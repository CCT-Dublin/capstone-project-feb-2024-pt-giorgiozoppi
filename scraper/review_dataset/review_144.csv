144,An amazing stay in Mayfair,"I had an amazing stay at The Flemings Mayfair. From the moment I checked in I felt so welcome. I actually felt like I was at home.

My room was absolutely gorgeous and very comfortable . The decor in the room was amazing. I enjoyed the large shower, Asprey  toiletries, and the heated towel bar. 

I was there on a business trip and found the room to be a very accommodating workspace.  

I enjoyed a tasty lunch at The Drawing Room.  It consist of a delicious burger and a glass of Sauvignon Blanc. I love the beautiful floral decor of the restaurant.  My server was absolutely delightful..

Andrew, the Concierge was wonderful .  He assisted me with all of my questions regarding the hotel snd the area. 

I would to think the following staff are going above and beyond to make my stay perfect .

144,Quick London stayover.,What a charming hotel! Top notch service and spacious rooms. The bedding was high quality and very comfortable. Heated bathroom flooring & towel warmers which was much appreciated for the damp weather. Our stay included breakfast which was very good. I can't say enough good about our stay. I loved the location and would definitely stay at this wonderful hotel again.,5,2024,10,15
144,Delightful English Boutique Hotel,"Outstanding boutique hotel steps from Green Park, Buckingham Palace & Bond Street.  Staff extremely helpful.  Room so comfortable with Nespresso maker & hot water electric pot for tea.  Lovely afternoon tea on site. Charming decor.  I was a solo female traveler; very safe area and quiet hotel where i felt comfortable dining solo in the bar (fantastic mussels and fries) & was able to sightsee easily.",5,2024,10,12
144,The perfect hotel in London,"One of the most value to money five stars hotels e have stayed at.

 Small, but not too small hotel (do not like when it gets too personal). Perfect level of service. Nice aircon. Clean. Friendly staff. Nice interior.

Only negative comment is no hot food in the buffet, but that is the only thing, and I only mention it to have something to say that is not positive. 

All in all the perfect hotel in London and verry nice set-up for us travelling with three kids",5,2024,10,10
144,Almost perfect,"My daughter and I stayed here for 2 nights to go to see Taylor Swift last month. 

Lovely hotel, very well and luxuriously modernised but still in keeping with the style of the building. We were well looked after, the staff are good, the hotel clean and well-maintained. Location is spot on, 2 mins walk from Green Park tube station..

Our room (a deluxe double) was small, but not necessarily out of the ordinary for a London hotel. Well appointed, great bathroom. Aircon worked well (personal bugbear in city hotels). No view which is always a disappointments, but again ‘London’. The hotel is quiet, no sign of street noise or noise from within the hotel - again, a bugbear for smaller London hotels. 

Breakfast is good rather than amazing; continental only (cooked is a cost option) but that suited us on the morning of the concert as we needed to eat quick to get to Wembley to commence queuing for 10 hours(!). We did avail ourselves of a reasonably pricey cooked breakfast the 2nd morning which was nice, but I’d stick to the continental in future.

The bar area is very nice, served a great Negroni on our first night. Our second night was where our only, minor, adverse experience occurred. We arrived back from the concert at 11.15pm, with a hungry daughter and my need for a drink (see above reference to a 10 hour queuing time), alas, room service provision is just a selection of pre-made sandwiches and they had already run out, so no food. And the bar was already closed at 11.15pm, and no room service for room drinks - not ideal for a 5* London Hotel. 

But, all in all, its a very nice hotel, definitely good value, very well located, extremely clean and well maintained.",4,2024,10,07
144,Exceptional!,"My husband and I decided to celebrate our wedding anniversary in London. We live in Houston so escaping the late September heat was a must.

After seeing an article in Travel and Leisure where Flemings - Mayfair was highly recommended by some of its readers, we decided this would be a great choice. We were rewarded with a lovely stay in Mayfair. The Green Park tube stop was just across the street and we were able to walk across Green Park for one of the last “summer” tours of Buckingham Palace.

The staff at this lovely hotel were superb. We have traveled extensively throughout the US, Canada, the Caribbean and the Hawaiian islands but nowhere was the service at this level. Jasmine in the breakfast area was particularly wonderful. And the buffet breakfast each morning was delicious.

Omer, the newly crowned Michelin restaurant at the hotel, occupies the same space in the evenings and was a real treat. (See my separate review of it)

The stay can be a bit pricey but compared to other hotels in Mayfair, an absolute bargain. We highly recommend this delightful hotel.",5,2024,10,04
144,Great Stay,"From the pickup from the airport, throughout my stay, Fleming Hotel was great in every way. My room was upgraded, thanks to my travel advisor. It's in a fantastic location, easy to get around and the service was top notch! I will continue to come back to this hotel for my London visits.",5,2024,10,02
144,Visited to go to Ormer but early,"Visited to go to Ormer but very early so sat in the lounge as the weather was bad!
Coffee was delicious and staff were helpful and attentive. Toilets clean and well presented.
Seats pretty comfortable.
The hotel is well appointed with plenty of staff ready and willing to assist you.",5,2024,10,01
144,TOP NOTCH!!,"I had an exceptional experience with the reception staff at The Flemings. From the moment I walked in, I was greeted with warm smiles and a welcoming atmosphere. They were incredibly professional, friendly, and went above and beyond to ensure my stay was perfect. Whether it was a quick check-in, answering questions about local attractions, or accommodating my requests, they handled everything with ease and efficiency. It truly felt like they cared about making my stay as comfortable and enjoyable as possible. Thank you for such outstanding service! I'll definitely be returning.",5,2024,10,01
144,Impeccable service,"My recent stay at Flemings Mayfair was truly exceptional. The staff were attentive and welcoming, ensuring every aspect of my visit was comfortable. The room was beautifully furnished, with luxurious bedding and amenities, and the requests I made were promptly fulfilled.

The breakfast options were delicious, and the service throughout the hotel was outstanding. The location is ideal, offering both convenience and a quiet, refined atmosphere.

I highly recommend Flemings Mayfair for anyone seeking a luxurious and memorable stay in London.",5,2024,10,01
144,First class accommodation,"The Fleming is an outstanding hotel. The location is perfect, the service outstanding and the facility is well maintained.
The continental breakfast offered as part your reservation is off the chart in terms of quality and presentation.",5,2024,09,30
144,Great staff  and location,"We had a great stay.  The staff is amazing. The location is great walkable to most everything you want to visit and a short to blocks to the subway.
 Do not get Room  330 because it is next to the service closet and the staff starts very early moving vacuums etc. creating noise.
One other tip confirm and pay the booking in USD in advance. We had booked through an agent and when we settled the bill the hotel changed the amount due based on the current Pound rate.  After discussion they did adjust our bill but if we had booked and payed in advance there  no problem",4,2024,09,30
144,Disappointing,"If you are spending most of the time out of the room then this hotel might be suitable. Rooms are small and dark. I was given a very small room with nowhere to sit but the bed and the suitcase took up part of the floor. The third room I saw was just ok, on ground level so very dark. Location is convenient to many attractions and restaurants but not really worth the money.",2,2024,09,28
144,London Vacation,The Fleming’s Mayfair Hotel was amazing. The staff especially the concierge were very helpful to us and the hotel was perfectly located for walking in the city.,5,2024,09,28
144,Beautiful Hotel,"One night stay at this beautiful hotel! The staff were very welcoming. They had arranged a wonderful birthday set up of champagne, biscuits and balloons in the room as a surprise for my husbands birthday which was a lovely touch. ",5,2024,09,24
144,Two stars for the location!,"A few things to consider when booking a stay at Flemings; 
1. Disappointed in the quality of the mattress. It had very large buttons, that were hard and uncomfortable to lay on. We put the fur throw on the mattress to add cushion. 
2. We also found some odd blue goop in the bathroom on the wall, and a bottle top for wine under our chair. The windows were also open when we arrived, it had been raining making it rather humid in the room.
3. There was also no conditioner in the shower.  I find it extremely odd conditioner is not provided in this “luxury” hotel. I have stayed in many Hyatts, Hiltons, other hotels and it is always shampoo, conditioner and body wash. 

For the price, which came to over $500, I expected more. The only two positives were the location to Green Park underground station and they held our bags for a few hours letting us explore more of London.  ",2,2024,09,24
144,Hidden Gem,"Fantastic hotel, great location and the staff were incredible. Would highly recommend this extremely clean and well located hotel ",5,2024,09,23

144,Best Place to Stay in London,"If there’s one place in London I’m willing to come over & over again to- this is Flemings Hotel. From the warm-welcoming check-in to the most comfortable clean rooms with aesthetic atmosphere, every single detail matters for the most caring team during your stay. The cafe space downstairs is perfect for both a lovely afternoon tea moment & working time with coffee or bubbles :)  Big thanks to Aman who literally makes you feel at home away from home.",5,2024,09,19

144,Always Stellar,"No other hotel comes close to the gracious beauty and quiet elegance of Flemings, situated in the heart of Mayfair with easy access to all of greater London.  Gorgeous rooms, splendid breakfast, and a whole staff of smiling professionals willing to assist with any questions, no matter how ridiculous.  (Like, for instance, my question about how to swap an old twenty pound note from a prior trip.)",5,2024,09,17

They serve an excellent breakfast buffet.  Also, there is a nice bar downstairs. Our room was large and well appointed. Very clean. We found this hotel to be a great value. We would definitely stay here again.",5,2024,09,12
144,"Great Location, Friendly Staff","Very centrally located to the palaces.  Building was a combination of former private residences, so hallways twist and turn.  Rooms are small unless you take an upgrade.  But clean and quiet.",5,2024,09,12
144,Perfect in every way.,"We stayed for 4 nights before heading to Southampton on a cruise. The hotel was perfect. The location was perfect. The staff was perfect. We definitely will return there  the next time we visit London. If you stay there, walk down the street to Kiku Japanese restaurant.  The hotel recommended it and it was one of the best Japanese restaurants we ever ate in. 
Go and enjoy!!!",5,2024,09,10

Every aspect of our stay was first rate, from the friendliness of the staff to the accommodations, the extensive continental breakfast and afternoon tea. Kudos to all the staff members we encountered for providing excellent service every step of the way, from booking the trip, to arranging airport transfers.

The location of the hotel is excellent, making it easy to visit all the highlights of London.

I am eagerly looking forward to another visit.",5,2024,08,31
144,"Gorgeous boutique hotel in heart of Mayfair neighborhood, London",Gorgeous boutique hotel in the heart of the Mayfair neighborhood in London. The hotel is perfectly located in central London yet on a quite street. It is easily walkable and very close to the Green Park tube station and city buses which made it so easy to get around. The hotel staff were incredibly kind to my daughter and I. They made us feel very special and welcomed.,5,2024,08,30

144,Wonderful Small Hotel in Mayfair,"My wife and I spent three nights at this hotel in August 2024. From the time we walked through the door we were greeted warmly and provided prompt check-in. The front desk staff was friendly and professional. We had a room on the third floor. The room was very clean, queen bed, a nice sized bathroom- double sinks, good sized shower and a special treat - heated tile floor!!  A small downside - room lacked a chair and had limited storage for luggage. A nice feature was turn down service at night. We enjoyed a very nice breakfast buffet each morning. The hotel is well located less than 10 minutes to Buckingham Palace and three blocks to Green Park Underground and buses!  
We thoroughly enjoyed our stay as well as the great hotel staff!",5,2024,08,28

144,London Love,Stayed here for 6 nights with my mother and 4 year old daughter. Loved it. Ambiance and decor better than the photos. Linens and bed super comfortable. Staff was so friendly and accommodating. The concierge helped us book a last minute dinner reservation for 5 and they tried to fix a broken toy for my daughter. Highly recommend!!,5,2024,08,26

144,Great accessible bathroom for people in wheelchairs,Extremely large accessible bathroom in room 77. One of the best shower chairs provided. The bedroom itself is quite small so you wouldn't really be able to push a hoist around. Location wise it is very good but of course can you pay the premium. For a five star hotel I expected a bit more service and welcoming feel. ,3,2024,08,25
144,Beautiful Hotel & Amazing Staff,I would definitely recommend staying at Flemings Mayfair. Not only is it the most beautifully decorated hotel but the location is perfect to.

144,A unique boutique hotel,"My business stay at Flemings Mayfair was enjoyable. The service was attentive, always friendly and engaging, with every team member I encountered being genuinely helpful. The rooms, though on the smaller side, are comfortable and well-equipped, perfectly complementing the charm of this beautifully preserved historical hotel. Breakfast was very nice, and the location is excellent for getting around. Highly recommend, especially for those who appreciate staying in a place with rich history and character. I surely will return on my next trip to London.",5,2024,08,19
144,A magical time.,"We enjoyed our stay very much.
Location was perfect, staff were friendly and helpful.
The quality of the food was excellent.",5,2024,08,15
144,Excellent 4 Night Stay,"First, the location of Flemings Mayfair is ideal for travelers.  You will be 2 blocks away from Green Park underground station with access to several lines.  You will also be located across the street from Green Park itself, a short walk to Buckingham Palace, as well as the entrance to Hyde Park.  Furthermore, Fortnum and Mason is less than a 10 minute walk away.  

The Flemings Mayfair staff are incredible.  They all made eye contact with us, provided warm greetings, and were very willing to answer our questions about the hotel and London.  I have to say that this was the best hotel staff that I have ever stayed with.  

The hotel itself is beautiful including our room.  The hotel is tastefully decorated.  Our room was very comfortable.  Large bed, well lit, and spotless.  

Lastly, we booked a breakfast package at Ormer, a one Michelin starred restaurant located within the hotel, and the continental breakfast was excellent quality. It even included a make your own Bloody Mary station!  We recommend this to all guests.",5,2024,08,13
144,The perfect London Getaway,"If you want a central location, great personal service from a modern but traditional luxury hotel , then Flemings mayfair is the perfect choice. 

In visiting 20 + hotels with work every year , travelling is tiresome and rarely am I surprised  and from the moment we arrived we were warmly greeted, quick check in  , very warm , homely  room.   A perfect week , perfect service and very enjoyable.

The taster menu in  the restaurant , WOW ! ",5,2024,08,12
144,Won’t return 🥴,"My friend and I spent 3 nights here last week.
Great location and good public transport links.
We found our rooms to be nice but small and dark. I would not consider them 5 star. Poor sleeps due to constant banging doors by other guests and housekeeping staff early morning. Soft closure doors would be so much quieter. No luggage racks in room for cases which I found quite poor for a hotel of this standard.
On checking out and paying my bar bill which was only £10, the final amount to pay was £40 ! My bill had several service charges  and a £3.00 charge for a packet of crisps which were placed next to the tea tray in the room which I assumed was complimentary as there wasn’t even a biscuit on tea tray. For a 5 star hotel I thought this was a bit off.
Going back to the service charges, I felt obliged to pay this without question even though I had been cash tipping throughout our stay.
It was a pleasant stay but unfortunately I won’t return to this hotel 🥴",4,2024,08,12
144,London vacation,"We had an amazing stay at the hotel. Everyone was extremely helpful and kind, location is perfect for all the famous sightseeings. We tried the hotel bar and the atmosphere and cocktails were really good. Breakfast was fresh and had enought options.",5,2024,08,11
144,"A Thousand Thanks to the Flemings Hotel Team, Especially Mr. Aman!","I want to say a huge thank you to the team at Flemings Hotel, and especially to Mr. Aman, who made our stay in London the best we’ve ever had. We stayed in a one-bedroom suite, and from the moment we arrived until the day we left, the experience was just superb. If I could give more than five stars, I definitely would!

The breakfast was excellent—honestly, the best salmon I’ve ever had, and the variety of breads and cakes, all handmade, was just amazing. The design of the hotel matches my style perfectly—vintage but luxurious—and it really made me feel at home.

I come to London for business every few months, and even though I’ve tried other hotels, I always end up coming back here. I feel comfortable, like I’m at home, and everything is taken care of for me. There’s absolutely no stress. I love the turndown service before bed; they come to prepare the room, and it makes me feel like a queen.

Thank you so much for everything, and I wish you all the best! See you next time.",5,2024,08,10

144,A wonderful stay... as always perfect!,"As always, Lorena and her team are top class and looked after us so well.
From the moment we arrive, we feel looked after and every detail is taken care of for us. Cannot speak highly enough of the whole team at Flemings. Cannot wait for our next stay... breakfast is always wonderful too!",5,2024,08,05
144,Lovely little hotel in Mayfair,"We spent two nights here. It is in a great location. We were welcomed by the staff on our arrival. It was early in the day, we checked in and dropped our bags. We asked the receptionist if she would text us when our room was ready and although she said she would she didn't. When we arrived back later in the day the room was ready. 
The room was newly renovated and spotlessly clean. Breakfast was good but the breakfast included in the bed and breakfast rate we had is only continental and we had to pay for any hot food. I had messaged the hotel in advance to let them know we were vegan but they didn't acknowledge my message and there was very little that was suitable for us on the buffet. To make it worse the staff didn't know what cereals were suitable for vegans. All that is really needed to improve here is more knowledge (which is really important for allergies) and a bowl of smashed avocado on the buffet. The staff were very keen to help and ensure that we were happy with our breakfast.
When we returned to the hotel after lunch on our second day our room hadn't been made up, after phoning reception to ask why we were told someone would be along immediately to do it. No one came. We called back twenty minutes later and they told us that in order to have the room made up in the morning you need to request it in advance. They said someone would do it by three pm so we popped out for a bite to eat and when we came back it had been done (to a very high standard).
When we came back from a show in the evening the bar was closed, this was the evening it stayed open the latest. However we popped over the road to the Mayfair Townhouse where the bar was still open.
We really liked this hotel and the welcoming staff, we had a few small issues but would definitely return.
We very much liked this h",4,2024,08,04

The location was absolutely perfect as well. Very central and walking distance to both luxuries and necessities even to a tourist with no sense of direction like me. On our last trip to London before this, we stayed at a different 5-star hotel but didn’t have this memorable experience. I will not forget the warm, friendly hospitality and personalised services provided. Andrew from the concierge and Lorena the Operations Manager were simply the Best!",5,2024,07,23

144,Best of London,"I came to Flemings Mayfair after another hotel made a mistake with my reservation and was completely unhelpful and unapologetic. As soon as I arrived at Flemings Mayfair, I was immediately struck by how seriously they took the art of hospitality--and was reminded what a difference it makes as a traveler. I am so grateful for their kindness to me. After an overnight flight, the offer of complimentary tea/coffee and pastries in their lovely restaurant while I waited for my room to be ready was a nice touch. I loved my cozy, individual room. The hotel is updated and beautifully decorated, but there's no mistaking you're in a historic, London neighborhood---it strikes a perfect balance of modern and traditional London. I will absolutely recommend the Flemings Mayfair and will stay here during future visits to London! Thank you! ",5,2024,07,17

144,Good location. Price is in good relation to the hotel. Liquid soap is provided instead of the traditional soap bar.,"Nice hotel in a good location in Mayfair. The bathroom provides liquid soap, not the traditional bar. This is something that a 5 star hotel should not have. Or at least provide both options (liquida & bar). The hotel is very well located near Piccadilly and Bond street, you can go walking to all stores. The breakfast is awesome, very well provided. We did not have lunch or dinner at the Hotel.",4,2024,06,18

144,Relaxing stay at Flemmings,Really well located hotel near Green Park.  Staff were very friendly and helpful. Decent gym for hotel and well furnished bedroom/bathroom.

144,Excellent hotel in Central London great location,Excellent clean and welcome hotel with exceptional breakfast and staff rooms quiet and very comfortable ,5,2024,05,21
144,Perfect apart from a couple of niggles,"This lovely boutique hotel had been recommended to us and it's almost perfect, bar a couple of things it should be easy to fix. In a perfect location for walking around central London the staff are wonderful and service levels generally very high. Rooms are generally small but perfect for a short stay and fitted to a very high standard. Air conditioning can be needed even in winter and it's centrally set so can take 20 minutes to kick in. Niggles? The bar closes too early - we ended up opposite at the Mayfair Town House one evening as a result - and beware the 'service charge' they add to the room rate and which is not well advertised nor explained. It means you don't need to tip as the charge gets shared around all FOH staff, but it was a surprise to get it added as no-one told us in advance, and unnecessarily difficult to have it removed (we had already tipped the staff ourselves so didn't want to be double dipped). But a lovely stay overall and recommended.",4,2024,05,19
144,Hotel in the heart of Mayfair,Very well located hotel . Rooms very clean. We had a nice and cosy stay apart of the beginning of our stay due to heavy noise in the streets . But we were happy the manager arranged at his best our accommodation and upgradeed us,4,2024,05,17

144,"Not bad, but don't forget to get get your deposit back!","Overall, it wasn't a bad stay. Overpriced, yes, but that's typical in London. The main issue was that they withheld an amount on our credit card for incidentals, which should have been reversed upon checkout but wasn't. It took nearly two weeks of phone calls and emails to get it back. Had we not followed up, I wonder if we would ever have got that money back.",3,2024,05,08
144,Great hospitality and exceptional service,"Our 9-day stay at this hotel was absolutely delightful. From the moment we arrived, Lorena and the entire staff, including Alex, Aman, Adnan, Monica, Daniela, C Ryan, Karolis, George, Stefan, Jazmine, Anca, and Christina, provided exceptional hospitality, making us feel right at home. The 2-bedroom room was beautifully designed with a lovely space and our own kitchen, providing us with the comfort we needed. The location was perfect, with numerous restaurants nearby. Even though we've been home for only 2 days, we're already missing the hotel. Can't wait to return soon! Thank you all for such a wonderful experience!",5,2024,05,05
144,Outstanding Boutique Hotel,"The Fleming Mayfair is a lovely smaller hotel with excellent service in a great location. The rooms are beautiful, well appointed, and immaculate. Our bath was large, nicely tiled, with marble sinks, and furnished with plush towels. The staff are very attentive and get to know their guests without being intrusive. From the front door staff to the managers, everyone is friendly and helpful. The operations manager, Lorena, made us feel like VIPs, making sure our stay was comfortable. The daily breakfast is excellent and the staff there are also focused on guest satisfaction. Clara, our server, knew our routine and kept our coffee cups full. Finally, for a small hotel, the gym is really nice. It has all the necessary equipment and is clean and well maintained.  The hotel is next to the Green Park tube station and walking distance from many London sites. If you’re looking for a great hotel in London, Flemings Mayfair should be at the top of your list!",5,2024,05,05
144,Great stay!,Lovely stay - decided to stay for a couple of nights for a birthday treat with dinner in the Ormer restaurant. Dinner was delicious. Staff were very helpful and friendly. Would definitely recommend.,5,2024,05,05
144,Truly cannot be beat,"I cannot say enough about Flemings Mayfair! We were a group of three friends who stayed nine nights at the end of last month and had a splendid time at this, our London base. Flemings simply cannot be beat for its hotel features, style and design, dining options, location, and last but most certainly not least and probably what sets them apart, service. 

Located in a most convenient location in London - we walked easily as far as Marylebone in one direction and Duke of York Square in the other, Flemings is the ideal hotel if your agenda includes shopping, theatre, museums, monuments, great restaurants, and strolls through London's beautiful parks to get to all of those or to simply enjoy the vast green spaces of the city. We only found ourselves taking Uber or a taxi if it was raining or to anything that was more than a 25 minute walk.

The hotel is beautiful and tastefully decorated, with cozy pocket spaces to enjoy having afternoon tea, a drink, or a quick snack. The decor is sophisticated and welcoming, with beautiful scenic wallpapers and design details that make it worthy of its neighborhood. We booked a two-bedrooms suite, which we were told was recently renovated. It was extremely well appointed, with very comfortable beds and linens, heavy curtains that ensured total darkness in the rooms ( a must for me!), heated bathroom floors, well functioning showers and baths, and Asprey toiletry amenities in the bathrooms. There were two full bathrooms and a half bath, which worked well as each of us were able to have our own toilet facilities. There is an ample sized living room, furnished with comfortable chairs and a sofa upholstered in luxurious fabrics, and a table that can accommodate four for meals. There is a fully stocked bar on an honesty system (great touch!), as well as a fully equipped kitchen with all the appliances you need.

Our rate included breakfast, which was served in the one Michelin star Ormer Mayfair restaurant. We were unfortunately unable to have lunch or dinner there, but the breakfast was great and had sufficient buffet offerings. Also, one of the best fresh orange juices I've had in a hotel, if such a thing were to be rated! You can also opt to have breakfast in your room, which we did twice. It arrives in a full silver service and laid out properly by the efficient hotel staff.

The operations manager, Ms. Lorena Somera, deserves a very special mention for the attentive and stellar service she gave us from the time of booking up to check-out. She left no stone unturned in making sure all our needs were addressed. She is competent, efficient, caring, charming, and really goes out of her way to talk to guests and inquire about how the hotel staff can help make their stay in London the best that can be. I noticed that she was also always talking to the staff, whether it be to compliment them, encourage them, or give suggestions. It seemed like a morale booster to many of them. We also met the general manager, Mr. Henrik Muehle, who was very friendly and welcoming and who makes guests feel that. they are visitors in a home.

From the front office to the housekeeping staff, we cannot say enough. Before we arrived, we has asked the concierge, Ryan and Karolis, to make some restaurant reservations for us which they did efficiently. Check-in was smooth and easy with Alex, Adnan, Monica and Daniela welcoming us. We were brought to our suite and well oriented by Aman, who taught us how to use everything in the room. In the breakfast room, we were attended to very well by Anca, Jazmine, and Christina, who chatted just enough with us to start our mornings right. Finally, you cannot imagine how heavy three ladies from the Philippines can travel, but the porters, Alex, George, and Stefan, took care of everything for us, from unloading our luggage when we arrived, taking up our shopping every day, and loading our luggage when we departed, which by the time had almost doubled in number. If you find another review that mentions all the same people, it's because we intentionally went out of our way to get everyone's name precisely so that we can thank and commend them.

We had a wonderful stay at Flemings Mayfair and cannot imagine staying anywhere else the next time we are in London.",5,2024,05,05
144,"Sophisticated, stylish and great service!","What a beautiful hotel in a fabulous location. The staff are superb, the bar and choice of quality drinks is fantastic.

144,Fantastic Hotel in Mayfair,"Flemings is a lovely boutique hotel in central Mayfair, I've stayed at Flemings on quite a few occasions over the last 5 years but this was the first time I stayed in The Town House.

The Town House is next door to the hotel, it's accessed from it's own entrance. The rooms are a very large with incredible spacious for hotels in London in the price bracket. The bed are very comfortable, the room really well decorated.

I would recommend booking a room in The Town House if you're staying at Flemings.",5,2024,04,29

The room was well stocked, shower pressure excellent, bed exceedingly comfortable. Just a block over are some great pubs, dining, and shopping spots. Green, St. James, and Hyde park are nearby and we loved exploring the green spaces. Overall just an incredible hotel location. We absolutely loved our time at Flemings and hope to return one day!",5,2024,04,28
144,Most sophisticated decor and warmest hospitality,We had an amazing stay at Flemings Mayfair. The interiors are modern and the interior design is very sophisticated. Breakfast is great too.

I would love to come back to this hotel in my next visit to London for sure.,5,2024,04,24
144,Wonderful Experience,"I absolutely love this boutique hotel!  I first stayed at Flemings Mayfair last August and have returned twice since.  The bar is fabulous, the restaurant is wonderful and the staff is amazing. The best part of the hotel is Lorena, the operations manager.   She goes out of her way to ensure the guests feel special.  I have stayed in a number of luxury hotels over the last year and can honestly say that not one compares to the warmth of Flemings Mayfair.",5,2024,04,24
144,"Couple of Initial Issues, but Overall Very Good Stay","Despite being loyal Bonvoy members, Hyatt and the Small Hotels of the World brand, in particular, have recently won us over. We decided to book two rooms at the Flemings Mayfair solely based on the reviews. I’ve travelled to London for work at least 5-10 times a year for the past 15 years and have stayed at numerous luxury hotels in the city, but not the Flemings. Needless to say, based on the review we were excited for our stay. 

We checked in fairly late (a little after 10pm) on a Friday evening in a pleasant and straightforward process. Once we’d provided our passports, the porter began to move our luggage back towards the door and mention that we were not in the main building, but a few doors down in the townhouse. We immediately noted that we had specifically mentioned to Hyatt that we had requested the main building because we did not want to have to walk outside to use the gym, restaurants, bars, etc in the hotel. Unfortunately, the hotel was at full capacity and that building was the only one with two rooms together. The two rooms were on the top floor of the annex building where the elevator didn’t quite go up to the floor so you had to either go up some stairs or down some stairs because of the design. Our room was lovely – large king bed, wonderful couch, big large desk, nice bathroom. Our kids room had the smallest “double bed” I’ve ever seen – something slightly larger than a twin, but less than a full-sized bed. We noted our dissatisfaction, and management noted that they would try to move us the next day.

The following morning we got dressed and walked outside onto the street in the rain, back to the main building and proceeded downstairs to breakfast. It’s nice to have a continental breakfast included, but there was no change over 4 days, so it did get a little repetitive. I will note that the server got our drinks order wrong twice (it wasn’t complicated – 1 cappuccino, 1 coffee, 1 orange juice). On our first day, I also noted a huge bowl of raw sugar on the buffet table and asked one of the servers for some honey. He simply said that they don’t have any. I assumed that he didn’t understand my request so I asked again to clarify, and he almost shouted back at me “Sir, we don’t have any honey!” – my wife, kids and I just stared at the guy. I don’t want to presume what is driving someone’s behavior (maybe just a bad day), but the reality is that I’ve never been spoken to so rudely before in any establishment. We were supposed to have afternoon tea later that day at the Mayfair, but given our less than stellar experience that morning decided to cancel and go elsewhere. I assume someone could have gone to Fortnum & Mason to pick up their mini honeys if they wanted, but that huge bowl of sugar remained on the table for our four days at the hotel.

Honestly, at this point we did consider just checking out of the hotel and finding another place to stay, but the reservations manager, Aman, came personally down to breakfast to meet with us. He mentioned that they would move us to the main building. He insisted on showing us the rooms to make sure they were acceptable and also mentioned that they would move all of our belongings so we could continue our day. When we came back in the afternoon, I was pleasantly surprised to see everything had been moved correctly and the new rooms were lovely. Large beds, great bathrooms, and most importantly, easy access to everything in the hotel. Every time we saw Aman he had a smile on his face, a warm greeting, and an offer to help in anyway possible. He really went out of his way to make sure that we had a very comfortable stay while at the Flemings. 

Additionally, I will note that the bell staff are some of the nicest guys as well. I find that at a lot of London hotels, the doorman are more of security, but these guys are constantly opening doors, helping with bags, getting cabs, etc. They are just generally very nice. 

While we didn’t have lunch or dinner at the hotel, we did frequent Manetta’s Bar a couple of times. It’s a really lovely art-deco inspired space with classic cocktails. The selection is superb, the service is efficient and friendly, and the drinks are really well made. 

Lastly, I would be remiss in not mentioning the excellent service of the concierge Ryan. He provided recommendations, helpful itineraries and when we needed to get some medical help, called nearly 10 private clinics to help find a specialist. I think he really provided exceptional service and genuine cared to do an excellent job. 

Despite some of our initial hiccups, I would return to the Flemings Mayfair. The location is excellent, the service was very good, and the rooms are very comfortable. Additionally, I think the concierge and reservations staff are some of the best, most decent and helpful people I’ve come across.",4,2024,04,23

144,WHAT A WONDERFUL STAY!,"We had such an amazing 2 night stay. From the beginning, Alex the bellhop was kind, attentive and gave us great historical facts of the hotel to start off our stay. We arrived in London in the morning local time- but it really was overnight for us where we flew from... so it was really nice to be able to check in right away, shower, and just decompress to start our day. The rooms were small (as to be expected in Europe), but the space was used really well - especially the bathroom! To our delight, the bathroom even had heated floors and towel racks. We got complimentary water with our room which was always a plus...and it came with all you need, even a British charging adapter (which we forgot because we only brought the Europe one). Truly have no complaints about our stay - only regret is wish we had a chance to experience the high tea or the Michelin restaurant in the hotel!",5,2024,04,20

Fleming's may not have the flash of a, say, Claridge's or Connaught or the rarefied, too-too elan of The Ritz, but it has the service. In spades. Wow. The service. And the decor is absolutely lovely with genius touches throughout such as cut flowers, bunches of orchids. And the location on quiet Half Moon Stret is divine. The Manetta Bar is a charming oasis of sophistication tucked away in the basement. Lorena Somera, the Operations Manager, is an absolute dynamo and the CONSUMMATE host. So on top of her game. Clara in the restaurant is a delight at breakfast--happy, charming, excited. Alex, one of the doormen, is just great. WE LOVE this hotel.",5,2024,04,08

144,Mayfair’s finest hotel,"Wow what a place!
We had a fantastic stay at the Fleming’s hotel, we can’t fault it. From the warm welcome on arrival, the attentive staff, to the amazing facilities, every aspect was perfect.

We will be sure to return, and will bring the children next time too.",5,2024,03,27
144,Mayfair Memories,"Flemings hotel - flawless service from the minute you arrive to the minute you leave.
The staff work as a team and are exemplary.  Its a lovely reminder of what good service should be, but all too often is lost in this fast paced world we now live in.  Well Done Flemings - You are a trailblazer that others need to follow!",5,2024,03,26
144,LOVE everything about this hotel!!,"This was our first stay in London and friends recommended the Mayfair area to stay in. We researched and took a chance on this hotel, and boy did we hit the jackpot!  Starting with the staff- every single person from the front desk, concierge and bellmen were so kind, friendly and helpful with all our needs. The rooms were well appointed and very clean. Water pressure in the shower was nice and strong- which is always great at the end of a long day walking around the city. The location was convenient to all the sites and shops that we were there to visit- totally walkable from the hotel. It was a little pricey- but well worth it.  Would definitely stay there again!

144,My birthday stay at the Flemings,"My partner and I stayed in the Flemings hotel for 3 nights. The hotel team is super friendly, professional and helpful. I would like to say special thank you to a young gentlemen who works as a porter, Mr. De (I am not sure about the spelling of his name) who made went extra mile to make my birthday even more special. Location is very central, super great. Next time we stay at the hotel we would actually book higher category room in order to have more space.",5,2024,03,23
144,"The best experience I ever had, posh and cozy! Excellent customer service.","One of the best hotels I ever stayed in London. Posh, cozy ad extraordinary customer services. It was my birthday and I received a champagne and balloons in my room. That was unexpectedly beautiful. For the food lover, they have the best dishes and so delicious. The breakfast is amazing!! And the cocktail bar was a perfect way to end my evenings. I will most certainly come back soon. Thank you once again! Manuela",5,2024,03,18
144,Best stay ever,"A memorable stay is defined by exceptional service, luxurious accommodations, and unforgettable experiences. From the moment you arrive, every detail is tailored to exceed your expectations, ensuring a stay that's nothing short of extraordinary.",5,2024,03,18
144,Excellent location.  Couple of issues.,"Hotel is located perfectly for visiting London.  
There were a couple of issues, and although these were mostly sorted it spoilt the whole experience.
One was the the noisy first room we were shown the second was not being informed of the bar closing time in the evening.",3,2024,03,18
144,They won me over,"I am glad I shelved my scathing review I had ready to go last weekend. My story started with the hotel being the most exasperated I have ever been with a hotel- and I think conversely they were exasperated with me. The basic gist was I booked through Hyatt and Hyatt describes the room as following: ""comes with a double bed that can be split into two single beds."" Well, I was traveling with my daughter and so needed separate beds and thought that would work great. However, as you can see in the attached picture, the bed does not actually split. The bed in the attached picture is as far as they separate, which is to say not even a little. As I will explain further, it is the fault of the headboard- it goes out the side so they can't split. 

Let me first say is that I think it's possible/likely not Flemings fault- I think somewhere the description got lost in translation when they were setting it up for Hyatt and I am sympathetic to that. I am sure this situation doesn't  come up very often and so I am sympathetic to that. But it came up here. As I was explained to multiple times, it is really not possible to split the bed. I was in fact explained this more times than I would have liked as I understood and accepted it the first time- my issue was not that I thought they should split the bed but that it was different from what was described by Hyatt. 

So we get in late Friday night and there's only the night manager there. I wanted to problem solve and figure out what to do. He was not sympathetic and it is the most exasperated I have ever been with hotel staff. I think I almost never get exasperated with hotel staff- I am almost uniformly sympathetic to the fact that they are in tough spots and I realized  this was an unusual and challenging situation. I'm trying to think of how many different hotels I've been to at this point in my life- 50-60 maybe? Possibly more. I don't think I've ever really been upset at a hotel or hotel staff. I was upset here. The night manager first tried to say there was a gap and that the beds were separate. Then he came up to the room and looked at it and realized it would be a ridiculous argument to make as there is no gap and it is really just one bed. So once that was done he just kind of shrugged his shoulders, gave a rote apology, and was like there's nothing we can do. If I had accepted that, I would have written the scathing, exasperated, very unhappy version of the review. 

However, when I called Hyatt, things started to knock lose some- and at least get to a different place. One problem for the hotel is that there seems to be a lot of layers of administration. By the end of the very long conversation with Hyatt (who was very helpful and called the hotel on my behalf) late that Friday night (which was a long one- I almost closed down their help center at 2am), I had assumed we would just be leaving the next day and going to a different Hyatt, calling this a mistake and a life lesson learned. It sounded like from Hyatt's perspective, there just needed to be a pro forma sign off by the person who was in the next morning and then we could all call it a day. I slept on the floor and got ready to move the next day. 

When I met with the manager the next morning, she said that they couldn't release me from my reservation/refund the last two nights stay because I had already checked in- that would need a different manager approval on Monday when we were set to check out and it was far from assured. So back to square 1 but at this point I had now slept on the floor for one night. She however was not as rigid and worked to find a solution. A rollaway bed had always been part of the story/solution but our first room apparently wasn't big enough for it. At one point it sounded like there would be a 150 pound charge but that it was possible  to make the move- but frankly I didn't want to pay that much extra money to sleep on a rollaway bed. So she put us in another, bigger room (which was in fact an upgrade from a twin to a king bed and a small sitting area) and offered to help move us and said that she would move a rollaway bed in there- and did not charge us any extra. At this point, I was ready to not have to think about moving or this entire situation any more and was ready to begin to enjoy London (which, by the way, I did, immensely- and Flemings was part of that story). 

So I thought that was resolved, I actually am not picky and can sleep on a rollaway bed. It's different than the luxury experience I envisioned when I booked the place but c'est la vie- and I was doing it on points so could live with it. If it was like $1900 out of pocket for three nights, one on the floor and two on the rollaway bed (which was what I estimated it would have been to upgraded to the room with the rollaway bed), I again think I would have been upset. But given the circumstances, I could live with it. So that being done, we went out and spent a long day enjoying London and its sights. Flemings really is in a wonderful area and you can walk to to so many great areas if you want or you can catch the tube right across the street. We walked to Carnaby St. for shopping to start and my daughter loved it. We then walked all around the West Side for museums and more shopping and spent a long day out. 

I love location in hotels and Flemings has it in spades. It's just a wonderful area for sure. It would be tough to find another hotel in London that has a better location than Flemings. Cute neighborhood, maybe a 5-10 minute walk to Buckingham and the changing of the guard and just a lot of character and great locations all around. It's a very wealthy, very scenic area. 

When I do short trips to Europe, I stay on NY time (sleep in late and come back late) so that there's no issue in jet lag and my kids can go back to school really easily when we return. So we get back very late Saturday night (we went to a show in the West End- There's Something about Jamie; pretty good- not amazing) and get to the room and there's no rollaway. Just a king bed that doesn't separate. So back out to the (same) night manager. I think we were both pretty excited to get to interact again. I was like we need the rollaway bed and he started by like being this is it- you have the King bed (which again was not anywhere close to the solution to the issue), which was an upgrade but did not have the rollaway, which was the whole piece that had been negotiated earlier that morning.  The manager that morning had literally walked me to the room and showed me where the rollaway would be set up. After some uncomfortable hemming and hawing, he went and got one and set it up for me. So, that was done. So it was frustrating for everyone involved and I spent an inordinate amount of mental energy and frustration working on getting to a solution that I and they could live with. 

So that finally done, after that they won me over. The rate included breakfast, which meant you could get room service for free. It is hard to beat that and it gives you at least an extra hour to see the city when you don't have to to like go get breakfast but just have it show up at an appointed time. We got the continental breakfast and it was wonderful- healthy and delicious and varied and full of interesting and delicious things to eat, including cappucinos. I was so so happy with it and it made the entire time better to be able to fill up quickly and easily on delicious and healthy food to start our day. Just exquisite. 

And then again the location can't be beat- it's perfect. You can get to everything you want to either by walking or hopping easily on the tube. The immediate surrounding neighborhoods are charming, interesting, and full of amenities. Again, perfect location. 

It started out frustrating but it was really quite wonderful by the end.",4,2024,03,14
144,Exceeding Expectations in Mayfair!,"We just returned from a quick trip to London. Our first trip after many years. We knew nothing about this hotel other than the decor in the photos appealed to our sensibilities, the reviews were excellent and the location was spot on. Our experience at Flemings Mayfair exceeded all expectations. The location was perfect for us. We appreciated the quiet picturesque street within easy walking distance of go-to destinations on foot or via public transportation. The neighborhood is lovely. The hotel itself is warm and inviting with a modern classic feel that is both elevated and thoughtful. The hotel is not too big and has a gorgeous bar and public rooms. Our room wasn't ready when we arrived around 8am. Shortly after our relaxing breakfast in the hotel restaurant, we were delighted that our room was ready for us. It was so fabulous! I can't say enough about the Junior Suite. The bathroom alone is worth a stay with its double rain shower heads and heated floors. I'd book the Junior Suite again in a heartbeat. The decor is extremely well done. The fresh orchids and art and design books are a real treat. The staff throughout our stay were incredibly friendly, unpretentious and welcoming. They knew us by the end of our visit. A highlight of our experience was a late night request for restaurants that might deliver after midnight. The staff told us it was too late for delivery and we went to our room. Moments later a knock on the door and an offer to make us sandwiches. We were thrilled. That thoughtful gesture says it all. Also, the sandwiches were delicious! The service, decor, location, restaurant, bar and fabulous bartender, concierge and reception staff are truly outstanding at Flemings Mayfair. I hope to return as we have the best memories of London largely in part because we loved our stay so much.  ",5,2024,03,12
144,Perfect base for any trip! Wonderful welcoming hotel.,"Very friendly and helpful staff. A welcoming, warm, and modern hotel with charm. Set on a side street this means little to no traffic noise, making it a peaceful stay. It is located a comfortable distance from the nearest tube station and there are plenty of lovely places to eat. Buckingham palace is on the other side of Green Park and other tourist sites are relatively close also. I would definitely stay again and recommend this hotel.",5,2024,03,08
144,"Small but PERFECTLY formed, warm hospitality, and like a family","Im not saying Flemings is the most grand hotel I've ever stayed in, but it IS the one that's made me feel the most special, and that's what makes it stand out. The moment we checked in, the staff make you feel so cared for. Our room was cozy, very clean, and tastefully decorated. The hotel is made up of townhouses, and retains that homey feeling. 
The gym was small but very well-equipped. Had it to myself.
Definitely do dinner at Ormer in the basement. WOW - I was blown away. Deserves the recent Michelin star win. Every dish was perfection.
I won't forget this stay, thank you for your kindness, helpfulness, and genuine passion and hospitality. It feels like home. See you soon.",5,2024,03,07
144,"Style, grace and charm in Mayfair!","Highly recommended! The location is fabulous and the hotel itself glows with style and charm. Hard to find this kind of luxury at affordable prices in London these days. The Michelin-starred restaurant is outstanding, well worth a visit if you are planning at least one fabulous meal during your trip.

I think what really made our stay so delightful was the staff. We were greeted a couple of times by the general manager himself, who could not have been more gracious. Breakfast staff, including Anca, Erica and Clara, were just lovely and made us feel very special each morning. Bar staff, especially Lorenzo and Alessandro, oozed Italian charm!

It was Lorena, the Operations manager, who really made the stay for us. We had a number of unexpected emergencies, including getting sick and needing attention above and beyond the norm. She was there at every turn to work big and small miracles. She even moved us to a bigger room so we could be sick in comfort. What a star!

We will definitely be back.",5,2024,03,06

144,A gem in the heart of Mayfair.,"I had the pleasure of staying at the Hotel Flemming Mayfair for a week during my visit to London. I was impressed by the quality of service, the comfort of the rooms, and the convenience of the location. Here are some of the aspects that made my stay memorable.
Great location
The hotel is situated in the heart of Mayfair, one of the most elegant and prestigious areas of London. It is close to many attractions, such as Hyde Park, Buckingham Palace, Piccadilly Circus, and Oxford Street. You can easily walk to these places or take the nearby tube stations. The hotel is also surrounded by many restaurants, cafes, pubs, and shops, so you will never run out of options for dining and entertainment.
Friendly staff
One of the best things about the hotel is the friendliness and professionalism of all the staff members. From the receptionists to the housekeepers, from the concierge to the bellboys, everyone was courteous, helpful, and attentive. They always greeted me with a smile, answered my questions, and fulfilled my requests. They made me feel welcome and valued as a guest.
Lovely breakfast
Another highlight of the hotel for us was the daily included breakfast, which is served in a spacious and elegant dining room. The breakfast buffet offers a variety of dishes, such as eggs, bacon, pastries, fruits, cereals, and yogurt. You can also order hot drinks, juices, and toast from the friendly and efficient restaurant staff. The breakfast was delicious, filling, and satisfying, and it gave me the energy to start my day.
In conclusion, I highly recommend the Hotel Flemming Mayfair to anyone who is looking for a comfortable, convenient, and classy accommodation in London. It is a hotel that combines the charm of the past with the amenities of the present, and it will make your stay a pleasant and unforgettable experience.

144,Perfect little hotel…,Such a lovely little hotel with an excellent location. Our room was on the 2nd floor and was very quiet although I did hear some complaints from others about the street noise for the rooms on the front side of the hotel. The experience at the hotel bar and Omer were exemplary. Truly a gem. If I had one additional critique it is that some areas of the hotel had a sewage smell. We did not have this issue in our room and it is a major city so take from that what you will. Just wanted to give my review more credibility. ,5,2024,01,17

We were fortunate enough to have been given a room upgrade and were blown away with how much space we had, it felt like a home away from home. We will be back. Thank you to everyone at Flemings who made our stay so exceptional and memorable.",5,2023,12,23
144,Superb location and quality stay!,"Flemings Mayfair is a gem, tucked away on a quiet side street location beside Green Park. We found through its Small Luxury Hotels' listing. Staff are kind and professional. Clean and well appointed rooms.  Great value for the money. Nice restaurant on premises.",5,2023,12,23
144,Great location,"Flemings Mayfair is in the best location for a London visit. It’s close to Buckingham Palace, Regent and Bond Streets, and Hyde Park. The tube station is a short walk away and has transfers to almost all of the major sites. The rooms are Flemings Mayfair are spacious and the beds are very comfortable. Breakfast was great. Sound insulation isn’t quite high, but for a converted townhouse property it is to be expected. I do wish there was a turndown service at this property. Overall, it’s a great luxury option especially for its location and plush rooms.  ",4,2023,12,21
144,Wonderful Flemings Mayfair. ,"Thoroughly enjoyed two nights around Christmas 2023 at Flemings Mayfair. The hotel is intimate, the staff couldn’t be friendlier and kind. The room was excellent, quiet, and large. The restaurant and bar were lovely. Across the board, service levels were excellent. We will make Flemings our destination whenever we visit London. ",5,2023,12,20
144,John and Mina,"None required - the hotel was excellent in every respect. I have already said that we found everything about the hotel to be excellent including the room, the service including room service, the front desk and the porters looking after the luggage and hailing the taxi on our departure. We were also impressed by the bar and dining room and the excellent service and food and drink.",5,2023,12,19
144,Always excellent!,"Been a few times and every time it's fantastic.  EVERY member of the team is excellent, so friendly and helpful - nothing is too much trouble.

144,Molto bene,"After a small misunderstanding at the reception, we found great professionalism and dedication.

Thank you",4,2023,12,16
144,Concrete beds are not comfortable ,"Staff can makeup for where the hotel falls short. This hotel is very lucky to have the staff they have. I gave the hotel 3 stars because a 5 star hotel is 360 luxury. Here is what they do well:
*Staff-friendly, my check out was fabulous. As it should be for 5 stars. 
*Festive decorations for the Holiday
* Location is 5 stars
* Amenities in the room (coffee/tea pot/heating rack for towels/welcome cookies—-all expected at 5 star hotel.
*Not a quiet location as some have mentioned, my room was facing the street- it was loud at times. 

If a manager is reading this, you need to replace the bed on the 3rd floor, it is worth the investment.  Based on other reviews here- It looks like I am not the only one that thought the bed was like sleeping on concrete. I have never stayed at a hotel with such a terrible bed.  I was settled in. So I didn’t complain. The bed IMO is the single most important factor in how comfortable your stay is. 

Hotel is boutique/quaint and in one of the best locations. If you book here, be sure to ask about the beds! I am sure they would not be in business if every room had the same bed. 

",3,2023,12,12

Thank you from the bottom of my heart..",5,2023,12,02
144,I had high hopes….,"This is one of the oldest hotels in London and has a great reputation. I had high hopes but unfortunately I was a little disappointed. We arrived late evening and there was no-one on the door to help us with our bags. This may be because of the time but it’s obviously the first impression of the hotel. The check in was fine but we didn’t get offered turn down and didn’t find out you had to request this until I asked at check out. 
The staff were very friendly. The actual hotel, the reception, the bar, were all lovely, fab deco. The room however was a little disappointing. It was quite small, which is fine, but the bathroom needed an update. It was the type of bathroom found in a much cheaper hotel….old small shower head, dark wood which looked dated….not 5 star. 
I didn’t want to leave a negative review, apart from what I have mentioned, everything else was great, but unfortunately it didn’t live up to expectations. 
I would probably give it another try if the price was right (some other rooms may be different).",4,2023,12,02

144,"Charming, comfortable and a bit opulent","Lovely warm welcome, easy check in and room (dbl deluxe) was excellent, very small but perfectly appointed for 2 people, but had the smallest double bed I’ve ever seen, which caused a bit of difficulty in getting comfortable as it was very tight, however excellent quality bed and peaceful sleep and surroundings in the middle of Mayfair.
Location is absolutely perfect, about 50metres off Piccadilly but quiet. Green Pk across road and tube round corner. 
Breakfast was a little chaotic and we weren’t sure about how it worked, there was a long wait for cooked breakfast but the buffet option was one of the best I’ve ever seen, and delicious too.
Nanette’s Bar is sumptuous and cozy, a bit of a gem really and lovely service and atmosphere. Good cocktails and knowledgeable staff. Would definitely recommend and will return. ",5,2023,11,29

The only thing that was subpar was the room service food. It was meh.",5,2023,11,12

144,Excellent hotel in Mayfair,"Flemings is a lot bigger than it appears. It has a boutique feel and a great location near Green Park Station and walkable to anywhere in Mayfair. Staff are friendly and the room was large for London and very quiet. All facilities are there and the restaurant in the hotel is of a high standard but may be a bit expensive for everyday but a short walk outside reveals several other restaurants. 
Breakfast was very good with an excellent selection of very good quality cold buffet items. Cooked breakfast is also available.
Overall a great place to stay in a central location. We will be back!",5,2023,11,01

Having travelled the world, Toronto, Trinidad, New York, Latvia, Ukraine, Tenerife, Ibiza, Washington DC, New Jersey, Paris, Rome,Glasgow and Wales, I have never experienced such a high level of customer care as I have received from Marian! From Marian at Flemings in London UK, I had received outstanding customer service,which is extremely rare these days.

Marian ensured my seating preference and again was so friendly.

If you want exceptional customer service, great food / beverage with a 5 star experience…Flemings Hotel Mayfair London UK is the place for you!

144,Dream stay! Total luxury,"What a dream stay, the attention to detail and care, especially with my requests, made my time at Flemings feel like home.  Everyone was amazing even prior to arrival up to the last second. Loved Manetta bar and their signature cocktails! Will be my new secret spot once I move to London.

 The culinary heaven experience in Ormer was the perfect way to spend my last night there, it is a MUST. Lorenzo & Marco add to the amazing tasting menu experience with their impeccable service and treatment. Do not miss the cheese table, it is a journey on its own! 

 I can only send praises all around. Concierge team Andrew & Karolis attend to all your needs with the utmost care and attention. So lovely !

IF I have to point out just one area that could improve that was not up to the excellence that irradiates everywhere else ,would be the breakfast, not bad but not at all same level of standard as the rest. 

Perfect location, 7 minute walk to Buckingham Palace through gorgeous St James Park, restaurants and everything you need literally around the corner in Sheperd Market.

Highly recommend the transfer/car service booked by hotel as well, but also very easy to arrange a Black cab immediately with concierge. 

Stayed in a deluxe double room, perfect size and spotless. 

Extraordinary boutique hotel with the feeling of home & private luxury haven. ",5,2023,10,19

144,Must consider boutique hotel,"I cannot under emphasize this is one of those boutique hotels you should not miss. 
Fleming’s is centrally located in London, within the Mayfair area, and is a short walk to sights like Buckingham Palace. It is also conveniently close to the green park tube station which can get you to a lot of London in short trips.
They have a nice breakfast spread which was included in our Hyatt SLH rate and is great value for Hyatt points in London. 
There is a chic bar which we tried the first night. We didn’t try the Michelin star restaurant but it seemed to be popular, yet reservations were relatively easy to find.
Our room was cozy but modern enough, and the bathroom had a great tub and tiling work.
Please consider staying here if you want to explore Mayfair and this part of London, and leverage the access to the high life London has to offer.",5,2023,10,14

Lorena was always engaging and friendly and professional.  And of course we finished off our evenings enjoying conversations with the bartenders Fabio and Marco!   The Flemings Mayfair was such a great place to stay, with clean rooms, great beds and good, strong showers as well as a central location which made it easy to get around the city.

144,Hidden Gem in the heart of Mayair - absolutely flawless,"I almost hesitate to write a review about Fleming's Mayfair because I am afraid for word to get out!  This hotel is an absolute HIDDEN GEM in the heart of Mayfair, just steps from Green Park.  It is my new favorite hotel, and so much warmer than the larger 5-star hotels.  Overall, at Fleming's you feel like a guest in a private home, yes the attentive and unobtrusive service reminds you that you are indeed in a luxury hotel.  

The welcome staff greet you each time you pass through the lobby, always keen to offer assistance or simply wish you a lovely day.  In advance of our stay, Concierge Ryan Alden took time to send several thoughtful suggestions for a first (jet-lagged) dinner, many of which I was familiar with and knew to be solid recommendations and not tourist spots.  

The hotel is comprised of 17 conjoined townhouses, but it functions flawlessly and each room and space is infused with character and taste. 
 The lounge off the lobby is incredibly well-styled, and this continues throughout the common spaces, especially notable in the bar and breakfast room.  The staff was absolutely brilliant and warm, we enjoyed both starting our day and finishing our day in these spaces.  The rooms are very well-designed and thoughtfully laid out.  The furnishings are comfortable and the rooms are well-appointed.  I booked a Deluxe Single for myself and had a large deep soaking tub and ample room to sit and work as well.  This would have suited if my husband had tagged along.  My father's larger Executive King had more walking space but the one drawback was that there was not a ton of counter space in the bath, as there were two sinks.  This would have functioned better with a single sink and more counter space.

Of special note was their Operations Director Lorena Somera who we came upon in the lobby as we were leaving. Just a lovely energy and she knew I was travelling with my father to celebrate his 80th and whom I had booked through - very impressive attention to detail.  Although the hotel is over 129 rooms, it is operated at a level that it feels much smaller and more intimate. 

BRAVO to General Manager Henrik Muehle for running a top organization that has won over my London business.  

I took my father for his 80th birthday and we stayed a few days and booked through Polly Bade at Travel Untethered.",5,2023,10,02
144,Wonderful staff,"I can’t say enough good things about the staff at this hotel. It’s what you wish for at all hotels. 
From the front door to the front desk to the dining room to the bar. Everyone could’t have been more friendly and helpful. The breakfast buffet was very good and sufficient every am. Andrew at the Concierge desk was immensely helpful. The bar is charming and intimate. 
Our room was nicely appointed (even though we overlooked an ugly area behind the hotel).  I still
Have to give 5 stars just because the staff was so outstanding. 
Oh and the tea in the drawing room was very nicely done. 
Thanks Fleming’s Mayfair",5,2023,09,29
144,Great hospitality in the heart of mayfair,"The staff were amazing, everyone was extremely helpful and friendly. It was like home away from home! Very central and situated in a safe place. 10 minutes walk from the main shopping landmarks, including harrods. 2 minutes walk from the tube. Very busy area! ",4,2023,09,29
144,Would give it 10 stars if I could!,"My husband and I stayed at Flemings Mayfair for one night with our 5 month old. We just had one night in London on the way home from Scotland. 

From the moment we walked in we were treated with so much kindness, it really does make my heart happy thinking about it.

It was our first time traveling with our baby so we had an incredible amount of luggage and the team didn’t skip a beat helping us out with getting it out of the cab and into our room.

The room was gorgeous and we loved the location, decor, and temperature.

The team setup a travel cot/pack n play for the baby and even gave us baby bath soap! 

We were celebrating my husband 40th on the trip and the team threw in a beautiful message with a bottle of Prosecco and a gift :)

And lastly but not least I needed to freeze ice packs and breast milk and they froze my whole cooler for me. Which if you are breastfeeding/pumping you could understand how grateful we were since we had a 24 hour journey ahead of us. 

So thankful we decided to stay at this hotel and just in awe of the kindness and thoughtfulness of the team at Flemings! Definitely will be back there!",5,2023,09,27
144,Beautiful Hotel and Room but so loud it was nearly impossible to sleep,"Had room 81, which is a Junior Suite, multiple steps up from the standard room. The room was on the street level, with our windows right on the sidewalk, which meant either we had the blackout shades closed the entire time or had people on the street staring into our room as they walked by. The street noise made it basically impossible to sleep. If you plan on staying here, I highly recommend that you try to get a room that is not on the street. I have no idea what the interior rooms are like though. I stay in London regularly and while I would say that the room & bathroom were both more beautiful than most, I have also never stayed in a room that was even in the ballpark of this loud.",2,2023,09,25
144,A little gem in Mayfair,Lovely welcome as we arrived by Eva in reception and Thomas! Getting our room upgraded to a suite was a very nice surprise as we were celebrating our wedding anniversary! Staff lovely! Good choice at breakfast.,5,2023,09,23

144,A GEM  Discovered,"A gem discovered in London. A luxury boutique hotel that gives an impeccable service up to the last detail. The moment we stepped in until we checked out , it was a perfect stay. I specifically want to mention that Miss Lorena, the operations manager,  saw to it that we were properly taken care of. We truly had an amazing time in London and Fleming Mayfair Hotel is definitely a hotel(friend) for keeps……..",5,2023,09,21
144,A JEWEL IN MAYFAIR,"Flemings was a great discovery - a small intimate hotel, great team, beautifully restored historic group of townhouses in a top location off Piccadilly at Green Park underground.

If you want more room to move the apartment is a special option with direct access to the street. Full kitchen but a tiny well appointed modern bathroom. ",5,2023,09,19
144,Excellent boutique hotel in Mayfair,Excellent boutique hotel in Mayfair . Location was fantastic within walking distance to Buckingham Palace right across from Greenpark. Many wonderful places  to eat nearby with many choices of types of foods in Shepherds Market. Tube station is very close by as well with easy access to everything. The hotel itself is beautiful and our room was well appointed and kept very clean. It was updated beautifully. The staff was top notch from the check-in staff to the bellman and concierge to the staff at breakfast each morning.

144,Fabulous place to stay,"Everything at Flemings Mayfair is fabulous. Clean, very comfortable rooms. Incredible staff who are friendly and helpful. Nothing was too much trouble and we felt completely at home. The bar is incredible and how the Ormer restaurant does not have a Michelin star is beyond me. We ate at a Michelin starred restaurant the night after eating at Ormer and the food at Ormer was as beautifully presented but with so much more flavour and interesting ingredients, and the chefs come out to talk to you which was wonderful.  Also great to see the support they give to the homeless.",5,2023,09,13
144,Impeccable is the word!,"This was my second time at Flemings Mayfair and they didn’t fail to impress me at all. Lovely room with a serene patio to enjoy the night with my husband, ever friendly staff giving you warm welcome wherever you encounter them in the hotel. On my last visit we experienced the Ormar restaurant which was simply exquisite, this time we made it to breakfast and it was an experience in itself altogether. Manettas bar is top notch with the best staff being cherry on top.",5,2023,09,11

144,Discreet Luxury in Mayfair,"Flemings is an understated luxury hotel in Mayfair with an excellent location on a quiet street.  Location is excellent, staff is highly attentive and genial.  There is a lovely, cozy bar and our room was a one bedroom apartment which was very comfortable.  Breakfast buffet is good and fairly extensive with the option of ordering from a menu as well.  This is not an extravagantly luxurious hotel but it is very reasonably priced and elegant nonetheless.  A very good value.",5,2023,09,05
144,"Top Notch Hotel, Excellent Location","First class professional care without being fussy or over-the-top.
This is the perfect hotel and location for guests that prefer an elegant stay without fuss.
I abhor the term “quiet luxury” but what a perfect turn of phrase for Flemings.
The staff were extremely friendly and professional. The concierge were each very kind and helpful. Housekeeping and maintenance were top notch.
The building is lovely and quiet. The rooms were well appointed. Our only small complaint which we did not bring to the staff’s attention as nothing could be done, was the bed was much harder than our preference, making for a few not as restful nights.
The location is a quiet side street just a few short blocks from Green Park Station allowing you to easily travel the tube through out the city. It is an excellent location for shopping and dining, although we had difficulty finding gluten free restaurant options nearby, there are not a shortage of other restaurants in the area.
We enjoyed our stay and felt welcomed home and cared for at the end of each of our six day stay, and all our needs or questions were met with expectational advice and concern.
We highly recommend Flemings for a quiet, well-appointed stay with an excellent location.",5,2023,09,04
144,Exceptional!,The staff at Flemings went above and beyond to surprise and delight! Everything in the hotel felt luxury! Would recommend 1000% and will never stay anywhere else when returning to London. Exceptional in all categories!,5,2023,09,04
144,Great Mayfair hotel,"The hotel is in a great location for easily walking to Buckingham Palace, Camden Market, Kennsington Park, Westminster Abbey and many other sites. The service was excellent; very helpful and kind staff. The room was large and the breakfast was good.
Shepherd Market, with nice pubs, is right around the corner.",5,2023,09,01
144,The perfect stay,"Absolutely faultless. 

Me and my partner stayed for our wedding and not only was the hotel stunning, the staff were some of the friendliest I’ve seen in the industry, nothing was too much trouble and they went out of their way to make our day so special. 

Our room was spotless and beautifully decorated. The cleaning team even ensured our room was spotless when we returned on our wedding night. 

It’s not my first stay at Flemings and it won’t be the last, we’ve even decided to return next year for our anniversary.

Couldn’t recommend enough!",5,2023,08,30
144,Family London Trip,"Stayed in a 2BR suite for 4 of us. It was a great overall experience. Our accommodation included a mini kitchen, which was great to have after a week of travel in Scotland without a kitchen.  We learned that washer/dryers in the UK are very different than in the US so even though it was in the suite, we had to be patient with the time it would take to clean a load of laundry. ",5,2023,08,27
144,Fabulous hotel in the heart of Mayfair  ,"Fabulous hotel in the heart of Mayfair. Everything was fantastic. The staff were really charming and helpful, we felt so welcome there and appreciated the upgrade as we were staying for a special occasion.
We would definitely look to stay again in the future as the location is great and the hotel even better.
The hotel has a gym, bar and restaurant and is a stone's throw from Green Park tube station on foot.
We stayed with friends and they also loved the hotel and booked to stay another night.",5,2023,08,26
144,Karolis concierge is a gem.,"We just spent a week in London at the Flemings Mayfair. We are not new to the city but it keeps chaning, thats why we rely on concierge for the latest experiences. We were lucky enough to meet Karolis at concierge. He was very friendly and accomodating, even with some of our boring requests. He suggested some hot spots and really took care of us. I'd go back just because of him. ",5,2023,08,26
144,A true Boutique Hotel in the heart of Mayfair,"I was very pleased with my stay at the Fleming Mayfair Hotel, where every moment was a pleasure, especially thanks to Adnan and his colleagues who did everything and beyond to make our stay enjoyable. A big thank you to them.

Being an art director and a photographer, I always choose hotels based on their interior decor, attention to details and vibes. The Fleming has a particularly beautiful design, from its lobby to its delightful library and sleek bar. My suite was beautiful and comfortable in every detail. 

The hotel is ideally located in the heart of Mayfair, with Green Park at the end of the street and Piccadilly, the theater district and the National Gallery only a short walk away.
The Michelin restaurant Ormer was closed for its summer break but luckily, one of the oldest family owned Japanese restaurant in London, Kiku is located at the other end of the street and serves very authentic and sophisticated Japanese cuisine the way it is done in Japan.

Kiku and the Fleming Mayfair share the fact they are still both family owned and in our world of chain brands, I enjoyed the special vibe, personal attention and ""hominess"" conveyed by both.",5,2023,08,26
144,Not Exciting,"The hotel is in a nice location but cannot be compared to the other finer hotels in the area. The rooms were small and corridors to them narrow and dated. I noticed a the carpet had not been cleaned in several days. The restaurant was in the basement and lacked any character at all. I looked at the menu and was not very impressed with the small selections or what was offered. I’m my opinion they need to get with todays food options….?  The check in was not impressive including the desk agent. All of the staff at front door were excellent and there most of the time opting doors as you arrive or depart. 
Overall, we were not impressed. ",3,2023,08,26
144,Flemings Mayfair London,"Flemings is an upscale, boutique hotel in a great location.  The service is outstanding and the rooms are clean, modern and comfortable.  Great breakfast, afternoon tea and a cool bar for drinks.  We didn't get a chance to try their restaurant, but we heard it was very good.  We will be staying here again on our next trip to London for sure.",5,2023,08,25
144,Very pleasant surprise,"It was recommended by our travel agent and was right on. Helpful in every sort of way. They were very helpful for restaurant recommendations. We were surprised there was no European turn down service dinner time with a change of towels, something other fine hotels do.",5,2023,08,24
144,Perfection at Flemings,"Thank you once again for the most wonderful stay at this delightful boutique hotel so perfectly positioned for a London visit. As always from the moment we arrived until we left the whole team were exceptional…couldn’t do enough for us, so attentive and always with a smile! A special thank you to Lorena and Nicole who absolutely do go the extra mile and made our stay very special. They are an asset to the Flemings team. It is so important for an operations manager to be visible and for sure Lorena is which as a guest inspires confidence. 
A very big thank you to the whole team and hopefully we will see you very soon.",5,2023,08,23
144,London Flemings,"Our stay at Flemings met the highest standards but still felt very relaxed and as at home. We liked the story behind the hotel and its history, the lobby, the restaurant ambience, the rooms... but also the more practical things, such as a good and well-organized breakfast restaurant, the quality of the bed, cleanliness...The location was perfect for any excursions and organization of the single or joint family activities.
Unfortunately, we didn't have a chance to try the Ormer restaurant. 
However, we would give Flemings Mayfair the highest rating for service, food, rooms, and especially attention to ensure that our stay was of the highest standard and in line with expectations.
all the best recommendations from us.",5,2023,08,23
144,Birthday Celebration Stay,"I have stayed at Flemings a number of times and visited this weekend again for my boyfriends birthday.

Thank you to Ryan for looking after us💙 Can’t wait to revisit. X",5,2023,08,22

144,A small gem in the heart of London,"Flemings is a small and lovely hotel located in the elegant Mayfair borough. 
It's furbished in a very chic style and kept nice and clean.
 The food is very good (even though the main restaurant was closed and the options for dinner were limited) and the staff is friendly and happy to help.
Moreover the hotel is located in a quiet street, but in the heart of London, which to me is the best combination. 
I would definitely recommend it.
Thank you.",5,2023,08,16
144,The rooms do not correspond to the hotel's offer on the Internet.,"Hotel located in a very good area, very friendly staff. Unfortunately, the hotel offer on the Internet is misleading. We booked a Deluxe Double Room, a very nice bright room of 21 sq.m., equipped with king's bed, table, armchair, high windows, etc., corresponding to the standard of a hotel with 5 stars. Unfortunately, upon arrival, we received a completely different roomcorresponding to the standard of a B&B rhather then with 5 stars: 3.5x3.5 steps in size, occupied almost entirely by the bed, with a ceiling that I could touch with my hand while standing, a small window, a small bathroom where I brushed my teeth while leaning on the toilet. At the reception desk, where we filed a complaint, we were told that there are different rooms in the hotel, marked the same way. It's a pity that the hotel's website did not inform us that in a 5-star hotel the pakameras are offered as deluxe double rooms .  ",2,2023,08,16
144,Excellent,"Just had a long weekend here celebrating husbands 60th. It may be the 2nd oldest hotel in London but it’s by far the 1st in hospitality, service, room standards and cocktails!

Great location for central London.   All round a lovely 5 star hotel.  will definitely be coming back.  Thank you",5,2023,08,09
144,Boutique Hotel Gem,It's a gem of a botique hotel. From the street and as you enter the lobby you would not think that they have over 130 rooms. The staff from top to bottom are great and responsive to all of your needs. The shower was the only little wrinkle. Since it's an older hotel the ceiling height and therefore shower head is a little low for taller folks. ,5,2023,08,06

144,Heaven on Half Moon Street,"My family journeyed to London for spring break. We were recommended to stay at Flemings by our travel agent at Virtuoso Travel, Kristin Diehl. I cannot say enough amazing things about this hotel. It is absolutely exquisite in every way. Our family of five (children aged 10, 13, and 16)  was more than comfortable in a two bedroom apartment. The apartment was beautifully appointed with elegant furniture in beautiful hues, gorgeous wallpaper, and comfortable bedding. It was a wonderful mix of style and comfort. The room was spotless and cleaned very well every day. We loved having the convenience of the immaculate white kitchen and the well stocked fridge with complimentary items, not to mention the convenience of the laundry and dryer.  We did not cook, but we could have if we wanted to, and most importantly, there was a small laundry and dryer which were fantastic to have, because we used the gym every day, and it we got by with having a few gym clothes, because we could wash them. The dryer did not fully dry the clothes, but the staff had advised us about that ahead of time and very graciously offered to run our clothes through the hotel dryer, which they did twice. 

The hotel staff and front desk and concierge were all beyond gracious and helped us with anything we needed, including making restaurants in whichever neighborhood we chose to explore, even suggesting a great Italian takeout spot around the corner from the hotel. 

It was the perfect combination of hotel and apartment, in that it had the feeling of living in London, but still the amenities and services attached to a hotel. 

We can't imagine staying anywhere else when we venture to London next.  We met the manager of the hotel, who was lovely and made sure all of our needs were met and encouraged us to reach out to her if we were going to stay again in the future. ",5,2023,07,16

My only reason for leaving off the 5th star is the shower.  I don't like a rain head shower.  And the shower never had hot water.  The bathroom faucet did, but not the shower.  I would stay here again.  ",4,2023,07,11
144,Great service in a lovely hotel,This is a beautiful hotel that perfectly captures the charm of London. The location is excellent with several sights at walking distance and a tube station very close by. The rooms may be slightly small but the excellent staff makes up for it. Starting with the bell staff receiving you to the desk staff all are cheerful and helpful. Special mention of Amaan at the reception who went out of his way to make our stay comfortable even changing our room when we needed to. Concierge Andrew helped us with all our dinner reservations so we could experience the best of what the city has to offer. Exceptional service at this hotel.

Overall a good choice to stay in the heart of the city.,5,2023,07,11

144,Can’t wait to go back!,"If you’re ever wondering where to stay in London, don’t hesitate to book at Flemings Mayfair! A friend recommended it to me and the whole experience exceeded my expectations in the best way possible. We felt completely taken care of by every member of staff. The hotel itself is charming with all kinds of nooks and crannies (i got lost several times trying to find our room!) The rooms are beautifully appointed and had a sense of heritage and modernity at the same time. The location is fantastic and we walked for miles through parks and high end shopping streets. Also, lots of restaurants, cafes, and pubs nearby. Truly central to anything you’d like to see or do in London. The most wonderful aspect of our stay was the personal touch!  It is the whole reason to seek out a boutique hotel. Flemings Mayfair will definitely be a part of any future London travel - 10/10 - make sure to include the continental breakfast which was well worth it! ",5,2023,07,03

144,"Great hotel, room had unpleasant odor","The hotel is great and the rooms  rooms are very clean. my room had an unpleasant odor that came and went throughout the entire weeklong stay which was unfortunate. It was my third stay in this hotel and this was the only time I experienced this odor. My low ranking for cleanliness of the room is only due to the odor issue.

144,The perfect London hotel.,"First time in London and it was recommended that I stay in or near Mayfair. After my own research, I chose Flemings Mayfair and extremely glad I did. Perfectly located in the middle of everything, quite walkable to the sights and sounds of Hyde Park, Buckingham Palace, and the rest all those areas have to offer. My room (penthouse suite) was impeccable. Great amenities, room service was prompt and delicious.

144,Magical Hotel in Heart of Mayfair,"We stay at Flemings whenever we go to London (as often as twice a year). The staff, and especially the manager, could not be nicer, more helpful, more welcoming, nor more efficient. We recently stayed there for my 60th birthday, and I felt like a celebrity when I arrived. I found a bottle of champagne in our room courteous of the hotel. We stayed in one of the suites, which is vast and chic, has a small terrace, and a magnificent bathroom. But even better was the constant warmth we received throughout our stay. Location is perfect: just across from Green Park, right beside the Tube and yet on a quiet street in Mayfair. High end shopping is next door on legendary Bond Street; it's a 10 minute walk to Fortnum & Mason, and a a 15 minute walk to Knightsbridge shopping, museums, and beautiful Hyde Park. ",5,2023,04,26

The breakfast area has a fabulous selection of items. the folks at the concierge are super helpful and gave me good suggestions for travelling about.
I love this place because the trains and buses to get all over town are right up the block. Plus the neighborhood is safe and tranquil.",5,2023,04,24
144,Love this hotel but……..,"We love this hotel. The staff always make our stay special. However management has lost its way with what guests want. The lack of lunch, room service and bar closures is poor for a hotel of this calibre and really needs addressing. The staff always do their best but it is not the responsibility of reception or concierge to make you a cup of tea or glass of wine. Come on management and return this fabulous hotel to how it was before covid. A hotel where guests could eat in the restaurant and drink in the bar even if they hadn’t pre-booked.
 ",4,2023,04,23
144,Love the staff,"Best staff ever, very professional, very welcoming and very polite. Nothing was too much trouble. Breakfast was amazing. Only downside the bed/pillows were so hard, and the windows were difficult to open. But the amazing customer service outweighed this totally!",5,2023,04,22

144,Small Room in a very central location,"The hotel has a very nice standing is really well located in a nice part of the city. Staff is very helpful but I felt that for the price paid, the rooms are very very smal. Breakfast was ok, nothing to complaim.",4,2023,04,20
144,In the Heart of Mayfair,"Location was great, we actually took the tube from Heathrow to Green park, walked 1 1/2 blocks and boom we were at the hotel.  Easy.  Got a Junior Suite, really liked the extra room and L shaped sofa. We were right on the ground level of Half Moon St., but it wasn't too loud.  The construction across the street was almost unnoticed besides the eyesore.  Staff was of course everything you needed them to be.  Very attentive, responsive and caring.  Always asking what they can do to make your stay better. Being able to do some currency exchange at the front desk was great, and really at about the same rate/fees as going somewhere else, but without the hassle.  It took about a day to figure out all of the light switches, good luck, but it didnt detract at all from the great stay.  Thank you!",5,2023,04,19

144,Brilliant Hotel!!,"We arrived in London very early in the morning so it was great to have a room ready for us upon arrival.  Such a beautiful hotel!

Treats in the room on arrival and bubbles on ice when we returned to the room in the evening .. Manettas bar were wonderful and offered complimentary birthday drinks which was such a lovely touch ….  I can’t praise this hotel and it’s staff enough .. and it’s only the first time staying !!   Will 100% return and recommend !!  You all made the stay very special indeed ..,5,2023,04,03
144,Perfect Hotel Stay,"Amazing hotel in the perfect London location! The most helpful, kind staff you will encounter anywhere. Everything about the hotel is amazing, the kind staff, the delicious restaurant, the luxurious rooms. This was truly the best hotel stay we've ever had! ",5,2023,03,31
144,A little treasure,"Since the pandemic, hotel prices in London have rocketed: even the run of the mill chain hotels like Marriott or Hilton charge a premium for basic accommodation. On business and while travelling, I’m happy to stay in Sofitel, but for a short break or holiday, I look for something more individual. memorable and better appointed.

The top end hotels have always been expensive, but now (I suspect deliberately) they are out of reasonable reach. Normally my “go-to” “chain” is Mandarin Oriental, and this is because of the excellent personalised service. However, a basic room at the Mandarin in London is around £1300 a night -  which seems excessive for anything other than a special occasion. 

What a pleasure, then, it has been to discover Flemings. Situated, conveniently between Piccadilly and Belgravia, it’s ideally located for retail therapy, theatre and the parks. 

As a middle-age woman, on this occasion travelling on her own, I was looking for something boutique, where I would feel comfortable sitting in its bar and restaurant with a good book. 

From the warmth of welcome offered by the concierge on first entering the hotel, after more taxing travel than I would have liked, to the delightful welcome in the lounge bar, while I waited for my room to be ready, I was struck by the genuine effort patently being made by the staff at Flemings to recognise their customers. 

The hotel has not only character but also well- appointed charm and comfort. 

But what singles out Flemings is the warmth of the personalised service. One truly feels that the team take care and take pride in their hotel.

I stayed in a one-bedroom suite, which was extremely well appointed and comfortable and which, with one or two exceptions, exceeded expectations. The exceptions are de minimis: a bath robe that is far too small for most guests (other than the very slim) and a make up mirror that was broken. 

It would also be nice if the other individual aspects of the hotel were reflected in the bathroom products offered which are rather pedestrian (and contain SLS). I have got to the age when I am careful about what I apply to my skin and really appreciate organic paraben, mineral oil free products. These are really minor matters (first world problems) which do not detract from the overall very positive and pleasing impression. 

The suite was very clean and decorated in pleasing, soothing colours, and to my delight contained fresh flowers and an honesty gin bar.

I look forward to returning.",5,2023,03,31
144,Great rooms in best location,Modern boutique hotel with clean and nice rooms and friendly and helpful staff. I had a quiet room. The hotel situated in a great spot. Will definitely go back. Good for both business and private stay.,5,2023,03,31
144,Well located hotel in quiet spot for West End,"Let's be honest, it's not going to be cheap to stay this close to Green Park, so you are paying for the great location, a hop and a skip from Buckingham Palace and an easy walk to most West End sites. Service was very friendly, the rooms are nice enough but not huge. It has a very nice basement bar, although last orders are 11pm, and we enjoyed the very nice breakfast spread, including a Bloody Mary station! This part of Green Park is a nice haven with some good traditional pubs within two minutes walk but it's also very close to all the West End action.",4,2023,03,29
144,The Best London hotel I've stayed at,"Everything from start to end was incredible!
Beautiful extra touches in the room - everything well designed and thought out.

144,Best hotel I’ve stayed in london thus far,"I was recommended this hotel by a friend and it went beyond my expectations. It’s a beautiful calm hotel with a boutique like vibe. It’s very sophisticated and elegant. The standard room is spacious especially being in london, and extremely comfortable with heated bathroom floors. The breakfast is lovely, light and filling and the hygiene of the hotel overall is amazing. I’ve been to london many times to different hotels and this one is by far the best. Ms Lorena was an amazing hostess, she treated us with the best upmost respect and care and reassured our stay was comfortable, easy and a great experience. We felt extremely welcomed and I can’t wait to go again. ",5,2023,03,27

144,Boring guesthouse with limited views,"Small room without any view nor much day light. Electricity supply volatile.  No drinks available in the drawing room except tea. Quite frankly this place does not hold what it promises. Based on my experience for a weekend stay, there are substantially better places around the corner. Only silver-lining is the excellent location",3,2023,03,12
144,Very poor,"Tired, dated and small room with a leak that left the carpet soaking. Little interest in resolving the issues. I would not stay here again. The Mayfair Townhouse across the road is much better. Similar style but much more modern.",1,2023,03,12

144,The restaurant is a very good reason to stay here,"We used to visit the Fleming pre covid for its very good restaurant , the ormer.
It’s gave us one of the very best most enjoyable meals we have had anywhere for a long time , which as people 
Who dine out frequently in London and elsewhere is really saying something 
They have a six and eight course dinner menu , which initially concerned us , because of several bad experiences 
Of such tasting menus in many restaurants which usually means you might like about half the courses etc .
But to our delight one course followed another each one being a total pleasure  , each one gave us a sort  of distilled perfection , the essence of each course on a plate , a very rare occurrence .
The food and the very enthusiastic head waiter combined to make a very memorable evening , 
Drinks before our meal in their bar , one of the nicest in London enhanced our experience .
In addition the staff in all areas of the hotel are some of the nicest most friendly anywhere  - certainly a reason to visit 
We stayed in a comfortable suite in the Fleming that as we told the hotel could take some improvements here and there to be really top grade , in our judgement .
The next day we went to the david Hockney exhibition which just started on that day which also was terrific .
So a very pleasant night and day in London

144,Great service  in fantastic location,"Although hotel prices in central London has gone somewhat crazy after the pandemic, The Flemings is a rare exception. The quality of service have not changed the slightest iota and remains extremely high as well as genuinely friendly, the rooms are just the same as I remember them from the previous years (some of the wooden furniture are very beautiful), and are spotless. 
The staff will park the car for you tin the local multistory but we were lucky that there was a parking on the meter available just outside the the entrance.  
The location is great both for shopping and restaurants and is reasonably quiet too.  ",5,2023,02,26

The hotel's crew are an exceptional group of people who go out of their way to make their guest feel extremely special while at Flemings and the evenings spent in the Bar is a special experience watching the barman produce his cocktails almost like a surgeon on the job.  ",5,2023,01,24

This boutique hotel is exceptional with the most fabulous, helpful and happy staff who go above and beyond to ensure that your stay is absolutely perfect! From the moment we walked in until the moment we left the staff were amazing. We have stayed in many 5* hotels in London but none with a team so attentive including the Managing Director Mr Muehle and his Operations Manager Lorena Somera, both of whom are very visible  and both clearly have extremely high standards that transcend throughout the team. It is so rare, but wonderful to see the MD as a host…love it! The whole experience is a great pleasure, we will absolutely be returning and wouldn’t hesitate in recommending this charming, perfectly located Hotel. Thank you Mr Muehle, Lorena and the whole team.",5,2023,01,11
144,A wonderful experience in every way,"When I arrived at Flemings Mayfair I was greeted with a smile by 4-5 people that worked there. Everyone seemed to already know me which was very inviting. Daily I had various questions for recommendations or directions and all were answered with ease. The Manetta Bar is a great place, feels like home in many ways yet better :) I look forward to my next stay. ",5,2023,01,10

The hotel is in an extremely convenient location - very easy access to the tube and major attractions.  I will definitely stay here again.,5,2023,01,03
144,"Location, Large Rooms, Excellent Price and Five Star Service!","I have stayed in London 20 times in the past several years; it is my home away from home. This was my first stay at Fleming Mayfair. It is tucked away a half block from Piccadilly street in Mayfair.It is right across from Green Park offering a quick walk to Buckingham Palace. You are 4 blocks to Old Bond Street, Burlington Arcade, Fortnum and Mason, and Jermyn Street.The Green Park tube station is a 2 min walk if you prefer to take the tube. It is centrally located which allows a quick walk to many London sights.

The staff are incredible. Danielle checked us in and we were shown to our room and introduced all the features of this incredibly large studio suite. This is the largest room in which I have stayed for the price. It was gorgeous and quiet. Natalia always welcomed up for their hearty English or continental breakfast. She remembered our order, room number, and provided personalized service. Miguel was also always there to assist.

We took advantage of the bar - a trendy, private space with bartenders who make excellent drinks. Snack and small meals can be ordered but we enjoyed the privacy and cool vibe.

Ryan and Andrew, the concierges, were always available to make recommendations, provide directions, make hard to get reservations. 

This was a very special trip as my (now Fiancé) proposed to me at Rules Restaurant. I was glowing upon return to the hotel and all of the staff were congratulatory and lovely! They sent a bottle of champagne to our room. They also bought us glasses of champagne in the bar. Every time we saw a hotel employee, they said they had heard the news and passed along their congratulations. They truly went out off their way to make this experience extra special.

I would absolutely stay at Flemings Mayfair again and can recommend this property with the highest accolades along with my sincerest thanks to the incredible staff for making this a truly memorable experience.",5,2023,01,01
144,"Excellent Service, Beautiful Room, Great Location, Fun Bar!","The Fleming Mayfair is a short walk from the Green Park tube station and is located walking distance to many restaurants, shops, and theaters. (If you're willing to walk up to 20 minutes.) We were only there for a few days so spent much of time in the area and did not run out of things to do. 

The staff was very friendly and accommodating. The bar downstairs was excellent! We paid a little more than usual for a larger suite (the Junior Suite) and were rewarded with a very pleasant room that made it actually very pleasant to hang out in while it was raining.",5,2022,12,30
144,A Must Stay,The property was lovely and the staff were super attentive. They solved a problem with a noisy refrigerator immediately. They were knowledgeable and eager to help. I would definitely go back and recommend it highly! ,5,2022,12,30
144,Lee family visit room 72,"Great hotel.  
Staff were extremely helpful, friendly and knowledgeable. 
They helped with reservations, taxis sight seeing tips…and even helped us get  a food delivery 3AM Christmas Day.
Simply amazing. 
We will stay at FLEMINGS Mayfair",5,2022,12,28
144,Go for the suites,"The location is not bad and is close to Green Park but the hotel itself is wonderful - good furnishings, clean and new, and consistently good service from the staff. In room dining was excellent throughout.  Traffic around Green Park and Regent Street is a nightmare but this isn’t the fault of the hotel.",5,2022,12,22
144,A wonderful stay in Mayfair,"Fleming's is one of those rare places where the expectations are not only met, but exceeded.  

We had a junior suite, which was lovely.  The king bed was comfortable and the bathroom was stunning (walk-in shower with two huge rain shower heads, lovely heated floor and warming rack for towels).

My only regret is that we did not have a chance to dine at Omer's. ",5,2022,12,19
144,Nice luxury hotel in the best part of London,"A well maintained and cleaan SLH - hotel in central London. A nice restaturant, and an excellent bar.. We enjoyed our stay at Flemings. Close to the best streets in London, easy acsess from Heatrow with the Piccadelly line.",4,2022,12,15
144,Beautiful hotel and de place was also amazing. Nice shops bars en restaurants,"Thank you for everything! The staff is very good and the hotel also! No more words needed. 
The restaurant in hotel is also amazing! The food is so good and the place were we eat is also amazing.
Thank you ",5,2022,12,15
144,Fantastic Hotel,"Wonderful stay in a fantastic hotel. Stayed previously in many 5* London hotels. During Covid had to visit London with my daughter for interviews-Chose this hotel as wanted a smaller, more intimate hotel- what a find! This hotel is beautiful! It is simply exquisite. The best part of the the whole experience - the staff. The level of attention to detail from every member of staff is phenomenal. The whole experience is very personal. We are very much looking forward to returning for our next stay . ",5,2022,12,11
144,Beautiful hotel and such friendly staff,"The hotel was beautiful - especially loved the Christmas decorations outside. The staff couldn't do enough for you, so friendly! Really felt like they all went the extra mile. Particularly enjoyed being asked whether I wanted water or for them to book me a taxi as I was leaving. Definitely will be back",5,2022,12,10
144,Great Stay at Flemings Mayfair,"Spent 4 nights at the Flemings Mayfair in December 2022 and it was a great experience.    From the moment you step into the lobby, the staff welcomes you and is there for anything you need.  Everyone was so helpful from the front desk, to conceirge, to wait staff and managers.  Special shout out to Operations Manager Lorena who really went above and beyond to ensure we had a great stay from arrival to departure.  We had a morning arrival and the room was not ready so Lorena escorted us to the tea lounge where we were served complimentary tea, coffee and biscuits - a nice touch after a long flight.  The hotel is charming and the location is fantastic.  A few blocks from the start of the shopping areas but just a half block from Green Park - which you cross to get to Buckingham Palace.  Breakfast is amazing and the restaurant manager is very attentive, enusring everything is prefect - which it was.  We were out most times during dinner, so we did get to try the restuarant for dinner but we did  have  a late night meal at the bar which was exceptional.   We stopped by the conceirge often to get tips or directions on which tube stop to use, or restaurant to try - most times we were helped by Ryan who was also fantastic and very helpful.   This is a botique hotel so you trade off some conveniences of big hotels for the charm, but it is worth the trade off.  For example, they gym is very small and the bar was not open for two nights of our stay - but neither was consequential.  The matress was more firm than i am used to  but it was fine.  The Flemings Mayfair and it's staff exceeded our expectations in many ways and we look forward to a return visit.",5,2022,12,08
144,Great hotel,Great location and staff and service was excellent throughout. Only had breakfast which was also excellent. On reflection probably should have asked for a room with a Queen or King size bed and Double room had a double size bed which was a little smaller than we are used to. ,4,2022,12,01
144,Weekend Stay,"Great location, friendly staff however restricted food and bar times very surprising and especially for 5 star hotel. We love the hotel and generally good quality but was disappointed when not being able to get drink in the bar even though it was only 11.30pm, ",4,2022,11,28
144,Shoe Box room for a Globalist,"Poor Standard of Room for my status, rabbit warren layout, no meaningful food options, chaos at check in, no acknowledgement of status, too many better options in the same location, will not stay here again and highly discourage this to be considered an option in this area of London",1,2022,11,27
144,Over price,Really over price. The rooms clean but some details no good in the shower. The croissant in the breakfast not fresh. Check in really slow. For the price it not work. Great location! It’s not bad but for the price I will prefer to look for another place,3,2022,11,26
144,Pedro Mendes,"Everything was spot on! Room was small, thats why you dont take the excellent! For the occasion was ok enough, but will need to book a better room next time :)
Bar was great and the bar service was top
Well done 👏🏻👏🏻",5,2022,11,26
144,Beautiful Hotel with Amazing Staff,Exceptional hotel all round from the very accommodating and polite front of house to the endless breakfast choices the next morning. They couldn’t do enough for us! Beautiful bar downstairs with cocktails and very comfortable room.,5,2022,11,23
144,Mayfair excellence,"A beautiful hotel with top quality staff and service. Probably the best breakfast I have had in London for many years. I assume  post COVID the only thing missing was an evening turndown service, but everything else was of the highest standard.",5,2022,11,23
144,Lovely Hotel,"I booked this hotel for my husbands birthday! We were both pleased with this beautiful hotel, room was immaculate very stylish decor and most importantly, staff were very friendly. Thank you Flemings for making our stay a memorable one. ",5,2022,11,23

144,Perfection!!,"We had such an amazing stay! Lorena and her team were stellar! Prior to our arrival and actually years of rearching hotels as I do for fun and save on Pinterest, I did not know about your hotel. We almost booked the Mayfair Townhouses my daughter found and we liked on Instagram, but when our real estate client who I just met who is a travel we spoke with her. Sasha Charney made the recommendation and we went with it. We could not be happier with our choice and will definitely be back to stay again. The location was ideal, the staff super attentive and our suite magnificent! Our only regret is that we did not stay longer! See you next year!

144,A Truly Amazing experience!,"Firstly, I have travelled and stayed in Toronto Canada, New York Manhattan, Trinidad and Tobago - Petit Valley, Latvia Riga, Tenerife, Ibiza, Paris, Rome, New Jersey USA, Long Island USA, Florida - Key West USA and never have I received customer service like I received from Flemmings 5 Star hotel in Mayfair London, truly amazing! On arriving during my first trip in October 2022, I received a really warm welcome from both porters Marian and Jude, they gave me the impression that they truly cared for my wellbeing, quite rare in this day and age. Marian had seated me in the relaxing, impressive bar area and supplied me with free bottled cold water! Jude had taken my folding bike to the cloakroom and had mentioned that I could collect my bicycle as and when I wanted and supplied a cloakroom ticket with a broad smile! Jude had asked me how my day was going and that if I needed anything I just had to ask, so I did, 'Jude is this a 5-star hotel?' and Jude answered but of course sir! and I said I guessed so, because the attention to detail is outstanding with nothing missing, the opening of the front door on entry up to the warm calm atmosphere which is unique for central. The food is very tasty, fresh and reasonably priced. Lorena was so accommodating in attitude and personality, quite outstanding. Lorena has a winning standard and top training service which clearly displayed Marian and Jude's 5 Star Customer Service Skills! 
I will not hesitate in recommending The Flemmings Hotel to anyone who wants a warm, relaxing and professional atmosphere at a reasonable price. Great job Flemmings, you are Top of your field! Additionally, I will recommend Marian in working for any Hospitality outlet as The Best in his profession.... Many, many thanks' Flemmings, Yours, Sincerely, Mark D Lawrence. UK 0754 646 6375.",5,2022,11,17
144,"A lovely, traditional London hotel","Many things went to make our 4-night stay at Flemings memorable: a wonderful location, just off Piccadilly... a memorable 8-course tasting-menu dinner at the Ormer, prepared by star chef Sofian... a luxurious bed in a perfectly-appointed suite... but what really stays in our minds is the attentiveness and kindness of the staff. 

From entering the doors (on the deliciously-named Half Moon Street) to reluctantly departing, we felt that nothing was too much trouble. From the manager to cleaning staff, we felt that our comfort was always their paramount concern. 

Having had many varied (and not-so pleasant) experiences in London hotels, Flemings Mayfair reassured us that British hospitality is still among the best in the world.

Highly recommended to all travellers.",5,2022,11,17
144,Wonderful service!,"We celebrated my husband's birthday here over a long weekend. The executive management, headed by the very distinguished Mr Muehle, made it a wonderful experience going out of their way to make it a special event for us. The hotel is a joy from the wonderful breakfasts to the exquisite Ormer Restaurant's special tasting menu. Lorena, the Ops Manager is so gracious. It is rare to find a hotel who cares so much for its guests. I lost a cufflink, Andrew, Head Concierge, found me one immediately -- saved me a lot of embarrassment! Thank you! Highly recommend this wonderful hotel!",5,2022,11,17
144,Staff go above and beyond,"The gentleman working the bar on Saturday afternoon was lovely and recommended a cocktail for myself and partner to try and it was delicious! Also, Jude, who handled our luggage and coats, was great and accommodating. Definitely recommend just to be treated like royalty by the staff.",5,2022,11,16
144,Absolutely Perfect,My favourite place to stay when spending the weekend in town. The staff are fabulous... They cannot do enough for you. Rooms are nice and cosy. Just the way I like. Very big and  comfortable bed. Perfect location ,5,2022,11,16
144,"Premium Hotel, Premium Experience","My stay at the Flemings Mayfair hotel was spectacular. I've stayed in luxury hotels all across Europe, but the service here was unmatched. The manager Aman had gone the extra mile to ensure everything meets my expectations and constantly checked-in to see if there was anything I needed. Alex, Fiki and Laurena were always present and helpful too. I've become a big fan of the hotel and the management, and it won't be long until I visit again. ",5,2022,11,14
144,Boutique hotel in Mayfair,We only stayed one but it was lovely. Hotel felt small and intimate with extremely helpful staff. Room was beautifully decorated with our own gin bar - never seen that before! Great location too and after a rail strike we had to drive and were pleased to discover we got a parking discount at euro carpark Mayfair. Thank you and see you again,5,2022,11,08
144,Excellent !,"I had a very peaceful and comfortable time in the Flemings while travelling for business. The staff was super nice, helpful and quick. I strongly recommend it and looking forward to coming back very soon !",5,2022,11,07
144,Perfect Stay,"We had the most perfect stay. The manager Aman went above and beyond to ensure that our stay was as comfortable and peaceful as possible. Everyone at the hotel including Alex, Fiki, and Laurena were extremely helpful the entire time we stayed",4,2022,11,06
144,Uncomfortable Room,"Great location, and very friendly staff. However, the rooms are incredibly small, stuffy, Uncomfortable, as was the bed. The hallways and common areas are also very small and uncomfortable. I was truly shocked, given the price. ",2,2022,11,06
144,"Fabulous Hotel, staff and location","We Just had 2 nights stay with our friends in This Hotel, it was superb!!
Location excellent, and the staff in the hotel just couldn’t do enough for you.
On arrival we were offered a drink, in the small bar, main bar was not opened.
Erica went the extra mile to bring the drink we asked for.
Lorena was at Reception when we arrived. She was so welcoming, attentive, and made you feel very special.
But also very professional in her role as Operations Manager.
A truly exceptional customer experience….thank you we will definitely return",5,2022,11,04
144,Nice stay in the heart of Mayfair,A very nice hotel in the heart of Mayfair. From there many hotspots are reachable within foot walking distance. Very good breakfast with plenty of options to chose from. Absolutely recommendable. We will come back.,5,2022,11,02
144,Reasonable Stay,"Hotel was pleasant, I paid for a Jnr Suite, but it certainly wasn't - it was more like a Deluxe Double.  There was no ironing board in the room I had to request it.  The bed was extremely uncomfortable - it was like sleeping on a slab of concrete - I didn't sleep on either night.  The fridge wasn't well stocked so we popped out for snacks.  I was left feeling a little disappointed for the money having stayed in many hotels.  Had a slight inconvenience with Housekeeping who decided to visit whilst we were at Breakfast rather than waiting for us to vacate for the day and put the sign on the door to say that we wanted our room serviced.  ",3,2022,10,31
144,Weekday mini break,"Cannot fault this boutique hotel where the staff remember you and cannot help enough. From use of an umbrella, to calling a taxi, recommend restaurants or providing complimentary water. All excellent. ",5,2022,10,21
144,Quiet oasis in Mayfair,"We had an excellent 4 night stay in a 1 bedroomed apartment which had its own catering facilities.  This was handy as there was an M & S Simply Food and Tesco express within 5 minutes walking distance. Our apartment was always kept spotlessly clean. Staff were very pleasant and welcoming and went the extra mile to make sure you had everything you wanted.  Very well situated for sightseeing in central London and for transport links enabling us to get around easily.  Green Park is virtually on your doorstep.  As mentioned above, you could not fault the location.  ",5,2022,10,18
144,My home away from home in London,"My time at Flemings started with an excellent bang. I had arrived at the hotel early in the morning - way too early to check in. I desperately needed a shower. The wonderful lady at the check in desk offered me a shower in one of the hotel’s meeting rooms - fitted with complete bathroom. After a very long travel day, this was just what I needed. I was able to start my trip feeling refreshed and energized, ready to explore the city. 

Throughout my stay, operations manager Lorena Somera would greet me by name, often stopping to have a quick chat. I have never stayed in a hotel where someone of her position would know my name. What a wonderful personal touch that was! How welcome I felt! 

In short, the staff are warm, kind, and welcoming. You feel at home instantly. Never fear to ask for anything because the staff at Flemings will make it happen, with a smile. I will be returning to stay here the next time I am in London. 

Ps - their tea is unreal.",5,2022,10,17

144,Smelly Room,"The customer service of this hotel is amazing. The room was the issue. No USB or US outlets to use, room smelled like smoke all 4 days, and 1 elevator for all floors took forever. We had friends that stayed at the same time who had a great room without any of these issues so I think certain rooms just aren’t acceptable for customers. ",3,2022,10,10
144,Friendly and extremely service minded,I have stayed here several times and love this very personal hotel.  The hotel is clean and rooms are very good. The staff are so friendly and go out of their way to help and make your stay as good as possible. The location is also excellent. Very good food and bar. I love the design of the hotel but it is the staff that makes this place so great! I will be coming back.,5,2022,10,07
144,Wonderful Boutique Hotel in Mayfair,"Tucked away in Half Moon street just off Piccadilly is this gorgeous little boutique hotel.  I can't say enough about this little gem of a property. Starting with the gorgeous drawing room just off the reception where you can have afternoon tea and cocktails. The rooms are modern yet cozy. Very nice amenities, clean and very comfortable bed with plush beddings. I can go on and on about the many features of the rooms but none of them will matter if not for its people. Always warm and friendly, the people in this property is what makes one's stay truly memorable. I will never forget the concierge, Andrew, who went out of his way to make our restaurant bookings , or the doorman and porter, Marian, who was always quick to offer help with our packages as we returned to the hotel. Not to mention the operations manager, Lorena, who made sure our stay was just perfect above and beyond her normal responsibilities. Hats off to you and your team, Ms. Lorena.

She made our trip more interesting with her advices & tips about the city, restaurants, shops, bars within walking distance. Would definetely recommend this hotel to everybody!

This makes a big extra difference... TOP 👏🏻",5,2022,09,28
144,30 plus years of staying at Flemings of Mayfair and it is as appealing this trip as it was on my first trip.,"Beautiful hotel in the greatest of locations.
Excellent staff and lovely bar and staff. Hotel rooms and all areas of the hotel are always spotless and clean and fresh. The hotel benefits by having excellent members of staff from doorman to concierge to check in desk to maid services to bar and restaurant staff. It is indeed my home away from home. ",5,2022,09,26
144,Best London hotel,"Have traveled to London many times since the late 1970s  and stayed in a wide variety of hotels of varying quality but for the past few years have found a gem…Flemings of Mayfair. An outstanding small hotel in a great location. Staff very friendly and helpful. Can walk to many places like Buckingham , Green Park, Piccadilly, Bond Street and our favorite place for tea Fortnum & Masons",5,2022,09,25
144,Great work stay,"Charming hotel in a superb location.

Flew in and came on the tube to Green park - short walk to the hotel.

Prompt checkin, everything was ready as I arrived.

Lovely room, albeit small. Comfy bed, tasteful decor & nice tea tray & minibar selection along with a personal note & box of chocolate biscuits. Large bathroom with White Company toiletries. All you would expect from this calibre hotel.

Only negatives would be around the practicality of the tea tray, it’s so high you have to stand on the bed to reach anything. Due to the size of the room I imagine the space between the bed and the wardrobe/hospitality unit would be difficult. The electrics under the TV were also lose and the TV kept flickering on and off. The shower is within the bath, and as is often the case, very slow draining - so your feet get a bath whilst you shower!

Staff were very attentive and friendly, good service over breakfast, and in assisting with getting a taxi etc as required. 

I’ll certainly welcome staying again on future business trips.",4,2022,09,24
144,Lovely stay in a lovely hotel.,From check in to check out outstanding customer service. Our dining experience at Omar’s was wonderful. We were seated in the semi private dining area and it just surpassed any of our expectations. Would most definitely stay here again. Great location. And would highly recommend to our friends and family. Awesome stay. ,5,2022,09,22
144,Lovely hotel in Mayfair,"Highly recommend this hotel! The room was a gem, breakfast was abundant, and the location was very convenient to Bond street shopping. But our favorite thing was the 30s style bar!  We went back each night of our stay before dinner.",5,2022,09,21
144,City visit,"Really enjoyed our stay the hotel was lovely and great location.the staff were very helpful and nice.only had breakfast but the food was very nice.was very lucky to be able to park outside which was an added bonus. would definitely stay again,very please.",5,2022,09,20
144,Anniversary weekend,Fabulous location. The staff were very friendly and helpful. We were upgraded to a two bedroomed suite which was amazing. We couldn’t fault our stay and would recommend this hotel to others. The whole experience (including being on London at the time of the Queen’s death) was something we will not forget.,5,2022,09,18
144,Smiling hotel,"It is more then a hotel, happy friends runs hotel…when people welcome from day first, service in at lounge, beautiful friendly people at breakfast service area, left only beautiful memories and I would definitely back again ",5,2022,09,18
144,The best customer service,Our company host a number of business dinners at the hotel for our clients and I have to say that we are always looked after amazingly. Staff are so friendly and helpful. Vlad and Lorena are absolute stars who make us feel so special and ensure our events run smoothly. We use the Half moon suite which is perfect for an intimate private dinners. The food and service are amazing. I highly recommend!,5,2022,09,16
144,5 nights in London,"Great high end boutique hotel in terrific location. Just off Piccadilly street in the Mayfair but very quiet. 3 minute walk to a tube station, 8 minutes to Piccadilly circle. Adjacent to Green Park, 5 minute walk to Buckingham Palace (we were there when the Queen passed away). The room was spacious and very quiet. Service was 'spot on'.  After 4 trips to London we've finally found our go to hotel. We'll be back next year. Not the least expensive, but well worth the cost",5,2022,09,14
144,Old and tired,"Lovely staff, nice old hotel in a superb location that has fallen on hard times. Elevator is abysmal - slow and old. This will be an excellent hotel once a sensible owner spends the needed capex for renovations.",3,2022,09,12
144,Perfect for a one week stay,Was traveling on Business for a week and the room was renovated clean and quiet. I loved the fact that there was no waiting for the elevator as you can take the stairs to all levels. The morning breakfast was and excellent way to start the day including fresh bread for heavenly toast.  ,5,2022,09,12
144,Hidden gem in Mayfair,Great little charming hotel with the best location and exceptional service from smiling staff all over the property. This was a newly discovered treasure that I will definitely boo the next time as well. ,5,2022,09,12
144,Outstay,"Lovely hotel with very friendly staff, the only thing was that the staff on the breakfast was stressed but friendly. The bed might have been a little bit hard for my taste but that is more of a preference.",5,2022,09,10
144,Excellent hotel,"The staff was uniformly courteous and helpful, and the hotel is very attractive.  My room was comfortable and had everything I needed.  The hotel is a short walk from the Underground, and there's a good pub (the Clarence) with exellent food a little beyond that, on Dover Street.",5,2022,09,09
144,Amazing location and friendly staff! 5 star ⭐️,"Location is everything. Clean rooms and well equipped. Friendly & welcoming staff. 
Aman & alex from reception made sure our stay was perfect. 
Housekeeping is exceptional. Room layout is great and the furniture is nice. ",5,2022,09,09
144,Simply superb,Can't fault this hotel and it's presentation at all. Lorena and the operations team are excellent and incredibly professional. The rooms clean and comfortable. Breakfast quality and variety amazing. Wouldn't stay anywhere else in London.,5,2022,09,09
144,Great Boutique Hotel,"I stayed at Flemmings for a few days around the time I was getting married and found the service that I received was impeccable. Staff were friendly, and any queries were answered promptly. I would heartily recommend Flemmings to anyone else looking for a great hotel in Mayfair.",5,2022,09,05
144,Flemings,"Beautiful hotel in an amazing position, great value for such a prestigeous location. The staff are incredibly professional and friendly and the rooms and lobbies are elegantly decorated. Proximity to the Jubillee line makes this an excellent base in the middle of town, even for a trip to Wembley like us on this occasion.",5,2022,09,05
144,"Great Hotel, fabulous staff.","My husband and I have stayed at the Flemings in Mayfair twice this year and were most impressed with the facilities and fabulous staff.  Nothing was too much and everyone did as much as they could for us.
The breakfast is delicious and a great choice is supplied. Again nothing was too much for the waitstaff.
The room was great, lovely bed and just great to come home too after a day out trudging the streets of London.  Always clean and a lovely bowl of flowers to greet us with some biscuits.",5,2022,09,04
144,Hidden Gem in Mayfair,"Wonderful, wonderful place to stay. Quirky, beautiful, comfortable rooms and really lovely staff - from front of house, housekeeping, waitstaff, concierge, and the wonderful doorman. Nothing was too much trouble - we felt very at home. ",5,2022,09,04
144,Treated like a Royal,"The Flemings hotel is amazing- 5 stars! The customer service was outstanding- we felt like a royal. The room was luxurious.  Although our room did not have a good view on the main level, I liked not having to go in and out of an elevator. The morning breakfast was delicious.  Don’t miss it.  A wide variety of choices accommodating a variety of tastes and appetites.  I looked forward to the wonderful breakfast and talking with friendly staff. When I return to London, I will be staying here again— definitely.  Highly recommend.",5,2022,09,02
144,Outstanding and great location.,"Great position for London Bridge, HCA health care and great restaurants.Great area to walk around as well. There are many sights worth visiting. Centrally located for theatres, museums and other points of interest.",5,2022,08,27
144,Nice hotel stay,Hotel was very nice.  Lovely room and friendly staff.  Breakfast was delicious.  One downside was that the room wasn't ready upon check-in even though it was 20/30mins past the check in time of 2pm. Slightly overpriced in my opinion.,4,2022,08,24
144,London Stay,Wonderful experience at the Flemings Mayfair. 5 night stay and couldn't have asked for better customer service. Staff was well prepared and helpful with needed information and additional help as needed.,5,2022,08,23
144,TOTALLY  LOVELY,"Flemings is all charm, personal service, and a beautiful great location!  We only stay at the Flemings in London!! Pre-covid we would go twice a year..After a 3 year covid lock-out we were delighted to be back!!  Warm and helpful staff, and a true escape into your best trip ever!",5,2022,08,23
144,"Small smelly room, noisy air conditioning and dismissive staff","We were looking forward to our stay here, as a family treat and get away. We have stayed before and had an incredible time. Room was that small that the bathroom door doesn't even open all the way - Room 420. Plug sockets in strange places and wall paper chipped. The ceiling was that low, struggled to shower as a 6ft person.

Struggled to sleep, due to the noise of the air conditioning unit, throughout the night.  

When feeding back to the staff about how disappointed we were with our room (£500 p/n) they just laughed it off and said that we should expect a variation of room from the pictures on booking.com as it's a 'boutique' hotel. 

The only thing which saved this is the bar, breakfast and location. 

Such a shame, as we have enjoyed stays here before.",2,2022,08,21
144,Fantastic,What a great stay yet again thank you for making it such lovely stay again  - I will be back - big shout out to the front desk staff and housekeeping was amazing (loved the minibar ;) see you again soon - ,5,2022,08,19
144,Fantastic Birthday Stay,We stayed here for my wife's birthday and it was a perfect hotel to make our birthday celebration such a special occasion. The location is ideal for the West End with Green Park tube station a couple of minutes away and Piccadilly Circus within easy walking distance. The staff were fantastic and we were made to feel very welcome. Our room was very comfortable and I don't think I've ever stayed in such a quiet room - we did not hear any noises for the whole night! We will definitely stay again.,5,2022,08,19
144,Great 10 day stay in Mayfair,"Amazing location, very convenient to walk around. Staff is amazing, very helpful and great with recommendations. 
My room was very nice and clean. Breakfast is gargantuan and quite diverse. 
I really like the scale of the hotel because it doesn’t feel like a huge hotel with no personality. This hotel feels very comfortable and homely. It was great for a 10 day business trip but I’ll definitely stay there for leisure as well.  ",5,2022,08,17
144,A very nice stay for our wedding,"I've stayed at the Flemming a number of times over recent years and decided to pick the Flemming as our base for our wedding in August. The food and service were impeccable as always and the rooms were cleaned and well maintained, as you would expect from a 5* hotel in Mayfair.

The only issue we had with the room was our air conditioning failed on the second day, and there were no other rooms to move to. I appreciate these things happen, considering the extreme heat  we've had over the last 6 weeks, but I would expect a quality hotel to have a back up plan.

I'm not happy that service charge is added to everything, including the room rate when you check out, the room rate should included these charges. Also if you order any thing in the bar or the restaurant this also attracts an automatic service charge when checking out. I was surprised to be presented with a bill for an additional £250 of services charges for the rooms alone, this should be at your own discretion. Considering we didn't have AC to 2 days/nights I don't think this is reasonable.

The breakfast is very good, but is now £35 up from £25, plus 12.5% service charge, rather steep.

Despite these issues the hotel is a lovely place to stay with easy access to great restaurants and bars.",4,2022,08,17
144,One of the Best,"Where do I start? Ok, I'll start from the start. As we entered in this hotel after a long trans Atlantic flight, we were warmly greeted by the front staff and concierges. We were quickly shown our accomodations.

Our rooms were extravagant. We had a kitchen, 2 bathrooms and very comfortable beds and places to sit and unwind.

The continental breakfast was second to none. There  were so many choices and seemingly bottomless cappuccinos. 

The cleaning staff was so friendly and courteous. We stayed for about a week and they so understanding about when or when not to clean.

I cannot say enough good about the staff here. They were so amazing and always greeted us with a smile. Please go here when visiting London!!!",5,2022,08,16
144,Bad Experience followed by a Better Experience,My mixed review below reflects our poor experience in the first room which was very different from the rest of our stay in the second room. The room 311 should not be assigned based on how warm the room was. ,4,2022,08,16
144,Excellent Experience,"The hotel has a fantastic location and the room has all you need to start your day early and enjoy London. 
However, the best thing about the hotel was the staff. I sadly forgot my phone at a black cab when I arrived and they all immediately got to working on helping me getting it back (which I did) and throughout my entire stay they continued to make sure I was ok.",5,2022,08,16
144,Not a luxury hotel,"Very average rooms for the money you are paying. Staff were pleasant enough, but one was very impolite and rude when we complained about the standard of the room.  Breakfast was not bad a good range and choice. Would I go back No!",2,2022,08,15
144,great staff in prime location,"by the green park station, 2 blocks from Oxford, Regent st. and by the corner of Piccadilly, by green and hyde park - this hotel is really at prime location, great gym, great staff, great cleaning and would recommend 100%!",5,2022,08,15
144,Superb hotel,We stay in London often to visit family and after over 10 years staying at another hotel with a heavy heart we decided to change.  Our usual hotel had real staffing issues and the general maintenance of the rooms was becoming an issue.  We did try to stay loyal post Covid but the impact on our stays became too great.  We found Flemings after a trawl through the internet.  We have now stayed on several occasions and are now happy to call it our London base.  The rooms are luxurious and the staff could not do more for us.  We are greeted by name and nothing is ever too much trouble.  On our most recent stay we had our 3 year old grandson with us for part of the day and this mini guest was made to feel very special.  Cannot recommend Flemings enough. Oh yes and the beds and pillows are so comfortable you may not make it down to the excellent breakfast!!,5,2022,08,10
144,"Excellent Hotel, Fantastic Location","We loved our stay in Flemings 3 bed apartment. Perfect location near tubes, fantastic restaurants and West End stores. A great base for exploring London! Staff are friendly and helpful. Bed was very hard but rest of the apartment felt like home from home so hopefully they change them and at least get some mattress toppers. No parking but there is a Hilton 5 mins away with a garage that has discounted rates for Flemings customers. The apartment itself is super roomy, very beautifully decorated and feels secluded from the hotel but with all the benefits of housekeeping and room service. We loved our stay! ",5,2022,08,09
144,Overnight luxury,"Wife and I stayed for our wedding anniversary and we received a great welcome and were able to check-in early. Room was spotless and all that we needed.  Staff were as helpful and as friendly as any hotel I have stayed in before. Would recommend to anyone as the food, service and location was perfect too.",5,2022,08,08
144,Birthday treat to a swanky London hotel,"What a wonderful
Hotel. Lovely location, great staff, beautiful decor, amazing breakfast, it was a delight stopping there, from entering the main door to check out. The hotel is just two minutes away from Green Park and Buckingham PAlce and very close to Hyde Park and James Park, it for want to get away from the huddle and bustle of traditional London. The back of the ok an area called shepherds market was very quaint with some good traditional pubs and restaurants. Would love to go back again ",5,2022,08,06
144,So well placed to visit London,"This is a lovely friendly hotel. The staff are just lovely, the rooms are well thought out and well lit. The breakfast is always a great way to start the day. Hotel is centrally located for visiting St James Park, Westend shows, restaurants, shopping at Oxford St, Covent Garden or Harrods.",5,2022,08,05
144,Lovely Flemings Mayfair,"Absolutely adored Flemings. Everyone we interacted with was so friendly and warm, especially Operations Manager, Lorena Somera, and Conceirge, Andrew. Always had smiles on their faces and very accommodating. My husband fell in love with their Whiskey Sour from their Manetta's bar. The gym was awesome! Great location too. ",5,2022,08,03
144,"Excellent hotel, superb service good location","this is our 4th time at the Flemings, it says it all!
every stay is enjoyable with staff that friendly and helpful, beautiful rooms, airport transportation.
Breakfast is reach and excellent ! 
and location is just behind the palace ",5,2022,08,02
144,Okay…,"The hotel staff was very friendly at reception, food service and cleaners not so much. My room was originally facing construction site so I asked to change the rooms. I was then given a room next to a “cleaners closet” which meant there was noise 7 / 8 am onwards up until 5-6 pm non stop. The hotel rooms are very small. The breakfast was really good.",3,2022,07,30
144,A wonderful stay at the Flemings.,"My experience at Flemings was great. One of the staff members, Lorena, recently started work there which is why I chose to stay, her customer care and service goes beyond what you would expect. Stephanie checked me in and made me feel very welcome. Sebastian and Elena provided friendly and efficient service in the bar. We had a taster menu at the hotel, and the restaurant manager Lorenzo went above and beyond.",5,2022,07,28
144,Lovely traditional hotel,"If you're looking to experience a hotel in the best English tradition, this is one of the finest examples in London. Built across the interior of several Georgian townhouses, there are often one or two steps along the hallways, and the rooms are on a European scale (smaller than the American style), but they are consistently lovely and have all the modern conveniences. Plus a very gracious and helpful staff. And a superb location just outside Green Park and in the heart of the Mayfair-Piccadilly-Bond Street district.  ",5,2022,07,27
144,Excellent Service,"My family and I had an opportunity to stay at this beautiful hotel during summer break and it was beyond our imagination! We loved everything about it from the interior design to the service their staff has provided. We were taken care of by their operations manager Lorena who was a dream to have and asset to the hotel. From the moment we reserved our dates, we knew we are in good hands. We’d like to thank her for her exceptional service along with Andrew Sturge who took care of our airport transfer which was planned seamlessly.

Our room was immaculate and the amenities are impressive! We loved everything about it and cannot wait for our next holiday as our stay here made our experience extra special!",5,2022,07,23
144,Amazing Hospitality & Service,"Recently, I organised a 2 day business event, which was fantastically co-ordinated with the assistance of Vladislav and Lorena from the Flemings events management team. 
The event was executed seamlessly, with A LOT of praise from the attendees.
THANK YOU VLADISLAV & LORENA !!!",5,2022,07,19
144,Very good,"nothing to say, everything is perfect, the only thing to be solved is the bad smell at the hotel entrance.        allow me to suggest.  the location is unique and very comfortable.  another thing when the doors of the rooms are closed you can hear a lot                             ",5,2022,07,14
144,Lovely boutique hotel,"Wonderfully kind and attentive staff. Lorena, the operations manager, greeted us everyday and made sure we had everything we needed. We had an apartment for our family of 5 and it was great. The location is perfect and I would stay here again.",5,2022,07,13
144,Lovely home away from home,"The Flemings Mayfair is a lovely hotel with a top notch staff!  Our room was exactly as pictured, well appointed, quiet and comfortable.  The hotel is beautiful, but the staff make you feel as if you are home. No request was to difficult and each person there made our stay delightful!",5,2022,07,12
144,Absolutely wonderful,"Had such a wonderful stay at Flemings. All staff was welcoming, warm and extremely professional. They were very attentive and made you feel at home. The operations manager, Lorena, was so sweet and kind. She made sure me and my mother had everything we needed. She continuously checked up on us and made sure everything was up to standard. 

Breakfast was so delicious. I highly recommend the eggs Benedict and the scrambled eggs on toast with salmon. The Ormer restaurant was such an experience. The food was so different and unique. 

The bed was extremely comfortable. Room was very cosy and had plenty of space to store clothes and suitcases. Bathroom was super clean. Shower was very good and had great water pressure.",5,2022,07,11
144,Very enjoyable stay,"This is a really comfortable and clean hotel in a fantastic location, approx 3 min walk to Green Park, 15 mins to Bond Street.
If I was being critical I would say it would have been a nice touch to have some biscuits in the room , lots of Green tea but could have done with other varieties
We only received 1 small shower gel between 2 of us, would have been nice if 2 had been left, we did ask reception for another one, and they did provide this  .
Bread and bagel's at breakfast were bit hard and dry, breakfast was expensive for what it is.
Reception staff who checked us in and out were ok could have been bit more friendly, tried to charge us extra for a full English breakfast when we only had continental, but this was quickly resolved 
Overall I would stay again and recommend to others .",4,2022,07,11
144,Smallest room ever - misrepresentation on booking.com,"Smallest rooms when compared to booking.com I was most disappointed and felt short changed. I have never been in such a small room. No space whilst it was a double. Yes rooms might vary but not to this degree. This was total misrepresentation by booking.com
",1,2022,07,11
144,My stay,"It was such a lovely stay, and the hotel is in one of the most beautiful and central neighborhoods in London.  Would definitely recommend to anyone.  The staff was some of the nicest people in hospitality I have ever had the pleasure of meeting. ",5,2022,07,11
144,Fabulous stay,We have just spent 4 wonderful days at Flemmings in Half Moon Street London.  We are frequent visitors to London but this is our first time at Flemmings but certainly not the last. The hotel was very comfortable and with all the attributes of a 5 star establishment. However the staff members were absolutely wonderful - at all levels - nothing was too much trouble. It is difficult to mention anyone in particular as they were all so helpful and professional however Lorena really went way out her way to assist us with a problem. Thank you for a great few days and we will certainly be back,5,2022,07,11
144,Our London Visit,"Flemings Mayfair is a lovely small boutique hotel in the convenient and wonderful Mayfair neighborhood.
The staff, especially the concierges, was excellent. For us the rooms were small but well appointed. ",4,2022,07,10
144,London at its very best!,"Our Experience from the initial booking process to check out was truly exceptional. Everything about this quintessential London hotel oozes class. The rooms are stunning with every amenity you could wish for, pure quality. The location couldn’t be better, you are right in the heart of everything, yet once you walk through the stunning entrance you feel a sense of peace. Breakfast was excellent also! I can’t think of one thing that could be improved on. Thank you to the Flemings team for making our stay a truly magical one. We cannot wait until our next visit.",5,2022,07,08
144,Nice boutique hotel,I love the location as it’s 5 mins walk from Green Park. The room was small like all hotel rooms in London. I didn’t like the fact that there is a drop down when you first enter the room so I would always stumble in. I can also hear the tube train going past. I love the bathroom as it has heated floors and a very very strong shower. The soap and shampoo provided was very fragrant as well. Overall a nice boutique hotel.,4,2022,07,08
144,Disappointing,"Service from reception was poor. Checked in early, left bags and was promised a call when room was ready. Not forthcoming but when returned was told we should have called them. 

Water in shower (suite room) was cold. 

On departure a text to station was booked. 25 minutes and several taxis later we were told that other guests had stolen our taxis. Concierge had to go down the street to flag down a taxi. We nearly missed our train. 

Supposed to be a relaxing break. ",2,2022,07,05
144,Our home away from home,Great stay as always ! Thank you to Henrik and his entire team for making us feel at home ! We love this hotel for its location and its super friendly staff ! We will be back in September/October if you still have places for us :) Alexis B.,5,2022,07,04
144,Perfect location!,"We visited London and the countryside about 100km around it during a vacation in late June.  Our travel agent had recommended Fleming’s Mayfair and the location was absolutely perfect for our visit.  Our room was small (as you’d expect in London) but stylish and immaculate.  We enjoyed our morning breakfasts, the fun bar and the fabulous high-end restaurant.  Love to come back.",5,2022,07,03
144,Top Hotel,"We stayed at Flemings Mayfair last week for a 5 night stay, this was our first visit to Flemings and were both impressed with every aspect of this Hotel, great location, very stylish rooms and extremely helpful professional staff.
Particularly enjoyed the beautiful cocktail bar on the lower ground floor, the Spanish waitress provided freindly efficient service, excellent !",4,2022,07,03
144,Fantastic location! Would definitely stay here again!,"Perfect location! We were able to walk to many sights including Buckingham Palace, Green Park, Big Ben, London Eye, Chinatown, Shopping, etc.  The tube stop is just a quick walk from the hotel as well. Rooms are clean and comfortable.  The breakfast was fabulous.  We loved our stay!",5,2022,07,02
144,Bad customer service,"Planning to stay here in August. Front desk person was nice until I was transferred to reservation desk and talked to Tracy. Somehow they didn’t find my reservation which I have a confirmation number. Tracy was impatient to listen to my questions, cut me off several times and repeatedly told me the same thing “call your agency!”",2,2022,07,01
144,Great location! Outstanding service!,"A very convenient location, easy walk to Buckingham Palace, Green Park, Westminster, Big Ben, The Eye.  One block away from the underground station to get wherever you need to go.  Hotel rooms are well appointed, nice modern bathrooms, plenty of charging outlets in the room.  Staff was outstanding!  Breakfast is very nice.  Definitely the place to stay in London!",5,2022,06,30
144,"Fabulous Place, wonderful staff","I invited my wife and my parents to Mayfair and booked 2x one bedroom suites and they where fantastic. Fantastic staff and a superb 8 course dinner at Ormer Mayfair. You should not expect a fantastic view from the rooms, but the area between green park and hide park is great. Highly recommendable.",5,2022,06,29
144,Low services and room doesn’t match those in the pictures,"1- maintenance and staff team knock and enter our room anytime although we put the “don’t disturb” sign - no privacy.
2- clean service is not complete, they don’t change bed sheets and bathrobes unless we ask for.
3- the room doesn’t match those in the website pics. 
4- very low sound proof - we can hear all maintanance activities in the floor. ",1,2022,06,26
144,In London for a sales event,"WE stayed at the Fleming Mayfair and we had a fabulous experience. The staff is super nice and helpful, the breakfast is great as well the bar service in the evening. The Concierge helped us with transfers and booking a dinner out. Congrats to all the staff and the management. A very nice address in the earth of London. ",5,2022,06,26
144,Great Service and Value,"Fantastic service, best check in and out experience I have had as had some issues with work and had to make some last minute changes which we were able to handle with no problems.  really good decorations.  Best front",5,2022,06,25
144,Excellent staff,"A lovely hotel in central London, with exemplary service and excellent facilities. Very yummy breakfast too. We have stayed there several times before and doubtless will again.  Would certainly recommend Flemings.",5,2022,06,23
144,Anniversary long weekend,"Fabulous top to bottom.  

Great location, beautiful interior and fantastic staff.

Room was very nice, if a little tight for space (nowhere really to store suitcase) and the aircon wasn't quite as efficient as the hottest day of the year demanded but it was a very comfortable experience nonetheless.

Dining at Ormer was an absolute delight - food and service were exquisite. Lorenzo and Sergi looked after us immaculately despite us starting late and not finishing until past midnight.",5,2022,06,22
144,A lovely small boutique hotel in Mayfair,"A lovely small boutique hotel located in Mayfair near many fine restaurants and shops. The staff and services were impeccable. At all times, everyone was warm and engaging. We look forward to a stay when we return to London.",5,2022,06,19

My stay will definitely be staying again , Breakfast was amazing . Staff very friendly and helpful at all times bed very comfortable shower very powerful. Just a amazing stay ",5,2022,06,17
144,Perfection in Mayfair,"The Flemings was like staying at the best private members club. As soon as I arrived outside its discreet doors, I was lucky to be greeted by Ms Lorena Somera, the Operations Manager. This executive has the gift of true hospitality from a bygone age. She radiates warmth, care and sophistication. She addresses all guests by name making it clear all are special to her.  Lorena escorted me to my room and after learning I preferred feather pillows, ordered them from housekeeping. They were delivered in 5 minutes! Incredible service! Lorena was found all over the hotel radiating her magic and making sure the place ran smoothly. My room was beautifully furnished and cleaned to perfection. The hotel's housekeeping must work very hard. The public areas, bar, restaurant, even the corridors -- all pristine. This was a joy to see! Andrew, the Head Concierge was very helpful and witty. The Flemings offers a delicious buffet breakfast with healthy and decedent options as well as an extensive a la carte menu. The breakfast team was wonderful  -- to be greeted each morning with smiles was lovely. The attention to detail throughout breakfast was commendable. To top it all, Mr. Henrik Muehle, the Managing Director, an exceptional talent in the hotel industry met me on a few occasions to ask how my stay was. He was so charming and made me feel very welcome. The Flemings is a jewel and it’s clear Mr Muehle runs it to perfection. This is certainly my new home in London.",5,2022,06,13
144,Our favorite hotel in London!,"Wow! Fantastic, yet tucked-away location. Incredible design. Super comfortable. Lorena, the Operations Manger, is the best in the business and is the perfect host and fixes any bits (England is having service issues across the board). Love Natalie who runs breakfast beautifully. A hotel where they really care and remember your name. Loved Jude, the valet. We have been lucky enough to stay at most every London hotel--the Ritz, Claridges, Connaught, Firmdale--and I would stay here hands down. Beautiful value, too!",5,2022,06,03
144,Great hotel in a fabulous location,Booked this hotel on the basis of previous stays pre-covid. It did not disappoint. Friendly staff and a fabulous location just a few seconds walk from Shepherds Market with its plethora of restaurants and pubs. Room although compact was very comfortable.,5,2022,05,31
144,Stay in Mayfair,"Flemings Mayfair is a great, historic luxury hotel located in an upscale neighborhood of London.  The accommodations and staff are top-notch and they go out of their way to make your stay a wonderful experience.",5,2022,05,30
144,Best hotel in Mayfair,"It was amazing stay at Flamings, it was my first visit and Aman was really helpful in finding out all the way out.
Rooms are washrooms were perfectly cleaned.
One should stay and enjoy the visit in London",5,2022,05,28
144,Excellent location and comfortable hotel,"I stayed three nights at the hotel for a business and personal trip in May 2022. The room I bought and stayed in for the second two nights was excellent. Great value for money, upgraded and very nice standard. The first night room I received was in the Annex of the hotel and not upgraded nor at the standard that I have booked. Recommend that when you book this hotel that you enquire with the front desk if your room is in the main hotel or in the Annex. You should insist on the main hotel.",4,2022,05,28
144,Overnight stay,"Perfect place to stop.
Easy to get to tubes and center of London.
Staff were more than happy to do anything to make the stop over perfect
The bar was very comfortable and had a great range of choices.
The concierge was superb in his knowledge and helped us with questions",5,2022,05,23
144,Perfect Stay at Flemings Mayfair,"We just spent nine nights in a 1-bedroom suite at Flemings Mayfair. Although suites are not inexpensive they are by far the best value for stays of more than a few nights, Flemings location in Mayfair is excellent, near Knightsbridge, Kensington, Piccadilly and the West End. It is luxurious but understated. The public rooms are attractive but not ostentatious. The vast majority of your time is spent in your room, and our room was perfect. A large bedroom with an enormous bathroom (shower, bathtub, heated towel racks and underfloor heating), a second half-bath, large living room with sofa and chairs, a full dining table and chairs and a compact but very modern kitchen with full-size fridge, freezer, dishwasher, full-size oven and microwave, toaster, coffee maker and combined clothes washer/dryer. Very well decorated and everything in perfect working order. The amount you can save preparing your own breakfast, lunches and dinners makes up most of the cost difference from a regular hotel room. There is a Marks and Spencer food market two blocks away with a huge range of prepared items and the Green Park Tube is one block away. We will definitely stay there again. A rare gem!",5,2022,05,18
144,2 Day Stay,"Excellent Hotel. Great Location. Excellent Service. Would thoroughly recommend this hotel for its location just off Piccadilly, close to the tube and a short walk from Oxford St, Bond St, Regent St and Soho.",5,2022,05,17
144,Amazing Botique Hotel,"Amazing little boutique hotel in the heart of Mayfair.  Walking distance to everything.  Unique family run restaurants, pubs are great in the area.  The Amazing staff at this hotel are just incredible.  This is a must book hotel when visiting London.  ",5,2022,05,11
144,Nice place extremely well located,"Extremely well located (north of Green Park) small luxury hotel. Very friendly staff. We took a 3 bedroom apartment which was great and a real good value for money : for the price of 2 classical rooms in any hotel of this category, you have a spacious two stairs apartment perfect for a family. Only disappointment the room service, poor choice that could be improved. But great place overall, very nice staff and good efficient concierge.",5,2022,05,06
144,What can I say,"Quite possibly the most accommodating hotel I have ever used, globally,  for a business event. All of the staff are excellent and you never have to search for assistance however Colin & Vlad go above and beyond to service their clients. 
Location is excellent, food is impeccable , service is omnipresent whilst remaining unobstrusive. I was in two minds about writing a review as am not sure I want anyone else to discover this gem! 
Have frequented numerous times for business purposes and I cannot wait to visit in my personal time.
The communal areas are all different with exquisite decor. After 5 visits I only just discovered the 'hidden' bar ! 
It seems there is something new at every visit !",5,2022,05,05
144,Lovely friendly hotel,"We recently stayed at Flemings Mayfair and found the staff extremely friendly.  They made us feel very welcome.  We had a problem with one of the TVs in our studio suite not working and as they were unable to fix it we were moved.  Help was given so that the move was easy and when we got to the new room we were amazed to find we had been upgraded to a wonderful suite, complete with kitchen and 2 bathrooms.  We are looking forward to returning soon.",5,2022,05,05
144,Nice Boutique Hotel,"Lovely hotel, very pleasant room, very friendly staff. Great Mayfair location, easy access to transportation, dining, shopping, sightseeing. We were first given a room on the ground floor which i asked to change, and was much happier with the second room on a higher floor. I would definitely stay here again.",4,2022,05,04
144,A lovely place to visit,"Charming and quiet and beautifully located, Fleming hotel met my requirements exactly.  I highly recommend it and will gladly return.  Just steps away from Green Park and Shepherd Market is just around the corner.",5,2022,04,29
144,Best kept secret in London,"We just had a two night stay at Flemings. It was our first visit. 
The location is excellent, just off Berkley Square and 100 yds. from Piccadilly Rd
Rooms are spacious and comfortable. Service throughout the hotel is first class. The staff are very friendly and helpful. Super comfy bed, terrific breakfast. Couldn't ask for more really.",5,2022,04,28
144,"A well located, excellent boutique hotel.","Great experience, all in all a recommended stay.
The staff are helpful, polite and friendly. This hotel has really got service right.

I stayed in room 71 which was at ground level. While you can hear the trains passing in the nearby tube station this was a very low level background noise (more of a rumble), and not disturbing in the least. Really good windows kept any street noise out as well.

The bed was really comfortable and I slept very well and the rest of the room facilities were well designed and the room was nicely decorated.

We used a small conference room while staying here which was well appointed with good AV facilities and friendly staff that kept the coffee flowing.

The only negative was a leaking shower (water flowing under the glass partition over the bath lip and onto the floor). This is a design fault and needs to addressed properly. 
",4,2022,04,25
144,5 Star Plus,"We  had a wonderful experience at the Flemings all be it a very short stay. Every staff member I encountered, from the doorman to the check- in to the cleaning staff were delightful and eager to help!  The Head  Concierge service was outstanding.  

An excellent property in an amazing location walking distance to Green Park and Bond Street. Front desk staff are extremely efficient, pleasant and helpful. The property shows great examples of 1st class housekeeping. The property has a fantastic old time charm with a touch of modern class.

Breakfast was amazing  the breakfast hostess goes out of her way to welcome and spend time with each table.

We will be back

Thankyou",5,2022,04,24
144,Cute Boutique,"Nicely located on the outskirts of Mayfair, really discretely placed hotel which you struggle to locate the frontage entrance to.

Just a really cute small hotel - we had a small room, off a side street but well glazed so  hardly any noise and a great nights sleep.  Good bedding, clean, great quality decor, lovely friendly normal staff, non stuff.

Breakfast well equipped and of an excellent quality.  

Hotel for the discerning customer.",4,2022,04,24
144,Amazing staff and superb service,"Upon arrival we were made yo feel so welcome and nothing was too much trouble. The reception staff were so kind and helpful, they made a point of talking to my grandchildren every time we were in reception, they felt very special. The room was very clean and was immaculate when we returned back in the evening. The concierge gave us very good advice which I was very grateful for. Thank you for making our stay so special.",5,2022,04,18
144,Great location and friendly staff,"Lovely little hotel. Just off main road in Mayfair, very friendly staff. Dinner in the restaurant was outstanding. Living in the middle of the Countryside we did find the room a little noisy, but I’m sure there are quieter ones and I’d ask for one next time. Perfect location for Green Park and The Ritz! We’ll be back….",5,2022,04,18
144,A wonderful experience at Flemings Mayfair a hotel with a very kindly staff and at the best location,"Very close to and within walking distance to all sights such as London Eye, Buckingham, Hyde Park, Kensington Palace, Oxford street and the hop on hop off buses. The parks nearby are amazing. A stay in London at a hotel like Flemings Mayfair must be experienced",5,2022,04,18
144,Lovely discrete hotel,"very discrete very convenient rooms high quality bathrooms wonderful staff very friendly the cocktail bar must be one of the best in London front of house attentive and very efficient . Must be one of Londons best kept secrets.

",5,2022,04,16
144,Friendly Faces and Perfect Shower Pressure,"The Flemings Mayfair was better than I could have expected. My room was small, but it's to be expected from an older building, but it was perfect for me being alone and the accommodations had everything I could need. I have been to many hotels with waterfall style shower heads, but the ones at this location were superb compared to many of the others I've experienced. Perfect water pressure and was greeted to a heated bathroom floor every time. ",5,2022,04,14
144,Disappointed,"The positives which is why we rated it 2 
Staff excellent customer service 
Food exceptional tasting menu but it did cost £85pp
Negatives 
TV didn’t work
Kettle was broken 
Cold room heating needed attention 
5 hours to receive t bags & milk
Our room 216 next to corridor door kept banging which made our room shake it was horrendous and we didn’t sleep 
When you pay almost £800 you expect a nights sleep 
The staff were apologetic and didn’t charge us for the soft drinks we had and didn’t charge us for the service charge which is charged on top of the room rate!",2,2022,04,07
144,A 5 Star Experience,A super luxurious stay from start to finish . Excellent service from all staff with particular mention to those in the Ormer Restaurant where we had a fabulous meal. Super cocktails in the bar too . Great location for exploring . ,5,2022,04,01
144,Great hotel and so central,"The staff at Flemings are always so friendly, nothing is too much trouble. The rooms are spacious and well designed with excellent lighting. It’s quiet and a good nights sleep is guaranteed. It’s our go to London base. ",5,2022,03,30
144,Well located,"Rooms and guest services correspond to the expectations. Ideally located in Central London, close to the tube and other facilities. Although not visited during our recent stay, the restaurant is nevertheless still recommended.",5,2022,03,28
144,Excellent hotel,"Celebrating my husbands 60th birthday planned a surprise stay at Flemings.  Front desk staff were exceptional as well as the luggage Porter.  We stayed in a junior suite which was perfectly designed and provided enough space and facilities.  Complimentary bottle of Prosecco and balloon in the room was a lovely touch.
Manetta’s bar is a must to visit the team were really friendly and helpful.
Only downside was breakfast with the wrong information held by the restaurant that didn’t note we’d pre-paid full English breakfast which resulted in being charged twice for this even though explaining to the breakfast team I had already paid.  Need to just ensure this is rectified going forwards as not best service and the reason for my score of average on service.
Overall though excellent hotel and would recommend.",5,2022,03,20
144,Our home abroad,We love the Fleming’s Mayfair. We have been staying here for over ten years and we can’t wait to come back. The staff is amazing and the service is unbeatable. We have stayed 3 different times in the last year and are looking forward to coming back soon. The beds are very comfortable and the food and bar service is amazing. Wait till you have the eggs Benedict for breakfast. It’s the best!,5,2022,03,16
144,Stunning hotel,This is a wonderful place to stay!!!!  Me and my hubby just spent two nights here and I cannot recommend the hotel enough!  I am a VERY light sleeper and the first night I could hear road noise and didn't sleep well......I mentioned this to reception and they sorted out moving us to a very quiet room (Junior Suite 70) where I slept like a baby!  Cannot wait to return!,5,2022,03,08
144,Another Fantastic Stay at the Fleming,"This was the second time I've stayed at the Fleming in the last few months, the staff kindly left us some chocolate biscuits in our room to say welcome back. The hotels location is prefect for shopping and eating out, although the hotel does have a fantastic restaurant we didn't eat there this time.

Staff and the reception were fantastic as always, very welcoming and incredible helpful. The hotel has a lovely bar with very helpful staff and a small selection of bar snacks.

On this occasion I booked through booking.com, the room was discounted but felt smaller than when I stayed previously and booked direct with the hotel. The quality of the beds and feel of the sheets is fantastic and we always have a good nights sleep. 

The only negative point I would say about the hotel is the cost of the breakfast, £28.00 for a full English, don't get me wrong it was very tasty but a bit steep.

We like the hotel so much we're booked to stay for 3 nights in August when we're getting married.",5,2022,03,07
144,Nice stay but very small room.,"Overall a beautiful hotel but we left feeling extremely hard done by for the price we paid for a really special occasion and such a tiny room. Great location yes, great bar and restaurant yes but sadly all we will remember is how small our room was and not wanting to spend any time there.
We work hard to do things like this and I wish we’d realised in advance. 
The staff in the bar were wonderful and I’d go back like a shot. Such a shame our memory is of the tiny room!

144,Top service and hospitality,"Service by staff and cleaniless was excellent. The room was very good, good internet connection, proximity to areas like Buckingham Palace, Big Ben, Hyde Park, Westminister. You can also walk easily to good shopping areas, like Oxford Street and Saville Row. ",5,2022,02,28
144,Good location,"The hotel is in an easy location and has been furnished well. 

The comfort and size of the bed along with the quality of the sheets and noise from Road outside made for the worst sleep I’ve experienced in a London hotel in recent years. ",3,2022,02,28
144,Flemings  Feb 2022,"This was a business trip and its the second time I have stayed here.  Great hotel, lovely location, great decor.  Excellent beds.  Friendly service.  I always choose this hotel 
when I am staying in London on business.

144,Flemings a little surprise,"Great convenient and fair cost lending hotel Flemings. Half Moon street 
Great modern bathroom. Kept clean. Fantastic friendly and helpful staff. Fair pricing. Lacks walk-in shower - it’s in bath, but it does have a little sitting area in the room.",5,2022,02,27
144,Short break,Our short stay here was excellent. The staff could not have been nicer . Very helpful at reception bar and at breakfast. We will definitely be back. We never ate in restaurant but it looked lovely and a nice atmosphere ,5,2022,02,23
144,Valentine weekend in Mayfair,"Nice Art Deco Hotel very well located.
Very helpful and professional team.
Clean and cosy as you wait for a small luxury hotel.
Quiet even if you’re in the center of London, Quiet too because very good isolation between rooms…very important especially when you come for a Valentine week-end :)
Will be back !",5,2022,02,16
144,Weekend in Mayfair,"Had a wonderful stay at Flemings in Half Moon Street.  The room was beautiful, the breakfast excellent. Flemings is a stunning hotel in the heart of Mayfair, stylishly decorated and offers every comfort you could ask for. I would add that all the staff were genuinely friendly and helpful and are an absolute credit to the hotel. We will definitely stay again. Thanks for a wonderful weekend.",5,2022,02,13
144,Wonderful stay and trip,"I travel to london for work every month and normally like to try a new hotel every time. I have done this for the last few years. 

But this is the first time I have liked a hotel so much that I am repeat booking in the same hotel for my next few trips. Such a handy and convenient location and such lovely staff!",5,2022,02,07
144,Excellent stay,Loved everything about this hotel and our stay except for the beds! They are just very hard und uncomfortable! But the hotel in itself was beautiful and clean and the staff are just very friendly and go above and beyond!,5,2022,02,07
144,Quality All the Way!,"We stayed here after a fabulous lunch at Ormer. Sara on the front desk was absolutely outstanding and could not have been more helpful. The room was well appointed with an extremely comfy bed. The breakfast was excellent. Thanks Sara, we will be back!",5,2022,02,06

144,Flemings,Absolutely love this hotel - Beautiful fit out internally - exceptionally clean. Would highly recommend. Fantastic bar in the basement. Wonderful location for the West End. Staff were very warm and friendly. ,5,2022,01,25
144,If only there were six stars,"Flemings Mayfair is the ideal hotel:  entirely comfortable and incredibly quiet yet ideally situated within steps of busy Piccadilly Street with easy access everywhere.  Buckingham Palace is a short stroll away to the south with all the great shops of New Bond and Oxford Streets are just to the north.  Green Park Tube stop is mere blocks away, to whisk you anywhere.  The hotel's elegance, with custom furnishings and uniquely shaped rooms (no cookie cutters) inside buildings that are centuries old, is only exceeded by the outstandingly helpful staff.  There is absolutely nothing they can't arrange.  I was there recently and needed the dreaded Covid tests but they arranged them at my convenience and simply added the cost to my hotel bill:  a priceless saving of time and aggravation for me.  (Especially considering how difficult it has become to find those in the U.K.)  I was thus able to go to all the museums I wanted to see, dine out, shop and generally have a thoroughly enjoyable time despite the global pandemic.  Delightfully personable staff added a lot to my enjoyment of my visit.  Highest recommendation possible.",5,2022,01,06
144,Great location and hotel,"Recently stayed at Flemings Mayfair hotel with family. Most hotels in the area are not so child friendly however, at Flemings Mayfair my five year old son was made to feel very welcome and so was the rest of my family.
It has a great bar and breakfast, can’t comment on the restaurant as we did not use it. The rooms are nice and well equipped, the lower floors can hear the underground trains on occasion and maybe the only issue.  Location is great and only 5 mins walk from Bond Street or Buckingham palace.
 
Would recommend this hotel to others and will be coming back soon.",5,2022,01,05
144,Great staff at Flemings Hotel,"Front desk staff were very helpful, especially Sara who went the extra mile for us. We got an upgrade and were given room 207 which was a good size with loads of light. 
 Breakfast staff and porters were also very nice and polite.",5,2022,01,04
144,Great experience,"I visit london approximately twice a year if not more & I’ve stayed in many hotels during the years. But this hotel was my favorite.

144,My favourite in London.,"I love this hotel, so much so that I'd rather no one knew about it, so there'd always be a room for me. 
It's just perfect for my needs. 
Spotless clean all the time, large comfy beds, big bathroom with baths and the nicest staff I've ever come across. 
The location is Perfect as you can walk to Selfridges in 15 minutes. 
I love it here, and wouldn't stay anywhere else in London.",5,2021,12,31

144,Avoid & Book Elsewhere,"Not what you expect from a London hotel. Avoid it. The bath filled, did not empty, heated floor did not work, smell of damp, misrepresentation on the website. Tv did not work, remote did not work. Noise of the lift was disturbing. Tiny room and General Manager is never available. ",1,2021,12,15
144,"Lovely hotel, amazing service!","Will definitely be back soon. Great location, close to tube station. Lovely hotel, rooms and bathrooms. Will be recommending this hotel to other people too. Staff were great and always helpful with any questions. ",5,2021,12,14
144,Ok if you like an early night !!,"On arrival we were so pleased. Looked so nice lovely fella who welcomed us in  Then we met reception. Things went down hill from there. First told the bar wasn’t available as booked out to a  private function!   They should  of told us  before arrival. She said we could still have drinks but only in the drawing room ! Quite bright and stark not good to meet friends for drinks before we went out ! Friends arrived but we felt out of place so we went out to another bar and had a lovely meal. Anyway arrived back at the hotel with friends we thought we could have a night cap seeing as our Christmas  catchup at 23.05 but we’re told  NO  drinks after 11pm   Even for residence ! 

We stay in many hotels and have never been told we can’t have drinks after 11pm. Why ? Says In our room reception 24/7. Perhaps should say they’re available but unable to do anything !! Really annoyed had a lovely time out but end of night really flat ! Our friends needed to get back to their hotel so asked reception  to arrange a taxi to go back to their hotel , that didn’t happen !! so our friends just  left to find one themselves , in the rain ! . Lovely room but service not so good. Shame as in a great convenient area. Won’t be coming back. We thought we had found a gem sadly not …",3,2021,12,09
144,Great Hotel,"Made to feel special - a personal touch
The staff, are extremely attentive and understood our needs.
The location of the hotel is excellent for the West End and is near a tube station for other parts of London.",5,2021,12,09
144,Excellent Hotel,"Highly recommend. Staff very welcoming, knowledgable and friendly. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff to help and assist us . Gorgeous Hotel. Very clean and  comfy. Will be definitely staying  again. ",5,2021,12,08
144,Great location,"We only stayed for one night, quite a small room but what you expect from London. Great location. Hotel and staff were great, only downside was that it must sit over a tube line as we could hear the noise from the tubes in our bedroom.",4,2021,12,08
144,Excellent hotel in great location,"The hotel is situated no more than 5 minutes walk from Green Park tube station in the heart of Mayfair. The staff are very efficient and friendly. The rooms and public areas are spotlessly clean and fitted to a very high standard. The breakfasts are excellent, served in tranquil surroundings. I could not find fault with this hotel. ",5,2021,12,07
144,Such a shame,"Been using the Flemming for 25 ish years have booked most types of rooms over the years it’s gone from being a fabulously welcoming , super smart boutique Hotel to an overpriced, arrogant mess. Sadly it’s time to give up on this former favourite.",1,2021,11,30
144,Mayfair has that certain something!,"I have stayed at Flemings several times for business. Their combination of style, class and quirkiness makes each stay a pleasure as well.  I've used their meeting rooms for executive conferences, their bar for after-hour drinks, room service for quiet evenings working on reports and their breakfast buffet for morning refresh.  Throughout it all, the team members and the services are always personal, professional and I'll say it again, a pleasure! Thank you, all!",5,2021,11,28
144,What a lovely experience,Such an improvement from The Dilly Hotel it is what a hotel and service is meant to be not the dingy rooms or rude management as it is at The Dilly Hotel it was refreshing to have booked and paid and got more than you expected in a hotel stay. ,5,2021,11,27
144,Lovely Hotel and staff,"A lovely Hotel and staff but the facilities are very limited currently. No lunch time restaurant service, the bar closes at 21.00 and no parking or valet parking. charming Hotel and excellent reception personnel.",3,2021,11,25
144,A wonderful two night break staying at Flemings Mayfair,"Flemings is a classy and well run hotel in a great location, just minutes walk from Green Park underground station. 
Our room was very comfortable, beautifully furnished and well equipped with a mini bar, coffee machine, bathrobes, slippers etc. There is a Tesco store just around the corner if you need to pop out to buy anything. 
We stayed on a Friday and Saturday night and unfortunately, there was quite a bit of noise from night time revellers on the street outside as our room was at the front of the hotel facing Half Moon Street. 
The self service cold continental buffet breakfast was included in our room rate and was excellent with a wide selection of quality produce on offer. Despite trying to book in advance of our stay, we were unable to get a diner reservation in the hotel’s restaurant, Ormer, on either night.  
We opted instead for lunch and had 
the eight coarse tasting menu with the wine pairing. It was truly outstanding  in all aspects and we probably had a better, more attentive service than we would have done in the evening. 
We used Manetta’s, the hotel’s beautiful bar on two occasions. We were able to just walk in after lunch but we had to reserve a table in the evening. The service, ambiance and cocktails were all excellent. 
Flemings is at the top end of what I am prepared to pay for a hotel in this area, but as a special treat, it was worth the expense and we felt that we had experienced something quite special. ",5,2021,11,22
144,"Fist class service, excellent food and great location.","This hotel is highly recommended for a visit to London.
The staff are friendly, helpful and attentive.
The location is great to explore the centre of town.

So thank you all for making our staff a real pleasure. ",5,2021,11,09

144,HIDDEN GEM,"Perfect location, fantastic decor, great Michelin star experience and a shower to die for
Had to deduct 1 mark due to stealth charges on check out bill. Would have liked to have been issued with the actual bill as opposed to assuming we were happy to blindly accept
",4,2021,11,02
144,"Amazing stay, best hotel in Mayfair","This was our 4th time of staying at this hotel, with a group of a few friends. This hotel is faultless. 

Apart from the opulent surroundings, the food and drink is out of this world. 

The staff are very attentive, and really go out of  their way to ensure your stay is perfect. 

There was lot of chopping and changing of room requests, and Colin Exton colin@flemings.com he is Director of Marketing and Sales, provided incredible assistance in ensuring we had the best rooms and best packages for our stay. 

The breakfast is incredible!

All ala carte and made to order. Would definitely recommend over the continental option. 

Lunch and cocktails at the bar were also delicious and we just ordered some starters and they were Michelin standard and generous portions. 

Location is perfect, very close to decent bars and restaurants.

You will not be disappointed!",5,2021,11,01
144,Excellent hotel in center of Mayfair!,"Fantastic service from all of the staff - home from home in a business environment 

Fair value in priciest part of London!

Only area I did not give full 5* … the bed had one of those rubber sheets underneath - which made it hot to sleep in ",5,2021,11,01
144,Just lovely!,"For a little luxury in Mayfair there are many high-cost options and we've tried many of them.  We've never tried Flemings before but booked for a celebratory weekend.  

To begin the situation is perfect. Just a few steps from the charming Shepherd Market, right on Piccadilly, across the road from Green Park and two minutes from Bond Street so plenty of options for short walks, high-end shopping and dining in the best area of London.  

The hotel is not super-large and is much better for it.  This is a luxury establishment on a par with the better known names that feels much more intimate and friendly, not in the least corporate and formulaic.  Staff are genuinely welcoming and we were treated superbly with an upgrade to a magnificent Studio Suite. 

We've only just returned home but already we're planning our next visit to Flemings.",5,2021,10,31
144,One of the best in London,"Amazing hotel , beautiful room and decoration, fast and early chick in , perfect location and the most friendly stuff 

We enjoyed our stay and sure Flemings hotel will the our first and only choice for London ( we tried a lot before)

Thank you for everything",5,2021,10,31
144,Belated lockdown 50th,"The lady on reception was extremely rude to us when we arrived back in the evening.  She was on the phone so I asked her colleague if we could go fo a drink in the bar.   She told me to shhuuuush and wagged her hand at me!!!  I’ve submitted a review to the hotel manager, they’ve yet to respond, so I’m wandering if this rude person was the manager?!?  The amount of money we spent for my husband’s belated 50th I expected better.  We will not be returning nor will I recommend to friends ",2,2021,10,28
144,Fancied a change of hotel-But not this one!,"Despite paying the higher rate for the suite, we still did not have a bath, the room was hot and stuffy with no ability to open windows, which resulted in the aircon remaining on all night-(Very uncomfortable nights stay) 
The room was extremely noisy (Ground level suite) with cars passing by all night, plus the rumble of the underground underneath us!!
No valet parking and complicated instructions for getting to the closest, resulting in us being late for our booked meal.
The breakfsat which was included in the room was only for the continental option-Cooked would be extra. So we paid £30 each for cereal, selection of meat/cheese and croissants.
The reception staff were friendly, but when we expressed our complaints, they simply replied...""yeah, it can be noisy"".",2,2021,10,27
144,A very pleasant stay indeed!,"An abundance of courtesy,friendliness,helpfulness,efficiency,professionalism and charm.Room was well appointed and super clean.Bed had the exquisite comfort of a Hastens and the walk in shower was a dream.",5,2021,10,27
144,AMAZING!,"A chic hotel in a great location -  super professional and friendly staff! Quick and efficient at check-in, breakfast or anytime one needs help. They try to know what you need before you know it. My favourite hotel in London. ",5,2021,10,18
144,Fantastic Hotel for a Weekend in London,"Stayed at The Fleming for a few nights with my partner, the location of the hotel is perfect, close to so many bars and restaurants.

We stayed in an Executive Double which was quite large for a central London hotel, the bathroom was lovely and large, the bed was one of the most comfortable I’ve slept in.

The cooked breakfast was lovely, perhaps a little step.

Staff in the hotel were lovely and very helpful, the bar in the basement was always manned, they had a good selection of cocktails, beers, and champagne.

I will most certainly stay at the hotel again.",5,2021,10,18
144,An oasis of calm in the heart of London,"Made to feel like a very special guest from the moment we turned up on the hotel steps until we left. Greeted like we were long lost friends and nothing was too much trouble for anybody there.
There are famous hotels; there are small and friendly hotels and then there is Flemings. 
I’m reluctant to leave a good review as I want to keep the secret and the special service all to my myself!!",5,2021,10,17
144,Great stay!,We have just had a lovely third stay at Flemings. The staff are lovely! Continental breakfast was plentiful and gluten free was no problem. We stayed in an executive room which is nicely furnished and a decent size for London.,5,2021,10,10

 the Hotel is very nice as well !

Always a pleasure to stay here ",5,2021,10,06
144,"Gorgeous hotel, great staff, fantastic location",Loved the hotel. Room was great and the staff made the stay special. The hotel is in a great location. When the hotel found out it was my husbands birthday we returned to biscuits and a balloon. The little touches count!,5,2021,10,04
144,Recent stay,"Spent the weekend in London and this hotel helped make the stay fantastic. Great location. Only 300 yards from Green Park tube but still feels in the middle of Mayfair. Superb staff, very friendly and helpful.",5,2021,10,04
144,Great hotel ideal for Mayfair,"This was our second stay here, the first since the Pandemic. Everything went as well as it did before. The rooms are great quality and the breakfast is excellent. Staff really friendly. Cannot fault it really.",5,2021,10,04
144,Hidden Gem,"We spent 4 nights B&B at this hotel.......Our room must have been the basic room as it was small and we had a small window .....there was no seating area but what we had was nicely furnished and bathroom was extremely clean....Was disappointed in having to make my own bed and clean my bathroom every second day !!!
Lovely breakfast room with ample offered on the continental breakfast table.....Enjoyed sitting in the basement bar/lounge
Had the feeling and ambience of a small hotel ..... Extremely nice staff all wearing face masks",4,2021,10,04
144,Good hotel but very disappointed with restaurant,Very disappointed with dinner in The Omer Restaurant but the rest of the hotel was fine. The room was nice and we were upgraded and the staff were all very friendly. Breakfast in the restaurant was fine. ,3,2021,10,04
144,Excellent,"Great friendly small hotel in a great position and fantastic resturant. Staff very helpful. Room and facilities spotless and stylish. Great position within two minutes walk of Green park tube station, and walking distance of all the sites of central London. Also close to Regent and Bond Street shopping. ",5,2021,09,29
144,London trip,Our friends and us had a very enjoyable stay. This is a lovely well presented hotel in a great location. the staff are very helpful especially Natalie at breakfast and the various doormen who helped us get taxis.,4,2021,09,28
144,Flemings Mayfair Dismissive of COVID Concerns,"I had book a non-refundable hotel room prior to COVID.  Unfortunately, the hotel was closed during the dates I was going to stay.  Flemings Mayfair said it would not refund my money, but would allow me to use the reservation through 2021.  Unfortunately, Americans were not allowed to travel to the UK for leisure travel for most of this period, thus my window to use the reservation was relatively narrow.  When I explained that I had still had health concerns given the spread of variants, and data regarding diminishing effectiveness of some vaccines, the hotel was dismissive and insisted on only honoring the reservation through 2021 and not a date when it is more likely that it will be safe to travel.  So now I’m out $800 because I am not going to travel when I don’t feel safe.  Given this hotel’s attitude towards health concerns and general customer service, I’ll opt for a luxury property that really acts like a luxury property when I next travel to London, instead of one that is just pretending.",1,2021,09,27
144,Worth the money!,"Definitely a hidden gem that I wouldn’t of have found without some research, with amazing service, a quick taxi to anywhere you’d want to go and the bar/restaurant is SO good (cocktails are insane). We’ll be back without a doubt.",5,2021,09,26
144,Great stay.,"Well located hotel in Mayfair, very welcoming and helpful staff. Nicely decorated room which was  well cleaned, and lovely and quiet. The whole hotel was looking well, nice fresh decor. I’d definitely book again.",5,2021,09,23
144,Believe the hype,"This really is a great little gem in the heart of Mayfair. Although not cheap, it feels like great value compared to the competition. Staff go above and beyond. Hotel looks way better in the flesh than the photos online. Would recommend to anyone for an upmarket Mayfair stay that won't leave you feeling hard done by. ",5,2021,09,22
144,London trip.,"Despite the current issues with travel, social distancing and the general problems associated with life today,  all the staff made every effort to make our stay as pleasant and as relaxing as possible. Special thanks to the Breakfast Team who made the start of our day with a welcoming smile.",5,2021,09,20
144,Very special birthday treat at flemmings,"We had a fantastic stay at flemmings the position of the hotel is amazing 5 mins to Buckingham palace 1 min to green park and just 5 mins walk to the main shop and straight outside subway and M&S. the staff couldn’t do enough for us checked us straight in on arrival, we had a gift of chocolates and a bottle of Prosecco gifted for my birthday 🥳 perfect stay ",5,2021,09,19
144,GREAT LOCATION VERY COMFORTABLE HOTEL,"This was our first stay at this establishment. It did not get off to an auspicious start as on arrival the hotel had no record of our reservation which we had made through an online booking agent. We had all the reference numbers etc. and we had paid the agent. This was of course not the fault of the hotel but I was a bit disappointed that, as they had only a suite available, and we had appointments to get to and were in a difficult situation, they refused to give us any discount on the more expensive room. They could see we were completely genuine and the cock-up was the fault of the agent. Not very helpful and one remembers these things. But apart from that our 2 night stay was very enjoyable and I cannot fault the room or the service we received. The location was ideal.",4,2021,09,18
144,Excellent stay,"Great attention to detail. Amazing stay!   Staff were great and very responsive. Rooms immaculate and clean. 

Minetta's bar serves fabulous cocktails and is a lovely space. 

Fantastic bars and restaurants nearby. 

Look forward to staying again.",5,2021,09,15

144,Very stylish in a beautiful area,We spent an amazing time at this cozy hotel. THe staff is very friendly and helpful. THe area is very nice and THe hotel is located very closed to the most beautiful places of interest and the underground station.,5,2021,09,14
144,Wonderful stay,"Staff extremely attentive from the moment we stepped in the doors, the room was gorgeous (studio suite 65) nicest hotel room I’ve ever stayed in. Hotel was in a great location, room was very quiet, so easy to get to sleep as sometimes I find hotels to be too noisy",5,2021,09,14
144,Anniversary Celebration,"The hotel is in a great location and is beautifully decorated. Our bathroom was amazing. The rooms are great value for money for the location. It is a stones throw from Green Park Tube, you are a few minutes walk away from all the shops and Buckingham Palace is just a shiver walk through the park.
We loved this hotel and would stay again.",5,2021,09,13
144,Luxury? I don’t think so.,Feels like hotel struggling after Covid. Continental b’fast poor like an airport hotel. Room serviced only on request & no towels left in the room. Staff seemed to lack training. Great location but not a luxury experience.,2,2021,09,13
144,A wonderful experience,"We stayed at the Fleming Mayfair and booked the 7 course tasting menu including pairing wines in the Ormer restaurant. The food was exquisite, the wine selection delicious and the atmosphere warm and friendly. Our room was well designed and equipped with everything one needs, it was spotlessly clean and the bed was very comfortable. The room was also surprisingly quiet even with the window open. All the members of staff, without exception, are friendly, engaging, thoughtful, efficient and professional and made our trip a memorable experience. We would like to thank them all and will definitely stay again.",5,2021,09,13
144,great stay!,"We really enjoyed our evening with you.  The hotel is brilliantly located and impeccable standards. Breakfast had a huge range of options, staff were very friendly and helpful.  Reception were very well staffed and super pleasant.    ",5,2021,09,13
144,Anniversary studio suite stay,"Fantastic hotel, felt very well looked after from the moment we arrived. Great, helpful and friendly staff. As it was our anniversary we even arrived at our room to a lovely congratulations message and some complimentary chocolates. Facilities in the room were perfect, even down to the white company (Noir) toiletries, my personal favourite, I genuinely couldn’t fault it.  Amazing room, I’d recommend and visit over and over again. ",5,2021,09,09
144,A hidden gem,"We had booked Ormer restaurant for our anniversary dinner, and thought: why not stay the night? So, we booked a last minute room and was able to take advantage of a free upgrade. The room was lovely. Not massive (but this is Mayfair!), but very nicely decorated, modern and clean. The bathroom was particularly nice, and I'm gutted I didn't have time to take a bath in the HUGE bathtub! The bed was very comfortable and we had an excellent night's sleep. Our rate included 'continental breakfast' so just be aware that you have to pay a surcharge for anything cooked, or just check which breakfast is included in your rate. Breakfast was delicious, with the staff very attentive and the coffee excellent.",5,2021,09,08
144,Very disappointed on my 4th visit," I was saddened to see several efficiency schemes have been implemented which really impacted on the quality of our stay. The upgraded deluxe room was really small And was only serviced every two days. This meant we only had two English breakfast tea bags and a couple of milks on our tea tray, the dirty cups and water glasses were not removed. We only had one small shower gel and shampoo between us for two days. Even the toilet rolls were very poor quality. The doorman at the front of the hotel has been removed. Such a shame ",3,2021,09,07
144,Birthday visit,This was a stay to celebrate a special birthday and the hotel made us very welcome and even provided a small gift and a balloon in our room. We couldn’t have asked for better treatment. All the staff were very efficient and friendly  ,5,2021,09,07
144,Expected a higher standard of luxury,"Average for a 5 star hotel, lacking in wow factor. Great staff, helpful and friendly. Tasty cooked breakfast. Continental breakfast quality was good but selection substandard for a luxury 5 star hotel in Mayfair. Awful pillows, rock hard and too bulky.",3,2021,09,05
144,Great stay!,Very recommendable hotel. The staff were very professional. Check -in and check-out was handled very quickly. Beautiful rooms with nice details and great interior design. The rooms were well equipped and the bathroom excellent.,5,2021,09,03
144,"Wonderful room, location, service - no soundproofing = no sleep","Really good location, lovely decor room and good size bathroom (for London!) however there was absolutely no sound proofing in the room and that lead to an incredibly sleepless night as we were subjected to very noisy neighbours. Quite upsetting and spoilt what was had been a lovely day in London. ",2,2021,09,01
144,Flemings Review,"Great hotel and staff ,in an excellent location. Came to a wedding in Mayfair and know the area well. Room was a little on the small side but a lot of London hotels are. Clean, comfortable bed and great breakfast. ",4,2021,08,30

144,Excellent,"The only let down was that the hotel bar closed by 11pm - we had returned for a night cap at 1045 and the bar was closing up. Also there was no room service so the drinks available were what was in the mini bar: wine, beer and soft drinks. I feel we should have been told about this at check in. I have still given 5 stars as this was just a niggle of ours.",5,2021,08,30
144,Well equipped rooms,"The rooms were well equipped, and the bathroom and showers excellent.  Good facilities in the room, good electric socket distribution, mirrors etc.  The mattress was too hard for us, and the bedding was made of synthetic materials and we do prefer feather pillows and duvets - a personal preference.",4,2021,08,29
144,Excellent,"Spent a lovely night at this hotel with our two grown up sons.  Our youngest was celebrating his 21st and the hotel gave him a bottle of champagne.  All the staff are super friendly and housekeeping keep the hotel very clean.

We look forward to being regular customers",5,2021,08,26
144,Central High Quality Hotel,"A hotel full of tasteful high quality tailor made interior design, well balanced with the high quality of service and staff at the hotel. Located in the posh Maifair district, right next to Green Park, Buckingham, wealth of restaurants and other high quality hotels, its a place to recommend to visitors seeking for a quality stay. Food selection is quality before quantity, and I like that. Rather few things, but really quality well prepared things on the menu.",5,2021,08,23
144,Another great stay at Flemings,"We have stayed here several times and love the style and feel of the hotel. The staff are great and attentive, the bar is stylish and great to spend a few hours in. We would recommend to Flemings to anyone staying in this area of London.",5,2021,08,23
144,Amazing stay at an amazing hotel,"The team at Flemings Mayfair are really warm and welcoming, we had a lovely stay at this hotel, from the complimentary room upgrade, to the super comfy bed in a beautifully designed room and the lovely continental breakfast, we couldn't fault the hotel or its amazing team in anyway.

144,Amazing night at an amazing hotel.,"We had a really lovely stay at Flemings Mayfair on Saturday night, the staff are so warm and welcoming and we got a complimentary upgrade on our booked room which was a beautiful room with a super comfy bed.
Definitely recommend a stay at Flemings for anyone looking to stay in London, situated in a perfect location, easy walking distance to Green Park station and lots of lovely bars and restaurants in the area.
We had the continental breakfast in the morning which was lovely and plentiful, will definitely be coming back for a longer stay next time.
Thank you to the Flemings Mayfair team for making our stay so wonderful :)",5,2021,08,23

144,"Wonderful stay,,","in this beautiful hotel, with fabulous staff (reception and concierge) who made us so welcome. Nothing was too much trouble for them.  Stayed in a gorgeous room with amazing attention to detail. The Bar was welcoming with the most lovely cocktails.  This trip was a birthday treat from my best friend - we are both Londoners, but had the best time being tourists for a couple of days in this gem of a hotel, in a superb location, in the best City. Thank you Flemings- it's been magic.",5,2021,08,21

144,Personal 5 star experience,"This is a lovely boutique hotel…5 star rooms in a sophisticated setting. It’s not ostentatious and it doesn’t have a big corporate or plush 5 star in your face feel. It’s charm and luxury are more subtle yet sink in around you to make you feel more at home than away. Awesome location, not right on the main drag when you step outside. Staff were lovely as was breakfast….we’d definitely return the next time we can get a babysitter!!",5,2021,08,08
144,Superb,We stayed at Flemings for the first time this August. What a fabulous hotel with the friendliest staff. We scored it 11 out of 10. On the basis of our experience we booked again to come back in October. A real home from home. ,5,2021,08,06
144,"Mostly exceptional service, great location for luxury shopping","Stayed with my partner for his birthday. I was able to arrange some room decorations which was appreciated and we were gifted a bottle of prosecco on arrival. This was above and beyond what we expected.

The Junior Suite (70) was decorated to a high standard with art deco features but all the mod cons. It was a warm weekend so the in room air conditioning was marvelous.

The suite was on the ground floor at the rear, unfortunately (and totally outside of the hotel's control) people at street level were often smoking outside of our window. This gave the room a mild smell of cigarette smoke.....which admittedly I am very bothered by. 

Breakfast was included in our package and was really the only thing that I was slightly disappointed by. It seemed chaotic and despite have 4 or 5 staff waiting on 4 or 5 occupied tables it took ages to get a drink and also the correct  order. The one day O had a cooked breakfast (eggs benedict which Inhad been dreaming about as its my favourite) it was served barely warm in a plate that was cool to the touch. *Sad face* my partner had the full English one day that he really enjoyed. 

All of the luxury shops on Old Bond Street (YSL, Chanel, etc.) are a short walk away and there are loads of great restaurants to choose from. We didn't leave Mayfair the whole weekend. 

It's likely we'll go back. Great location and amenities.",5,2021,08,02
144,Fabulous stay!!!,"This was our second stay at Flemings Hotel Mayfair - we liked it so much we booked it again!
Fabulous service, we were in London celebrating our 10 year wedding anniversary & my 40th birthday - we were upgraded when we got to the hotel which was lovely. Our room was available as soon as we arrived (10.30am) which was great as we were able to unpack our suitcases and freshen up before heading back out. 
When we did arrive back later in the afternoon we had a lovely bottle of chilled wine awaiting us to celebrate our trip. 
The rooms are extremely clean, complete with soft dressing gowns and slippers. White Company toiletries and a nesspresso machine! 
All the staff were extremely friendly, helpful and welcoming. 
Breakfast was also lovely, it was brought out to us like an afternoon tea set up, lovely fresh pastries and good coffee - again lovely tentative staff. 
In the evening after having dinner out in Mayfair we headed to the bar in Flemings which was Devine. Subtle lighting, velvet soft furnishing and lovely cocktails!! A big choice of alcoholic beverages. 
A thoroughly enjoyable stay… again… I have recommended it to all of our friends and we will be booking again soon as I just love it and I love the area of Mayfair so much. It’s perfect for walking to Buckingham Palace, Green Park, Hyde Park and Kensington High Street but equally in the other direction in close proximity is Piccadilly Circus, Leicester Square & Covent Garden.",5,2021,08,01
144,Fabulous top class boutique hotel with a restaurant to die for.,"A first class luxury hotel with an eye on understated classy internal decor and design.  And with one of London’s finest restaurants.  Despite the hotel being fairly large it feels intimate and the staff are very charming and  friendly. There is a great bar area too. It is like a boutique hotel but on a larger scale. The rooms have top quality modern but classic furniture and the beds are super-comfortable.  The location is excellent too.  Hard to fault anything and with THAT restaurant this could become my favourite London hotel.   Prices are very reasonable too, especially given the class of the hotel.",5,2021,07,30
144,Just Brillaint,"Thank you!!! We arrived 3 hours early and asked if we could drop our bags off, Nicole on reception checked and advised us that our room was already ready and that we had been upgraded. The room was excellent, great size, beautifully done and spotless. We then retuned from an afternoon out to a bottle of champagne on ice for my partner’s birthday! What a brilliant touch and made the stay very special. The bed was large and comfortable, and breakfast the next morning was delicious. Nicole and the team were very friendly and looked after us so well. I would 100% come back and stay again and recommend this hotel to anyone. Please visit if you want a special night away.",5,2021,07,28

144,Overnight plus dinner break,From the moment we stepped into reception at the hotel we felt welcome. All staff were most attentive with big smiles. Nothing was too much trouble. The junior suite room was very comfortable and beautifully decorated. Plush towels and lots of hot water. Extremely comfortable bed and crisp bed linen. The 7 course tasting menu was scrumptious and service amazing. Breakfast a feast. Can’t fault it. Great location directly opposite Green Park and a short stroll through its tree lined walkway to Buckingham Palace.,5,2021,07,19
144,Excellent Stay in the city,"We stayed for a weekend at the Flemings and it was wonderful! Friendly staff, clean room, lovely restaurant, walking distance to shopping and main attractions.Would definitely recommend to anyone wanting to stay in the city!",5,2021,07,19
144,Wonderful friendly hotel in amazing location,"Flemings is a wonderful, friendly boutique hotel opposite Green Park across which is Buckingham Palace so amazing location. Handy for public transport. Beautifully furnished, cool and calm interiors with fabulous cocktails and Ormer, one of the top restaurants in London which well deserves its reputation. Cant wait for next visit. ",5,2021,07,19
144,An excellent place to stay while in London.,"From the moment we got there, the service was excellent. Receptionists were very polite to us and clear about everything we needed to know. Dining at both the Manetta’s Bar and Ormer Mayfair was also fantastic. The 7 course tasting menu at Ormer’s Restaurant was particularly amazing and I would recommend trying this if you ever stay there. Quality of the rooms was excellent as expected. I will definitely being going here again if we come to stay overnight in London. ",5,2021,07,17
144,Great hotel,Great hotel.  Staff very welcoming and helpful. Beautiful bar and lounge areas.  Rooms very comfortable.  Nice deep bath. Great Location right off Piccadilly with Fortum and Mason and other great shops/restaurants on doorstep.  Also opposite green park. ,5,2021,07,15
144,Lovely weekend away.,"Beautiful hotel, friendly staff couldn't do enough for you and no holding out for a tip, perfect location away from the centre but walkable, Green and Hyde park close by as was the tube would definitely recommend. Fantastic breakfast.",5,2021,07,13
144,5 star service,"This hotel is absolutely fabulous and you certainly get what you pay for. Our room was stunning and spacious. The continental breakfast was excellent with more food than we needed. But most of all every single person who works there is friendly & helpful and just couldn’t do enough to make our stay perfect, which it was.",5,2021,07,12
144,Superb stay,"Excellent hotel, fabulously positioned by Green Park and close to the tube station.
Our room (had requested twin beds) was beautifully decorated and bed was extremely comfortable. We were on the ground floor, but heard no road noise at all. The staff went above and beyond to make our stay perfect. Nothing was too much trouble. Highly recommend and will return. Thankyou.",5,2021,07,08
144,Fabulous luxury,"What a superb hotel. From the moment you arrive you feel like royalty as there staff are so good. Friendly, welcoming and always taking an interest. The room was gorgeous and the whole ambience was of understated luxury. A perfect place for a birthday weekend. ",5,2021,07,08
144,vacation,Excellent service and staff were most helpful and very pleasant. A good location and easy to reach by car and good location for bars and restaurants. We were upgraded that was a lovely surprise. would most likely book Flemings hotel again. Only draw back was the slight noise from the underground tube station located on next street.,5,2021,07,07
144,Loveliest part of town to stay,"Had such a lovely stay at Flemings. The decor is beautiful and our room was immaculately furnished.  The staff were so friendly and helpful, especially Ryan Alden, he couldn’t of made our stay any easier.  Great continental breakfast served in the restaurant and happy to store our luggage whilst we went shopping on the last day. Can’t wait to go back.",5,2021,07,01
144,Great location. Staff were 10 out of 10.,"We really enjoyed our stay, great location in the hear of London. Breakfast was great. Staff were 10 out of 10. Ryan looked after us and made us feel very welcome! It was a lovely touch making a fuss of my partner who’s birthday it was. Highly recommended.",5,2021,06,30
144,Quite Retreat in the West End of London,"Great hotel with fantastic service and very nice accommodation from design, execution to function as well as quality. Quite room, nice en-suite and finishing. Would recommend the hotel and we will stay there again.",5,2021,06,28
144,"Perfect location, place and service","We stayed in the Penthouse for 1 night, and wow it was beautiful. So spacious and luxurious, it was really worth the money I cannot fault it one bit. The beds were huge, rooms were massive and the bathrooms were stunning. Due to the limited pictures on the website it was very hard to know what we were to expect, but it really didn't disappoint. The location was spot on, 5 minute walk to Hakkasan and Sexy Fish amongst a lot of other great places. A 12 minute walk to Oxford Street as well, the men at reception were so welcoming and friendly it was a real pleasure. Only thing I have to mention is the breakfast, If I was to stay here again I would definitely skip the breakfast as 1. It wasn't that great in my opinion, expensive and a bit boring. 2. the staff who worked there were quite rude/abrupt and not very accommodating what so ever but that is my only moan. Thank you for having us and I'm sure we will be back! If anyone is thinking of staying here, treat yourself and do it!",5,2021,06,28
144,Night in Town,"Small but perfectly formed hotel with an excellent atmosphere mixing old London and new stylish decor. Lovely breakfast and all staff very efficient and friendly. The room was described on Booking.com as ""tiny"" and to be fair is was, it was good value for mayfair and well appointed for a 1 night stay. ",5,2021,06,28
144,Little gem,"Beautiful and well appointed hotel with friendly and efficient staff.  Immaculate in an ideal location. Opposite the park, close to tube and short walk into Mayfair. Quiet comfortable room good breakfast. ",5,2021,06,27
144,Great stay,"Stayed here for 1 night for theatre trip .  Luxurious hotel , staff were amazing and very attentive . 

Free room upgrade and Prosecco delivered to the room 

Would highly recommend and will certainly be staying here again ",5,2021,06,27
144,Great hotel and best location,Perfect London stopover. Location was great and so quiet for a centre location. The decor was so lovely and the quality of rooms were fantastic and immaculately presented. Staff very attentive. Continental breakfast that was included was great start to the day. Did not have time to dine or use Spa but they both have great reputations. ,5,2021,06,24
144,Outstanding Luxury Boutique Hotel in Fashionable Mayfair,"Flemings Mayfair is a boutique luxury hotel tucked away on a small street in the fashionable Mayfair district of London. It is the quintessential boutique luxury hotel. It is classy without all the unnecessary glitz of a large five star hotel.It is tastefully decorated and impeccably maintained. It is hard to imagine how the staff could have been more attentive or helpful . The entire staff from the front desk to the dining room was friendly and efficient and did not have the sometimes off putting over polite demeanor sometimes found in the larger luxury London hotels. We had a relatively long stay in London due to a family emergency and stayed in a ""one bedroom suite."" This was an extremely well structured efficiency apartment. It had a living room, bedroom, dressing area with a large amount of closet space. It had a full bathroom with a separate shower and tub, and a small guest bathroom too. The dining area had a large table. The kitchen was a full kitchen with a dishwasher, a full size refrigerator and freezer and a washer-dryer.Plates and cooking utensils were also provided.In short I would highly recommend Flemings Mayfair for anyone who wanted the luxury it provided, and the friendly staff without the glitz.I thought the pricing was extremely fair considering that it was in London and the extent of the accommodation in which we stayed.",5,2021,06,18
144,A nice break,"We had a lovely stay for my wife’s 50th Birthday and our 25 wedding anniversary, great location, lovely staff, nice room and we also had the weather which always tops it off. Didn’t have meals there since there is lots of choices locally and we also picnic’d in Green Park!",4,2021,06,16
144,Excellent location,"Room very clean, excellent full English breakfast, very friendly and helpful staff and would definitely stay there again when next in London. Perfect location from which we could access all the shops, restaurants and museums we wanted to visit.",4,2021,06,14
144,Flemings,"Excellent hotel,location and staff. Enjoyed our 2 night stay very much. Room a bit on the small size but overall no complaints. The staff were very accommodating with nothing to much trouble.
Will definitely return ",5,2021,06,14
144,Nice room just no hot water,I had delayed our stay due to COVID-19 and we were very excited when we could finally stay for a nice weekend in London. The room was a good size and location hotel was excellent. The main issue we had during our stay was there was no hot water. When we explained this to the staff they advised us just to run the taps longer however this still didn’t change. We were then advised to let them know exactly when we wanted a shower so they could run the taps in the rooms around to build up the pressure. When you are paying this much for a hotel you do not expect there to be no hot water. I understand these issues happen but they obviously knew it was an issue and wasn’t raised on check in. We were just told next time we stayed this would be fixed but after two cold showers I think we will give it a miss.,3,2021,06,13
144,Beautiful decor,"Stylish decor, friendly staff. My only feedback would be to cater better for those with dog allergies by separating dog-friendly rooms with allergic-friendly rooms. Currently these are mixed, so an allergy sufferer could potentially stay in a room where a dog had been there the day before. ",4,2021,06,07
144,One of a kind,"Without doubt the best hotel I’ve ever stayed at, amazing decor, beautiful rooms and the staff couldn’t do enough for us. 

Central to everything 

I would recommend this hotel to everyone. 

Well done and thank you all !

144,Disappointing stay,"Poor menu choice on Saturday, no bar or food available on Sunday/Monday with no room service, also the room was very small for a deluxe room when you open the bathroom door it hit the bed. Overall was disappointed with the stay.",3,2021,06,01
144,Great hotel in a wonderful location.,"Wonderful stay at Flemings. Great hotel, amazing food, rooms and atmosphere.
I’d recommended this hotel to anybody based on the location and the quality of the rooms and the amenities. I can’t think of a better location.",5,2021,06,01
144,We couldn’t wait to get out,"So many things went wrong . We travelled with a one year old and asked specifically for a cot not to be put in , but they had put in a spare bed in to the room . The lady they sent to collect -alone- was new and didn’t know how to put it together . The bathroom had shower only -  not ideal with a baby. The hotel recommend and even give you menu from “Burger and Lobster” restaurant which we ordered from . It arrived in take away bags and boxes (as you’d expect) but no plates from the hotel or even cutlery . So by the time we looked through the bags and drawers and called reception - the lobster and sauce were cold. The other option was to eat with your hands - even the salad . The room was not serviced after the first night so we had overflowing bin with nappies and smelling left over food and lobster carcass in the room for two days . We called the reception when we arrived in the evening but were told they only clean rooms every two days. We asked for clean towels and coffee and water and asked to be put through to the room service but the receptionist said not to worry - he’ll bring all of it up. A long while after the receptionist came with towels and some cheap instant coffee sachets not coffee pods . He said he couldn’t find tea and he’d come back and someone else will bring water (this is after 9pm). A further while later - I was not fully dressed and on bed feeding baby when there was a knock on door and it opened and the lady proceeded to walk in with three tiny plastic water bottles . I called reception again and said that it was not what we needed . We wanted large glass sparkling water . A while later someone brought us the bottles but still water . We had to call reception because no one ever answered the room service in two days. Probably total attempt of calls would have been 10. They didn’t have room service menu in the room either .  The menu only extended to around 6 meal options, no options of drinks or snacks.  Very odd . 
Breakfast was odd. The guy who seemed in charge appeared to be very serious and he was talking down to all the other staff - quite rudely . He asked a girl to get us a high chair and when she brought it and put it down he asked he to put it on the other side of the table , she did but chucked it with quite a force - she was annoyed but I can also see why - he’s tone was very rude . They got our breakfast wrong - I specifically asked for no meat but the meat was there. They never brought my other half his toast. The pastry selection was two plain croissants. I asked if they have some sweet pastries with chocolate. And the guy said - oh you want another one? On the selection - two slices of cheese , two toasts , tiny little cup of fruit salad , salmon, plastic pot of cherry yoghurt , little packs of butter, Nutella, jams etc. Really not very exciting at all. 
Sunday checkout is 1pm - great option but the system disables the room keycards at 11 or 12 so we couldn’t get in to room .
Room looked nice but at night you can hear everything going on outside the hotel as well as the fridge in the room was extremely loud . 
I do wish when we left someone would have asked whether we enjoyed the stay. 
We couldn’t wait to get out.",2,2021,05,31
144,Beautiful stunning hotel,Visited friends for drinks in the hotel and ventured down to the basement bar. Absolutely stunning hotel. Beautiful decor and ambience. Staff very courteous and lovely for a treat in their art decor bar.,5,2021,05,29
144,"A perfect gem, amazing staff, in a great location","I loved my stay here. Gabrielle was amazing with my initial contact and Colin was an absolute delight to meet. The reception staff are friendly, very helpful and I felt at home right away. The suite and bed were a dream - I slept well and refreshed for long walks in the park with lovely takeaway dining options nearby. 

A perfect stay in a great location, within walking distance to the best of London. Cannot wait to return. Thank you! ",5,2021,04,23
144,Great Apartment ,"With the lifting of restrictions we were able to book one of their apartments.  We arrived to be told that we had been upgraded to a two bed penthouse.  The apartment was lovely and really felt like home.  The reception team were very helpful and friendly.  

Would certainly book an apartment again!",5,2021,04,19
144,Okay- very friendly staff,"This is not a 5 star or even a 4 star hotel, a 3+ would be fair. Great location and  excellent staff.
The hallway and room unfortunately smelt of foul drains and the bed and linens were not of a high quality. A bit uncomfortable. I stayed for 1 night and it wasn't terrible but if you are aware of the quality of a genuine 5-star hotel, then this is nowhere near the league of them.",3,2021,03,23

144,"Amazing stay during covid, highly recommended ","This was our second stay during lockdown. We had to visit London on both occasions for medical tests. During our first stay we booked the one bedroom suite, room 708, amazing room with a kitchen , dining table, separate living room, dressing area and an amazing egg bath with a chandelier above and heated flooring.  The attention to detail on both stays have been amazing, a very personal service. On our second stay we booked a studio suite, but on arrival we were told that they had looked on the system and upgraded to  exactly the same room we had during our first stay. We were very grateful for this, as having a kitchen was such a bonus when the only way you can eat is to either cook yourself or have takeaway. We ordered a deliveroo which was brought directly to our room.
We are regular guests at the Soho hotel, but due to it being closed we decided to book Flemings. We will definitely stay here again and looking forward to experiencing Flemings fully in the future. Thank you ",5,2021,02,26
144,Stylish hotel at an excellent location,"I stayed here during a business trip.  It was a stylish hotel with nice decorations even within the elevator! Not sure if this was something specific to my room, but there was a bit of noise coming through next door, though not to the extent that it would bother my sleep.  During my stay, it was a bit unfortunate that the treadmills didn't work, but I did appreciate the effort from the staff members who came and took a look as soon as I reported the problem.  I will keep this hotel in my shortlist for my next London trip.",4,2021,01,27
144,Excellent stay,"Excellent overnight stay.. prime location in Mayfair, I will recommend.

Room was clean, Conceirge was friendly and helpful, room service was excellent but pricey, bathroom has heated floors which was nice and unexpected - especially this time of the year.

A pleasant experience.",5,2021,01,10
144,One of the best,"I’ve stayed in many high end hotels in London, Flemings is definitely one of the top ones! Welcoming from reception to check out. My suite had everything needed. Finishings were high end and luxury. Fantastic food and drink selection. Ideal location, close to Bond Street and Regent street and Buckingham palace. Green park was across the road and fantastic place to run",5,2020,12,21

144,A fab stay at Flemings - go!,"We had a brilliant stay this October. The staff were fab, the cocktails were excellent and the discreet boutique feel of the place make you feel like it’s home away from home but better! Just want we wanted out of a rare night away in London. ",5,2020,10,26
144,"Overnight stay and taster menu: amazing, 5 star experience, would highly recommend.",Surprise stay from my fiancé. Lovely room and extremely helpful staff. We called down to reception due to a problem with the hot water coming through and someone came to the room in minutes and sorted the issue. We did the 6 course taster menu in the restaurant which was an amazing experience. The food was all creative and delicious and served by highly attentive and welcoming staff with real flair. I am a coeliac and only minor adjustments were needed to my dishes and all staff very knowledgeable. Also a great selection for included continental breakfast the next day.,5,2020,10,18

Proximity to Underground station ""green park"", to the nightlife at Barkeley square and green park for the morning run.
The breakfast is exceptional and mindbogling.
Thanks for a great stay.",5,2020,09,18
144,Lovely hotel with a boutique feel,"Another weekend stay in our home city took us to Flemings. We have eaten many times before in Ormer restaurant but staying was novel.

We are fortunately Indulged members of the Small Luxury Hotels group and were very well looked after. An upgrade to a junior suite (Room 70) was a real bonus, the room being a good size and very nicely furnished in pleasing hues. A large and very comfortable bed and a lovely sitting area were very good features.

The bathroom is maybe a little small but had a large bath tub (which we prefer) but quite a small sink area. Nonetheless more than acceptable.

The room is at ground level at the back of the hotel and the noise from the Piccadilly Line was a little disconcerting at first but you quickly get used to it.

Upon arrival we had a lovely greeting from the two ladies at reception, it was explained that the room would  not be serviced for such a stay - times are different at the moment and this was certainly acceptable and understandable.

The reception is classy although the ceiling is low but there is a nice sitting area adjacent, sanitiser stations are clearly marked.

The hotel is in a very convenient location just off Piccadilly and a short walk to Green Park Tube station.

We had a most enjoyable couple of days and will certainly return again..",5,2020,09,14
144,Nice with one miss,The hotel is nicely renovated and has a comfortable and boutique’y feel.  Our deluxe room was small but nice. Bathroom great. Neighbourhood v nice and central. Didn’t try breakfast - 28 gbp seemed too expensive. Only real complaint is they (per policy) didn’t service room at all while we were there forna weekend stay. Expect better at this price point. They did provide clean towels on request,4,2020,09,13
144,Great customer service!,Thank you to the team of taking note that it was our 10 year wedding anniversary! They also upgraded us to the deluxe double which was great. Location is perfect and is walking distance to all the hot spots. ,5,2020,08,31
144,Pretty good hotel in a beautiful location ,"Pros

Lovely staff. Upon entering all staff were attentive, polite and genuinely friendly. Seemed interested in our plans and at the end stored our suitcases after check out so we could further explore London for the day before our train back to Lincoln 

Clean in the room. Super tidy in the room. I would say it was a spotless experience and loved that it had sanitiser is many places in the hotel so felt very Covid friendly. Everything wrapped and tidy as well! 

Fab location. Literally 5 mins walk to Buckingham Palace and Green Park so on a hot day and ice cream in the park and a wander is a must. The other direction is luxury shops and places like The Grand and The Ritz so perfectly situated! I would also say that it’s about 4 minutes walk to the tube! So wonderful for transport and also we used uber and we were collected easily! 

Elemis products were a nice treat. Sometimes products can be on the cheap side and not nice but Elemis products and minis are always a nice touch. Classy! 

Cons

Small room and bed. We stayed in 201 so a double deluxe and it’s small. The hotel is boutique so hallways are narrow and the hotel room is pretty small. So ok for a night or two but anything more you would easily need to go for a larger room. For the location I guess that’s what you compromise on, room size. Bed was very small. None of this was a deal breaker for us at all and we were happy enough. Just like to leave an honest review. 

Lacking atmosphere but that maybe just due to Covid and not many people staying etc. Not somewhere to grab a drink and stay in I would say but that’s just our tastes 

No bath so if you like a soak in the tub this room wouldn’t be for you 

Overall

A lovely stay. Location wins for us every time! Rooms are small so great for a city break not a long stay. Staff are lovely! ",3,2020,08,25
144,Unhelpful abrupt staff noisy smelly rooms ,"Yeah you get celebrity prints all around the hotel. We had Luke Evans staring at us in bed and Kate Winslet by the lift. But that’s where the humour ends. 

The room is noisy, you’ll hear people coughing at night and plugging in their mobile phones etc. God forbid if you get a honeymooning couple next door to you.

The bathroom absolutely has a high stench of what I can only describe as strong cat urine. We had to close the bathroom door all the time.

We went to reception on the first morning after the first night and asked if there was housekeeping refreshing the rooms to which the lady at reception replied loudly and bluntly “WHAT DO YOU MEAN” then she said “HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN HERE” we went to breakfast (outside of the hotel thank goodness) and couldn’t believe how we had been spoken too.

When my wife checked in she asked for a late checkout and was offered 12pm or £30 per hour after that. On checkout day at 11:50am we were called on the phone and asked abruptly when we were leaving. When we went downstairs and checked out the 12pm time was never noted. Poor, very poor staff attitude towards us and to be offered an hourly rate suggests something very dodgy and degrades this place to some sweaty red light district hovel.

When we did come down with our 5 cases which we were struggling with there was no help offered by the 3 people sitting doing noting. My wife waited outside with the cases and no one offered help while I got the car.

This hotel clearly has some serious staff issues and we will never stay here again, it’s simply not worth the money or the hassle of wanting to feel that 5 Star feeling. 

Fleming’s Mayfair has not shown us that they were not a 5 star boutique establishment in Piccadilly but a place that did not care for people in any way whatsoever.",1,2020,08,21
144,Good value,"We only stayed one night as we were dining at The Ritz and it was really convenient. The staff we encountered were all very friendly and helpful. There were plenty of sanitisation points around the hotel and our room was very clean, so we didn’t feel there was anything further they could have done to make us feel safe. The room was quite small - I wouldn’t have wanted to stay there more than one night. However it was well appointed. When I asked for an iron and ironing board they appeared within 3 minutes. The bed was lovely and firm, the coffee machine excellent and there was no outside noise. For the location and standard of the room the price we paid was very good value and I would certainly stay there again. ",4,2020,08,18
144,Short Stay in at Flemings Mayfair,"If you do have to spend several days in London, I  do recommend this very nice hotel.

144,Luxurious stay in Mayfair hideaway,"We absolutely loved staying at Flemings for a weekend in London. The property is ideally located a stone's throw from Green Park, The Ritz, Fortnum & Masons and the stylish restaurants, bars and shops of Mayfair and Piccadilly. Staff were genuinely friendly and hospitable, the decor was exquisite and the room maintained to an immaculate standard. The air conditioning was also very welcome on a particularly scorching weekend. The highlight was definitely dinner at the exceptional Ormer restaurant. The food was magnificent, paired with lovely wines and cocktails and the setting was so romantic and peaceful. I can't wait to stay again!",5,2020,08,02
144,My recent stay.,This was may first stay at Fleming's- I was suitably impressed and this will be my preferred hotel in the future. Hotel is clean and well looked after.

144,Perfect balance of luxury and affordability,"This was my second stay at Fleming’s - I was suitably impressed with my last stay to make this my preferred hotel once again. Hotel is clean and well looked after. Room was on the smaller size but perfect for a couple - and certainly expected given the rather reasonable price paid. Mattress was comfortable as well. 
The staff on duty were very friendly and helpful. And certainly contributed to the overall pleasant experience. 
The location of the hotel is perfect as well. There is a tube station located within a 3 minute walk. But it is also perfectly situated to explore the shopping streets of London. We didn’t have to use the tube during our entire stay.
My only advice would be to try and get a room on the higher floors - definitely more spacious.",5,2020,07,31
144,Great stay during odd times,We stayed in this hotel during the pandemic precautions. Obviously certain measurements impacted our stay (e.g: breakfast was not a buffet) but we still had a great stay. Staff were very friendly. Will definitely stay here again when we visit London. ,4,2020,07,28
144,Average hotel for a high price,"Beds are small compared to the other hotels in the surrounding area for the price paid and the hot water was very intermittent, cold shower at 6 am prior to work was not a great start to the day. Staff was very good who greeted is at reception and I’m sure should we of had any requests they would of dealt with them accordingly. 

The sound of the underground was quite loud. ",3,2020,07,25

Reassuringly high standards of cleanliness critical in these times 
This establishment epitomises what hospitality is all about

144,"Make your own bed, no communication on the lack or services and poor room, not a winner","Very disappointing trip, wont be staying there again. Oh and if you are over 6ft forget sleeping in a bed that you can actually fit in without your feet hanging over the end. A nice lady on reception sypathised with our concerns but apart from that a poor experience.",2,2020,07,24
144,Fabulous Flemings,"Having been to lunch on several occasions at Ormer, one of their restaurants, we now sampled the overnight hospitality on two separate nights in different rooms. Both were fine; in fact in some ways the smaller had an advantage because there was a welcome window in the bathroom. 
It’s terribly well appointed and has a very personal and homely feel. The staff are all very helpful indeed. Nothing is too much trouble and they are alert and attentive.
Highly recommend and will almost certainly be back!",5,2020,07,13
144,Great stay on July 4th!,"Stayed at this hotel on Saturday July 4th, which was memorable in itself as it was the lifting of the lockdown for the bars/restaurants/hotels. Was a surprise stay, and it was great. Loved the hotel, staff were friendly, and always responded promptly to our requests. The room was lovely, bed was comfortable, and the shower was amazing!
Great location, found some lovely places in Shepherd Market to eat and drink. Would love to go back and check out the bar and restaurant properly!

Tip - I drove into Mayfair so needed parking, the hotel does not have parking, however I recommend parking at the Hilton Park Lane - if you book the space via the Just Park website/app - it is a lot cheaper than booking through the hotel's website direct. Was very pleasantly surprised at the rate for 24 hours, considering the location! The car park is just a few mins walk away from Flemings.",5,2020,07,07
144,Wonderful holiday,"Even with tourism being affected so badly with the Corona virus, Fleming's Mayfair went above and beyond to make us feel safe and welcome. Nothing was too much trouble and all our needs were taken care of. ",5,2020,03,22
144,Amazing hotel!,"Me and my boyfriend stayed in Flemings, Mayfair for one night for his birthday and I can’t fault anything. Everything was amazing; the rooms were really cosy and well-decorated, the restaurant where we had breakfast was really nice and had a great choice of food and the service was especially exceptional throughout the hotel. Everyone made us feel so welcome and they were all so friendly from check in to check out. Ryan helped us a lot throughout our stay and we would like to thank him for being so professional and making us feel so welcome and helping to celebrate my boyfriends birthday. I would definitely recommend staying here, we hope to go back soon!",5,2020,03,18
144,Great boutique hotel with fabolous restaurant and bar.,This is a hidden gem in Mayfair that makes you feel special. We have stayed in some lovely hotels with great service but Flemings just felt more special. Great food and drinks in the restaurant and bar. ,5,2020,03,16
144,Great Hotel and Excellent Service,"Stayed for 4 nights and very happy with the decision. The rooms are quite and comfortable and the restaurant and bar are very great. Also, the Mayfair location is very convenient to a number of attractions and the tube. We plan to return!",5,2020,03,10
144,Perfect!,"Couldn’t of asked for more, the perfect stay! We had a problem with our room but within minutes it was solved and we were upgraded. The staff were fantastic throughout always helpful and friendly. I’d recommend to anyone! ",5,2020,03,10
144,Fantastic London Hotell,"Fantastic little jewel in the heart of London. Everything was great. Room, staff, food, cocktails... loved our stay. The room was very comfortable. Excellent breakfast with amazing coffee.  And, I loved the way the staff interacted with the guests. They are very helpful and professional, and look like they love what they do...",5,2020,03,09
144,Cosy and intimate ,"Flemings hotel London is a  intimate hotel, great location with the type of  incredible service you expect from a small leading hotels of the world . The initial room I was allocated was at the front of the hotel and I asked to change to a different room as I’m a light sleeper and not an  early riser. It was no problem for the staff who were willing to show me a number of available rooms in the same category.. The rooms are spacious and very comfortable , with a smallish bathroom but extremely warm . the breakfast extensive in choice and the bar very cosy.  Omar’s restaurant has amazing food. I usually try not to eat dinner in my hotel but it was cold out , I’d had a long day and decided after a drink in the cosy bar , I wasn’t venturing out . I was blown away by the food. I would recommend to anyone visiting London 
I was impressed and enjoyed my 4 night stay at Fleming’s .  The property is a few older houses joined together, so Fleming’s has not lost the atmosphere of a sophisticated more traditional hotel but with all the mod cons and contemporary chic style .  I myself am not a fan of the larger hotel chains , so had a wonderful experience at Fleming’s and would definitely stay there again . The gym at the property was closed but we offered the use of another nearby. ",4,2020,03,09
144,Really enjoyed our stay overall,"Great shower and toiletries, lovely rooms and generally good service. However, the chandelier in our room did not work, and we were billed for the newspapers that were offered to us upon arrival, which was a surprise. ",4,2020,03,09
144,30 anniversary ,Stayed here for two nights. The staff were very attentive and professional and made you feel at home. The restaurant was excellent and I would definitely return just for the flavours and superb cooking skills of the chefs . There is also a nice bar to have a guiet and relaxing drink after a long walk around Oxford Street. Nice to be situated so centrally.,5,2020,03,05
144,Weekend in London,The excellent location of the Hotel and the skills suggested by the staff permitted us a wonderful permanence in the city. The room was comfortable. The breakfast was excellent and every person of the staff was amazing.,5,2020,03,04
144,Afternoon tea at Flemings hotel ,"Just a short time all from Green Park station this beautiful hotel offers tea in their drawing room. Very comfortable with a nice real fire. 
Staff were all very pleasant and range of teas on offer was good. 
Sandwiches were tasty, scones good but a little on the small size and we had to ask for some more cream. 
Cakes were gorgeous. Would have been nice to have more tea included rather than just the 2 small pots. 
Would recommend this afternoon tea as I think It is good value compared to other venues. ",4,2020,03,02
144,a treat,"We spent one Saturday night here having found a great deal online. It was such a lovely experience. The hotel is very conveniently located for local dining venues at Shepherd Market round the corner and also for getting into town by bus or tube. Our deluxe double on the third floor was clean, beautifully decorated, not huge but big enough. The coffee maker was a great extra touch. Lovely double ended bath and plentiful hot water and a very comfortable bed with Egyptian cotton sheets. The continental breakfast was a great spread with fresh fruit and yoghurts as well as a great array of cold meats, cheeses and smoked salmon. The staff were cheerful and helpful. I can't fault this hotel and will aim to come again - soon. I could quibble and say there was no 'do not disturb' notice for our room so cleaning staff did knock on the door at 10 a.m. on the Sunday, an hour before checkout. And we could have done with a few more milk sachets. But we could easily have asked for both of these things from room service and I know they would have been provided without fuss!",5,2020,03,02
144,Fantastic - every time!,"Gorgeous hotel in a great location - only a 15 minute walk to Oxford Circus, a 15 minute walk to Piccadily Circus and a 2 minute walk to Green Park/Green Park tube station.

They treat you to some lovely choccies too as a thank you - what's not to love!",5,2020,02,28
144,Sincere friendliness and hospitality,"We had another great stay at Flemings. Advantages are the true and sincere hospitality, the excellent location, high quality of both building and interior and the small scale of the hotel.
The breakfast is a real treat. we will certainly be back!",5,2020,02,26
144,Excellent hotel,We spent the weekend in London. We had an early arrival flight. The front desk found us a room for an early check-in. All the staff were so friendly and helpful. The location is fantastic with a short walk to loads of bars and restaurants and attractions. Would highly recommend this hotel.,5,2020,02,24
144,Delighted with our stay,"Flemings Hotel is a lovely old hotel in a quiet street in Mayfair. It’s beautifully decorated throughout and is clearly very well maintained. I don’t think I’ve come across such immaculate service and friendly staff for a very long time. We had cocktails in the bar and genuinely quite wowed by how beautifully decorated it is.  It’s small, but stylish yet cosy with an extensive cocktail list. When I enquired about a particular cocktail, I was made a mini version as a taster which was a lovely touch.

The bedroom - a deluxe double - wasn’t huge but it was spacious enough for us. It was very nicely decorated, the bathroom was lovely with an excellent shower and Elemis toiletries. We were given a complimentary bottle of water each. The robes and towels were very thick and felt quite luxurious. 

Overall I would highly recommend and I will certainly be returning.",5,2020,02,23
144,5 Star,"Staying at Flemings is a 5 star experience. If you want a big, brash soulless hotel, this is not for you, Flemings has the feel of a cozy private club and you are treated as if you have been a member there for years. If staying I would recommend a drink or two in Manettas Bar, such a relaxing environment. Must also mention the breakfast which is top notch.",5,2020,02,23
144,My London favourite,"most friendly stuff, helpful and polite. great style. feels like beeing at home.
super bar and food.
and mayfair is the best area to stay. the neighbourhood ist very nice, quite but vibrant. you find everything, from barber to cool restaurants and bars.",5,2020,02,20
144,Miss Amelia Taylor,The most loveliest stay at the Fleming Mayfair Hotel. The staff were very kind and attentive. I have an gluten intolerance allergy and had so many options to cater for me. Our night was so special thank you to the Flemings Mayfair Hotel. ,5,2020,02,17
144,Good Value but has some issues,"The location is great if you want to walk to Buckingham Palace, Hyde Park, Big Ben, and Westminster. But just know that most restaurants (we recommend The Ivy) are in Covent Garden and there’s lots of traffic to get there at night.

The rooms are nice and spacious, the staff is friendly, the breakfast is good. They can give you an upgrade to their patio suite, which is lovely BUT you hear the tube every 5 minutes going underneath and slamming of doors outside. I recommend requesting a room NOT on the ground floor as you won’t get any sleep. 

Also, the elevator broke for at least two whole days, and stairs are not as easy to maneuver and the hotel is a maze. The hotel barely apologized and offered nothing for the trouble. 

Overall, it’s good value but I think we’ll stay elsewhere next time, especially to explore a different side of London.",5,2020,02,16
144,fine but,"great location, room a bit small and noisy, water leak on the floor during the shower, otherwise great staff but no French at the reception, manage!
very decent breakfast, very friendly staff; we may come back but we will ask for a better room with a view and a window worthy of the name",4,2020,02,14
144,A Celebration...,"As much as the service received was great (Thank you Valentina), the room location let the experience down. Its never ok to be woken up by loud builders and loud machinery. Yes, this is not in the hotels control but not giving us this room would have been a start.",3,2020,02,13
144,Beautiful and boutique ,"This is a stunning hotel, the interior design and flowers make it beautifully luxurious. All staff friendly and helpful. I gave it a 4 rating as my room was small, luckily I was there on my own, but had my husband come with me, we would have been very tight for space. No where to put my bag, had to squeeze between end of bed and wall. Lovely bathroom but only one sink, good amenities. Beds comfortable I slept well. Breakfast very nice. Great location. ",4,2020,02,12
144,A nice boutique hotel,"Overall, the location is wonderful and I was satisfied with the service.  The restaurant (Omer) is not necessarily good for performance. Some staff are keen on service but others are not necessarily so. The room was rather small but this is inevitable in the real city centr of London, I believe.  ",4,2020,02,08
144,Fantastic hotel,A fantastic hotel. Very clean and very welcoming. Always there to help. A lovely box of shortbread and a welcome card in my room on arrival. The door man was especially friendly. The bed was super comfortable.,5,2020,02,06
144,Mayfair Stay ,"We had been wanting to experience Fleming's for a while now so after seeing a deal online we decided to book this property for a theartre weekend.

The staff were very pleasant and room decor was pleasing & comfortable but it was the  quality of the breakfast offerering that made our stay.

 Just dissapointing the room was far smaller compared to the photo... I have included a picture to show what we brought online compared to what we ended up with.

Then it was the lack of soundproofing, you could hear absolutely everything from our neighbor's on either side and footsteps above and have to say we had never experienced anything like that before in this category of property!

A very small point but one I did spot when getting a tissue was the wall area behind the sink, you could see lots of toothpaste stains on the wall, again not expected for this this type standard.

Overall a nice experience, and a wonderful weekend. The building and location are fabulous and the property is decorated beautifully throughout and would book again.
",3,2020,02,03
144,Great hotel in the very city center,"Flemings hotel is a great one. Situated in the very center of the city. Green part underground station is just around the corner. Both Green Park and Hyde Parks are nearby.
Pretty good supermarket and good pharmacy shop which works till late night are also around the corner.
Great breakfast, friendly staff members. Overall great experience.",5,2020,01,29
144,Ask for smoke free room,"Rating options don't allow for better than average but needs some attention.  The staff is very professional and friendly.  We used the concierge staff quite a bit and found them to be very efficient.  I've stopped asking for non smoking rooms these days as it is no longer an issue most places.  Unfortunately our suite did smell of smoke.  I did not ask to be moved because we didn't realize it until we settled in at the end of a long evening.  Housekeeping provided inconsistent service.  The location was very convenient.  Our suite was affected by the hotel front door, which made our door rattle a bit.  If I were to return I'd ask to be on a higher floor.   The pillows are all quite dense on the beds.",3,2020,01,28
144,not as good as the last few times," I previously wrote my thoughts on the last screen
not as accommodating as my previous trips here 
bed was uncomfortable as well the pillows staff wasn’t as accommodating as in the past 
A breakfast appeared on my bill that I never had 
it was adjusted ",4,2020,01,27
144,Beautiful rooms,"We stayed three nights in December. Wonderful suite. The location, of course, is unbeatable. The drawing room is nice with excellent food. Didn't have time to eat at the restaurant this time. Overall, one to return to.",5,2020,01,21
144,Flemmings Mayfair London,"We thoroughly enjoyed our 10 day stay at Flemings Boutique Hotel during December 2019. The staff were very helpful, the room extremely clean and comfortable and the chef produced world class gourmet meals. We loved the cosiness of this hotel, the central location and being only 300 metres from Green Park station gave easy access to explore all over London. I would highly recommend this hotel for business.and holiday travellers alike.",5,2020,01,19
144,Beautiful boutique hotel gem in Mayfair,"Been here three times already and each time the staff remembers me. The design is timeless and sophisticated the rooms are stunning, the service impeccable and there is no better more central location in London! We will come again",5,2020,01,19
144,Excellent gem of a hotel,"Everything about The Flemings is thoughtful, beautiful and enjoyable. I was in London for a quick four-day work trip and ended up using the restaurant, bar and drawing room for various meetings. The surroundings were beautifully appointed and comfortable and the staff so helpful. The hotel is that home-you-wish-you-had away from home. I will be recommending to everyone! Only down side was that my room was on the first floor, street side and construction across the street began at 6:30AM, which was not kind on my jet lag. Next time I will request a room off the street.",5,2020,01,17
144,Short stay in a small room with a noisy fridge,"I was only in the hotel for a matter of 9 hours so this is a limited scope review. Staff were polite and attentive, room was clean but small and had no chair, desk or table (besides dressing table and stool). The minibar fridge hummed intermittently all night which meant it took a while to fall asleep. Having an iron and ironing board very promptly delivered and pre-filled with water was welcome.",3,2020,01,17
144,nice place to stay,"Well situated place for sightseeing and shopping, lovely hotel and friendly staff. Good breakfast with a wide selection to choose. We had a small room, but a large bathroom, and it was very quiet, although next to Piccadilly street.",4,2020,01,15
144,Nice stay for a quick weekend,"Spent the weekend in London, it was an easy walk from Victoria and another easy walk around town, great location for the hotel. Small but wasn't in there much. Friendly staff and very helpful. Would definitely stay again.",5,2020,01,08
144,"Small, Luxurious and Perfect","Centrally located right near the Green Park Station The Flemings Mayfair is a high end boutique hotel. Everything was 5 star. The decor is lovely, the room was delightful and the bar and restaurants were great! I did book one of their single rooms - I thought it was very, very nice. The view was non existent, but the room was quiet and beautifully decorated. And I love the Elimis shampoos and soaps. I had many hotels to pick from, and I took a long time deciding but I have never gone wrong with a hotel that belongs to Small Luxury Hotels of the World. And now that they give Hyatt points - it was a non decision, decision! Expensive yes, but not as expensive as the large 5 star hotels and just as nice. The place was perfect!",5,2020,01,05
144,Amazing,"Great location,perfect room,amazing breakfast..no more needed...will be preferred afterwards by me...one and only hotel for me in mayfair anymore...just a better wifi wanted..sooo clean ,tidy and newly designed room",5,2020,01,05
144,Not as good as expected! Avoid rooom 60!,"My wife and I were gifted this stay by our daughters for Christmas, on arrival everything looked great, as a hotel it was very nice. We were shown to room number 60 on the ground floor that backed onto the café/bar, nice looking room and all okay. At 5am next morning we were awoken to the staff restocking to bar with no consideration of the guests room next door, the noise was so loud it seemed like they were in the room with us. 
We went down to breakfast at around 9.30 where a grumpy lady pointed at a table and said we can sit there, having not stayed at this hotel before I would have expected to have been told were the buffet breakfast was located, asked if we would like tea or coffee and if we wanted the cooked option but this was not to be. After eventually finding our way around unadvised the breakfast was average at best. After breakfast we asked for two more white coffees, two black coffees showed up, asked for some milk, waited 5 minutes (coffee going cold) asked again, 5 more minutes and my wife went up to ask for some, they said they would bring it over, another 5 minutes nothing came and gave up as the coffee was cold. 
On checkout there was no effort made to ask if we had a good stay.
I know these problems don't sound that important but my daughters payed good money for this room and it definatly was not good value.
I tend to think a lot more attention is given to guests using the bigger rooms on upper floors. 
Very disappointing customer service, will not be staying here again or cannot recommend this hotel, have stayed in much better hotels, keep looking.",3,2020,01,05
144,A good experience,A good experience But the rooms very very small the stuf very friendly smiling rooms was clean location was amazing Quiet street Close to everything Only the size of the rooms is very small I hope to make it bigger ,4,2020,01,02
144,Disappointing,"When we compare the price we have paid and the overall experience at the hotel, it was really disappointing. Room was not clean, front desk support was not sufficient. Low level of support from concierge team other than Simeon. ",2,2020,01,01
144,Excellent Service and Location,"Location was s perfect for what we were looking for; to be near a central tube stop, close to Regent and New Bond Street and Shepards Market, and close to Hyde Park for some runs. Room was small, but all we were looking for. And the staff was tremendously helpful and freindly.",5,2019,12,31
144,Great Find,Great small hotel in the heart of Mayfair. Staff was well trained and very friendly. Doormen could not have been more friendly and efficient.  Room was small but spotlessly clean. Continental breakfast was excellent with impeccable service We'll be back.,5,2019,12,30
144,One of the best hotels in London,"A boutique hotel in central London. At arrival, the doorkeeper greeted and referred us to the reception that were already waiting for us. We  booked a standard double room - the room was lovely, spacious enough and very comfortable. Nothing was missing from the guest's well-being. The service at the hotel, the excellent breakfast in the wonderful dining room, the stylish bar - everything was perfect. A place to come back",5,2019,12,29
144,"Birthday hell:
But a honest review","So we always stay in London and decided to stay here .

So we booked through Voyage Privé and there seems to have been a error. So three hours before we arrived at the hotel we were told our reservations was cancelled. After a stressful flurry of emails the hotel agreed to honour the booking and we made our way down

The hotel is in a great location  and simply stunning.
However the front of staff are miserable and there is no welcome. As we approached the front desk there was a blonde receptionist who looked up and just looked miserable 
We checked in with ease and went to our room.
The room itself was tiny. And I was sure they put us in the staff quarters as the room opp we saw staff going in and out.
We went back to reception and they assured me that is what standard double room look like.

The room itself was very travel lodge.

The hotel knows it was my husband bday and they did give a wonderful bottle of prosecco and cake in the tiny room.

As we had dinner reservations I decided to run the bath and the water came out a mellow yellow. We then flushed the toilet and the toilet flushed something yellow too. Please see pictures
We immediately called the manager who came
Immediately with the maintenance man and we showed her the bath and toilet.

I thought it was sewage coming up.

And we gathered our things and waited in the lobby. The manager was awful . Absolutely condescending and patronising she was constantly telling us that all you came earlier on to complain about the room. Then after about 15 minutes she said I spoke to the maintenance man and he said all the water is running clear.So it’s very strange experience that

At this point my husband was absolutely furious 

She made the situation absolutely worse She couldn’t handle the situation it was beyond her control
And even the way that she was apologising she had
 this weird smirk on her face all the time

Anyhow the hotel upgraded us to a more luxury room.

Which was much nicer and bigger however it was two single beds pushed together to make a double

They also didn’t move the cake and Prosecco into our new room

We actually didn’t get to enjoy those two

However the restaurant and bar staff are absolutely amazing they’ve obviously been trained to incredibly high standard and perhaps the front of desk and take some tips.Although when it says breakfast is included please be aware it’s only continental breakfast

Overall I would never ever ever stay here again I feel if you’ve booked through another agent at this hotel you are treated almost like a second-class citizen

And the hotel itself although stunning lacks the complete five star experience

If you going to pay the money go Washington or the 
Mayfair hotel

It has really put my husband off spending his birthday in London again",2,2019,12,28
144,Perfect ,Lovely Boutique hotel in a great location so close to green park station. Had a lovely cosy room that which was beautifully furnished with a very comfortable bed that I would’ve happily stayed in all day so much so we didn’t make breakfast. All the staff were lovely and made the stay exceptional Thank you ,5,2019,12,28
144,An excellent stay,"From the moment we entered the hotel we were treated well.The staff were friendly, courteous and helpful.  The rooms were well apportioned and neat.  Housekeeping service was similarly excellent.  Special kudos go to the concierge staff who answered all our questions with consummate grace.",5,2019,12,26
144,Review,Good location and hotel overall . But electrical malfunction caused initial discomfort /we could not boil kettle as boiling kettle caused electrical fault. Maintenance attempted to resolve within the hour . But would have been ice to be offered welcome refreshments.,4,2019,12,26
144,Fabulous stay,Lovely room with everything you need For your stay including a great light up magnifying mirror in the bathroom. hotel in a in great location within 1 minute walk to Green Park tube station. The staff were very friendly and most helpful. Continental breakfast was excellent with a lot of choice. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would recommend this small luxury hotel.,5,2019,12,22
144,hotel review,"Great service and an ideal location. The staff is very friendly, the property is very clean and in good repair. I have srayed here several times. As I checked in I was greeted by name, and each time I entered the breakfast room I was also greeted by name. The hotel isn't large. it has a homey feeling. that  is nice in a large city. ",5,2019,12,16
144,Very average London hotel,"Except for the nicely furnished bedroom, this was nothing but the average London experience, possibly a bit worse as the bathroom was in need of a refurbishing (worktrip so a single room) and there was no water (AT ALL) from the time I arrived until the next day. Which was very inconvenien for me, as I was going to a big reception. I understand it wasn't the hotels fault, but they did absolutely nothing to remedy or alleviate my situation. Extraordinary situations is when you can judge a hotel, and here it performed just as any standard hotel. Didn't even suggest to arrange for a hairdresser where I could was my hair. The women at the reception seem untrained in basic service and understaing guests' needs, although the manager was very friendly. Breakfast was a better experience, good coffee and orange juice, although no hot food. Personally, its nothing I miss.",3,2019,12,15
144,A relaxing bar,"Went for a drink in the bar after dinner. The bar was warm, comfortable and very luxurious. Staff were great. Live music was playing. 
Concierge was very thoughtful. He really helped us out as we left. ",5,2019,12,15
144,Fleming’s Awful ,"I booked one night as a theatre stopover in London 
Arrived at check in 10:05pm
We asked for a restaurant table all closed even the bar no food!
Only room service.
We were cold wet and hungry! 
In room we showered and got ready to eat. 
Room service menu 
Remember this is supposed to be a 5 star Mayfair hotel
Chicken or vegetable panini 
Soup 
Prawn sandwich 
We ordered 2 Chicken panini and a prawn sandwich.

One hour later after chasing 
The stuff arrived.
Bad quality awful cheap nasty taste.
Breads were so poor quality.
Grim is the only way to describe it.

Fairgrounds or motorway cafes have better food than this menu. 

Beyond belief the problems continued..
Remember it’s election night probably the biggest in recent political history.
Our room tv had a fault and would not stay on longer than 2 minutes! 
Bed sheets rough and scratchy 
Bad nights sleep hungry.

Breakfast options only continental 
Again this was very poor like a cheap B&B offering. 
I will be complaining to the hotel group management and directors.
So disappointed that you spoiled our special pre Christmas evening out in London on election night. 

",1,2019,12,14
144,Very Disappointed,"Despite their small rooms, this used to be one of my favorites in London because of the service of their delightful staff. I have been here at least 5 times in the last two years; so I had an expectation. But this time I was utterly disappointed with my room - which has uncontrollable lighting. And by uncontrollable I meant the lights would go on at 3am, then off 5 minutes later, then on again at 3:30am, off again and so on. Apparently, I was told, it’s a ‘feature’ of automated lighting at the bathroom, which would go off in a few minutes if there was no movement. The problem was, the lighting-activation sensor was clearly faulty because no one was moving in the bathroom at 3am, and the bathroom has glass walls which meant my whole room was brighten up at 3am, then 3:30am, then 4am-ish... Basically it never stopped surprising me with random on and off. Luckily I was there for one night only. It’s either a stupid design that no one ever thought of fixing, or it’s haunted. Room 317.",2,2019,12,14
144,Oh dear!,"We lunched here at Ormer. Separate review.

The ladies' cloakroom has 2 cubicles. One had no paper except on an unopened roll on the floor, which had to be opened and put in place. The other cubicle was waterlogged with water on the floor. 5-star????",2,2019,12,13
144,Very Disappointed,"This is the worst 5 star hotel I have stayed in for a number of years. The room was very small and the bathroom in need of updating. The location of the hotel is good but I can't say the service was in anyway 5 star.
The TV system rebooted itself many times during the night making viewing difficult.
The English breakfast is something to be avoided; It cost 328.50 and you still had to pay for coffee and juice separately. There was no buffet and limited choice.
I could not recommend this hotel.
I've stayed in many 5 star boutique hotels in London and this is not unto stratch.",3,2019,12,13
144,Flemings stay,"Everything exceptional with Flemings on most occasions ….apart from the time you get one of their ""tiny"" rooms. Simply too small and not really what you would expect from a top end West-end hotel. Nearly had to move the bed to get the ironing board up!!   ",3,2019,12,13
144,Stunning,I stayed in 2 bed apartment. The greeting at check-in and service at check-out was superb. The location is absolutely fantastic. Very close to shops with plenty of restaurants nearby. Green Park Tube station is 5 minute walk away. Room was luxurious and absolutely spotless. Full stocked fridge with price list which was very reasonable.,5,2019,12,13
144,A London gem,"Our stay in Flemings was fabulous. Everything about the hotel was beautiful and the staff went out of their way to help.
We loved the accommodations, the location, the food and the ambiance. I will return.",5,2019,12,12
144,Lovely Stay,"Pleasant stay, impeccable welcome. Hotel very well located in relation to the Green Park metro station. The continental breakfast is very nice and hearty. The rooms are clean and cosy, silent hotel. The staff is very pleasant.",4,2019,12,12
144,OK - bit odd,"I found the stay ok.  Nothing more, nothing less.  The service was probably below the 'effortless professionalism' I would expect of a 5* establishment.  

Little things matter.

1. The concierge didnt call me back with an update on a reservation for dinner when I was told they would.  I had to chase them.

2. I was told I could not book a table for 2 at 7pm and had to come in at 6.45 pr 7.15.  When we arrived at 6.45 there were multiple tables of 2 and these remained empty until we left at 8.30.  Only 2 or 3 other tables were occupied. Odd

3.  There were only 3 coffee pods for a deluxe double room (there were 2 of us) odd

144,Hidden gem!,"I celebrated my birthday on Sunday 8th of December at their beautiful Drawing Room, and I must say, it has been a complete surprise, the atmosphere was ideal, and so was the room itself!

We were a group of six having the Traditional Afternoon Tea, and I would love to thank Elena and the wonderful staff in charge of the service for their time and for explaining every detail to us, it was my first time experiencing Afternoon Tea after just one year living in London and they surely made of my birthday an even greater day.

Highly recommended and will definitely come back.",5,2019,12,10
144,Mum and Daughter trip away together,Wow ! What a wonderful boutique hotel. Thank you so much. It’s started with a wonderful and very warm welcome from Alex when getting out the taxi.

Rooms are beautifully furnished and the apartments are amazing.",5,2019,12,04
144,"Excellent Hotel, Great Location","This was my second stay at the Flemings Mayfair.  Very nice boutique hotel and great central location that's walkable or a quick tube ride to much of London's main attractions.  Nice restaurants and lounge and friendly staff as well.  My only complaint is, depending on your room location, you can hear the underground trains running beneath you.",5,2019,12,03
144,Perfect,"We stay perfectly in this hotel, amazing restaurant and staff, good choice, we will repeat next time. The location is perfect, just in middle between piccadilly and hyde park. Rooms are spacious and confortable.  ",5,2019,12,03
144,Beautiful Hotel,"We love Flemings. It is a beautiful hotel in the heart of Mayfair with service that is second to none.

We will return again and again!",5,2019,12,02
144,Wonderful Hotel,"This boutique hotel is just a gem.  Perfect location in Westminster to easily get around and see the sights.    Everyone was so friendly and helpful.

144,"Great location, lovely service and rooms.","Great location, great welcome and rooms.

Some communication issues with staff at breakfast.

I also feel you shouldn't be charged extra for a hot breakfast and I thought the continental was a little limited.

Phone in room also didn't work so I had to use my mobile to call the hotel to get an iron sent to our room.",4,2019,11,30
144,Nice experience,"Friendly staff, but for the price we payed - we definately think breakfast should have been included. This was our second stay with the Fleming, it's excellently placed near Piccadilly in Central London. Standard double beds a little narrow.",4,2019,11,27
144,When Facts meet Expectations,"Perfect for your stay in London either for business or for pleasure.
Location: close to Leicester Square, a few minutes' walk away from Buckingham Palace.
Fully refurbished rooms.
Nice English atmosphere in a period house building.",5,2019,11,26
144,Never stay here again,"Although Flemings Hotel is classified as a five star Hotel, this hotel as Per my experience should be 3 stars hotel or less. 
The room are so tied and small.
Noise and you can’t sleep.
The towel and room carpet are not clean and smell bad.
The room furniture is so old and ugly.
The bathroom is so bad.
The room has no drawers !!! So I keep my socks and underwear on the ground.
The breakfast has no variety at all only limited types.
The street is always closed and I need to park my car far  away from the hotel.
I really have a very bad experience with Flemings Hotel and I would not ever ever stay here again and I would not recommend it to anyone.
Only the location. ",2,2019,11,25

144,Perfect hotel,"Very good hotel with a perfect service. the only regret is not to see outside from my room.
The bar is very cool and breakfast is very good. I also appreciated the Gym room open 24h/24h. Everybody is king",5,2019,11,24
144,One Night stay,"I was very excited to stay at a Hotel in Mayfair. Unfortunately if you’re traveling with a Average Buget I wouldn’t recommend it.
The rooms ver small the view out of the windows showing nothing more the a backyard full of Tristesse and noisy AC‘s. 
Very overheated 🥵 
Service excellent I have to say",3,2019,11,24
144,A perfect hotel in a prefect location,"A hotel located perfectly for my work and my wife's activities while we were in London.

144,"Shabby hotel: not worth the money, or 5 stars","The hotel room was shabby, it looked like it hadn’t been updated since the 90s. Very bad nights sleep with staff coming in and out a laundry room, slamming doors. Also the bar doesn’t stay open for guests. Not worth the money. There are much nicer places to stay/ ",2,2019,11,20
144,Recommend,"The Hotel is very well located, a few steps from Green Park Staion, thus really close to the Hyde Park, Buckingham Palace and Piccadilly. The staff were gentile and breakfast was amazing. Would recommend",5,2019,11,19
144,A pleasant surprise,"First time I stayed here, and I liked it. Small but very comfortable room. Great location for walking in the area and around.

Perhaps the pillows were a bit hard, other than that it  was easy check in and access to the room, easy check out and that's how I like it. 

Didn't have breakfast or any other meals so can't judge.",4,2019,11,18

144,Secret treasure in Mayfair,"This place is my secret treasure, so much value for the money. The rooms are nice and tastefully decorated. The location is fantastic. If you are looking for a nice but still classy hotel with comfortable rooms this is great. This is probably not where you find the trendy elite guests but close enough to all those restaurants and bars where they go to. This is s place where you are in the center but private.",5,2019,11,16
144,Mixed.,"My three stars reflects our experience relative to what one expects from a luxury boutique hotel in Mayfair. I wanted to like this hotel, and overall our experience was fine. But there were problems with the arrival (room not ready on time). The room itself was ok but had very little natural light.  And the building seems to be right above one or more subway lines--one hears/feels the rumble as trains go by (thankfully this stops for 5-6 hours overnight). Breakfast was good, Location is convenient, including to Green Park station and some excellent restaurants.",3,2019,11,13
144,exceptional hotel,"The hotel is super well located in mayfair close to green park metro station. The staff of the hotel is very nice, friendly and helpful. The room is big and very nice as well. The only thing which could be improved is the isolation of the room from the noise of the corridor. But I did not have any issue with this.",5,2019,11,13
144,Best Hotel in Mayfair Section of London,This boutique hotel is fabulous....the rooms are absolutely beautiful and the proximity to everything is perfect.  The staff is super friendly and helpful.  The bar and drinks are better than any bar in London...will definitely stay there again.,5,2019,11,09
144,Honeymoon Suite Was Perfection,"As Day 1-4 on our honeymoon I could not have asked for a better hotel or service. It is absolutely beautiful and they upgraded us to a junior suite on the first floor which was lovely. The food there is delicious and I can’t rave enough about the professional service you’ll receive from the staff, especially Charlie. He works with the concierge service and was always there with a helpful tip and a huge smile. We actually looked forward to seeing him every day! I highly recommend staying at this luxurious hotel and definitely try the afternoon tea in the Drawing Room if you have time :)",5,2019,11,08
144,"SLH Hotel, but not 5 star, in good location","We stayed for 5 nights at this hotel and found it very well located but not really meeting up to the expectations we have of a luxury hotel. On the surface everything is neat so to speak, it`s when breaking through the polished shell that you realise the hotel still has some steps to climb before it is up there in the true luxury segment.
The rooms are rather small, the corridors are narrow with (in our case) 4-5 parting doors to go through with a few steps up and down from the elevator to our room which makes it complicated carrying luggage. There is one single elevator serving the whole hotel making the journey to and from the lower ground breakfast room a time consuming challenge as all guests have breakfast more or less at the same time. It does not help either when the staff (!) is using the elevator for transport of cleaning material during the busy morning hours, blocking it for minutes on end while guests are queing up on every floor.. (see pic)
The breakfast itself is a decent continental buffet without any hot food. Eggs etc. can be ordered at additional cost. The breakfast room is in the basement and being without any curtains, fabric or carpet becomes very loud and canteen-like when busy. On top, it feels like the staff, though friendly, is participating in a race which will never end. They are not quite on top of things, running around trying to please everyone but often being a step behind. 
We did not visit the restaurant but went to the bar a few times which was nice with a good choice of drinks.
The turn down service in our room was forgotten one night and when we complained the manager called the day after to apologise but did not compensate with anything (like a bottle of something for example). 
When checking out, as members of SLH we had a voucher for some nights but the staff could not handle that and we had to call SLH ourselves to organise the administration of it all.
All in all, for us being frequent hotel guests around the world it feels like Flemings is still on an internship to become a true SLH member. That genuine luxurious feeling of being totally taken care of is yet missing.",3,2019,11,08
144,Beautiful hotel,"Stayed here to attend a business event in Mayfair. This is a lovely hotel. From the greeting by the doorman and the reception staff and porters, the service was incredible. So efficient, friendly and helpful. We also had drinks in the bar and the barmen were so good. Rooms are very nice with everything you need. We had continental breakfast which surpassed my expectations. I recommend this hotel highly ",5,2019,11,08
144,Mayfair Luxury,A beautiful elegant hotel on Half Moon Street where you are welcomed at the door with a smiling face. Our room was a Junior Suite which was absolutely gorgeous & full of luxury with everything you need. The bar was a great stop after dinner with excellent service. Cant wait to go & stay again.,5,2019,11,06
144,Affordable Luxury In Mayfair,"Having 3 kids, we find it difficult and extremely expensive to stay in Hotels however Flemings have 2 bedroom units that we could comfortably stay in.

I rang head to let them know if possible we'd like an early check in as we arrived around 8.30am. I was expecting a 12pm to 2pm offer that you usually get from hotels. however since we were exhausted from a travels half way around the world, the front desk updated us to the Penthouse which was immediately available. My daughter also suffers from travel sickness so she was sick once we got to the hotel which the staff were very accommodating and and helpful with.

The location of the hotel is second to and Flemings made our London stay!",5,2019,11,05
144,Saturday Night Treat,"Champagne in our room on arrival, superb 3 course dinner with accompanying wines then a nightcap in the Drawing Room before retiring to our room with a movie and popcorn. Followed by breakfast in our room the following morning. What more could you want... 
Pleasant and helpful staff, comfortable room and fantastic food in the Ormer restaurant. Give it a try you will not be disappointed.",5,2019,11,04
144,Fabulous Find,"great location for this perfect hotel. Just around the corner from Green Park Tube Station and close to Mayfair.  This is my hotel of choice in London.  Rooms are on the small side, but then they all are in London.  Reasonably priced if you can get it on a deal.",5,2019,11,04
144,A great place to stay in London,"The hotel, the staff and the GM are all pampering you during your stay. It is very well situated and some appartments have their own entrance. We highly recommend the hotel as it is also extremly well situated. ",5,2019,11,04
144,Terrible. Not worth the money,"This is not a 5 star experience by any mean. Rooms are ran down, with old facilities that do not work. It is not worth the money you pay.Location is great but for that money you can find better alternatives.Please go elsewhere else",1,2019,10,30
144,Excellent high-end hotel,"Great hotel with high levels of customer service and very stylish rooms. We stayed using a MasterCard special offer that bundled together room, dinner, breakfast, a bottle of champagne upon arrival and a movie with popcorn and it was excellent value for money but made a weekend trip to London for the theatre into a really relaxing but “wow” weekend. ",5,2019,10,29
144,Business Trip to London,"This is the 2nd time I have stayed with Flemings Mayfiar and this stay was just as good as the first.  The room was spacious (I stayed in one of their Townhouse rooms), bed was amazings and I got a great nights sleep.  I also had dinner iin Ormer with a colleague and it was also top class.  Its location is also spt on, very close to where I needed to be.  Will ceertainly be staying here again :-)",5,2019,10,29
144,An excellent hotel!!  Highly recommend,My daughter and I stayed for 6 nights in a double room. When I booked I was worried the room would be too small but it was just perfect for the two of us. The room was clean and very comfortable and we thoroughly enjoyed our time. Staff were so friendly and welcoming. The hotel was beautifully decorated for the fall and we enjoyed two nights at the Manetta Bar for drinks and it is a gorgeous space with the best staff. Highly recommend the hotel and we intend to return. Thank you Michael from the conceirge who was so friendly. ,5,2019,10,28

144,An excellent Hotel,"Overall we had an amazing time at the Flemings Mayfair. The hotel stuff were extremelly nice, the 2 bedroom suite was very comfurtable. breakfast was great,! the location is superb, (went for a run at the park every morning)

",5,2019,10,26
144,"Flemings - comfortable, friendly hotel","A very convenient location for the west end. The staff were extremely friendly and attentive. Our ground floor bedroom room was clean, well furnished and very convenient at the price of feeling as if we were not within the body of the Hotel. Some rooms apparently have a shower above bath as did ours - we could/should have specified a walk in shower.
We chose to have the Full English Breakfast which was well prepared  but disappointing. 
Overall a good choice of hotel save for a very ordinary breakfast.",3,2019,10,25
144,Perfect for Foodies,"The location is close to wonderful restaurants and high end shopping. Catholic church is 7min walk. very safe neighborhood surrounded by embassies. Quiet street at night. Green park is closest tube station and less than 5 min walk. If you stay on the 1st floor, we could hear the Piccadilly line go through at night occasionally. But I didn't mind it.
",5,2019,10,24
144,Good but not perfect,"Some rooms not of the same quality even though it is of the same category. When I came in January 2019, I booked an Executive King room which was really nice. However for this trip I booked the same category but the room/bathroom was not nice at all. Had to upgrade😓",4,2019,10,24
144,Amazing stay,"I stayed 5 days and was very pleased with Flemings, the Location is perfect, my studio suit was spacious and very clean ( i stayed in ground floor)and very near to the side exit which is a plus. Definitely staying there again",5,2019,10,22
144,Excellent!,"Loved our stay at this hotel, beautiful room, super friendly staff and made to feel very welcome. Perfect for a weekend in central London.

144,short stay,I brought my Mum to flemings for a short break. The staff were excellent. Breakfast very good. the first room we were in was very noisy and small both of us were woken early by construction outside. There was no difficulty moving room and were given a beautiful room on the second night. We will be back.,5,2019,10,20
144,Birthday Trip ,"Super boutique hotel, great location for shopping ! I use a crutch and found the hotel easy enough for get around only one lift but that’s what you get in an older hotel.  Buses are frequent on Piccadilly and taxis easy. However,  if you are able bodied then you can walk everywhere easily. 
Fabulous bright room at the front of hotel , it was really good for me to have a walk in shower. Yes there is  big new hotel being refurbished/ built opposite so it is sort of noisy during the day but not awful.  Didn’t bother us at night. 
Murano is a great restaurant and just round  corner , also Burgers and Lobster, shepherds market good for busy bars. 
Breakfast excellent with brilliant staff. Doorman was fab. 
Will definitely return. 
Flew in by plane So £10 in taxi from Paddington and back by train  £17 to kings cross. ",4,2019,10,20
144,"comfort and convenience, a quiet oasis in busy London","We were warmly welcomed by staff, though our room could not be provided until after 2 PM, which although understandable, would have been most welcome a bit earlier after an overnight trans-Atlantic flight.  

The room was well appointed and quiet, much appreciated when recovering from jet lag.   It was not overly large, however, with just enough room to squeeze past the foot of the bed by the (non-functional) fireplace.  The package included continental breakfast buffet, which was well provided with choices, and the breakfast restaurant staff were very helpful. 

Front desk and concierge staff were friendly and helped with local information and umbrellas for rainy weather. ",4,2019,10,18
144,Closet for a Room...,Quite simply... I will not return to this Hotel if they are going to stick me in a closet when I paid for a room... The closet we were given looks nothing like their promotional information for the Hotel. Three nights of hell.,2,2019,10,09
144,Poor service and tube noise!,"Bottles of water weren’t in room on check in. The person who showed me to my room was to send but none arrived. Had to ask at front desk. 
Asked for luggage rack when my luggage was delivered but it never arrived.  Used a chair instead. 
All calls to reception were never answered and instead went to voicemail instead. This is poor. 
Also the tube noise in my ground floor room was maddening. I paid in advance for two nights and left on third day to go check in at another hotel  ",3,2019,10,07
144,Lovely stay in the heart of London,Super boutique luxury hotel bang in the middle of Mayfair. My wife and I had a wonderful stay and hope to return in the not too distant future.the stay was made special by the staff who without exception all showed the sunniest of disposition and gave the highest of service.,5,2019,10,05
144,Very poor first impression ,"After a 10 hour flight we were looking forward to resting.  We arrived at the hotel at check in time at 2:00 but the room was not ready.  There was no apology, no offer of a glass of water, no explanation or even an offer of a comfortable place to sit while we wait.  I have written many trip advisor reviews but never gave one star.  There is construction all over the place, very noisy.  Terrible, terrible service!!!",1,2019,10,04
144,Great location but uncomfortable rooms,"The staff is friendly and the concierge did an amazing job recommending restaurants and things to do. However, the rooms are extremely small and the bed is too small for 2 people. Mattress and pillows were very uncomfortable. ",3,2019,10,02
144,A gem in Mayfair,"This was our first visit to London and Flemings was suggested by our travel agent.  From the doorman to the concierge, from the bartenders to the restaurant manager, the staff was friendly, knowledgeable and professional.  They made our stay a real treat.  ",5,2019,10,01
144,Boutique Excellence,"Our travel agent booked our London stay at Flemings Mayfair and we are so glad she did.  The location is perfect; close to Piccadilly, close to the Tube, excellent staff and beautifully decorated and appointed.

144,Perfect,"Best hotel we have stayed in London. Staff are fabulous, friendly, courteous and very helpful. Beautiful hotel in a lovely quite side street in Mayfair. Room 101, small deluxe had all the amenities of a larger room and was very quite. Breakfast was a lovely experience too, excellent service and food of a very good quality. An excellent experience from start to finish. Looking forward to our return",5,2019,10,01
144,Lovely hotel - but  customer service related challenges,"First of all - the positive aspects of our stay:  Lovely hotel! Room was well appointed with a very comfortable bed,  great ensuite - quite spacious by London standards. Lobby and hotel generally were immaculate.

Had afternoon tea in the Drawing Room. Friendly, prompt servers  - enjoyed it immensely!

Breakfast was included - staff gave the impression of being hurried - not very friendly. Also, when you order tea - they give you ""ready made"" tea in a small tea pot, and the tea tastes like it has been sitting for a while - so the assumption is that they make in large quantities. I heard the table beside also, also complaining. The staff were reluctant to give us just a normal tea bag in boiling water. Said that they ""didn't do that"". Other than that, the continental breakfast was adequate. 

Our issue with the hotel was a security breach. A man entered our room without knocking or notice. He simply walked in. When he saw the room was occupied, stated that he was going to be putting things in the next room so would be noisy. As there was only one female in the room in her night clothes at the time, it was very disconcerting and upsetting. 

Upon reporting this issue  to the front desk, they said they would look into it. A couple of hours later, I went back to the front desk, and asked to speak to a manager as I was very upset. One of the 3 staff members at the front desk said she was a manager so I was speaking to the right person. She said a few times that she didn't think it was a staff member but someone doing work in the hotel.  I questioned whether an outside person would have guest keys and she said yes. I have written to the hotel, but haven't heard back as I feel strongly that this is a breach of security and I am definitely not satisfied with the answer I received at the front desk or the hotel's response.",2,2019,09,30
144,One night stay,"An excellent establishment with helpful and friendly staff, the concierge was quick to respond to our requests. Small but comfortable room and an excellent continental breakfast selection. We would definitely stay here again for a weekend break. ",5,2019,09,29
144,A great hotel in the heart of Mayfair/Picadilly,"I had a very nice stay at Flemings, the hotel is fully renovated with an elegant yet eclectic decor. The room was small, which was fine for my needs (and typical for the area), fully up-to-date and the bathroom was very well laid out to maximize the space -- and the bathroom floor was HEATED, such a bonus and so classy. Everyone I met was professional and very nice. I had two good meals in the Drawing Room and a nice drink in Manetta's Bar. I would definitely stay at Flemings when in London again, highly recommend.",5,2019,09,28
144,Simply Charming,"Charming hotel very central to shops, restaurants and the palace! About 10-20min from most attractions. With limited time to explore the city this made the day enjoyable. 

Beautiful decor with a variety of room size options. As a single traveler my room was fitting with a twin size bed without much excess of space. Also on check out day thought it was lovely fresh flowers and a note were left to bid my stay was satisfactory. Highly recommend staying here!

",5,2019,09,27
144,Great hotel,"A great hotel in a great location with friendly staff and very comfortable beds. The breakfast was good, considering that it was included in the room rate, but I would have expected there to be eggs which actually came as an extra.",5,2019,09,26
144,Week end in london,"We spent a perfect weeks end in London with my mum. The hotel has a good location, not too far from Piccadilly circus. Room is confortable, clean, quiet. Staff was really nice with us. We enjoyed the attention in the room when we checked in. ",5,2019,09,25
144,Second to none....,"I have stayed at Flemings a few times and each time, it gets better and better.

The levels of service are impeccable, nothing is too much and you are greeted by staff who are smiley. friendly and knowledgeable in each and every department of the hotel, you leave feeling like you have made a whole bunch of new friends. The hotel itself, is well cared for, comfortable, clean and just generally beautiful.

I always find myself, trying to find an excuse to visit London so I can come back!

144,Amazing staff in an incredible location,"By far the best service we had received at a Hotel, located in the heart of Mayfair within walking distance of the trendiest restaurants and bars in the area.

144,MyVisit to London,"Everything was perfect. I could not have asked for better, more attentive service from beginning to
end. The seats that Andrew got me were excellent and he was not given that much notice.
Both rooms were quiet and I really appreciated that my second did not require stairs as my
suitcase became rather heavy during my trip! Every time I went into the restaurant for Maria and
Natalie always greeted me as though I was a long-lost friend, which I hope to become. I do not know
the names of the Head Waiter or his assistants at dinner, but they made me feel very oomfortable
as a single woman dining along. And the food was original and delicious. It is hard to return to
my own Kitchen! ",5,2019,09,13
144,Excellent City Hotel,"perfect location in London for our family city trip to enjoy sightseeing and shopping
friendly staff, excellent breakfast, nice cocktails at Manettas Bar, small but clean rooms with renovated bath, nice that we could hire the hotel car to get to the airport

",5,2019,09,13
144,Fantastic ,"Stayed here while on business.  Absolutely amazing!
The complementary bottle of wine in the room was a very nice touch.
The cocktail bar is fantastic.  
I can recommend the Lobster Burger
Will definitely stay here again!",5,2019,09,13
144,Perfect week in London,"Fleming’s was fantastic.  The entire staff was friendly, knowledgeable, and helpfull.  Our room and bathroom were always clean.  The mattress was firm.  The furnishings were attractive.  Even though the hotel is a half block from Piccadilly, it was always serenely quiet.  If you want a great holiday in  London, start every morning with a lavish Flemings breakfast, and end every day with a wonderful night’s sleep in your Fleming’s sanctuary bedroom.",5,2019,09,12
144,Cocktail Weekend,"Stayed at The Fleming Mayfair and was an excellent choice.
The hotel staff are very friendly and helpful, the hotel is very clean and the rooms are very comfortable.
We used the bar which was very good  and the breakfast was amazing lots of choices and all fresh.
Also the location of the hotel is perfect for visiting London.
We will definitely be coming back .",5,2019,09,11
144,"Lovely stay, great location","Wonderfully helpful staff, clean rooms, comfortable beds, small basic gym, yummy breakfast, walking distance to sights and Soho, Green Park just across street at the corner (good place to go for a jog or a walk). Highly recommended!!",5,2019,09,10
144,Perfect hotel!,The hotel staff was extremely friendly and helpful! Only stayed one night but wishing we were able to stay longer. Location was perfect if using public transportation and in walking distance of restaurants and parks. Highly recommend! ,5,2019,09,10
144,Very pleasant stay,"Hotel is in a good location close to the tube and many nice restaurants and bars.
The staff are all very professional and pleasant. Breakfast was delicious and we also had a drink in the Bar in the evening that serves wast selection of drinks in a very nice atmosphere.
Our room was nice with good amenities and comfortable bedding, however much smaller than expected. We booked double deluxe and had nowhere to put our cases. I would not like to see the size of the basic rooms. For the price of the rooms I would expect more space. That is the only negative.
",4,2019,09,10
144,Best little secret in Mayfair!!!!,Could not have been more welcoming and accommodating.  Bathrooms and bedroom decor so very sheik.  Perfect location!  Look forward to returning.  Will tell everyone I know who'll listen!  The staff had great memories and were perfect!  We were there 4 days!,5,2019,08,28
144,Nice people,"Small noisy room and found our room being cleaned as we returned from breakfast,  to cap it all we were asked "" ambushed"" out of the nluefor £5 per night gratuity as we left which seemed very cheeky, we were definitely  not happy as we walked out of the door.",3,2019,08,26
144,Faultless,"Faultless, nothing was too much trouble.  Rooms are stylish and comfortable. Ormer restaurant was superb, food is excellent and service impeccable.  Everything we had from the menu was delicious and beautifully presented.",5,2019,08,25
144,Excellent location and friendly staff.,Excellent location and friendly staff with super service. The Double Deluxe room is smaller than what is shown in the official website. The photo of the Double Deluxe Room is kind of misleading. Thanks ,5,2019,08,23
144,A gem in the heart of Mayfair,"We really appreciated the great position of this hotel - in walking distance of the pubs and eateries of nearby Shepherds market, Piccadilly and many tourist attractions.  Rooms, and especially bathrooms are smaller than we’re used to but quiet and we slept well.  The buffet breakfast is fantastic - loved it. All staff very idly and professional - highly recommended hotel.",5,2019,08,23
144,Experience not to be repeated ,"We chose this hotel based on other people’s reviews. I booked two executive rooms (it says in booking.com each is 30m2). First of all the room was way too small to be 30 m2, (3.3x 4.0 m) the bathroom was very small too (2.0 x 0.8 m excluding the shower) but well maintained.
The A/C didn’t work well and I couldn’t sleep at night. They failed to fix the A/C in many trials. The staff including the manager didn’t help as they say they are fully booked. But one staff offered that I upgrade myself to a suite !! 
One of the rooms has a seating area and the other one doesn’t! 

Room walls sound isolation is poor.

Breakfast was limited but just OK for continental. Service was slow, you need to repeat the order twice most of the times to get what you want. 

Staff were welcoming 

There is construction going on in front of the hotel that forced the taxi to stop about 50 meters away from the hotel entrance but we were lucky the bellboy noted our arrival and came over to help with the luggage.

I didn’t like the location, More central would be definitely better. ",1,2019,08,21
144,Weekend Stay,"We have stayed in many hotels in London including the Savoy and the Ritz.  We were so pleasantly surprised at how nice this hotel is, probably one of our favourite places to stay in London from now on.  It offers everything we want in a hotel, your staff are so helpful, professional and friendly which makes a huge difference.  We had a very comfortable stay indeed, our room was just perfect for a one night stay.   Look forward to coming back in the future.   ",5,2019,08,19
144,Good hotel but....,"We stayed at this hotel for 1 night, and the hotel is lovely. We had a room on the ground floor and it was a little more compact than we were expecting, but still good. Had some late evening drinks in the bar, good ambiance, default measures are 50ml, so one to note! Staff were friendly and helpful. Only real negative was that we had a room on the ground floor and you could hear noise from the underground trains. ",4,2019,08,18
144,Great hotel in the perfect location!,We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Mayfair!  Perfect location for visiting the sites in London.  Service and facility were excellent.  Just a block or so from a number of delightful cafes in Shepherd's Market. highly recommend!,5,2019,08,18
144,Offer too good to be true,"Thought we had found a wonderful offer to lure us to London for a long weekend. Our first impression was that the room was very small and basic but ok for the money. Whilst getting ready for dinner the air conditioning machine started spewing out water all over my husband's suitcase. Clothes were soaked but owing to level of heat in room we knew we would need to use the air con to sleep. Informed reception who were so obsessed with getting us into a basic room, first of all offered us a room with a weird smell and then secondly gave us a single room, one bed side table etc. Room had a see through and hear through en suite facilities. These en suites are a definite no for me. There was little concern as to how we were to dry out my husband's clothes or indeed if there had been any damages. Appreciate we booked a deal but we also selected a supposedly five star hotel in Mayfair. This was well below any other luxury hotel we have stayed in before in the same area and we had a certain expectation and Flemings for us has fallen well short.",2,2019,08,18
144,Afternoon Tea,"We booked in advance although it wasn't really necessary. £34.50 per person for afternoon tea. We arrived and was seated in a pleasant bit small room and the menu was nervously explained by our trainee waiter . After a short while the tea arrived, it was very disappointing. Only 8 small finger sandwiches , they were quite tasty but you could tell that they weren't freshly prepared , they weren't replaced either after they had been eaten. Scones next but served with Chantilly cream instead of clotted cream with strawberry jam. My small scone wasn't cooked inside , I called over the waitress and it was dealt with without fuss. The cakes were disappointing and we left them. Only one refill of tea was allowed also. We left feeling let down and slightly ripped off to be honest. Once the obligatory 12.5% service charge had been added it came to nearly £78. On the plus side the staff were very nice and polite. A costly mistake of which we won't be repeating",2,2019,08,15
144,"Beautiful, large room centrally located in London","We loved staying at Flemings during a three day trip to London. Mayfair is very close to posh restaurants, cafes and Hyde Park. Also the Green Park tube is right around the corner and from there you can get to almost anywhere in the city. ",5,2019,08,14
144,Nice... but....,"All was nice as one would expect; however the bed was old and saggy.... not up to par with others in the area such as the Stafford or Dukes.  I travel to London about every 8 weeks...for many years, so I am very familiar with all of the 4-5 star hotels in the Mayfair and St. James neighborhoods.",4,2019,08,13
144,Our new favourite London hotel,Wow!!! Such amazing service from all the staff - especially Katia on reception and Camillia in the breakfast restaurant. Their vegan dish (avocado & mung beans) at breakfast was the tastiest breakfast I've ever had at any hotel. And in such a great location too so close to Green Park.,5,2019,08,12
144,Amazing All Around ,"Returning to Fleming’s after far too long, we found an wonderfully updated hotel with exceptional service.
Our accommodations: a 2 bedroom apartment and a 2 bedroom penthouse were elegantly but comfortable furnished. Full kitchen washer drawer, room service, housekeeping. Small markets nearby for snacks and light drinks for the refrigerator. 
The concierge and his staff helped with various needs including reservation recommendations, a piece of lost luggage.
The doormen were especially helpful to hail cabs and unload our van as there’s some construction  in the street.

A wonderful location central to every part of London, Fleming’s provided a wonderful family vacation.  ",5,2019,08,07
144,Excellent Hotel,"Thoroughly recommend this wonderful hotel. Staff are exceptional under the guidance of the very experienced General Manager.  One of the very best hotels in London. Fantastic breakfast and service, cannot fault anything. Rooms are comfortable and very well equipped, try an apartment for an amazing experience.",5,2019,08,06
144,Real Customer Care. ,"What a fabulous and personal hotel!
Sadly I saw very little if it..... That was due to the fact I left in an ambulance at 7AM...
Had a horrible night with gallbladder infection, the reception staff were incredibly helpful through a painful night. 

Even providing an extra room so I could find some pain release in a bath and allowing my wife to get some sleep. 

Flemings Mayfair went beyond for me, as someone who spends upwards of 100 nightsper year in hotels, it's not often I can say that! 

I'll stay again, hopefully get to try the breakfast! 

Thank you Flemings ",5,2019,08,06
144,I would give this hotel 10 stars if possible!,"We absolutely LOVED our brief stay at the Flemmings Mayfair! We were there with our two teenage children celebrating our 20th anniversary and the hotel went above and beyond to make the whole experience so special! We had two rooms booked, but when we checked in, we were surprised with an upgrade to a 2 bedroom apartment!!! The room (which was really like 8 rooms!) was gorgeous, well-appointed, spacious, and sparklingly clean. Left for us in the room were a dozen red roses and a delicious cake with a Happy 20th Anniversary message scrawled in chocolate - such a special touch. Every single member of the staff from the front desk to concierge to the bartenders were so professional, polite, friendly and helpful. Also, I don't think you could ask for a better location for sight-seeing in London. Tons of shops and restaurants and sights all in walking distance - it was perfect. My only problem with the stay was that I wish it had been longer! We will definitely return to this property next time we are in London!",5,2019,08,06
144,Gorgeous Mayfair gem,Delightful hotel with amazing staff.  Real desire to create a friendly welcoming atmosphere with super professional service. Terrific attention to detail and the room interior design is top quality where everything has been carefully considered and perfectly executed.,5,2019,08,05
144,Fabulous niche hotel,Great ambience & beautiful rooms & friendly service; and delicious breakfast ! Also it was a very convenient location for travelers from tube/train. We can’t simply ask more for this hotel! It’s simply wonderful! ,5,2019,08,05
144,looking forward to return!,"My London favourite!
New renovated rooms. New restaurant. High quality breakfast. Nice staff. 
Best located directly in front of Green Park.
And London Mayfair with Sheperd Market is just a two minute walk away.
",4,2019,08,05
144,Manetta’s bar ,"I had never heard of this bar , in the basement of Flemings Hotel in Mayfair until a saw a little Time Out offer for burger / macaroni cheese and two cocktails ( at a brilliant price )so I thought we would try it out .
What a lovely place it is , kind of Art Deco glamour . We went on a sunny Sunday afternoon in August and to be honest I think it’s more of a winter or evening place so it was very quiet , but lovely nonetheless .
Our burger and macaroni cheese were delicious and our gin &tonics too. 
There is a fabulous looking restaurant which was closed on Sunday but we will definitely visit again.
My only criticism would be that our coffees were cold to start with but were quickly replaced when we asked . Even the second time round my flat white wasn’t a very good one.
But definitely worth a visit .
",5,2019,08,05
144,Great hotel in a great location,"We were looked after very well at Flemings Mayfair and thoroughly enjoyed our stay.   The beds are really comfortable with crisp white sheets and the bathroom very clean too, with fluffy white towels - what more could you want from somewhere to rest your head!",5,2019,08,04
144,Terrible experience - do not stay here!!!,"First of all, the hotel did not advise us of the road closure from the main road. Secondly there is a massive building construction directly across the road. Upon check in, I asked why hotel did not advise us of the construction across the road and of the road closure from the main road. She simply skirted around the topic and just did not address my concern. When I asked the same receptionist where we could get a casual dinner nearby, she just asked us to ask the concierge. When my husband asked the concierge, he simply said just ""walk to the main road and look for a restaurant there"".  He clearly was not interested in helping any customer unless we were to buy something where he can earn a commission.

Here comes the ‘highlight’ of our stay – housekeeping staff trespassing into our room without knocking, breaching our privacy using the masterkey whilst we were inside the room. Not once, but TWICE across two different days and left rubbish bag ON MY SUITCASE.

All started on second day of our stay when somebody loudly banging on our door and demand us to open the door, I opened the door to a maintenance staff who I am assuming wasn't expecting to see a guest and therefore quickly left. I closed the door and didn’t think anything of it. I proceeded to start getting ready for shower. Then within few minutes, I heard someone using a room key and a housekeeping lady just walked inside our room without knocking. She then proceeded to ask me if the maintenance guy fixed the bathroom?.At which point she realised I am a guest then she just let herself out. I called the front desk straight away and I was assured it won't happen again.

Then came third day of our stay, whilst my husband was in the shower, a housekeeping staff used their masterkey WITHOUT KNOCKING once again just entered our room, came inside, then she saw me and tried to exit but then opened it AGAIN to come in to asked me if I have seen her blue garbage bag WHICH WAS ON MY SUITCASE.

I have never experienced this poor level of service anywhere before, let alone a supposed 5 star boutique hotel where we paid alot of money for. To top it off, they didn't want to provide monetary compensation and I had to negotiate my own way into a measly 50% discount for ONE night plus complimentary breakfast on our last day. I reluctantly accepted the offer as we were in a rush to leave but I do not deem this compensation as sufficient.

Heed our advice, DO NOT STAY AT THIS HOTEL.

",1,2019,08,04
144,Terrible Service,"We arrived at Flemings Mayfair and for some reason they would not allow us to take our own bags to our room although we needed to be at afternoon tea in a little over an hour. After repeated calls and 45 minutes of waiting our bags finally got to our room even when they knew of us needing to be somewhere. 

Over our stay I twice asked if they could bring an iron up to the room as throughout our travels my dress shirts got wrinkled. After waiting over an hour in a half both times I finally gave up as they never came.

Our room was also situated on the second level and directly across from us was construction going on that woke us up every morning. 

We even got the deluxe room and for the price of this place I am sure you can find somewhere with better service. 

The bar did serve great drinks though.",2,2019,08,02
144,good stay,"all perfect, staff super kind. room clean. functional gym.
breakfast very good. position excellent. good quality of sleep. bed very comfortable. staff helpful .
   check out perfect even if  I was a bit late",4,2019,08,02
144,Very Pleasantly Surprised,"We had trouble finding a decent and still affordable hotel as London was almost fully booked over the Pentecost weekend. So we gave this hotel a try although fearing that, having booked a standard room, we would end up in a tiny run down closet.

We were more than delighted when we entered our room (no upgrade!): absolutely gorgeous, cozy and with enough space for our three large suitcases. There was some noise during the day from the room attendants who had their storeroom next door, but apart from that the room was absoultely quiet and we slept like babies. Evening turndown service was provided.

Continental breakfast buffet was more than sufficient and the breakfast room was attractive and quiet.

Staff at breakfast was attentive and courteous. Same went for front desk and door man.

Location couldn't have been better: Piccadilly just around the corner, Green Park tube station just a few steps away.

Flemings Mayfair will be amongst our first choices in the future when coming to London.",5,2019,07,30
144,"Great Location, All the rest is Average","Located a short walk from Green Park, the Hotel has an excellent location. The actual street is quiet which is super helpful. HOWEVER, it was only prior to checking in that we were advised that the street the hotel is based in is closed, taxi's prefer not to enter and that the whole street, on the other side is under construction.

The hotel room was spacious. For the price we paid, over 5 nights it should have been. It is bizarre that they charge you extra if you want a hot breakfast, really, paying literally many hundred of pounds for the room and you want to charge some pounds more for eggs in the morning. Ridiculous.

The Concierge was super helpful with Restaurant bookings. The continental breakfast is average. We will not be returning. There are lots of other places to try.",3,2019,07,29
144,We Will Be Back!,"From the very moment we were welcomed in to the hotel, to the beautiful room, the lovely meals & the very friendly & ‘human’ service as a whole, we had an utterly wonderful time.

For Once, A Truly Faultless Hotel Experience... Well Done!!",5,2019,07,29
144,Outstanding Option for Long Term Stay,"My husband and I are renovating our flat in London and needed a home away from home while visiting for two weeks.  The accommodations were perfect, modern and great kitchen, washer/dryer, spacious living and bath and 1/2.  The staff went over and above to insure our comfort.   We needed a juicer for our morning routine and they purchased for us and let us choose type. The professional and warm manner in which we were treated and the care of the hotel is a must for anytime of stay.  We will be back. ",5,2019,07,27
144,Flemings is a gem,"Love the remodel. Our room was beautiful. The staff is helpful, friendly and cheerful. Would highly recommend a stay to anyone. The location is great. This was my third stay and every bit as comfortable and friendly.  Like the smaller hotel atmosphere. The staff gets to know you.",5,2019,07,27
144,The perfect London home from home,This little gem is located very conveniently just steps from Green Park tube station and a short walk from so many of Mayfair’s shops and restaurants. Nothing is too much trouble for the wonderful staff here including coffee delivered on request in the morning to road travel weary guests. On a recent trip to London I was stranded at Heathrow and the staff made a room available to me at short notice at 2am. Even the smallest rooms are extremely well equipped and the atmosphere is elegant yet relaxed. A must for business travellers looking for more of a private members club feel to their hotel.,5,2019,07,26
144,Bad experience based on prior stays,"The quality of the hotel in general has deteriorated. From the tacky faded artificial flowers at the entrance, to which we had to drag our own luggage to, down the loud, cordoned off sidewalk shared with numerous construction workers; to the concierge staff who couldn't seem to communicate with each other, and the tired loud room, we were happy to leave, after being excited to visit Flemings in the first place. We will not stay here again.",2,2019,07,25
144,Luxury and Location,"Wonderful staff, beautiful decor, quiet, comfortable and in a great location. Although we only stayed one night we noticed the staff remembered other guests names and breakfast orders, a personal touch and excellent service.",5,2019,07,23
144,Excellent hotel in good position,An excellent hotel in good position with professional staff who provide a warm welcome with great attention to detail. Highly recommended. Ormer Restaurant provides high quality food with good choice of menus beautifully presented.,5,2019,07,23
144,A Wonderfull stay in Flemings Mayfair,"Hotel Flemings is a small Luxury hotel located in a very central area of London, near Green Park and Piccadilly. The Hotel is really on a human scale, even if luxurious and we appreciated the cleanliness and the great kindness of all the staff",5,2019,07,23
144,Toddler tripping,"If you need hotel that is in great location, then this hotel should be more than suitable. I saw more of London on foot, than I 
ever have on previous breaks. Shepherd’s Market a stones throw away as is entrance to Green Park. Was really happy with the walking distance from hotel to areas like Covent Garden, Hyde Park & Buckingham Palace.  I travelled on my own with 3 year old & would def stay at this hotel again. ",5,2019,07,22
144,Excellent,"I booked the Flemings Mayfair in a package with the Eurostar and was not disappointed, on the contrary. Very nice hotel, excellent service throughout. Nice bar to have a drink in the evening, cocktails were great. Also the location is very handy, close to the Green Park tube station, you can cross the street and simply walk to Buckingham Palace if you wish. The room was topnotch.",5,2019,07,22
144,Oof,Bit of a mixed bag to be honest. Hotel was mainly good. Entire street leading to it was closed though. Only really there to sleep but was adequate for that. Staff were alright. Just kinda meh when it should've been fantastic. ,4,2019,07,21
144,Quiet oasis amidst the frenzy,"London was full of protest marches making it impossible to carry out the plans we had made.  Flemings was a life saver. Beautiful food, expertly served and unbelievably good value.  Just heck out their offer menu.  We lunched on, among other things duck and Dover sole.  We will be back!",5,2019,07,21
144,Horrendous reservations staff,"The staff and service at Flemings Mayfair were horrendous. I had to cancel my trip and return to the U.S. on short notice because of the death of an immediate family member, and the Flemings Mayfair was unsympathetic and did nothing but tell me I would not receive any refund of my reservation. One quote from a manager was: ""It's not our fault your family member died."" I will never forgive this hotel for their terrible treatment of me during a difficult and sad time.",1,2019,07,16
144,"Fine, but nothing special","Fine, but nothing special.  Dining is very limited and menu lacks healthy eating options.  Rooms are super small. SO much construction -  my car could not even get in front of the building because the block was closed off the day I arrived.  ",3,2019,07,15
144,Fabulous boutique experience in a great location,I love Flemings!  Another super warm welcome from Patrick and the rest of the reception team.  The rooms are superb and what a great location!  One of my fav places to stay in London for sure.  I cannot recommend highly enough...,5,2019,07,14
144,Ideal location and coziness,"The location of the hotel is ideal,: close to public transport and walking distance to many business, shopping and cultural venues. Staff is extremely kind. The building is cozy with a special layout as it is the sum of different buildings connected one another. My single room was really very small but comfortable. Pillows were both a bit too hard for my sleeping habits. Maybe providing a choice between two different degreed of softness would help.",4,2019,07,12
144,Flemings Again and again,"Flemings is as good as it ever was. Even with construction going on across the street, it was quiet within. It's located in a perfect spot - convenient to everything. Within easy walking distance to dining, shopping and places of interest.",5,2019,07,09
144,Fleming’s Mayfair,"We spent six nights at Fleming’s Mayfair. The location is perfect, close to some great bars and restaurants. The hotel is in some old home and as such it has lots of corridors and stairs that can make navigation difficult at first. Unfortunately, during our stay, Half Moon Street was closed off and full of construction equipment. This made it impossible for taxi access and the noise in the lobby was high.",4,2019,07,09
144,City weekend break,"I can’t get enough of this hotel, the staff really can’t do enough for you and the ambience is truly delightful. After a full day out in the city, knowing that you are returning to a hotel that oozes relaxation, cleanliness and excellent service is just👌",5,2019,07,09
144,our stay in london,"the hotel was beautiful, great location and the staff was amazing. they went out of their way to make sure our stay was wonderful. Very friendly, helpful and prompt. We would definitely stay there again.",5,2019,07,08
144,Awesome London luxury hotel,"Stayed in penthouse suite 

It’s was awesome and. Now part of Hyatt I get and use points 

The suite was amazing. The staff even better. 

Definitely going to go back ! My children loved it As well. Very centrally located

",5,2019,07,05
144,Perfect Position,A good hotel but not great. We found the bed most uncomfortable especially as this was our 5 th hotel so far on this journey. The staff were terrific. The rooms clean and well designed and the bathrooms were a good size with great water pressure. A very good solid stay. ,4,2019,07,03
144,Mayfair Flemings,The Flemings was beautiful! So posh and clean and the staff was incredibly friendly and professional. I highly recommend this hotel and area if you are traveling to London. It is in a very nice area called Mayfair and a 2 block walk to the underground.,5,2019,07,03
144,Nice stay,"We bought a secret escape to this hotel. There’s no Carpark but there’s an NCP in the next street . 
Hotel has been updated .we had a standard room which was beautifully decorated but very small . Sadly the bathroom had not been. Updated and the tiles were cracked and mouldy .
The restaurant was fantastic.food  exquisite.
Breakfast was really good too .
Staff were amazing . ",4,2019,07,03
144,Super Hotel,"We stayed at Flemmings Hotel for my son's investiture at Buckingham Palace as it was so close.
From the moment we entered the hotel the service was superb, the staff so helpful. The room was very comfortable with a large bathroom.
The best thing about the hotel was the food and the service from the dining room staff.  We had a special lunch after the investiture for 30 people in a semi private part of the dining room.  Everything was excellent.
Will certainly return to this hotel when staying in London",5,2019,07,02
144,Very poor experience with Fleming Mayfair,"This is the first time i am sharing my experience about any hotel I usually travel a lot and this time my experience is very bad

The hotel was over priced and i paid 3000 USD for 5 nights where the price should nt be more than 200$ /night. This is a very small hotel and they add huge service charges for all transactions

Construction in progress in front of the hotel

Restaurants inside also heavily priced for no reason",2,2019,07,02
144,Best hotel in Mayfair,"I absolutely love everything about this hotel.  It is warm, well appointed, incredibly calm and quiet. This is a 5 star plus hotel that welcomes you like a good friend.  The location is exceptional and the rooms are modern and comfortable.  The bed was super comfortable and the bathroom was spa like.  I love this hotel and always recommend it to anyone I know. Thank you Flemings Mayfair for another great stay",5,2019,07,01
144,Lovely historic hotel in great location,"Prospective guests should be aware of major construction works in Half Moon Street have currently closed the road (June/ July 2019). This is a small luxury hotel with small, but comfortable rooms in a perfect part of London with many dining and sightseeing options nearby.",4,2019,07,01
144,A Wonderful Small Luxury Hotel,"Our stay at Flemings was faultless.... The room was so comfortable, spacious and well equipped for every need.. Staff impeccable, polite, helpful without being obsequious...A thoroughly enjoyable experience,staying in one of the best areas of London...",5,2019,07,01
144,"On Day Two They Brought Me The Right Kind of Coffee and Fruit, Without My Needing to Ask","The service at this lovely hotel is special.  They outdid most hotels I’ve been to in multiple ways, starting with the gracious hosts at the front desk.  But my favorite bit was at breakfast (and I wasn’t even having the expensive breakfast, nor am I a rich and regular customer).  On my second day, as soon as I sat down, someone brought over my coffee just the way I had ordered it the day before (and the same was the case with my fruit juice order).  And the same happened on the third day.  They also knew exactly how many coffees I wanted and which paper I preferred.  That’s a level of attention to detail I have rarely seen.  Plus, they were so darn nice.

Bravo!  And thank you.",5,2019,06,30
144,Birthday Experience,From the moment upon entrance to walking down the stairs into the restaurant 'feeling special' is an understatement. Service and attention to detail is phenomenal. The food made us speechless. Thank you.,5,2019,06,29
144,"Good location , rest average","Excellent location . Room was ok , bathroom had more space. Tricky to get a normal water temp in the shower . Bed on the hard side . You hear every tube train that goes under the building so don't expect a lie in . Didn't bother me though. There's no common space lounge , just a bar . A bit weird there's nowhere to sit & relax. The gym - typical of hotels - cram a load of equipment in a room way too small. Virtually no floor space & only one weights bench just randomly located in the middle of eveyrthing . Why not invest in a bigger space ? Was clautrophobic with 2 of us using it. Staff were neutral..no one was unpleasant , but no one offered even a simple 'good morning'. It's ok but I won't rush back .",3,2019,06,27
144,Overall nice stay with superb location,"The hotel has a nice location in Mayfair and you feel you are in the centre of everything if you plan to visit London. Really nice restaurants nearby and close to all the hotspots of London city. 
Rooms are well done and spacious. ",3,2019,06,27
144,Rooms at Flemings hotel,"The room size was decent, but the air conditioning wasn't great.
The construction outside the building was a hassle as no taxis would drive by.
The lift wasn't operating at all times.
Overall the experience was good, the staff was friendly and the check-in /check-out was smooth
",3,2019,06,26
144,London Vacation,"Our stay at the Flemings Mayfair was amazing, the hotel was very nice and the  concierge staff Andrew, Stefan and Charlie were awesome, very friendly, courteous and helpful.  They made us so welcomed and comfortable.  We highly recommend this hotel if staying in London and will surely stay there again on our next visit!",5,2019,06,25
144,Perfect London stay,"The location was perfect, the ambience and the attentiveness of the staff perfect. The room was immaculate and the room service was to match. We didn’t use the restaurant but will be returning to do so. One of my favourite hotels.  ",5,2019,06,25
144,Small luxury hotel in the best location of London,"Small luxury hotel in the best location of London. Very welcoming staff throughout the stay. Easy Check in, helped on Check out to hold luggage. Good size room with a very nice bathroom. Greater than my expectation.",5,2019,06,24
144,Friendly staff nice lobby but worst room ever,"Hotel looks good but we had the worst experience concerning a room in long time, it was too small worn out and noise of big air Conditioning system was too loud to open an the window. Staff was friendly but we won’t come back. ",2,2019,06,24
144,Great Location,"Good but not quite the Leading Small Hotels member I would expect, at least for our room. Staff were always helpful and very nice. Public rooms and breakfast very good. Mixed bag aspiring to be great but not quite making it yet.",3,2019,06,24
144,Work Overnight Stay,Had a couple of days work which meant an overnight at Flemings.  Always the right choice and instantly feel at home with warm and friendly staff. Superb bar staff and setting make it an excellent place for a late meeting and relaxing drink at the end of the day. Simple and quick check in and outs make a busy day easier and a great breakfast always starts the day off the right way.,5,2019,06,24
144,Top Notch - Fabulous,"Flemings was an excellent choice for our family.  Although it was our first visit, from the time we arrived, until we checked out, we were treated like special guests.  The concierge Andrew in particular, went over and above to help with our reservations, making suggestions and worked hard to secure reservations for us at places that were ""overbooked"".  We had 2 connecting rooms, both were luxurious, extremely comfortable and we loved the extra touch of fresh flowers delivered to our room.  The location was fantastic, walking distance to most places, or just a short car ride away.  We loved it, and look forward to a return visit.  ",5,2019,06,23
144,Excellent cozy small luxury hotel,"Although I had a 8sqm room it was pleasant and surprisingly comfortable . I loved the decor, the service, the ambience and the location. The only problems were the very noisy works in the buildings on the other side of the street: very disturbing during the day",5,2019,06,23
144,Absolutely perfect,We reserved 2 rooms with our teens and stayed twice in the month of June as we traveled in and out of London. I just cannot say enough about this quaint hotel. It’s spoiled us for the rest of our trip. Service was impeccable and the rooms were quiet and lovely. Will definitely be coming back.,5,2019,06,23
144,Perfect place for a few days of stay,"I stayed for business attending a conference at Excel  venue east London. 
The hotel is perfect location getting from Heathrow with the tube, drop luggage at hotel and new tube directly to Excel (including the emirates cable car) .

The hotel has also perfect location with short distance of walk or tube to all nice places to go in London",5,2019,06,21
144,Another welcoming stay,This hotel maintains excellent standards and continues to please. It is lovely to be remembered from the concierges to the breakfast staff.  Nothing is too much trouble and they aim to help in any way they can to make your stay that little more special,5,2019,06,20
144,Best kept secret,"Professional & helpful staff, superb service, enviable location, great food, spotless and stylish decor, quiet neighbourhood despite being mere metres from Piccadilly, Green Park Tube Station and a 5 min walk from Buckingham Palace",5,2019,06,18
144,A lot of arrogant staff. No space to sit on the bed. Very expensive rate.,A lot of arrogant staff. No space to sit on the bed. Very expensive rate. Room size is very small. No service mind. All staff dress well. All areas are very clean. You can easily hear the noise from other rooms.,2,2019,06,18
144,Catfishing at it's finest,This hotel was nothing like the photos. Room was dirty and completely different. The shower and drain kept backing up at random parts of the very short showers we took. Wondering if better rooms were located in another VERY different part of the hotel.,1,2019,06,17
144,Wonderful,We have just stayed at Fleming’s for the past 5 nights. It is a lovely elegant small hotel in a superb location.  Accommodations excellent.   Food at the hotel way above typical- even for a luxury hotel.  But the highlight was the absolutely stellar service from all staff( and there are plenty).   Every single staff member jumped to be of service right up to the GM who came to check in on us twice after we had our credit cards stolen in a pub the first night.   ( incredible.  No idea how someone pulled it off). The front desk helped us address that problem until 2am our first night.  They were lovely especially Catalina. The GM was at our breakfast table first thing the next morning offering any support required. The concierge staff was the best we’ve encountered.   Through multiple emails before we came they arranged perfect show tickets and other recommendations.  Once at the hotel their dinner recommendations were excellent ( which we also find to be rare). Andrew and Ryan at the concierge desk were highly professional and efficient.   I would highly recommend Fleming’s. Elegant but not stuffy environment.   Hard to imagine doing better.,5,2019,06,17
144,Staff and hotel lovely...slight downside of breakfast and rooms,"The hotel is certainly an impressive sight and you cannot fault any of the staff who seem to make every effort to make you feel at home and make your stay as nice as possible. We had a deluxe room which while perfectly adequate was somewhat pokey and on the ground floor and had minor issues such as watermarks around the shower controls (ie limescale that has built up and hasn't been cleaned off)..other than that the rooms are of nice quality and very clean. I have to say the only thing I found slight aggravated me was the breakfast (c£22) which was for the ""continental"" selection....which when you viewed the continental selection wasn't much of a selection which mean most guests would be forced to pay the extra for a cooked English breakfast...which is £6 per person, yes its not excessive but for £22 I think most hotels in London can manage a cooked breakfast ...especially when Flemmings are trying to trade off their old world English charm.  The cooked breakfast was however very good but if we stayed again we would take a walk around the area to find breakfast out.",4,2019,06,16
144,Business Trip,Great location in Mayfair for easy access to all my meetings. Hotel is stunning and relaxing. The quality of the rooms makes all the difference when away from home. Front of house staff very accommodating.,5,2019,06,15
144,Fantastic boutique hotel in the heart of central London,"This hotel was a great find.  The staff and service were wonderful, quirky art deco decor and a fantastic location made for a brilliant stay.  Will definitely be recommending to friends and family, and am looking forward to visiting again soon.",5,2019,06,15
144,Amazing place to stay,"It was good experience to stay for 9 nights, location is excellent, restaurant is good, rooms are beautiful and the hotel bar is amazing setup ,all the staff is good very well organised management in the hotel.",5,2019,06,13
144,The Great Flemings Mayfair Hotel,"We had an amazing experience at the Flemings Mayfair. Everything from the service to the room exceeded our expectations. It's one of the best quite/ cozy hotels I've stayed.
Great Management, the staff was very courteous and helpful. Excellent Location, and extremely clean.    I would definitely highly recommend it to others.",5,2019,06,12
144,Professional and personable hospitality,"A delightful little hotel with very cordial, helpful, and professional hospitality centrally located for easy access to areas of interest in the great city of London. Superb food and service, A wonderful experience and highly recommended.",5,2019,06,12
144,A horrible experience,"This hotel is the worst you can stay in london, it's overpriced and the rooms are uncomfortable and dirty. I stayed for one week and it was a terrible mistake, please don't make the same mistake as me and book a better hotel in London",1,2019,06,10
144,Perfect luxury haven in the middle of Mayfiar,"The staff could not have been more friendly, helpful, going out of their way to make our stay as perfect as possible. The rooms are very comfortable with every small thing having been thought through properly. Ormer is a world class restaurant - impeccable food and service!",5,2019,06,09
144,Highly Recommended,"Very welcoming and helpful staff.  Great location less than one block from Piccadilly.  Short walk to Hyde, Green and St. James parks. The rooms are a good size.  Executive King has a nice sitting area.  Highly recommend ",5,2019,06,08
144,Just didn’t make four stars let alone five ,"Stayed here with hubby from thur for two nights. 

The room we were given was on the ground floor.  You can feel and hear the London Underground right underneath.  Asked politely to change our room.  No issues and we were grateful for a third floor room. 

That’s it.  Room was small but decent.  Quite gloomy as window looks out to some tiny courtyard.  Walls all around so mobile signal was non existent. 

Continental breakfast was decent enough.  No issues. We used the bar on both nights.  Really good although some disputes over the bill on the first night.  All amended.  No issues. 

Then came check out and that was most annoying.  We have already paid service charge at the bar and gave a tip due to great service.  Yet hotel piled on additional service charges when we checked out.  More or less double the costs.  They said it was discretionary and happy to take this off.  Why would you add them in the first place.  Which meant we will be paying costs twice!

This was so dishonest.  Really annoyed us.  
We won’t be staying here not recommending this hotel. 

If you do stay here check your bills!",2,2019,06,08
144,Anyone for the underground?,"Arrived greeted at the door suit case taken off you quick checkin

Extremely polite staff - case taken to room

Room had a smell of smoke / cigarettes 

Obscure glass in window because of poor outside view

Tea / coffee facilitates in room with hair dryer - no iron

Hotel build vibrates with the underground trains

Trains constantly running every other minute can hear until they close for the evening and open for very early morning, left us feeling a touch “jet lagged”

Breakfast was slower than expected, eggs Benedict arrived cool, egg over done with burnt toasted muffin....

Choo choo! It’s okay just another train 🚂 

",4,2019,06,07
144,Another fantastic stay at Flemings,Another outstanding stay at Flemings. Fantastic location. Very friendly and competent staff and comfortable rooms. This continues to be a fantastic location when visiting London both for work or pleasure.,5,2019,06,06
144,haywood,Staff was friendly and helpful. Concierge booked a tour for us to Windsor Castle with a charming guide.  Hotel is well located.  Bed was comfortable.  One of our adult children was traveling with us.  Our room was spacious and has adequate room for three of us. The full English breakfast included in our room rate was delicious.  The bar is nice. ,5,2019,06,05
144,Lovely Boutique Style Hotel,"The bedroom was very dark and small and looked out onto a brick wall!  The bathroom was fairly small and the side of the bath was relatively high for climbing into when taking a shower.  However, the room, like the rest of the hotel was so beautifully decorated that I managed to overlook the negatives and did remind myself that we were staying in the cheapest room available!

The bar area is lovely - very nice nibbles served with our drinks, and definitely worth a visit.  We have eaten in the restaurant on a previous occasion and the food is amazing, but unfortunately we had to eat elsewhere as it is closed on a Sunday evening.

The hotel is in an excellent location and we had a very friendly girl on reception who checked us in.  When we told her why we were staying for the night (my son was receiving an award at Buckingham Palace the following day) she made a point of coming over to see us the next day as we walked through reception, with a genuine interest in how our morning had been and made us feel very special.

I regularly stay in London hotels and would be very happy to return here.",4,2019,06,04
144,A Hidden Gem,"Our time at Flemings was all too short. It has a fabulous location, but is tucked away, so quiet. It is like a tardis and we kept discovering new and unexpected wonderful surprises.

It is the attention to detail that makes it stand apart. This included gorgeous floral arrangements, clever use of space and amenities in the bathrooms and excellent lighting in the rooms. Most hotel rooms have an absence of suitable lighting, but this had an array of choice- reading lights, mood lighting, ceiling light. Whilst it sounds unimportant, it makes a huge difference.

The decor is chic but inviting. Staff friendly and willing to help.

The gym is small but well equipped, and you have Hyde Park on your doorstep if you fancy taking a run.

The food at breakfast was excellent.",5,2019,06,04
144,A very dark room. Avoid Studio Suite 75,"Stayed for a couple of nights. The staff were excellent and generally the hotel is very good. A quality breakfast.

But don't believe the website picture of a Studio Suite if you are allocated Suite 75. It's nothing like the picture shown as it's very enclosed an dark. Not a place you would consider sitting. The room is OK with the lighting but it was a big disappointment as you pay a premium price",4,2019,06,03
144,Quite impressive experience!,"Very well located, service impeccable and good valeu for money. Staff are very friendly and the restaurants are good too. They have an international team which gives you a global flavor in the service catered.",5,2019,06,02
144,Worse hotelexperience ever,"To much noice from the underground/tube and a lot of noice from the roms/restaurant next  to the room. Reception wasent that helpfull, but would only offer another room if I paid for an upgrade... 80gbp ",1,2019,05,31
144,Beautiful boutique hotel in a quite location but within 10 minutes walk of so many London highlights ...,"The Flemings hotel is a charming, classically styled hotel, nicely done after their renovation. Given our surname is Fleming, we of course wanted to try this London option, amidst a city with so many great hotels. The staff are helpful, and the location is very good (close to Green Park tube station, Piccadilly St, Shepherds Market, not too far from Oxford and Regent Streets also). Wi-fi,  good in-room tea/coffee (herbal teas), and water all lovely touches.

There were three of us in a suite, and we coped fine; complaints about small room sizes are perhaps a little exagerated, at least in our experience where the suite had ample room for our needs and my daughter and wife loved the luxurious bathroom.",5,2019,05,31
144,Pleasant boutique,"Flemings is a wonderful boutique with a high standard, nice interior design and pleasant staff. Great rooms and nice amenities (both for the rooms and hotel in general). A good choice for those who want to stay at a smaller place with an exclusive feel.",5,2019,05,30
144,Best Boutique Luxury Hotel in London,"We started speaking with the concierge months before our arrival to arrange certain trips. Andrew and Ryan were fantastic. We were a group of 8 and it was no small task to take care of us. Once we arrived, we met with Andrew as soon as we walked in and he could not have been more helpful and friendly. We kept kidding him that Ryan knew when to take a week off to coincide with our arrival sticking Andrew with us. What a pleasant person he is. The rest of the front staff were equally exceptional and so very accommodating. The hotel is in Mayfair just an 8 minute walk to Buckingham Palace and a few minutes more in the other direction to Piccadilly Circus. The hotel is in the middle of just about everything. The rooms are a bit small but so are all of the hotel rooms in Europe.  This is easily overcome by the pleasant and very friendly staff. Just a really great place to spend some time while in London. I will be going back again.",5,2019,05,29
144,Disappointed in my room,"The staff & concierge were top notch.  Our room, not so much.  Our air conditioner was an individual unit and not working properly.  Our beds were lumpy with a five pound duvet, which was very hot when the A/C isn't working properly.  Tried opening the windows, but construction across the street was noisy. Complained about the A/C, they offered to move us the last night, no thanks.   Continental breakfast...ehh.  The bar does not have chardonnay, so tried ordering a White Russian, I think it was made with skim milk, not good.  When checking out, they compensated us for the inconvenience, which I appreciated.  I think the hotel rooms with central a/c would be a better choice, just not room 425! I don't want to take anything away from the staff...they were on top of their game.  I just had a bad room.  Hotel is a good location  too.",3,2019,05,27
144,A hidden gem,"My Mum and I had the pleasure to stay here for two days and only wish it could have been longer. From the doorman , check in desk, concierge , restaurant manager and waiters the service was first class. I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough and you are so close to everything London has to offer. Will definitely stay here again.",5,2019,05,24
144,Misunderstood LOYALTY???,"As a WORLD 🌎 OF HYATT LIFETIME LOYALIST I WAS RUDELY AWAKENED BY THE Front Desk Attendant who knew (Nothing) What So Ever About what is Expected OR Granted To The  WORLD 🌎 OF HYATT LOYALIST MEMBERS??? 

But the Restaurant, Food 🥘 and Staff are All Wonderful  👍🏽 ",3,2019,05,22
144,Great Stay,Loved this hotel. The lowest level rooms are very very small so be aware however next level up is fine. Staff are great and position amazing. I booked through Luxury Escapes so received a better than normal deal but would definitely recommend this hotel nonetheless. ,4,2019,05,22
144,Excellent location  - small room size.,"I booked this hotel  for my recent trip to London - and I was not disappointed. The hotel was excellently located - less than a 5 minute walk from Green Park station. Staff members I was in contact with were excellent - very friendly and very helpful.  Patrick from concierge in particular was excellent - smiling and helpful all the time.  Would make another trip here for his service alone. Interior of the hotel lobby was well presented. The room was clean  tidy and the bed comfortable. 
Breakfast - continental buffet - was good. Although I was not aware of the added cost for the option of ala carte cooked breakfast before.  Would have been beneficial to be informed of this beforehand - rather than when already at the dining room. 
Several other minor issues did prevent this from being the perfect experience.  Firstly I booked a double classic room - which was more affordable. And I have to say this is probably the smallest room  I have stayed in through all my trips to London. There was barely any walking space between the closet and bed. I should have known better when I picked the cheapest option.  Even the kettle was tucked inside the closet making the use of this difficult. The bathroom space was not any better. Furniture in the room was slightly dated though still in good condition.  And on my arrival - unfortunately there was a cleaning cloth left on the toilet sink. 
All in all - still a very good hotel to choose. Just bear in mind room sizes when going for the classic double. ",5,2019,05,21
144,Stay at the Flemings,"Wonderfull time at The Flemings.
 Romantic dinner at the Tyburn Room

144,Luxury London,"Fabulous , luxurious Hotel in a Great location close to Green Park Tube & all the tourist sights.
But not if you are on a budget.Staff are very efficient,courteous, professional & obliging & the buffet breakfast extremely good.",5,2019,05,21
144,London staycation,"The hotel is conveniently located in Mayfair with bars and restaurants nearby. The staff were welcoming upon our arrival and for the duration of our stay. The rooms are small and somewhat dated; the bed was very comfy but the bathroom was tiny, the bath was mini and my husband was too tall to stand in the shower (over the bath). There is also construction work at the moment directly opposite the hotel which is incredibly noisy so we were woken at 8am on a Saturday. Breakfast was good. For the price of the room there are better alternatives. ",3,2019,05,18
144,Excellent Stay,"Although stay for 1 night for transit, my stay was much better than expected. I could walk leisurely in nearby Green Park and shopping places. Hotel room was very comfortable and clean. Would recommend to stay.",5,2019,05,17
144,Another outstanding experience,This was my second stay at Flemings and this time was another wonderful experience.  The room was extremely comfortable and the staff very accommodating.  Guest Services Manager Daniela could not do enough to make my stay pleasurable and Gregory in the restaurant was a real stand-out for his friendly and most professional help with breakfast each morning.  I am definitely coming back in the next few months!,5,2019,05,16

144,Great Boutique Hotel,Flemings is a wonderful boutique style hotel located in Mayfair not far from Buckingham Palace and Green Park tube station. The staff are very friendly and helpful and the service in their restaurants top class. The rooms are well appointed with a very comfy bed and the wifi works well. We would highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting London.,5,2019,05,12
144,Lovely hotel,Love this hotel. Super friendly concierges and staff. Rooms lovely and so clean. Fab mattress on beds. Food in Ormer fantastic and huge breakfast selection. Perfect location for sightseeing. Will stay here again.,5,2019,05,12

144,Friendly Hotel in great location,"We had a great weekend here. The location was excellent, rooms a bit small but the outstanding thing for us was the people from the doorman to the reception, to the concierge, the bar and all of the staff were really welcoming and friendly.
Patrick one of the concierge team and the doorman (sorry can't remember name) both went out of their way to be particularly helpful and informative.
A great place and a great stay.",5,2019,05,08
144,Weekend Business Trip,Very nice quiet and old school hotel. Front of house excellent. Concierge particularly helpful as was doorman. The room was excellent and the breakfast very well prepared with quality ingredients and hot. Offered additional tea well received.,5,2019,05,08
144,Great location for exploring London,"This is the second time staying at this hotel and it was just as good as the first.
Our room was compact but perfectly equipped.  The bed very comfortable.

We ate in the Ormer restaurant for lunch, served by Matteo who was very attentive.  The food was delicious and extremely tasty - would recommend the duck.  The breakfast was not so good but this was more to do with the tables being very close together and the waiter making it confusing when explaining the two-tier breakfast menu.  Watch out for being charged a service charge, which is ok for lunch but a bit much for a London-priced breakfast.

The service by the receptionists could be a bit friendlier but overall it is a great small but luxurious hotel perfectly situtated for visiting the sites of London - we were visiting the O2 for a concert and it is near the Jubilee line which takes you directly there.",4,2019,05,07
144,beautiful small hotel,"This hotel is a typically English little gem. The atmosphere is one that every tourist who goes to London would like to try. We felt really pampered. very rich English breakfast, fantastic location, between piccadilly and buckingham palace with the metro station 3 minutes away and practically immersed in a park. All exceptional. ",5,2019,05,06

144,Will stay here again! The location is perfect. Loads of shops and restaurants nearby. The staff is so professional!,We could walk about everywhere from Fleming’s and were recommended to have lunch at the Guinea Grill near Berkeley Square. Beautiful meal! Everything about the hotel was calm and welcoming especially in the hustle bustle that is London.,5,2019,05,04
144,Excellent stay,"We stayed at Flemings Mayfair for 4 nights in April.   From start to finish, it was an excellent choice.  All of the staff, from the front desk to the wait staff were attentive and friendly.  The room we were given was very large, up to date, clean and comfortable.  The many breakfast choices were great.  The hotel is in a perfect location. We will return!!",5,2019,05,03
144,VERY GOOD,"I was  there in2013 and now I have found that the in general it was a little worse. The location is superb , also the cleanliness and the room. The hall and the fact that the restaurant was close on Sunday and Monday was a little disappointing.

144,Great Stay,"Great place for a real treat. Very central location, easy to get around city great service from all staff and the best continental breakfast we've had. Flemmings was the perfect place for a very special occasion. Thank you",5,2019,05,01
144,Overall nice stay,"My husband and I stayed here for one night whilst enjoying a weekend away in London (minus our little one). The location was good for our plans over the weekend and I looked forward to staying in a smaller hotel. 
Overall the stay was enjoyable and the room nicely furnished although the bathroom was a little dated.
The food and drink was really nice. We only had the continental breakfast as part of our reservation but there was plenty of choice.
Our only slight negative was the sometimes less than friendly service from some staff. Otherwise a lovely boutique hotel.",4,2019,05,01
144,Great boutique hotel,"Beautiful hotel, great location, friendly staff. Would definitely stay here again. Small boutique with only 4 floors - 1 elevator, which could be slow but easy access to stairs. Easy check in and out.",5,2019,04,29
144,Always excellent,"My only negative on this occasion was our Studio Suite.  The previous time we booked a Junior Suite which we were very happy with.  Studio Suites appear to be internal suites, looking into the centre area.  I wouldn't book one of those again.",5,2019,04,29
144,Had a great stay,Friendly staff and impeccable service. I was greeted with a warm welcome and the check-in was a breeze. The room was very clean and comfortable as was the overall appearance of the hotel. The continental breakfast offers a reasonable variety.  ,5,2019,04,28

144,Really nice!,"The Flemings was a wonderful experience.  The room, while not huge, was certainly adequate for the short time we were in our room. But the staff is what made this so good!  Both Andrew Sturge (head concierge) and Ryan Alden(assistant head concierge) were BEYOND helpful! They got us where we needed to be, gave us great suggestions for restaurants, set us up with reservations when we needed them - all with a smile!  We were greeted with a smile by the doormen & desk staff every time we returned.  We had a small problem with our bathroom, and they did everything in their power to try to fix it, even offering to move us if we wanted to! I would definitely tell people to think about staying here on their trip to London!",5,2019,04,25

144,Wonderful!,"The location, staff and hotel were just wonderful.  Highly recommend staying here.  The hotel was clean and the staff were very friendly.  The Manetta Bar was lovely and we enjoyed our stay here.  We will stay here next time we are in London.  Thank you for everything!",5,2019,04,24

144,Weekend stay in suite 65,"Ask for this room. Beautiful decor, amazing bed, bathroom to die for and a small private outside patio. The in room gin bar is something else. Breakfast was beautiful and late Sunday checkout with breakfast in bed topped of a luxurious weekend break. We will return. ",5,2019,04,16
144,Highly recommend,"Just spent 3 nights at this wonderful boutique hotel and couldn’t say enough about it. From the lobby to Manetta’s bar to the rooms, the decor was top notch. Everyone on staff was extremely pleasant and did everything they could to make our stay as memorable as possible. The concierge made some great recommendations as well. I had never stayed in Mayfair before and loved the shops, cafes, and people watching. 

We will definitely stay there again!",5,2019,04,15
144,Home from home in Mayfair.,Their single rooms are just the job for lone business travellers and their double rooms are great when travelling with my wife. Many wonderful restaurants and sights all on your doorstep so no need to catch the tube anywhere.  ,5,2019,04,15
144,Beautiful little gem,"Thoroughly enjoyed our stay at this beautiful hotel.  All the staff we met were friendly and polite.  We stayed in one of the studio suites on the ground floor which had a cute terrace area.  We couldn’t fault this hotel.  Yes, you do hear the rumble of the underground but it’s London, and we felt this just added to the authenticity of where we were.  It wasn’t loud or intrusive at all.  

The room was beautiful, and we loved having the underfloor heating in the bathroom.  

Breakfast was lovely, and the staff couldn’t do enough for us.  We even had breakfast in bed on the Sunday.  We loved the fact that breakfast is served until midday on a Sunday and late check out was 2pm which was great when you are recovering from taking in a show and the nightlife the night before! 

We would definitely go back again.",5,2019,04,14
144,Geoff the Chef,"My wife and I went to Flemings as a package, it was a good experience which we will do again.
The Hotel and staff are first class and very professional. the room was top notch, the continental breakfast was one of the best that we have had.",5,2019,04,14
144,Style and Comfort,"We loved this hotel, everyone was so friendly - room was not large but catered to our needs and was spotless as was the bathroom - plenty of storage space.  Food in the hotel is excellent and the place has a very calming ambience - allows you time to sit, reflect and chill.  A lovely experience. ",5,2019,04,12
144,Well deserved Award Winning Hotel,"we stayed for the weekend 6/7april, the stay was perfect, the staff were beyond helpful and charming, we dined at Ormer restaurant, very deserving of the hype, an excellent, freshly cooked breakfast, what's not to like!! I can't speak highly enough of this hotel, will definitely stay there when next in London.",5,2019,04,10
144,Hyatt benefit not honoured ,"I have recently stayed at the Flemings Mayfair, which is part of the small boutique collections for Hyatt. I was extremely disappointed. Apparently the Globalist benefit was not fully honoured meaning even though they had a suite available they wouldn’t honor my upgrade. They said at best was a one class upgrade. But that’s the same benefit as the Explorist? The rooms for the hotel is tiny and they have made so many different categories when booking such as classic single, classic double, deluxe single, deluxe double, junior suite ...  making the upgrade meaningless. My upgrade to deluxe double was only a 20sqm room which wasn’t even enough to fit my large suit case as the room was decked out with lots of furniture. But the fact that they don’t honor the full hyatt privilege (also no club lounge) is why I will never return to any small boutique collections hotel. ",2,2019,04,09
144,Birthday weekend,"We really enjoyed our stay at this lovely hotel, friendly, efficient staff, clean and quiet room and great location, good breakfast selection everything we wanted in a hotel. Would definitely stay again.",5,2019,04,09

Room was nice, small but it didnt mind. very close to everything. i recommend!",5,2019,04,08
144,Be careful - price quoted excludes vat,"Who advertises prices excluding VAT ??? Felt cheated. 
Small print will forever kill you. 
Room was nice although you hear the rumbling of the underground down below ...
Location is very convenient. Good breakfast ",1,2019,04,05
144,Two visits in two weeks,"I was lucky to come across this hotel by chance and my f fiend and I and then my mum and I decided to visit Manettas Bar for my birthday drinks.
My friend and I loved that the barman didn’t just let us look at the cocktail menu and pick a drink he asked us what kind of drinks we liked and made us cocktails from what we said...both of which were delicious!! We also enjoyed the little bar snacks, which were topped up and even one was changed as they could see we weren’t eating them. We were also treated to 2 little chocolates each, which were absolutely amazing!! The bar itself is elegant, chic and comfortable!!
I enjoyed it so much that I returned not long after with my mum!! Again wonderful friendly service and knowledgeable staff that are very attentive!!
I will definitely be visiting again in the near future!!",5,2019,04,04
144,Amazing ,"Yet again Ormer did not let me down, I recommended the restaurant to one of our guest (Shamsy) upon arriving Ryan was opening the door to welcome them before I could get out the car.  When I bumped into them later that evening I asked how was it, his response “ amazing, the flavours and infusions “ he recommended the signature starter.  Thank you to the staff who validated my recommendation 👏👏👏👏👏
",5,2019,04,04
144,"Great hotel, good location, friendly staff","Spent one night in Flemings, enjoyed the stylish bar with a nice range of cocktails.  Room was smallish but well appointed and bed was very comfortable.  Breakfast had a good selection, we used concierge service which was very efficient, all round good experience would recommend",5,2019,04,03
144,ANNIVERSARY LONDON VISIT,"A very Welcoming Hotel , that strive to deliver a great service on a daily basis.
I would always book the Afternoon Tea at this hotel.
The newly refurbished rooms are very comfortable and well furnished.",5,2019,04,03

Can't recommend it more! It was a perfect stay. Loved it and will be back soon!",5,2019,03,31
144,Amazing stay - exceptional service,"Visited with 5 friends, and our whole experience was absolute perfection. 

Taking responsibility for the group booking I was nervous about the party being happy with the stay. 

From the incredible afternoon tea, and wonderful breakfast.

Rooms immaculate, beds so comfortable.

The staff were friendly and professional and couldn’t do enough to ensure we had great stay.

Great location, will definitely return.",5,2019,03,31
144,"Super staff, avoid rooms on ground floor and front ","Very nice hotel, Great location and staff extremely attentive. Issue was noise levels in room. Only advice avoid Ground floor at front of building. I could hear rumble from what I assume was the underground. Noise from the road - could pick up people talking into the early hours. ",4,2019,03,31
144,Lavish,Spent one night in this lovely hotel. Staff were great from the moment I arrived. Great room and quirky decor throughout. The restaurant breakfast was stunning and the bar was a perfect end to the night. Special thanks to Ryan who made me so welcome and helped with activities to do in the surrounding area which was perfect location-wise. Pure luxury in Mayfair and felt thoroughly spoilt! Hope to be back again one day x,5,2019,03,28
144,London break ,"Visited this hotel and was amazed at the quality of service and room amenities. 
Although this was a short stay the concierge Ryan was incredibly helpful and knowledgeable about places to visit and easy ways to get around. He could not do enough to make our stay a pleasant one. 
I will definitely return to this hotel again very soon. Thank you to Ryan and Flemings for a wonderful stay.",5,2019,03,28
144,Charming Hotel,A charming hotel in an excellent location opposite Green Park and just round the corner from Piccadilly.  My husband and I stayed there three nights and dined at its Ormer Restaurant on one of them.   We found all the staff exceptionally friendly and helpful.  Our cosy room was to a high standard and well-equipped.  Our package included continental breakfast which was very good indeed.,5,2019,03,26
144,incredible staff,"the location is perfect, just a short walk to green park (and the subway station). our room ( a one bedroom apartment) was spacious and lovely. but what impressed us most was the friendliness of the staff. also: the restaurant can be highly recommended.",5,2019,03,26
144,Excellent Location,"My husband and I stayed at Flemings for one night on Saturday the location of this hotel is excellent its close to all luxury shopping and fantastic restaurants.
When arriving at the hotel we were not aware the road would be closed for the march that was taking place over the weekend, felt the hotel could have pre warned guests of this inconvenience and made concierge available to help with luggage from the end of road as you couldn't park any where, I carried the bags to the hotel whilst my husband waited where he could near the hotel in the car.  Check in was efficient once I made it to the hotel.
All staff we encountered were extremely friendly and helpful, the bar staff were particularly lovely and the bar is a great place to relax.
Our room was small but perfectly formed! All fixtures and fittings were luxurious and in keeping with the luxury feel of the hotel.
The only reason I have scored the hotel very good and not excellent is because our room  was right next to the lift and the noise did wake us up earlier than we needed to be up! We would definitely recommend this hotel to friends and family and I very much look forward to staying here again, I would just request not to be in the same room.",4,2019,03,26
144,Charming!,"This is a hotel I know quite well, having eaten here many times.  This was our first stay here.  Great location and friendly staff on arrival.  It has stunning public rooms, beautifully designed and very comfortable.  
Our bedroom was on the 4th floor on the roadside of the hotel.  However, there is a lot of building work going on opposite, so no view to speak of.  The room was of a reasonable size albeit on the small side and the bathroom was probably the smallest bathroom I have ever had in a hotel - there was no way either of us could fit in it together to get ready in the morning!  Sadly the bathroom had seen better days - it could have done with a refit (chipped bath, sink & tiles).  However, it was a nice room with a very comfortable bed and all the necessary bits you need.  However, it wasn't very quiet at night and the noise kept me awake for some of the night.
We did go into the bar (Manetta's) and had some delicious cocktails, with superb service.  It's a very relaxing and laid back place.  Perfect for a late night drink.
Breakfast was delicious - we only had 'continental' due to time restraints, but there was plenty of choice. 
This is a very charming hotel.  Laid back but deliciously British.  I really enjoyed it here (despite the lack of sleep) I just think I would ask for a quieter room next time with a bigger bathroom, and take earplugs!",4,2019,03,26
144,Highly Recommend!!,"Clean, wonderful staff, firm beds, fabulous location.  I would highly recommend!!
The bar has a great romantic atmosphere.  The hotel is extremely quiet.  You can walk everywhere, it's in a fantastic location.  ",5,2019,03,25
144,Flemings,"Excellent hotel and people.  The location is great and the ambience of the hotel is warm and comfortable.  It was only let down on this occasion by a slightly disappointing internal facing room.  However, I will use again.",4,2019,03,25
144,Very good service small room,Location was very good close to everywhere shopping park restaurants. service was very good staff is very friendly.however the room was very small and  the ceiling is low you should not stay in a classic room,4,2019,03,23
144,Fabulous City Hotel,My better half booked Flemings for a birthday treat. What a treat it was. Opulent rooms which were really really comfortable and luxuriously furnished. Service was second to none and a nice touch was a plate of cake with an iced “Happy Birthday”. A lovely gesture. If in London I would recommend Flemings,5,2019,03,22
144,Weekend stay to watch the rugby in Twickenham,"Beautiful hotel. Very friendly staff. We ate in the restaurant which was fabulous, would definitely recommend it. We had a classic double which was lovely but a little small and only a double bed. On a return visit we would go for a bigger room. This did not alter our thoughts of the hotel.",5,2019,03,21
144,Fine hotel - But whats going on with the ''intercontinental'' breakfast,"Very nice hotel. But you have to pay for eggs, bacon, beans sausage etc. at A 5 STAR HOTEL!!!! are you kidding me?
You cannot call it intercontinental breakfast with that boring breakfast you are presenting your guests.",4,2019,03,21
144,Overall a very pleasant experience,"Stayed at Fleming’s for 4 nights during our March trip to London. 
Very nice hotel in a perfect central location - close to everything and within 2 minutes walk from the tube. 
The stuff was great - friendly and helpful. Top-notch service. All our needs were immediately attended to. On arrival we were given a room facing the vent shaft which made quite audible noise that we complained about to the front desk. The next day we were relocated to another room that was great. Even though it was on the ground floor, it was very quiet. 
The breakfast buffet was good: yogurt, pastry, cereal, fruit. Good coffee and juice. Though we got a bit tired of it on the third day and went out for breakfast. ",4,2019,03,21
144,The Doorman from Half Moon street,Unfortunately we are not staying in this beautiful hotel Flemings hotel but Sunday afternoon we walk down to half moon street suddenly a heavy rain started and the doorman of Flemings Emil immediately came up with a umbrella and invited us to the wonderful Manneta bar.we look forward to book a room in this hotel ... very friendly staff,5,2019,03,20
144,Flemings Mayfair - Simply The Best!,"I have just returned from a one week stay at Flemings Mayfair. It was my second visit here but certainly will not be my last! I can't say enough about the hotel and the staff - every single person I interacted with exuded true professionalism while making me feel I was part of the family. There is nothing better for a business traveler than returning back to your hotel after a very long day to be greeted with kind, compassionate conversation. The style, accommodation, facilities are superb - are you in a hotel or at home? Well, Flemings is able to make you feel you are staying in a combination of both. Ormer serves fabulous meals - even breakfast was fantastic - Manetta's Bar? You will feel transported to another era. And the Drawing Room and its staff? Awesome! My room was superb - I think I could live there. Every comfort you could want, presented in a stylish manner . And let's not forget the prime location in Mayfair, where you can walk everywhere within minutes. I've had the privilege of staying at many of London's 5 Star properties but none hold a candle to Flemings, a hotel that defines hospitality, This is now my home away from home!",5,2019,03,18
144,lovely little gem hotel,"Only stayed here for 1 night but it's a lovely hotel with a nice ambience and furnishings. good check-in and out , only used the room service as late arrival- mac and cheese with jersey crab - tasty but small portions. Suited me but probably not man sized     ",4,2019,03,18
144,Couple of days break in London,"Very nice hotel in a good location in London. Very friendly and helpful people working in the hotel. The concierge,reception and dining room staff all very friendly. The room was alway kept clean and the bed was always made up. Well stocked up fridge.",5,2019,03,17
144,Great Hotel by a lot!,Really neat location green park--near Buckingham palace--near good restaurants one block from a park one block from Green Park tube station/ central location...boutique style English décor and rooms..second stay and will come again!,5,2019,03,14
144,Emil and Charlie - exceptional people!,I have stayed at this hotel for several weeks now and I must give a big thank-you to Emil and Charlie who work on the concierge team and have made my stay at this hotel very enjoyable. They are always very professional and smiling. They go above and beyond to make you feel welcomed and nothing is too big for them. I've stayed in many hotels around London and I have to say that these two guys have made this hotel the favorite for me because of their outstanding attitude. You'll be sure to have good chat and feel the good energy when greeted by these two gents and I look forward to staying there again.,5,2019,03,14
144,Amazing stay,"We had orginally booked a studio suite for two nights, but on  arrival we were advised we had been upgraded to the Garden Suite.  This was truly amazing and something we would never normally have experienced.  The suite was beautiful and equipped with everything we needed.  Being at ground level you could hear the undergroud, which we actually enjoyed.  The location of the hotel is great for walking to most parts of the West End and Green Park tube is only a few minutes away.  I would certainly recommend this hotel, all the staff were friendly and welcoming. ",5,2019,03,12
144,Great place to stay,"We just love Flemings hotel in Mayfair, great rooms, very private and very nice staff.
A fantastic location! very near a lot of things. We specially like the bigger rooms more like an apartment that are very private",5,2019,03,11
144,Elegant as usual,"Always lively to return here. It is lovely to be recognised and treated so well. 
Executive room is of a nice size and great welcome amenities. 
A truelynbriwtish Hotel with a hint of international style. ",5,2019,03,08
144,Amazing location,"Great hotel across the park from Buckingham palace, on the same road at the Ritz and tube stop within 2 Minute walk. Great service and luxury bar (not cheap!!) But nice for a special occasion. Shame the restaurant was closed on a Monday but concierge booked us a table at a local restaurant. Rooms very clean, not over generous in size but adequate for central London- might pay to upgrade next time for a larger room. all the things you'd expect from a luxury hotel, dressing gowns, slippers, coffee pod machine. But be warned- take your eye mask, really annoying green flashing light on the smoke detector right above my head in bed!! Not hotels fault but could of been positioned better in the room. Coffee & breakfast in the morning was very good, although no toaster to toast bread!? The staff couldn't do enough to help at this hotel, exceptionally clean too!! ",4,2019,03,07
144,"Small hotel, nice staff and perfect location","Location is good (the tube from Heathrow to Greenpark and a 2 min walk to the hotel is perfect) and the staff was nice, and I enjoyed my 4 nights stay. Very good for a short business trip and I can highly recommend it! ",4,2019,03,07
144,space of the room very good for a family,"we love the apartment room, the space was great. A little bit noise because it was in the ground floor. breakfast could be better (more variety) high price for low quality. the restaurant of the hotel its very good. ",4,2019,03,06
144,Very nice small hotel in Mayfair,"This was my first time staying at Flemings.  I am primarily a Hyatt client so I jumped at the chance to stay here when the ""Small Hotels of the World"" joined the Hyatt program.

The hotel is nicely located just north of Piccadilly across from Green Park.  Being close to the park would be more beneficial in the warmer weather.  Being close to the Green Park Tube stop is always helpful especially because several lines run through it.  It's also convenient when walking around Central London.

The front desk was courteous and efficient with my check-in.  I was able to check in by 11AM which I appreciated.  The cost was reasonable but the winter price is obviously a lot less than for the busier, warmer months.

My room was lovely.  I had a comfortable queen or king bed and a small sitting area with a love seat and chair.  The bathroom was equally nice.  The room was not large by American standards but easily met my needs.

The breakfast buffet was excellent- eggs, smoked salmon, yogurt, baked goods, cereal.  Plenty of choices.  Good juice and great tea.  Excellent, friendly service.

The concierge desk was most helpful when I needed to print something out.

I did use the gym.  Perfectly adequate.  This is not a large gym but does have a good mix of equipment.  I exercised late afternoon on a Sunday and was the only person there.  I am not sure how busy it is on weekday mornings and whether it is difficult to get on a particular machine.

If you like large, sleek, modern hotels, this is not the place for you.  If you prefer smaller spaces that feel like someone's upscale home then you will enjoy Flemings and its great location.",5,2019,03,04
144,Lovely afternoon tea,"Lovely afternoon tea. Sandwich and cakes were delicious, Service was fabulous. Staff are very friendly. Location was perfect. Very cosy bar. We were at the restaurant for over 2 hours.  Staff did not rush us. We enjoyed ourselves before the theatre show.  Looking forward to going back.",4,2019,03,04
144,Well located and nice service,"I would recommend this hotel for stay, though the rooms are bit small but they got top-notch service. Staff is courteous and prompt. I would highly recommend this place and would stay here in case I visit London again.",5,2019,03,03
144,Yet another fantastic stay!!!,"Have just returned home after a wonderful stay at Flemings for a birthday celebration. We have stayed at Flemings a number of times and it never disappoints....it is one of our favourites. The staff are amazing, nothing is too much trouble and they go out of their way to make every stay as special as it could possibly be. We would particularly like to mention Stephanie Gaal and Lisa Pilz, Guest Services Managers, who arranged some really special celebratory touches for us...a huge thank you to you both, and to the entire Flemings Team ",5,2019,03,03
144,No room at the Inn!,"We booked a Room many weeks ahead and used a prepaid voucher. On arriving, we were directed to the front of house manager who bluntly told us that they had received our booking, but due to an overbooking error, the hotel was full and they had no room for us. It seems that it was Oil Week and they preferred to have oil executives rather than our business. Needless to say, we were furious at being left until arrival to be told. The hotel offered to book us into an alternative five star hotel, arrange transport back and forth(we were booked into Ormer restaurant that evening), pay for breakfast etc. We took up the offer and Flemings also paid for our pre dinner cocktails.
Thus a difficult situation was retrieved, but it does not hide the fact that Flemings left us in an impossible position by lack of early communication. Bitterly disappointed.",3,2019,03,03
144,Excellent Stay,"The Flemings Hotel Mayfair is of the highest standards, the Restaurant was excellent, and the staff made us feel like Royalty. Its great to see a hotel excel in quality and service, and we look forward to visiting again shortly.",5,2019,02,27
144,Super weekend stay,"Stylish, quiet and well located, super customer service (birthday extras much appreciated).  Room small but beautifully appointed, would have been nice to have a chair/chairs and noise of refrigerator intrusive at times due to proximity to bed.  Abundance of artificial flowers at entrance (and round the mirror in Manetta's Bar) so inappropriate and out of character with the rest of the external architecture and internal décor.",5,2019,02,26
144,Location location location,"Really is a very central location for getting about London.   Wonderful service at the hotel, faultless.
Would definitely use again if the price is right and have no hesitation in recommending it to family and friends ",5,2019,02,25
144,Perfection!,"Great location.  Visit the Royal Academy!!!   Walk the parks,  have tea at the Ritz!  Shop Harrods, Liberty's and Fortnum & Mason.  See ""Come From Away"" at the Phoenix Theatre --- terrific story and music that you don't want to miss!  ",5,2019,02,23
144,Lovely week at Fleming’s Mayfair,"Extraordinary customer care in beautiful hotel located close to parks, museums, Buckingham Palace, restaurants and shopping.  Highly recommended. Staff was responsive to every request and made recommendations, reservations and directions for theater, dining and cultural adventures.",5,2019,02,23
144,Birthday Treat,"Spotlessly clean well equipped room,( exec king) Friendly, helpful staff and great dinner in Ormer. The restaurant has a lovely warm cosy feel to it and the food was excellent. The breakfast was really good and served till 12 on Sunday morning. ",5,2019,02,19
144,Stay at Flemings,"One of the best hotel stays in London, centrally located just a short walk from Buckingham palace. The rooms are impecacbly clean and  beautifully  presented with all of the facilities you would expect from such a high end establishment. We really enjoyed our stay.",5,2019,02,18
144,Would Book Again!,I had a great stay at this hotel and would 100% book again next time I am in London! The Staff was friendly and made me feel welcome. The room was so cute and clean. The location could not have been more perfect and close to everything that I had to do on my business trip! ,5,2019,02,14
144,Fabulous post Christmas break,"A wonderful gem of a hotel, tucked away in Half Moon Street. Service, room and guest experience was first class! Cocktail bar was relaxing with a great selection of rums (our tipple) and Omer's Restaurant was superb - breakfast and dinner! It has been a long time since I could honestly say that the Hotel did not disappoint in any way - well done all the team at Flemings Mayfair. British hospitality at its best!",5,2019,02,14
144,Flemings Hotel,We enjoyed our stay in a Deluxe Double Room which is one of the refurbished rooms; very comfortable bed and large bathroom.  Beautifully decorated;  Fabulous bar with great ambience.  We shall be returning.,5,2019,02,13
144,Fabulous Individual Hotel,"A great find bespoke hotel, recently refurbished to a high end spec. Our room was a little on the small side but gave us all we needed.
Ideal Mayfair location within close reach of shopping, fabulous restaurants and tube.
Service was second to none throughout the hotel.
Stayed 3 nights, breakfasts and afternoon cocktails were great. Can't wait to return.",5,2019,02,12
144,Nice hotel,"This is a lovely hotel, beautifully decorated with very friendly staff. Nice area and short walk to Piccadilly Circus. Thin walls meant I could hear everything next door but that was the only downside ",4,2019,02,11
144,something new,Great little find in Mayfair. A group of 8 of us stayed for 1-2 nights at the weekend and all thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Breakfast was great and the bar kept us watered until 1.15am when we finally had to call it a day. Only slight grumble is I had to call down for cups and milk as we had a coffee in our room at 4.00pm when we arrived and these were not cleared or replaced by the time we woke up the following day .,5,2019,02,11
144,Room & Service,The room is a bit smaller than I expected but it is clean and neat. Also it is quiet so I have a very good night sleep.The location is perfect and has easy access to various places of interests. Also very close to the Underground. Walking distance to business & shopping district. Service is great here at Fleming. But I also recommend to provide services such as charger converter for international guests. Also may be a small stand lamp at the desk area for business trip user. ,4,2019,02,11
144,Great location and stylish,"We had a standard room that overlooked the street on the third floor, no issues with noise as has been mentioned elsewhere. Large and comfy bed, with a great shower and nice toiletries. Room size was good and the decor is very classy. Breakfast was decent and the bar makes a mean cocktail! I’d recommend Flemings and stay again for sure.",5,2019,02,10
144,"Lacks attention to detail, staff quite inconsistent","I have stayed here quite a lot over the last couple of years.  The whole experience is never very polished.  I often first get given a room which isn't what I've requested - this time it was on the main street side - I have always wanted quiet rooms.  The reception staff are fine, but the waiting staff at breakfast are oddly rough and aggressive - most don't speak very good English.  In the bedrooms, they have now added an annoying light with a sensor at night (triggered by movement) - doesn't go off very quickly when you get into bed - strange and annoying.",3,2019,02,10
144,Celebratory afternoon tea,"After some research, selected Flemings Hotel for their afternoon tea experience.  What a find; a boutique hotel which provided excellent service from the moment we entered the doors to when we left some 2 hours later.

The occasion was a celebratory champagne afternoon tea and our choice could not have been better.  The tea was given in the drawing room and we had a table for 8 set out in one corner, very cosy.  We started with some exceptional champagne, followed by tea (varied selection of teas on offer) and then the plates of food.  The fresh sandwiches had various tasty fillings, after which there was the cream, jam, and scones followed by delicious macaroons and other delicacies. To finish off,  some rhubarb syllabub and orange wafer cones, all very scrumptious, The chef was also able  provide for one dairy free platter for one of our party. There was sufficient for all appetites!

My one complaint, which would knock half a star off the rating if that were possible, concerns the “cream” that was served with the scones.  It was, in my opinion, thin with no body, as though it was synthetic.  For a tea (and hotel) of this quality it should have been traditional clotted cream!!!",5,2019,02,10
144,Flemings Mayfair - what a treat,"We were given the most fabulous 1 bedroom, 2 bathroom apartment/suite, interior designed throughout, with impeccable attention to detail and a modern sleak design, the room certainly had the wow factor. The service at the hotel is exceptional and we will certainly be returning. A jewel among a plentiful array of London hotels and located just a two min walk away from the tube. We really couldn’t have asked for more.",5,2019,02,08
144,Jon Freeman,"The customer service I received from staff was exceptional, second to none.I would highly recommend staying at Flemings, as you will not be disappointed.Rooms, dinning areas, bar area were all spotlessly clean. ",5,2019,02,07
144,Glamorised London Town House Stay,"Stayed at the Junior Suite which was roomy and spacious as expected. Interesting bathroom design with 2 basins and 2 rain showers within the same shower cubicle.Unfortunately the suite was located on the ground floor so the curtains have to be closed at all times.Very poor sound proof as well, could hear everything in the corridor.Somehow there was some reverberation in the room every now and then which I am not sure is from heavy vehicle across the street or something within the hotel",3,2019,02,06
144,Just a great place to stay!,"What a great place to stay in London! It's been a while (some two years) since we last were in London and at that same hotel, but it's gotten even better since then! 

The room is so beautifully set up and with a lot of attention to detail! The staff is so attentive and friendly! When we arrived people addressed us by name, before we could introduce ourselves and - unbelievable (!) - congratulated me for my 60th birthday with flowers, cakes and champagne in the room! Now THAT makes you feel welcome! 

Perfectly quiet room with GREAT boxspring bed! 

We'll be back! Definitely!",5,2019,02,05
144,A wonderful experience!,"Flemings Mayfair is a wonderful place even if is well located is in a very quiet spot.Everything work to perfection staff, hotel management, rooms and facilities. Simply a wonderful experience. 100% recommended!",5,2019,02,05
144,Tiny room paper thin walls,This may be a self styled boutique hotel and well situated but the rooms are tiny and walls paper tin so you can practically have a conversation with the couple next door. Dissappointing. Staff were friendly,3,2019,02,05
144,Great service,"This hotel is beautiful and charming.  It is conveniently located near public transportation, restaurants and tourist attractions.  The rooms are beautiful but small.  There is hardly any space to walk around in the smaller rooms.  You should purchase the larger rooms if you need a lot of space. The service was exceptional.",5,2019,02,04
144,Chic stay,"Beautiful chic hotel with optimal service and all the people were friendlyRoom wasa bit smaller than the site shows.Good food at breakfast, if it will be better to extend continental one with also english typical dishes",4,2019,02,04
144,Good single night,"Impromptu stay.  Room slightly smaller than expected, but it is the West End of London. Quality hotel and fittings.  Room well provided for.  Ormer Restaurant was excellent for dinner and breakfast. Would revisit.",5,2019,02,03
144,Fantastic stay,"Heard about but never tested before. Amazing Surprise. High class and service, must be the hotel in London!I've only to suggest this hotel for business and leisure travellersWith all my best compliments",5,2019,01,31
144,Flemings,It is difficult to improve on perfection. We have visited Flemings Mayfair several times and remain overwhelmed by everything and everyone connected with Flemings Mayfair. We are looking forward to our next visit which won't be long.,5,2019,01,29
144,Avoid This Hotel if You’re Tall or If You Expect Good Service,"The entry way to the gym is WELL
below standard door height. Regulation door height is what it is such that the vast majority of humans may pass through safely. I understand that I’m a historic building certain passage ways may be lower, but such passage ways should be marked with black and yellow tape a the words “caution, low clearance”. 

I hit my head quite hard and was met with indifference by the lobby staff. 

Rather than this hotel, I suggest staying at one of the Firmdale Hotels? The rooms and service are of far better quality. ",1,2019,01,27
144,Outstanding!,"Fleming's of Mayfair is the perfect boutique hotel. The location, staff, restaurants, absolutely perfect. A must go while in London! The hotel was so well appointed and classy. It is out new ""go-to"" hotel in London!",5,2019,01,26
144,Recent stay,"Fleming’s Mayfair I’d in a Great location. Our stay was enjoyable because of the friendly,professional staff. We are in the restaurant, Ormer, in the Drawing room for a snack and for afternoon tea and a drink the bar and the food in all areas was well presented and of good quality We would  recommend this boutique to others and would certainly stay there again. ",5,2019,01,23
144,A Magical Christmas Holiday Thanks To Flemings,"To say that our stay at this boutique hotel was magical is to sell the hotel short. Ideally located a quick 10-minute walk from Fortnum & Masons, Bond Street, and Buckingham Palace, this luxury hotel was perfectly sited for our family trip to London. We were told to expect 'an upgrade' from our Executive King room. Upon arrival and welcoming check in, we were delightfully shocked to be escorted to a One Bedroom Apartment Suite. A stocking full of chocolate awaited us along with some treats on the dining room table, compliments of the hotel. Merry Christmas! Our room included a large bedroom with King sized bed, ample closets, bathroom with heated floors and great water pressure, living room, dining room and fully-equipped kitchen including washer and dryer, dishwasher, microwave, oven, stove and an honour gin bar.",5,2019,01,21
144,Our stay 18 Jan 2019,Room 61 should not be used as a bedroom as far too noisy with the trains. We moved rooms to 111 which was better. Disappointed that no one asked us about our new room or apologised about our experience in 61 or offered us any thing by way an apology. I cannot believe we are the first to complain about room 61  ,3,2019,01,21
144,"Good, but .....","We were staying at Flemings from 22 to 28 December. 

I had booked the two bedroom suite, which was close to £1,000.00 per night. So our expectation were fairly high. The kitchen and living room were fine. The bedrooms incredibly small, and one of the two bathrooms was so tiny!! I complained to reception about the most horrible smell coming from our bathroom, we didn't hear a thing back.

Had a lunch in the drawing room, but unfortunately our waitress had a very little understanding of English, which meant we got a completely different order, advised one of the staff but once again, nothing really acknowledged. 

Be prepared to hear the tube from your room.

Great location, walking distance to many restaurants, Oxford street, etc.

Getting to our room was honestly a total rabbit warren!!!! 

Breakfast continental breakfast only ok! 

Would I return, I am afraid not",3,2019,01,20
144,A ROYAL VISIT,We are returning guests of Flemings Mayfair and have referred many of our associates and friends.  This is a boutique hotel in Mayfair with proximity to everything in London.  We are treated like royalty by the staff and always feel welcomed and appreciated:  it doesn't get very much better.  The afternoon tea was delicious and beautifully executed.  Our room was perfect and the related amenities made our stay even more memorable and pleasurable.  We personally enjoy the lower floors as we avoid the elevators and can access our room by climbing one set of stairs.  Special thanks to the manager and his marvellous associates who make our stay consistently enjoyable.  Thank you.,5,2019,01,18
144,Wrong decision ,Considering the feedback and proximity to oxford street decided to go for this 5 star hotel. It was disappointment. Very odd room sizes. Impractical layout. Poor condition of furniture. If you have to open the cupboard unit one has to move the side table. Different levels. Very badly designed toilets. Only good thing was quality of towels not bad.,3,2019,01,16
144,truly mangnigicent,"Such a magical stay at a beautiful hotel. As always the food at Ormer is amazing. This is the first time we have stayed at the hotel, and we were not disappointed. Service was second to none and excellent value for money ",5,2019,01,16
144,Manetta bar is great if you can find it ! ,"The basement of this hotel is such a warren, but worth the effort because this bar is a gem! The art in the wall is great, we especially liked James Joyce, the bar is super comfy and the best blanched almond snacks ( and olives and chorizo!)  with your drink. Original, proper cocktails I had a Caribbean dream, who knew sherry and rum would be so amazing?! Best of all it was like Eastenders, 3 affluent east end blokes arguing, threatening, hugging post a funeral and then one of them calling his wife/girlfriend to have an argument better than anything in the West End at the moment ! Kudos to the staff for putting up with them ! ",4,2019,01,15
144,it has charm,Top charming little hotel with very friendly stuff and good breakfast. But the heating system is a problem - heaters must be renewed. Bathroom even has no heater. Location is top. Difficult to get that better.,3,2019,01,13
144,A gem glowing in the heart of London,"We recently spent eight nights at Flemings Mayfair to celebrate my birthday and 20 years of marriage. The experience was fabulous and wonderful. We booked a studio suite which on average should be around 40 square meters. The one we actually stayed was a lot bigger than the average. It was spacious and very comfortable. The suite has two huge closets and an L-shape sofa. It also comes with skylight and the bathroom actually has two sets of showers. Our flight arrived quite early in the morning and the guest service manager Andrei offered us hot drinks and a double room for us to use until our room was ready. When we walked in our room, there were a nice bottle of champagne and some delicious cakes waiting for us already. The service of the hotel was very good from top to bottom. The continental breakfast was very nice as well. Our usual waiter, Greg, was very attentive and helpful at all times. He even taught us what a cortado was. The only thing one might occasionally notice is the vibration and low noise caused by the nearby underground station. After all, there are three routes going through the Green Park station nearby. Otherwise everything else seemed so wonderful. The location is also just great no matter what you are planning to do in London. We shall come back very soon and very often.",5,2019,01,13
144,First class location,"We always choose this place for each of our stays in London for, on the one hand, its chic and sophistication and, on the other hand, its extraordinary location ideal and quiet although its very lively environment We are still welcomed, the staff is at the top,  smiling and caringThe restaurant is of quality, the bar cosy, the drawing room so comfortable to relaxWhat else ? ",4,2019,01,11
144,Nice hotel with a great location in Mayfair,We were in London for new year and we reserved two one bedrooms apartments. They were very nicely decorated and the bedrooms were very spacious as well as the social areas. The bathrooms had heated floors and very modern. The staff was very attentive with the exception of one of the concierge ( the one who was heavier set) he was not rude but had no people skill for the job. We would most definitely stay in this hotel in our next visit.,4,2019,01,10
144,New Year at Flemings,Our family had a fabulous time at Flemings this New Year. The suite was fabulous and miraculously presented. The staff were really helpful and friendly. I would definitely recommend this as a place to stay.,5,2019,01,09
144,Excellent business hotel,"I was recently in London with colleagues and we stayed here for 6 nights. Unbeatable location just off Piccadilly and very close to all major facilities. The hotel is very nice and staff were friendly and efficient in all departments. Breakfast was continental with a large variety of very fresh and high quality products. A' la carte menu also available. Excellent service at all times. We also tried the restaurant one evening and enjoyed it very much.
The room was well appointed and very comfortable. I love the heated bathroom floor and the large walk in shower was amazing. The room temperature control could be improved. Good wifi.
A very satisfying stay and would definitely return in the future.",5,2019,01,09
144,Amazing Hotel,"Fleming’s is amazing hotel, the building is so nice and so well located. The people working there is so welcoming, nice and professional. The food was always well prepared, and the rooms are so comfty. We love everything. ",5,2019,01,08
144,First Class Hotel,"having stayed at other hotels in the area, including another in the same road, I decided to try Flemings. Everything about the hotel was first class and excellent value for money. I will stay there again in the future.",5,2019,01,08
144,Poor service... not good enough for Small Luxury Hotel,"Sadly, we are adding our voice to the many other poor reviews about inadequate service at this hotel.
Location is great for London and we booked a three night package expecting so much more.
Reception staff were cold and indifferent to our concerns... we reported issues about our breakfast on the second morning of our stay and did not receive any feedback, despite raising the matter with two reception staff.
Like many others have reported, the daily breakfast is a shambles... so many staff standing around doing nothing, orders taken incorrectly and drinks delivered to wrong tables. Very embarrassing for a so called small luxury hotel.
We also experienced the same poor service during lunch... shame for the kitchen which did produce good food.
We weren’t asked if we enjoyed our stay when we checked out... management needs to take a good hard look at training.
We won’t be back and do not recommend this hotel.",2,2019,01,08
144,Spectacular place ,"Such a glamorous place, with top notch service and super attentive staff. Cocktails could be improved but the crab starter was out of this world. Outstanding staff. Really unique dining experience with great ambiance. ",4,2019,01,07
144,Top hotel,"Beautiful and elegant hotel. Room was comfortable and stylish. Staff were very friendly and accommodating. Cocktails in Manettas bar was a highlight. 

Excellent location, great base to explore London. 

One of my favourite hotels I’ve stayed in. 

Wouldn’t hesitate to return. ",5,2019,01,07

144,Short break in London,Great hotel in a fantastic location to access the city centre. If you stay make sure you visit Manetta's bar for a cocktail before heading out. Staff were friendly and welcoming and completed the overall experience.,5,2019,01,07
144,Fabulous boutique experience in a great location,"From check-in to check-out I was seriously impressed.  Flemings is in a great central location but there was no street noise.  My room was fantastic, I loved the heated floor in the bedroom and the bed was super comfy.  Every member of staff that I came across was genuinely helpful and took the time to engage me in conversation.  Flemings has made it onto my favourites list, not an easy task!",5,2019,01,04
144,Great location,"Extremely convenient to Piccadilly and local Parks, attractions and great shops such as Fortnum & Masons and Harrods.  Great Old English Pub nearby the Hotel called  'Ye Grapes'Flemings Hotel staff very friendly and helpful particurlarly concierge and check in staff made my stay very welcoming!",5,2019,01,04
144,Lovely hotel in a fantastic location.,"It's hidden gem. a lovely hotel in a fantastic location. Very friendly and welcoming. It's a steps away from Shepherd Market. This 'hidden' square in Mayfair with many of good restaurants, bar & shop. ",4,2019,01,03
144,Our Matchbox stay,"The room was embarrassingly small, leaving hardly any room for two adults to get ready. To top it off the generator kept us up all night from right outside our window. The bathroom was so small my husband had Have a shower bent over to accommodate the very low ceiling. Ludicrous!",1,2019,01,03
144,A good choice.,"Great location and good facilities from this well ran hotel.
I would call it a non fussy hotel, ie, the staff are not the usual fornicating overly chatty type. 
You are allowed to get on with the day without being accosted by meaninglessly waffling staff.
Good housekeeping, great breakfast and acceptable prices.
Patrick in the lobby is a pleasant chap, knows the score and keeps an eye on things. Well done young man.",5,2019,01,03
144,Location and Style - fantastic,"We booked a suite for two nights, and it was amazing.  When they checked us in, they didnt note our request for a room with a bath, so when I went into the first room I was concerned about this.  In saying that the first room was very spacious and beautiful, so if you are not a bath lover you would have been super happy.  They were quick to rectify this and move us to a room with bath.  The room itself was slightly smaller, but really a fantastic room, even had a little outdoor area, although it was a bit nippy to be outside when we were there.  The little touches of flowers, biscuits was lovely.  The bed was incredibly comfortable and shower and bath were amazing as well.  The interiors were really lovely.  We went to the bar for a drink and late supper (jetlag) and the food came from the restaurant and was very tasty.  We also spent time in the drawing room for coffee and drinks at different times.  The drawing room is beautiful, although the seating was a little tight in there and the service in the drawing room was variable (compared with the excellent service elsewhere in the hotel).  The location was also perfect.  As a frequent luxury traveller, this hotel ticks all the boxes and even though later in our trip we stayed at the Ham Yard Hotel which was exceptional, it did not detract from the great experience we had at Fleming’s and would definitely stay again.",5,2019,01,02
144,London visit,"This hotel is all round excellent.The staff were friendly and very helpful. The room was spacious, very clean and had everything we would need.There was an amazing spread on offer for breakfast. I would certainly stay here again.",5,2019,01,02
144,Perfection ,"Such a sweet and perfectly appointed little boutique hotel. Great service, excellent location, stylish interiors—would absolutely stay here again and again. Don’t hesitate. Just book it. You won’t regret! ",5,2019,01,01
144,Great stay - highly recommend.,"The vibe and decor outside and inside is very nice. Festive but not tacky! Staff are very helpful showing us to the bar while our rooms were being cleaned. The bar is beautiful. Narrow but modern hallways lead to a beautiful and spacious room. TV playing nice music and welcoming me, very comfy bed and lovely furniture. Modern bathroom. 

Would highly recommend this modern, upmarket hotel.",5,2019,01,01
144,Good but not good enough,"Really have mixed emotions about this one. Booked a junior suite got upgraded to a studio suite........probably the first mistake.
Reception very efficient and quick with check in.
Our room looked beautiful but oh dear, the “outside” seating area so small that we didn’t even bother trying to use it. Very very tiny. Very little space to move around the bed. Very comfortable bed, awesome pillows, loved the throw on the bed. 
The sitting room was nice, sofa not very comfortable to watch tv for more than an hour. 
Beautiful honesty gin bar with interesting books on gin to.
Bathroom was very disappointing, shower leaks under the door and no bath. My biggest disappointment no bath, especially booked junior suite for bath, got upgraded and no bath. 
Very nice Elemís toiletries and loved the black slippers with the Gold embroidered F on them.
Will do a separate review on the restaurant as I had the best dessert of my life there, and will also do a separate review on the Drawing Room’s afternoon Tea which was a total let down and in my opinion a waste of money
All in all a good small hotel, stay away from room 100 as it’s also right next to the cleaning staffs supply room and sometimes you have to climb over their stuff to get in or out your room
Staff really excellent and friendly. Breakfast staff really awesome. Dinner very very good with staff that makes you feel like you royalty.

Kind Regards
Rita Smith

144,Overnight in London,"Excellent food, service and  staff, Couldn't fault anything. We took a Junior suite which was lovely and the extra space is worth it. Location is very good in the heart of Mayfair and an easy walk to the major attractions.",5,2018,12,30
144,Fabulous stay,"We had a thoroughly wonderful stay at Fleming’s. We had booked a two king room interconnecting arrangement but arrived to a two bedroom suite. It was beautifully furnished and so well equipped. The kitchen has a washer drier which was great and the bathrooms are modern if not a single person use only configuration. Yes the bedrooms are small but the living room is generous and so comfortable ! The staff were enormously helpful at every interaction and the service at breakfast was first class. Breakfast itself was delicious. Particularly the eggs on mung beans and avocado (try before you judge!). There is a good sized gym, a short way to anything you want to see and do. Beautiful!",5,2018,12,29

144,Lovely hotel with great location,"I stayed at Flemings Mayfair recently. The location can’t be beat. Just steps away from a Tube Station. A very short walk to The Ritz London, Fortnum & Mason, & lots of great shopping. Buckingham Palace, Hyde Park, & other key attractions are also nearby. My reservation was for the Tiny Single Room which was much larger than I was expecting. It was roomy but cozy. While the staff was helpful, they were not particularly friendly. ",4,2018,12,26

144,A beautiful façade- a terrible experiance,"I stayed at this hotel from 14-18 of December 2018, and I won’t be staying there again for the following reasons. 
1)	Some of the staff and rude and have an attitude. Having said that a couple were actually nice and friendly. 
2)	I had a parcel delivered to the hotel, when I asked the concierge for it, he asked if it was in a boxes or I bag, I said I don’t know, maybe a box, it was in a bag, and he was visible annoyed that I didn’t know that it was a bag. How was I supposed to know, I didn’t pack it.  
3)	The lift is extremely slow, I tried to avoid it when possible because it would be faster to use the stairs. 
4)	The walls are paper thin, It’s difficult to relax in the rooms, when I can hear people in the next room chatting. 
5)	My room was next the lift, every time the lift was called for I could hear it. 
6)	There is no lock on the door, so you never feel safe, most hotels I stayed at especially in London tend to have locks. 
7)	I requested a late checkout when I booked, I emailed before arriving explaining I need a late checkout because I have a night flight ,I reminded them again at check-in, and was told that they can accommodate, and then on the day when I wanted to double check I asked again and was told that they need the room! No one informed me beforehand so that I can make other arrangements. I have stayed at many hotels in London, and the night before you checkout they leave a note under your door, at Flemings they don’t offer you this courtesy.  I had to quickly  take my things out of the room, and leave.  When I was  understandably  upset about it, the lady at the front desk gave me attitude. It was a horrible end to my trip, my whole day was ruined, I had to cancel my plans, and quickly make other arrangements it was awful! 

I do not recommend this hotel at all, it’s not worth it. There  are better hotels in the area, with a similar rate, and a much better service.",1,2018,12,24
144,Good stay,"Was pleased with the hotel overall.  Staff were cordial and professional.  Post an initial issue with the room  not having a bath as stated on website, staff managed the move to a new room with efficiently.  Room was clean and of good standard assuming it was recently renovated.  Breakfast excellent and an extensive selection. ",4,2018,12,24
144,Christmas Stay with Friends,"Great hotel, excellent and friendly service from all staff without exception. The Hotel was well appointed and very comfortable - everywhere was very clean, beds were comfortable with beautifully  laundered bed linen - will definitely stay again.",5,2018,12,22
144,Poor experience,"Staff is rude and some don’t understand English, details in the room not up to a five star, having spent several stays in this hotel It has lost definitely the magic. Won’ Stay in again unfortunately  unfortunately ",1,2018,12,22
144,Location was gold,"Location is nice, but some of the room layout was weird - do not stay in room 407 (it's a bit depressing). Staff were nice, though sometimes they take actions too quickly especially when it comes to payment, and this might incur extra banking charge for you. ",3,2018,12,19
144,Nice Stay in Mayfair,"Excellent Mayfair location between cozy Shepherd Market and the Green Park tube station. The decor and amenities at Flemings Mayfair are quite nice. Not too big, not too small. Intimate scale and ambiance. They offer good in-house choices for dining and refreshment.",5,2018,12,17
144,Festive weekend getaway at Flemings,"The Junior Suite is spacious comfortable and luxurious. The decor is very festive this time of year and there is something very special about walking around Flemings hotel. The Bar is great, the staff are friendly and very helpful and this is why Flemings is my favourite London Hotel.",5,2018,12,17
144,"Greatly overrated, smallest room and terrible breakfast service","We never expect rooms in London to be big, unless you pay a big premium, but Room 406 is a joke. Insufficient storage for clothes, just enough room to move around the bed - but only one at a time.
As for the bathroom, it was tiny and a larger person wouldn’t fit it in.
The room was in need of upgrading.
We had a good meal in Ormer in the evening.
However, we walked out at breakfast as we waited 30 minutes for the £28.50 English breakfast to arrive, while our coffee and tea went cold.
For some reason they only provide three milk portions for the tea/coffee making, which seems mean and only allows one guest to have a second cup.
The couple who booked the two rooms had an unknown charge of £400 appear on their credit card in the early hour of the morning. It was removed when they complained.
This hotel is trying to be 5 star and seems to have a lot of staff but still poor service.
To be honest, the rooms and trained staff at Premier Inns are superior.",2,2018,12,16
144,"Great location, noisy lower floors","Nice hotel with well furnished, comfortable rooms and good food - service was attentive without being stuffy.

Great location in Mayfair - the only downside is that the lower rooms suffer from hearing the tube line rumbling past underground... ",4,2018,12,16
144,"Snobby staff, TINY room, overpriced, uncomfortable, strange room layout, and did I say tiny?","I know, it’s London—so rooms are going to be small compared to most cities. That’s fine and expected, but this was a bit ridiculous for the price. Billed and priced as a luxury hotel, the Flemings Mayfair was anything but in our experience. 

Our room was so tiny that I’m pretty sure it had a full-size bed—not a queen and definitely not a king. A king size would NEVER fit, it just wouldn’t.  There was just enough room on each side of the bed to “scoot” out. We had two large suitcases and found one space of floor big enough to lay one of them down. The other suitcase had to be stowed. Unfortunately we had to live out of our suitcases because there were zero drawers in the room, only one small wardrobe for hanging a few items and storing one closed and upright suitcase. The layout of the room didn’t help any, it appears that at some point in history they decided to retrofit an old room to accommodate a tv and bathroom. This resulted in the tv being mounted down a short “hallway” of sorts that was probably a closet in the past. If one wanted to watch any tele, they had to be on the right side of the bed (left side couldn’t see it).  Or sit at the desk 18” from the screen. 

This cannot possibly be a common room in this hotel. Listed and reviewed as luxury—I would have to say that our room here was the smallest and least conveniently appointed, old and dirty hotel room we have ever stayed in.

I think what happened is that we booked our room through a tour company, which gave us a good rate—I’m sure the rate was only good for the “cheap rooms.” Amazingly this was the way we were treated here as well. The doorman wouldn’t open the door for us because it seemed he didn’t expect our kind to be entering such a posh establishment. We were wearing jeans most of the time and that appears to be beyond acceptable attire for their clientele. My advice to you considering this hotel—pay their high rates, and you’ll probably get a nice room and attentive service. Pay a discounted rate and you will be cloistered in the makeshift room above the stairway! My advice to the hotel—remove room 417 (I think) from service or return it to its original purpose, maybe servant’s quarters or storage. Then you won’t have any of the cheap rate riff-raff to deal with. And train your doormen to hide their surprise when someone in jeans (btw, they were new jeans, not holy or worn) actually steps inside. 3 days of pushing past your doorman gets old. Amazingly when we were dressed up for dinner, our experience was 180 degrees different, “Welcome...have a wonderful evening, may I hail a taxi for you, etc.” 

Moral of the story, Flemings Mayfair will judge you according to your rate paid and your attire and adjust their room and service accordingly.",2,2018,12,14

144,excellent stay,"comfortable room that allowed me to do what I needed to. The interior was very comfortable with good lighting and facilities such as bathroom and power sockets. very convenient location and friendly, helpful staff",5,2018,12,13
144,Elegance,"Working in Mayfair and stayed here at this beautiful boutique hotel. I understand that it was converted from a number of Georgian townhouses dating back to the 1700s and opened as a hotel in 1851. The rooms are comfortable and welcoming with electrical sockets to accommodate UK/EU/US appliances and USB ports for charging devices. 
Recommend a visit (and I hope to stay here again soon)",5,2018,12,12
144,Amazing Wedding Reception,"I would just like to say a huge thank you to all the staff at Flemings that made our sons wedding reception on December 1st 2018 the most beautiful and amazing occasion.
We were blown away with the level of service and effort that was taken to make the
whole evening go with such panache!  The service, decoration of the two rooms and the food were faultless. Every small request was delivered with smiles.  The food was delicious and all of the guests have written to thank us and congratulate us on finding
such an amazing venue.  We will definitely be back and intend to recommend to all our family and friends.  Thank you once again.",5,2018,12,11
144,Beautiful charming hotel,"we really enjoyed our stay at the Flemings. Charming hotel, warm welcome, beautiful recently refurbished rooms and a great breakfast. Top location. The Flemings made our stay in London a memorable one. Thanks to all the staff!",5,2018,12,11
144,Cozy tiny single room,"I booked the ""tiny single"" room and it was delightfully cozy. In a fantastic location and all the luxury of a larger hotel. Especially nice after a long weary night of traveling.  A great place to stay! ",5,2018,12,11
144,Very disappointing and lack of customer care,"I booked this on reviewing Tripadvisor and on it's proximity to Langans where we had a reservation.
On initial thoughts the hotel looks nice and is in a great location. The room we had was quite small and the view was terrible. There was a problem with the bathroom as the towel rail ( which was inconveniently above the toilet) was ridiculously hot and made the whole bathroom into a sauna.
We had seen that the hotel has a bar and was famed for it's signature cocktails so we went down early before our dinner reservations. The bar is in the basement and we were directed by and greeted by a number of staff. The bar was half empty and so we found a table and sat down. A waiter then approached us and told us that we could not sit down as they were expecting a group of 20. He then said that there were no other places to sit in the bar. He was a little abrupt and offered us no alternative.
I can understand if they had cordoned off an area or we were advised of this at any stage before sitting down but there was no apology .
As a final nail in the coffin , we were disturbed a number of times in the night ( from midnight to 5.00am) by our noisy neighbours who insisted on talking loudly outside our room and also on shutting their door noisily a number of times.
On checking out the next day , we were asked by reception whether our stay went well. When I explained the above problems the receptionist did not know what to do and almost ignored our points. O think she was geared to compliments and not to complaints.
Finally a few days after our visit I got an email from the general manager ( a standard email) asking for feedback to help improve their service. I promptly responded with the above points. We are now three or four days later and I have not had a response.
One sign of a good hotel is how they deal with complaints and in this case I think they have ignored us. We will not be returning and we do not recommend you stay here.",2,2018,12,11
144,"Elegant, but poor service","I have stayed here twice now, and had the same bad experience twice. The reception does not read your profile or room request properly. They assign rooms to you which are noisy, not renovated or with poor quality. After my first visit last June, I was informed that next time I stay here, they would ensure that I get the room asked for. Again, This time, I had to change rooms twice. After a flight, one just would like to get to ones room and unpack. Interestingly enough, they always try to give you a poor or non renovated room at first...",2,2018,12,11
144,Perfectly Formed.,"Recently refurbished, this hotel looks great and has improved since our last visit. Particularly loved the new bar downstairs with a very lovely and helpful barman on last Sunday evening. Rooms are quite small at the lower end of the price scale but they have been well thought out and do everything they should. I found the pillows uncomfortable, and would have preferred feather, but this is a personal preference. Staff were well trained and nothing was too much trouble.Great stay looking forward to going back.",5,2018,12,10
144,Fantastic hotel,The hotel is excellent. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and the service was second to none. The only criticism was that the room was on the small side but other than that we could not fault the hotel in any way. We would definitely stay again.,5,2018,12,10
144,Mayfair London,Nice hotel if in London for business around Mayfair.Fairly good breakfast & very friendly staff. Also good location at Green Park or for shopping around Savile Row etc. Good internet service too. Tiny rooms though...,4,2018,12,08
144,Relaxing Atmosphere,"I stayed for one night at this stylish, centrally located hotel, part of the Small Luxury Hotels of the World group.  The room was a small double which was roomy and very comfortable. I decided on the A la Carte breakfast menu rather than the buffet and had French Toast with bacon and maple syrup.  My daughter had the porridge.  There was no problem in staff providing non dairy alternatives to milk.  Throughout the hotel the staff were very friendly and helpful.  I would definitely stay at this hotel again.",5,2018,12,06
144,Great location and dedicated staff,"located nearby Green Park station, this hotel is ideal for leisure and business.The staff is helpful and dedicatedThe rooms are nicely decoratedthe breakfast is good and some good coktails are prepared at the bar",5,2018,12,06
144,Great Location For Getting Around,Having the hotel as a base makes it easy to conduct business meetings.  The location is convenient. The staff is helpful and knowledgeable and the accommodations are quite attractive and very comfortable.,5,2018,12,02
144,stay,The Flemings Mayfair is a sweet little hotel with extraordinary service and beautiful interior. The Hotel is perfectly situated in the middle of Mayfair. Rooms are small but newly renovated and very clean.,5,2018,11,28
144,Can’t wait to come again,"We had such a lovely stay and felt so special at this hotel. We stayed for three nights in a Classic Double - the room is on the bijou side so it was a little tight with two large-ish suitcases, but we were still very comfortable as it is furnished very appropriately. The hotel celebrated our anniversary which we so appreciated - it is the little details. Continental breakfast was also lovely and we loved having a Nespresso in our room! The bars/restaurants at the hotel are all of a high standard. We particularly loved Manetta’s Bar, wonderful cocktails and complimentary bar nibbles. Can’t wait to come again, thank you Flemings Mayfair!",5,2018,11,27
144,november short trip,Pleasant stay as usual but the rooms at the back are really noisy due to ventilation outside and poorly if not isolated windows. I am not the only one complaining  as I noticed when coming in the lobby in the morning. ,4,2018,11,26
144,Really Great,"I always stayed across the road at the Hilton Green Park. But as the HGP is being renovated I decided to stay at Flemings Mayfair. I always admired the hotel from HGP as it looked very quaint and the doorman was always on duty. Therefore I was delighted to try it out. Flemings Mayfair dis not dissapointed at all. The check I  process was fast, the room very comfortable and the staff very friendly. The hotel has a really lovely historic feel and you get a sense you are staying somewhere special despite the reasonable prices. The restaurant staff were excellent and very friendly. The wifi in the room was really fast. I must say it will now be difficult to pick between HGP and Flemings as Flemings is really exceptional. Will definitely return. Highly recommended.",5,2018,11,22
144,Beautiful stay in Mayfair,"This is a really beautiful hotel situated perfectly in the Mayfair area. The staff was friendly, the food was amazing and they handled my allergies perfectly, without any fuzz. My only complaint were that the beds were a little bit to hard and thus a bit uncomfortable and the air in the room was a little bit stuffy. Apart from that it was perfect. ",5,2018,11,19
144,Gem in Mayfair,"Flemings Mayfair is a very fine and affordable hotel in the heart of Mayfair.  While the rooms are not huge (at least at the lower rung of the price scale), they are well-designed and very comfortable.  What makes the hotel special, though, is its staff.  From the men at the door through check-in and down to the bar and restaurant, every person is helpful, friendly and ready to assist.   A secondary reason to like the hotel is that a number of fine Japanese, Indian and British restaurants are within 100 meters of the front door.   You cannot go wrong at Flemings.  ",5,2018,11,18
144,“Pleasure stay”,"We stayed at Fleming’s Mayfair for 3 days with my sister and my niece and were very pleased with our stay! The staff, especially the manager and the man at concierge desk were incredibly warm and accommodating! The suite was so nice, comfortable, and clean! The breakfast was delicious and the staff was very friendly! 
We would love to come back as soon as possible! ",5,2018,11,16
144,Very Nice location and great staff,"Arrived on Monday evening and had a very good check in, unfortunately I could not enjoy the restaurant but it seems busy and very tempting menu. Staff always ready to please (Housekeeping and restaurant for Breakfast). Will definitively come back.",5,2018,11,16
144,Stay in London for Company Offsite,"Flemings is well located in central London, in Mayfair.The room was nice & service was good.Unfortunately, the room was at the front of the hotel & was very noisy.I did not get a good night sleep. Thank you, ",4,2018,11,14
144,Manetta’s Bar,"I visited this luxury bar in October 2018 with a group of people. As you walk in you get the feeling that you have walked off a James Bond film set. The decor is simply amazing and I kept on thinking that either Sean Connery, Roger Moore, Pierce Brosnan or Daniel Craig was going to walk in with a Bond girl on their arms. The drinks were served perfectly. Mind you it is simple to serve a Fever Tree tonic water. ",4,2018,11,14
144,Frequent Business Traveler to London,"The hotel is very well located in the heart of Mayfair, offers excellent  services from the staff in every level and the cleanliness is also very good. But the room size was very very small and in case that you have an inner side view room then it can bacome even more difficult to have a memorable staying.",3,2018,11,11
144,Excellent London Hotel,"This is a first class hotel and beautifully run by an excellent General Manager. The staff are all amazing, polite, professional and always willing to assst with any request.Bedrooms are furnished to a very high standard with good amenities. We had breakfast in the restaurant and couldn't fault the food or service. Staff were attentive and polite and welcomed you .The location of Flemings is central and you can walk to many attractions, restaurants etc.There is building work opposite the hotel and was noisy in the morning, but this is not the fault of the hotel!  Unfortunate but this is London!",5,2018,11,11
144,"Great service, disappointing rooms","We made reservations online through a third party, apparently reserved the cheapest room of the hotel, it wasn't remodeled furniture looked old and beaten. no decor. Manager was very nice to us and gave us a different room, which was also not remodeled, ,furniture was pretty old and did not have any amenities, not even a coffee maker. ",3,2018,11,11
144,Pinnacle of Human Civilization in hospitality,Flemings Mayfair is one of the best small luxury hotels that Central London can offer. It is absolutely authentic and the staff makes every effort to make sure that their guests feel pampered. This is is the height of hospitality.,5,2018,11,10
144,50th Birthday Stay,We had a great stay at Flemmings Hotel.It was for my Husbands 50th Birthday and was a memorable one. We had lunch in the Ormer restaurant and would go as far to say that is is one of the best meals we have ever had. Great Location and only 25 mins from Westminster. Definitely will return.,5,2018,11,09
144,Brilliant location and staff,"The location of the hotel is great and within 5 mins walk from Green Park station, which itself is about 45 mins from Heathrow airport on the Piccadilly tube line. The step free access at Green Park station is great for luggages. Hotel is really near many restaurants and bars and is a ok hotel side street. Hotel is also near to many attractions such as Hyde park and Buckingham palace. Green Park station is an interchange with three major tube lines, which makes it highly convenient.

Hotel staff is friendly while room is decently appointed for its status.

Would stay here again",5,2018,11,09
144,Shocked by the lying staff,"The hotel property is lovely if you are willing to overlook small details like misshapen doorknobs, banged up against a wall, or nicked bathtub ceramic. I am giving it a poor review, though, because their reception and reservation staff lied to me about a refund. 

I booked through hotels.com, initially for two nights and then had to add a third. I accidentally booked the additional night for the following week. When I arrived, the reception staff said no problem, they would get hotels.com to refund me for that misbooked night and I would pay for the new night directly. I paid them and then received an email from hotels.com saying the misbooked night was cancelled but not refunded. Over two days, four separate hotel staff told me that they requested the refund and though they could give me no way of confirming this, it’s all right here on a screen I was not permitted to see. They were unwilling to give a confirmation number, print the refund request, or otherwise put anything in writing. This did not inspire me with confidence. When I called hotels.com, they said the hotel had never reached out to them. While I was on hold, hotels.com called the hotel and got me the refund. Within minutes, hotels.com took care of it. ",2,2018,11,08
144,Mayfair Gem,"Great location. Convenient, quiet and central to all London attractions. Concierge Ryan was particularly helpful with suggestions and bookings. Always felt good cheer. Bar was quiet and comfy with imaginative, original cocktails.",5,2018,11,07
144,A special hotel right in the heart of London,"From the time of my check in to check out, my short 3 night stay a Fleming was fabulous. The staff was friendly and took the initiative to check with us anything that would make our stay better.Breakfast was a delight and the coffee and tea was excellent.We took a set lunch at Ormer restaurant and was very happy with the choices and quality of food served. Further an afternoon tea at the Drawing room is a great way to relax.Our room was not large but adequate at 21 sq meters but it was spotless and cozy. The king size bed was fantastic to sleep in after a long day out walking around London. I would no doubt recommend this par excellent to all.",5,2018,11,06
144,Absolutely Gorgeous Boutique Hotel in the Heart of Mayfair,"What a treat this property provided.  The warm staff creates a familial environment from the moment you walk in until they call you a car to leave.  The rooms were not the largest; however, they were very comfortable.  The bar is a sure visit, and the restaurant downstairs is fantastic.  The breakfast staff does a great job greeting, again by name, and already aware of how you take your coffee or tea.  And oh yeah- it’s bang in the middle of Mayfair & and a short walk from virtually anything you can dream up.",5,2018,11,06
144,Excellent,"We stayed here for our wedding anniversary. We arrived before check in to drop off our bags and received a warm welcome. On our return to our room we found that the staff had kindly left us a bottle a bottle of Prosecco, cakes and a card
The bedroom was extremely comfortable, I can’t fault anything. We had a great stay and would highly recommend.",5,2018,11,06
144,Liked Flemings,"Very nice and upscale hotel, in great Mayfair location.  Very friendly and knowledgeable staff -- especially the concierges.  Excellent breakfast included.  Only negative is some of the rooms are very small, including our first night there.  We moved rooms to one that was bigger for the next four nights, which was much better.  Otherwise, all positives!",5,2018,11,06
144,Thursday to Saturday Stay,"A charming and luxury small hotel in a tremendous location. The staff were friendly, especially the breakfast team and we enjoyed our two night stay, food, service and the Flemings Mayfair experience.",5,2018,11,05
144,Always a warm welcome ,"This small boutique hotel is a little gem in Mayfair.  The staff are so friendly and welcoming and will recognise you when you return for a future visit.  My only gripe would be that some of the rooms are smaller than those of alternate hotels in the area, but they compensate by making them as luxurious as possible.  Ideally located for the Green Park tube, Shepherds Market, Buckingham Palace, Piccadilly, Regent St and Oxford St all within a 15 min walk.",4,2018,10,31
144,Top Notch,"Our stay here could not have been better.  The staff was wonderful and paid attention to every possible detail that we needed in a friendly, respectful and knowledgeable way.  The rooms were exquisitely decorated but comfortable and had every amenity you could desire.  The tea room, bar, and food were a great treat to come back to for a nightcap or meal after a day long of touring the city.  The entire facility was immaculately clean and could not have been more conveniently located for seeing many of the sites that London has to offer.  Additiobally, the tube station is just a mere two blocks away for getting places that are a bit more remote.  ",5,2018,10,30
144,Excellent Hotel,"A very friendly and comfortable Hotel in a good and quiet location. The room was decorated very nice. The beds were comfortable. Its locatet very near to Piccadilly Underground Line, Station Green Park. Very friendly and helpful staff.",5,2018,10,29
144,Great stay.,"We stayed at the Studio Suite, overall was great. Fleming's location is superb, you are surrounded by restaurants, tube, convenience stores etc. However, the only downside is you may experience some noise disturbance from late night owls banging the room's door. ",5,2018,10,28
144,"Great location, but noisy room","Really friendly staff all around, we got looked after well by concierge George. All the staff are very friendly and accommodating. It’s great that on a Sunday you can check out at 2PM. My only reason for the 4 star review is we were in room 60 which is a ground floor room behind the tea room. That’s fine as you don’t have any neighbours but around every 15 min you can hear the tube line underneath go past which is very very annoying. I will return to the hotel but I wouldn’t recommend you stay in room 60!",4,2018,10,27
144,Classic double was very disappointing,"We booked based on Trip Advisor reviews. This is definitely not a five star hotel. The room was ridiculously small, even by European standards (possibly because half the room was taken up by eaves). The bathroom was small and dated. Nothing close to the pictures on the hotel site. We still have two nights left. If we had not prepaid (I asked for a refund and was denied), we would certainly leave. I wish we could go somewhere else. We paid more to stay here than other options thinking it would be a nice treat. What a mistake.",2,2018,10,27
144,Three night stay,Great location and quirky rooms. Lovely friendly staff especially our breakfast attendant. The restaurant for lunch very fantastic with a great menu and accompanying wines. Unfortunately ran out of time for the High Tea.,4,2018,10,27
144,Nice stay,Had a nice stay. Front desk staff and Concierge were very nice and friendly. The room ( Double Queen) was nice for a solo traveller. Very clean. The bathroom was very clean too. The only complaint I can make is that the bathroom looks old.,4,2018,10,26
144,"good, expensive , very pleasing","welcoming team and warm place-feeling. I made sure to tell them that, it was a pleasure. hotel is full of customers and it is high quality. Of course, rates are a bit high, it was half a surprise. good stay and will recommend.",4,2018,10,26
144,Very Good Location and very Friendly staff and excellent services,"Great place to stay in London. Ideal location, great stuff and services. The wall are a little thin and can hear people talk on top or next to your room. However, not many hotel in London have good wall insulation.  Overall, good place to stay in term of services and value for your $$$. ",4,2018,10,26
144,GOOD LOCATION BUT THERE ARE BETTER OPTIONS FOR MONEY,Thus is a clean and friendly hotel but somehow it lacks that touch which makes the experience more personal. Despite being told this was a birthday treat for my husband no effort or recognition was given and we were put in room 60 which has the feel of being in tth service area of teh hotel and rather tucked away. The surprise when we were given the room on teh concierges face was a first hint that this was not a well regarded room and although he covered it well the damage was done. Tube noise was a problem and to cap it all an alarm sounded in our room at 6ish in the morning. No card saying happy birthday welcome or anything - very different from my experience of other hotels who make at least a token effort of recognition.,4,2018,10,26
144,Home comforts,"Flemings is our preferred destination during the London Film Festival. The hotel is very comfortable and homely, made all the more so by the staff who are always welcoming, friendly and helpful. We will be back.",5,2018,10,24
144,Wonderful place to stay on our first visit to the UK.,"We booked the 2-bedroom suite/apartment which had a full kitchen, living room and extra half bath.  There was plenty of room for our family of 5 adults.  The furnishings were great and everything was very clean.  The staff were beyond friendly and helpful.  Breakfast was one of the highlights each day.  Food was delicious and beautifully presented.  The hotel is within walking distance to many of the city's attractions.  We will definitely stay at Flemings Mayfair on our next visit.",5,2018,10,23
144,"Wonderful Staff, Great Location","My husband and I stayed here for three nights. It is walking distance to Buckingham Palace and Piccadilly Circus and a quick boat ride to the Tower of London. The Staff here is amazing. Thank you to Pasquale, Oldevigi, Ciro, Agnieska, William, and Alex. You treated us like we were the most important people in the world. Gracious and attentive and patient. Thank you!",4,2018,10,22
144,business trip,"super friendly staff at all times, cool design and you feel good going to the hotel. i'm sure it have much more nice to offer if we stay longer ! this time was only a shorter business staym but we certanly found the staff helpfull and tryign to do their best for us ! ",5,2018,10,22
144,London has plenty of better options,"Our room was not ready at arrival on 1:15 pm. We were directed to tea room having some drinks. It didn't take too long, however, until we were directed into the room, and our luggage was delivered right away.
Our room was a spacious suite (701). It was quite winding road there, but fortunately there was another door outside next to the room. Room was located ground floor, and I don’t know if it was it or something else but there was a terrible noise at night time on several occasions (people talking loudly).
Bathroom was quite small compared to the size of suite itself, and shower was in the bath, unfortunately. Only one very small sink was provided there. Two big tv sets, one in the living room and another in bedroom. Good bed. 
Breakfast service was slow and unorganized, and breakfast itself quite poor in both variety and quality (considering located at 5 star hotel).",3,2018,10,20
144,Great Mayfair location,Small room in a great Mayfair  location. Difficult to take heavy luiggage to the room as I had to deal sith couple of stair in addition to the elevator. The location is very convinient as it is very close to Picadilly and the neighborhood is great.  In close proximity to London's best boutiques. ,4,2018,10,18
144,Best Hotel in London for Certain,"Best hotel with the most awesome staff.  Fabulous location too.  As compared to the other 5 star hotel I stayed at in London, The Flemings beats them hands down with personal service and attention to detail.  A must stay!",5,2018,10,18
144,Full Moon,"The staff at this establishment are the icing on the cake, so good. Attentive, friendly but always respectful. Truly impeccable service. The location, near to everything you want to see or do. Cocktails to die for. My one reservation, the room 413, tired bathroom with cracked tiles and a rather cheap rubber shower mat, I could go on, just an unpleasant bathroom. Given that, I would absolutely stay again, in fact I want to stay again.",4,2018,10,18
144,Charming and Friendly,I had noticed this hotel on a previous trip to London and it turned out to be even better than expected.The staff in all areas of the hotel were friendly and helpful especially the staff in the breakfast room which made for a very pleasant start to each day.The rooms are a little smaller than those in standard chain hotels but are well equipped and the bed was very comfortable..,4,2018,10,17
144,Lovely Hot,Hotel is very nice and the staff are really friendly. We had lunch at the hotel which was very nice.  We stayed in a deluxe club room the size of the room was ok same for the bathroom. The room seemed alittle tired and could do with some items being replaced. The bed was very comfortable and the noise was very minimal. However the location of this hotel in london is brilliant.,4,2018,10,17
144,Excellent boutique hotel,"Although the room was a little cramped, overall the stay was great. Flemings is in the perfect location for shopping, dining, theatre trips, walks in the London parks. Great location, excellent service and the marvellous Ormer restaurant on site. The bed was comfortable & we slept well. We shall definitely return on our next visit to London",5,2018,10,17
144,Terrific spot for our family vacation to London,"We were visiting London from the US for the third time in three years and had decided we wanted to stay in walking distance of Green Park Tube Stop which is accessible for strollers/push cars.  We were two adults and one almost three year old.  The hotel was well located a short walk from Green Park Tube, bus stops, Mayfair neighborhood, Shephard’s Market and short walk to PIccadilly.  The room was spacious and had plenty of room for the pack and play (provided by the hotel and ready in the room once our room was available).  The breakfast was included in our stay and was good.  We also ate dinner one evening in the library--a very cozy little room with a good -albeit limited -menu.  The bathroom was well appointed and had a deluxe hair dryer.  The staff was great and very helpful.  They recommended a couple of just perfect restaurants in the neighborhood (ie charming, delicious reasonable and ok for our well behaved 3 year old but not 'kid' places...recommendations were perfect!)  Our only complaint was the service charges.  We tipped in cash as we went along.  However when i went to check out there were significant (in my judgement) service charges added to each of the breakfasts (ie that were included in our reservation) and each night in the hotel.    If I had known about these in advance I would have not tipped in cash (and therefore worried less about how much local currency we had on hand each day....). The front desk readily took them off but it did put a bit of a shade on an otherwise amazing stay.  I would however stay again readily!",5,2018,10,17
144,Early 60s US couple,"We highly recommend this hotel to tourists.  The location was very convenient and the hotel was lovely.  We stayed in an Executive King room, which was a very nice size for a London hotel.   The breakfast was great and those serving breakfast could not have been nicer.",5,2018,10,16
144,Perfect in every detail,"The room was super comfortable. Lovely bathroom. Peaceful. Fabulous linens and towels. Breakfast was excellent and dinner was absolutely outstanding. The food delicious and beautifully presented. The service faultless, friendly and fun.",5,2018,10,15
144,Great To Be Back,"First time back at Flemings since the completion of the building work, the corridor carpet is now so lush and springy that you almost wonder if the floor is OK. Our room was tastefully decorated and in the main well appointed. There are no standard  rooms at this hotel and ours was not quite large enough to fit both an upholstered bench and the bed's foot and an armchair.

We booked a combined food and accommodation package and enjoyed both fine dining and wonderfully substantial Sunday brunch, made even better by a super-late checkout time

But what really makes Flemings stand out the quality of service, walking the tightrope of total attentiveness and discretion. Its a standard and ethos I have never experienced anywhere else to quite this degree. Sure, this is premium hotel in high end London,  but you can see where the premium goes. No mater if a stay is a one off treat or part of a lifestyle Flemings will cater for you like no one else",5,2018,10,14
144,Loved it!!!,"Kindness and friendliness of concierge and door staff was faultless. Room decor was gorgeous and the location was perfect, just a short walk across the park to the palace. I was looked after so well and would definitely stay at Flemings again!",5,2018,10,13
144,Curious stay,"We enjoyed this hotel for decor, location and comfort. Green Park station is a fabulous hub from the airport and to other sites. Walking to Mayfair and Soho etc. Not to mention a park effectively next door.  Rooms were not spacious but well designed. Restaurants and lounges  are lovely to experience and good enough menu wise. A drink in the bar after dinner out became a habit.  We did find the service a bit erratic across all areas. Difficult to pin down but not enough to stop a return visit. ",5,2018,10,12
144,Beautiful hotel in a great location,I stayed in this hotel for a few days.  I had a single room however I thought the room was relatively larger than others of this type I had stayed in before and also the size of the bed was bigger than a standard single.

144,A distinguished and tastefully appointed boutique hotel with First Class service.,"On our first trip to England, we saw many amazing places: Castles, Churches, Cathedrals, Museums, Parks, Stores, Theater ...in London, and Stratford, The Cotswolds, Devon, Warwick, Stonehenge, Exeter, Falmouth, Tintegael, Penzance, Lands End, Oxford, and more, however staying at Fleming was definitely one of the high points.  ",5,2018,10,10
144,Home away from home,"Excellent location, quiet yet so convenient, just a stone's throw away from Piccadilly.  Staff is discreet and helpful.  I felt well taken care of yet even though staff service has not been conspicuous.  The room I stayed in was a good size, the bed was really comfortable.  The bathroom was clean with a good size tub which I totally appreciated for bubble baths at night.  :-)  Quite pricey but - what else would you expect in London!?!  Lived up to its positioning as small luxury hotel.  ",5,2018,10,08
144,Above expectations,"From the moment you arrive the staff greeting, the quality of  the  accommodation and the food service were found to be of the highest standard. We are unable to fault any aspect of our st a y and would highly recommend this hotel.",5,2018,10,06
144,Lovely Stay,What a fantastic Hotel. This hotel is lavish yet comfortable and inviting. We stayed for one night and upon checking in I was greeted by the door man and was escorted to check in right away. They took my bags and while I waited for the room to be ready I was offered a drink in the Drawing Room. The room was a good size for London and had a very roomy bathroom. We enjoyed dinner at Ormer Mayfield which I cannot recommend enough!! We did the tasting menu which was a 7 course dinner and I'm so glad we did. Most of the items are meals I would never be brave enough to order but I ate every single thing! Beautiful presentation and incredible food! We also had tea service at the Drawing Room which was lovely and informative. The staff at this hotel were all wonderful and friendly. I would highly recommend staying here and enjoying all this hotel has to offer. ,5,2018,10,04
144,Cosy and friendly traditional English hotel,Very quiet but central location and excellent service from all staff encountered. The rooms are not large but very well fitted out and extremely cosy and comfortable. The plush carpets and inviting colour schemes helped with the overall enjoyment as well. Not all rooms have bath tubs but I would recommend requesting one that does.,5,2018,10,03
144,"Location ,location, location","As stated in the title, the Fleming Mayfair is situated close to major attractions, tube stops and fantastic shopping areas. 
The staff arr extremely professional and knowledgeable.   The “boys”in the downstairs bar who are mostly from Italy are fun, friendly and make wonderful drinks. My husband and I enjoyed our after dinner drinks and were so entertained we closed down the bar a few nights.  BTW, I was not a drinker but was introduced to some wonderful drinks including Pimms and an espresso martini.   The restaurant is top notch and both breakfast and dinner service are impeccable. 
London is a fabulous city and our stay at this hotel added to our wonderful experience.",5,2018,09,30
144,Perfect,We only stayed for one night wish it had been longer.  The hotel is lovely and cosy with a homely feel.  The staff are fabulous efficient and very friendly.  It’s just across  the road from Green Park and in the other direction Shepherds Market.  Perfect location and would definitely stay again.,5,2018,09,30

Chapeau to the team and I will be back again",5,2018,09,29
144,Beautiful hotel,"I cannot recommend this hotel enough. The room`s décor was stunning, inspired by the glamour of the 1930's, and the bathroom was just as beautiful and luxurious. 
I have booked the Flemings Mayfair for a short birthday celebration in London and the staff looked very well after us. Cannot wait to return.",5,2018,09,29
144,"Perfect location, perfect character","This is a beautiful old hotel, one of the oldest in London. I loved the rickety passageways with their original Georgian floorboards under plush carpets; the room was very small but sumptuous and comfortable; the bathroom splendid. Perfectly located in Half Moon Street, a short walk from Green Park tube and an enjoyable longer walk from Picadilly Circus. Right in the heart of Mayfair with its shops and restaurants. Great breakfasts as well.",5,2018,09,29
144,Birthday Stay,"My girlfriend booked us to stay here for my birthday and it was amazing, the room and amenities blew my mind and all the staff went above and beyond to make my staff feel special, we thank the staff for the upgrade and late check out as well",5,2018,09,28
144,"Excellent Location, Quiet Street, Comfortable Room","If you are in London as a tourist to see the sights, this location is ideal.  Also, the street is quiet, but within a block of lots of restaurants and activity.  The staff is extremely helpful and friendly.  Our room was not in the heart of the hotel.  We were two doors down so if it is raining, it is not as convenient as I would like.  We were in room 604.  The room itself was very nice.  Comfortable bed.  Nice bathroom.   I would book here again if I return to London.",4,2018,09,25
144,Very friendly staff and good service throughout,lovely weekend break at Flemings would visit again very good breakfast and room and location excellent.  Ideal for all London attractions mostly within walking distance.  Would recommend and hope to have a return visit,5,2018,09,24
144,Great Hotel,Overall this was a great hotel.  It is located in a very nice area that has just the right balance of activity of quiet.  We had a junior suite which offered plenty of space for the two of us.  A number of interesting places to explore are in walking distance from the hotel.  Overall a great trip.,5,2018,09,23
144,Flemings Mayfair friendly boutique hotel in the centre of Mayfair,"Lovely stylish hotel great rooms great service highly recommended, breakfast is sensational staff very friendly, clean and quiet.  I booked direct would encourage visitors to do the same using reservations@flemings.co.uk -",5,2018,09,23
144,Location is great,"Pros:
-The hotel is located right off piccadilly street, so its close to regent and oxford and for anything further u can take the tube.
-Breakfast was great and restaurant was cute and cosy.
-Staff are friendly.
-Room is decently sized.

Cons:
-Bathroom is dated with a crazy amount of limescale on the shower head (almost completely blocking water-flow)
-Corners in the bathroom had black mold
-Cleaning in the bathroom wasn’t great i dropped a towel and when i picked it up it was covered in dirt
-Windows wouldn’t open and weren’t properly cleaned despite the fact that i asked them to clean them 3 times
-The AC was extremely old and had a stuffy smell, when I complained they said they would fix it, until the day i left the room smelt stuffy
",3,2018,09,21
144,Windows,The one and only thing that was difficult for me is that the windows didn't opened easily and the one who did a little was in the bathroom... I would suggest an other way to solve it because its nice to open the window and have a little of fresh air...  ,5,2018,09,19
144,Flemings Mayfair,A classic and classy boutique hotel hidden in Central London. Spacious accomodations are available. Service is Impeccable with attention to every last detail. Choose a plan that includes breakfast for the excellent food and superb staff.,5,2018,09,18
144,Great Stay,"This was a special treat for us to stay in a 5 star hotel in London and we were not disappointed with the choice of your hotel ,all the staff were so attentive without being in your face ,the food was amazing in Omer;s the room was fabulous a truly 5 Star experience ",5,2018,09,17
144,A Gem,"We had a minor issue at check in which was quickly remidied by the manager. Our room was spectacular and extremely quiet. The bed was very comfortable. Bath tub was perfect size .

Breakfast is wonderful buffet. My only suggestion is an egg feature. I observed most guests grappling with wanting eggs and the buffet.
The hotel bar below is sexy stylish and the staff recommended a Cognac cocktail which was fabulous.",5,2018,09,17
144,Great hotel for a luxurious stay in central London ,"My wife and I stayed in Fleming’s as a birthday surprise for her and we had a fab time. 

We booked an online deal that included lunch and breakfast which was great value. The location is great - only a short walk to many key tourist spots and the hotel itself is excellent. Our bedroom wasn’t very big but the decor was great and the bathroom was a good size. There’s a feel of luxury when you walk around the hotel - something that you don’t get with large chain hotels. 

The food at lunch was beautiful, although we both had the red currant soufflé for dessert and weren’t huge fans of it. The restaurant staff were friendly, chatty and smiley and they gave my wife a complimentary pastry with birthday candle after we had finished our 3 courses. 

Breakfast was a continental buffet - more than adequate if you’re not after a huge feed and with reasonable choice of cereals, fruit, pastries, bread and cold meats. It was nice, but would probably have seemed expensive at £20+ p/p had it not been included in our package cost. 

Highly recommended hotel for a relaxing short stay...we’d definitely return. ",5,2018,09,17
144,Excellent location ,"This hotel is right in the middle of everything you would want to do in London. Near shops, sights and parks. Friendly staff. Only downside, their classic bedrooms need to be renovated especially their bathrooms. This would put me off staying here again. ",4,2018,09,17
144,Perfect location,"This hotel has a perfect location just off the busy shopping areas. Close to the Tube, and walking distance to most things you want to do in London. Friendly and welcoming staff. The room was not ready since I was a bit early, and even though they promissed that they would speed up the housekeeping, it took a little bit too long to wait for. The room was well furnished, but I had asked for a quite location, and instead got one room where there was a huge ventilator standing just outside the window. Bathroom had a good size but definitely needs to be renovated. Everything I put i the safe got boiling hot. Old-fashioned bathtub (I had ordered a shower..), a sink which took hours for the water to sink down. I guess this is common English standard, but for foreigners used to 2100 century standard, this needs to be improved in order for me to stay there again. I did remarks to the staff about the above, and hopefully they will look in to it.",4,2018,09,16
144,Luxurious and Friendly,I stayed here while I was attending a conference a short walk away. I chose not to stay at the large chain so I could have some privacy as there were nearly 1000 delegates. It was the best decision! The restaurants were beautiful and the whole experience made it possible to travel half way around the world and still feel rested and relaxed.,5,2018,09,13
144,Lovely London hotel,"My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay in London.  The location of this hotel is perfect and easily accessible.  The room was well appointed and comfortable, especially with having a separate sitting area.  Staff are helpful and friendly.  We would definitely consider staying here again on a next visit!",5,2018,09,12
144,A Gem in Mayfair,"I stayed for two nights at Flemings Mayfair. I couldn't have been more pleased. The hotel is perfectly located to explore London on a quiet street steps from Green Park. The staff is very friendly and helpful, the room clean and well appointed. This is a real gem in the heart of London.",5,2018,09,12
144,Wifes 50th,"Excellent stay,great location friendly staff ,food from the drawing room very good, rooms very comfortable, would defiantly stay at the Fleming's hotel again.Staff did calculate incorrect check out charge but this was quickly rectified",5,2018,09,12

Our room was beautiful with Elemis products, the staff were  very welcoming and nothing was too much trouble for them. I would recommend this hotel and will return on my next visit to London.",5,2018,09,11
144,Exceptional Experience for our Family - Highly Recommend,"Stayed at Flemings Mayfair in August 2018 and this was by far one of the best experiences we've ever had.  The staff was uber accommodating and friendly, the room (2 bedroom + living area and kitchen) was large and clean and the location has to be the best in all of London.  We arrived early due to a red-eye flight and although our room wasn't ready yet, the staff was able to put us into a one bedroom unit that was available so we could shower and rest.  Literally go out of their way to make you feel comfortable and welcome.  Staying here was one of the best travel decisions we've ever made.  Will definitely return.  I highly recommend it.",5,2018,09,10
144,Great boutique hotel,"Fabulous cozy spaces in a great location for site seeing, shopping and great food.  Staff was great, nice amenities.  The bar was great, cozy and fun staff.  We liked it had an exercise space for a smaller hotel too.  I'ld book it again!",5,2018,09,09
144,5* experience,"A wonderful hotel with a great restaurant.  Staff very helpful.  Evening meal a memorable experience, truly deserving of its Michelin star. Room very comfortable with tasteful decor.  It felt like a stay in a private house.",5,2018,09,06
144,24 Hours of pure luxury... best staff in London.,"We were visiting this hotel for my 18th birthday in August 2018. We were greeted  out of our car by a finely polished and very well mannered concierge, they efficiently took our luggage from the car and escorted us into the reception area. We checked into our room, and we were taken upto our room were our luggage was waiting for us, the hallways were spotless, beautiful furnished and every staff member we walked past greeted us with a smile. The room was amazing, it was spacious, beautifully designed and filled with luxury. The bathrooms have heated floors, huge rain showers and top of the range cosmetic products. After a day and night out in London we slept amazingly well and we ready for breakfast, and the breakfast did not disappoint. A huge continental breakfast is on offer as well as a huge variety of hot dishes. We checked out and once again this was an effortless process. Thank you to all staff and management for making this a truly memorable 18th birthday.",5,2018,09,05

Rooms very comfortable and well decorated.
Most of the staff incredibly helpful and very friendly.",5,2018,09,04
144,Great stylish London hotel,"Stayed for weekend for 2nd time. Really like the style and décor having recently had a full refurb - lovely bathrooms and furnishings. Immaculate and nice staff. Small boutique type hotel in a great location for Mayfair area, easy stroll to park, Buckingham palace, Fortnums, New Bond St etc. Handy to have bar menu in lounge, and good restaurant. If you like a quality boutique style hotel you won't be disappointed.",4,2018,09,03

144,Very Good Experience,Very clean environment. The staff there was impeccable in their service and attention to details. Right smack in the city center and near to all attractions. I highly recommend this for business or casual tourists looking to explore the London city area. ,5,2018,09,01
144,Awesome hotel,My wife and I had the most incredible time at the Fleming hotel.  The staff demonstrated the utmost in customer service and covered every detail.  I would highly recommend this hotel for anyone travelling to London.  ,5,2018,09,01
144,A nice return to Flemings,When staying over on business this is always my preferred hotel. Service is great and the rooms very clean and comfortable. Right next to Green Park and a short stroll from Victoria - ideal. There was a nice welcome back card and gift in the room - these small touches matter. I can't recommend this place enough and will return.,5,2018,09,01
144,Possibly the finest hotel in Europe,My daughter and I took a side trip to London last week.  My travel agent booked the Fleming Mayfair.  ALL services and food were flawless and always provided with a smile and kind word.  Recommend Highly!!!!,5,2018,08,29
144,very good choice,"the hotel is really well located close to green park and to the underground station. Possibility to go to central London by walking, 5 min away. Hotel staff is very nice and helpfull! The breakfast is amazing, a lot of choices and if not available at the buffet, you can ask and they bring special products such as soya milk.",5,2018,08,29
144,Amazing hotel wonderfully located!,"Flemings Mayfair is one of the best hotels I have stayed in. The staff are warm, friendly, polite and efficient. Our rooms were cleaned really well and the beds were very comfortable. The hotel is perfectly located with easy access to the train station, grocery stores and wonderful restaurants - all within walking distance. What's also awesome is that it is located on a quiet street. Once you get off Piccadilly to Half Moon, its nice and quiet. This is a hotel I will definitely stay again!!",5,2018,08,27
144,Wonderful hotel with an AMAZING staff!,"I had a great experience at this hotel. I had an accident on my way to the hotel and the hotel staff were incredibly helpful and accommodating while I was dealing with the situation. The hotel itself is beautiful; I really enjoyed the room and the atmosphere. The bed is very firm, which I like. The one suggestion I have is to change the partial glass door in the shower. I always ended up with a lot of water on the floor.",5,2018,08,25
144,Location best luxury hotel,It was highly prestigious hotel and interior and exterior was a traditional making ot the United Kingdom.Location was best in the center of london. Service level of the staff was high and they had a hospitality of the heart. The room was small but was enough for traveling along. I want to stay next time I go to london and I`m happy if there is a littke more discount rate plan.,5,2018,08,24
144,LOVE this hotel!,Beautiful & historic hotel located on a pretty little street in Mayfair - EXCELLENT location.  Rooms are absolutely gorgeous.  Beautiful bar/ cafe off the lobby - perfect for a cocktail or cup of tea. We cannot wait to return!,5,2018,08,23
144,Could not have picked a better hotel,"A walk from anywhere, so comfortable, lovely staff all round. We were so happy that we booked here again for our return journey. Just be aware that the hotel does have Do Not Disturb door hangers (ours was on the safe). Don’t rely on the red button as that means knock but don’t enter to housekeeping. Special thanks to Greg & Andrew. Staff could not have provided a more friendly and obliging service.",5,2018,08,21
144,Riichard Goldstein,"The overall staff was pleasant , professional and available at all times. The location of the property was excellent for our purposes. The comfort of rooms was great and the food and beverage service fulfilled all our needs. ",5,2018,08,20
144,"Tired bathroom, small noisy room, amazing service","Flemings has such a lot of promise. The rooms are small, which you would expect from a London hotel, but the bathrooms are very tired and need some work done, even in the rooms renovated in 2016. The shower head was absurdly filled with scale, making it hard to wash. The room was also fairly noisy. Service was excellent, though, with the exception of the sommelier at the otherwise excellent Ormer restaurant, who has perfected the art of making you think you're making bad wine choices.",3,2018,08,20
144,Anniversay Break!,"This hotel is absolutely amazing. All of the staff are so friendly and my wife and I were made to feel extremely welcome. The room was lovely and clean, as was the rest of the hotel. The complimentary continental breakfast was delicious and plentiful. I would highly recommend this hotel and would definitly return.",5,2018,08,20
144,Flemings Mayfair London at its Best,"My wife and I have stayed at the Flemings Mayfair many times. If your not looking for one of the larger more  Western type hotels, the Flemings Mayfair is an excellent choice. It's a well maintained London Hotel, across the street from a beautiful park. iIf you walk through the park you will end up staring at  Buckinghsm Palace. Its around the corner from the first Hard Rock Restaurant & store. Down the block is the very unique Sheffield Court, full of classic English pubs. And many wonderful restaurants from around the world. The Flemings is a Hotel that can answer every question about London activities, shows, The Arts, museums Unbelivable Besutiful Gardens. You ask the Consignor, what your looking for, and he will get you there. Or give you the honest pros & Cons. It's a class act.",5,2018,08,19
144,Nice place for Hobbits,"I went to boarding school and my dormitory was more comfortable, the room was TINY and not very comfortable, staff not overly helpful it was probably one of the most uncomfortable places I have stayed, ",2,2018,08,19
144,Came back and loved it again!,"We came back with our daughters this time and loved to stayed here again. We booked a Junior Suite and were upgraded to a Studio Suite. Absolutely lovely room, spacious and beautiful decor.
All the staff was again very attentive.
We had the breakfast included and the selection of the buffet was large and delicious. We recommend you try their home made granola!",4,2018,08,19
144,Poor Service,"While there are some staff who were good, most of the staff are lacking service oriented attitude and enthusiasm.  What an irony is that they charged service charge on top on the fees I paid to the agent on the internet.  What is most disappointing is that I left behind a pair of shoes and send an email making an inquiry, and no response after 3 days;  ",2,2018,08,17
144,business trip,"some disturbance from street noise at 3am, but should have closed my window!!
otherwise a superb hotel with wonderful staff and facilities.
will endeavour to make it my hotel of choice in future in London for both business & pleasure.",5,2018,08,13
144,Just ok,"The location was close to Buckingham palace. The staff was polite but not friendly. Room service was not very good. They would get the order wrong. Clearing out the tray would take long. Any dish left outside the room stayed there for 24 hours. Conceirge seemed a bit irritated when I changed my mind on tours I wanted booked. 
Overall nice hotel but don’t know if we will return. ",3,2018,08,12
144,Home Away from Home in London,"One of the finest hotels in which we've ever stayed. Excellent, professional and responsive staff; great location; delicious food; super clean and exquisite furnishings... I could go on for days about how wonderful this place is. ",5,2018,08,11
144,Fantastic hotel,"What a fantastic hotel. The staff could not have been more helpfully. You really made our holiday. Especially a lovely lady called Aga at breakfast time, who was so attentive and made my 6 year old boy laugh a lot. Thank you.",5,2018,08,09
144,Very friendly hotel,What a fabulous hotel! Set in the heart of London. Excellent value for money and friendly staff. Rooms are very clean and very chic. I would not hesitate to stay there again and would highly recommend. ,5,2018,08,09
144,Family present - London Trip,"Excellent base
Good standard of accommodation, very comfortable and relaxing.  Good menu variety of light meals
Nice areas within the hotel for dining, or drinks
Attentive staff, nice general atmosphere all round",5,2018,08,09
144,Great location with awesome service,"We just spent three nights here. 

The hotel is small in size but big with its service approach. We enjoyed luxurious service throughout the visit.

Location was perfect for us: close to Buckingham palace, Green park, Hyde park, etc.

There was also an idyllic Shepherd Market with many restaurants and bars in two minute walk distance from the hotel.

",5,2018,08,07
144,Relaxing and good location,Stayed for 2 nights for a birthday trip and enjoyed our stay with good service...Rooms were clean and tidy...handy location anext to green Park station/The Ritz/The Wolseley etc..10 minute walk to Piccadilly etc..Will stay again,5,2018,08,07
144,Julia Roberts,"A gorgeous hotel with mostly friendly and attentive staff (especially in the bar, at breakfast and on the desk except the lady with long, dark hair-very rude). Gorgeous breakfast and rooms. The afternoon tea was a massive disappointment!",4,2018,08,07
144,Highly recommend Flemings,"My wife and I stayed at Fleming’s Mayfair for four nights on the front end of our recent UK trip and one night on the back end. Terrific location near the Green Park tube station on the Piccadilly line (direct access from Heathrow), but on a quiet side street to avoid the clamor of Piccadilly while enjoying the proximity to all that Mayfair has to offer.  Mayfair is a great location - walkable to parks, restaurants, other parts of London like Knightsbridge, Westminster, etc.  Rooms at Fleming’s were very nice - completely updated and very comfortable. Service is outstanding.  Award-winning restaurant on property and a short walk to many outstanding Mayfair options. Would stay again in a heartbeat. ",5,2018,08,05
144,Beautiful ,"I’ve now stayed at Flemings twice - in January and July this year.

Both times the rooms were beautifully decorated, the welcome & overall service impeccable, and the staff all went above and beyond to offer a very memorable stay. There were some lovely extra unexpected touches too (eg chocolates & bubbles to celebrate a special occasion).

Bearing in mind this perfect location in one of the most expensive parts of London, I think this hotel is great value for money and far nicer than many larger chain hotels nearby.

The bar and breakfast were both great. I would definitely recommend the hotel and had a wonderful experience both times.

I haven’t seen their new apartments but looks like they could be good value for two couples on a London mini break, as they have kitchens in them.",5,2018,08,03
144,Lovely Weekend stay,My wife and I arrived early and appreciated the fact that our room was available to us from around 1pm. The reception staff were friendly and efficient. Though our room was small (411) it was clean and beautifully presented. The staff in the breakfast room were also professional and the standard of the full english exceptional.,5,2018,08,02
144,London Visit 2018,"The Flemings has become a second home-like experience. The staff are very accommodating and welcoming. The rooms are well maintained and very clean with a few extra nice comforts, heated towel rack and bathroom floor. The breakfast is has a variety of offerings and is open at helpful hours. ",5,2018,08,02
144,Lovely hotel,wonderful location - friendly staff - good value - we make regular trips to London and will consider this hotel given its location and friendly service. The only hiccup was the room wasn't ready until 4 - we ad travelled all day and needed a refresh - overall a good experience,5,2018,07,31
144,My recommendation ,"I am a chauffeur for a 5 Star knightsbridge hotel and a guest of mine asked for a recommendation for dinner that evening. We were passing Flemings and I suggested they check out the menu for Ormer. They liked the look of it and asked if I could book it for them I went in, Adile was on duty and very kindly came out to speak with my guests and made the reservation for them. On arrival they were greeted by Charlie. Next morning speaking to our concierge they said everything had been excellent and the best restaurant they had been to in London. Thank you to all for making me look good. Will definitely recommend in the future. ",5,2018,07,30
144,reservation was canceled on us.,"We wont be going to this hotel again. Too Risky! When we arrived after a long day of challenges, we were told our reservation was canceled. A computer glitch...uh huh...If the manager had to come down to tell us this, they knew in advance! They sent us to another hotel, The Capital.",2,2018,07,30
144,Perfect break,"Wonderful friendly staff, great central location ideal for a city break, close to Buckingham Palace and central London tourist attractions.  Plenty of nearby cafes and restaurants and short walk to Green Park and the Mall.",5,2018,07,30
144,Over priced for tiny rooms,"These were undoubtedly the smallest rooms we have ever endured during our 6 previous stays in London.The breakfasts were great, but it just could not make up for the sardine can rooms.
Also, make sure you don't have a room facing the street, as it is ridiculously noisy and you will be awake all night.
Overall, extremely disappointing and poor value for money",1,2018,07,29
144,Very nice and shall we say cozy hotel in Mayfair,"The Flemings hotel is a charming, classically appointed hotel, nicely done after their renovation.  The staff are very helpful, and the location is very good (close to Green Park tube station, Piccadilly St, Shepherds Market, not too far from Oxford and Regent Streets also).  Wi-fi was included and relatively reliable.  Good in-room tea/coffee selection, and as part of daily room cleaning they appear to provide small bottles of water which is a nice touch (not sure if that is typical or due to the heat wave the week I was there!  Oh speaking of that, the A/C worked excellently).

Only minor nits:  the standard room was a bit smallish comparatively, though fine for a business traveler of 1; there wasn't much of a work desk, just a small hutch and ottoman-like chair to sit upon; and the shower only had a half-glass door that tended to swing open and result in minor flooding in the bathroom.",4,2018,07,27
144,Exquisite and English,"I've been staying here for over 20 years, and the current upgrade is the hotel's most beautiful incarnation. It's an English hotel in historic buildings; thus some of the rooms are small but all are elegant and comfortable; the food is marvelous, and the staff is wonderfully gracious and helpful. Plus a great location: near Green Park Tube station, Piccadilly and the Ritz, the Royal Academy, and the very pleasant Green Park that leads down to Buckingham Palace.",5,2018,07,27
144,Luxury in a historic building,"Our room was in an adjacent building to the main hotel - in an old old building with a teeny elevator, but everything inside the room was up-to-the-minute modern and luxurious. The location is great - right by Shepherd's Market, which is great for cafes and restaurants. Also close to the Green Park subway stop, Oxford St. shopping, and other attractions",5,2018,07,26
144,Weekend Break,"We love our weekends in London and enjoy trying out differing Hotels. Flemings is a delight. It originated from being a number of Georgian houses knocked together and benefits from a recent refurbishment that whilst lavish is in sympathy with its period. It is elegant and comfortable. The staff are friendly and helpful and one of the staff in particular, a Concierge, Jean-Paul, is a real asset to the Hotel being knowledgeable, interesting and willing to assist as best as he can. We had a standard room which was a little smaller but our choice, we could have booked  a larger one. Good decor and comfortable. Breakfast was buffet style with a good variety of foods. Certainly would stay there again. Great location not far from Green Park tube and easy walking distance to Piccadilly, Regent Street, Covent Garden to name a few.",5,2018,07,24
144,Fantastic Short Break at Flemings,I recently had a 4 night stay at Flemings hotel. My expectations were exceeded and everyone was very pleasant including the room service staff.

144,Great property for work and pleasure. Walkable location to all London Hot spots,"The recently remodeled property was very nice. Clean rooms, friendly staff, great food, and good location for shopping and restaurants. I traveled there with my wife for business and we had almost the whole hotel reserved for my company. They were very accommodating. Quick walk to Piccadilly and the Green Park Underground station is very close.  ",5,2018,07,22

Rooms were wonderful, towels are warm, thick and thirsty after a great rain shower.  Downstairs restaurant expansion was welcomed and the breakfast is excellent and fast.  

Staff is polite, helpful, friendly and great help while navigating London and the many sites and restaurants.  We will be back!",5,2018,07,21

Bathroom was still very small  
The location and the rest is great

144,VERY NICE HOTEL IN GOOD LOCATION,The hotel is victorian style with great service from the time the bellman let's you out of your cab. Larger than usual size rooms for a European Hotel with large bathtubs.  Bars and restaurants ;are excellent.,4,2018,07,14
144,Ruined an expensive sweater and tried to gaslight me that it was fine,"Was here for 2 weeks on a work trip. Sent a very nice sweater for dry-cleaning and it came back many sizes smaller. They insisted nothing was wrong with it, which was incredibly insulting. Wouldn't even refund me the small dry cleaning charge. 
Other than that the room was nice.",2,2018,07,14

144,Perfect,"Lovely experience, particularly enjoyable surroundings in beautiful Drawing Room.  Friendly staff, very happy with visit.  Returning to London in August and will not hesitate to rebook directly with hotel.  Highly recommended.",5,2018,07,11
144,Great location & service,"This was our second visit to Flemings and we enjoyed it once again on this occasion.  The premises had been renovated since our visit in early 2014 but had kept the character it had previously, which was good- it was nice to recognise a familiar ambience. We had just one cause for concern -we arrived at 3:45pm but our room wasn’t ready for over an hour.  Granted, we had asked for a specific room for sentimental reasons, and we could have been given another straight away, but on the flip side of this, the hotel had known of our specific request for more than six months & it was well after check in time when we arrived.  This was our only slight criticism in an otherwise faultless visit.  The location of the hotel is superb & all staff are very friendly and helpful.  We didn’t take breakfast in the hotel, as its price was outlandish but there are several good options for breakfast in close proximity.  We will definitely return to Flemings if we are fortunate enough to return to London in the future.",4,2018,07,11
144,Nice again,"As a returner, i appreachiate the developement during the last years. Really great and beautiful new restaurant. Superb and friendly staff. My favorite hotel during the last 5 years in the middle of London Mayfair.",4,2018,07,11
144,First time in London,The staff was very friendly and accommodating. We had a newly remodeled room which was beautiful and comfortable. Bed was comfortable and shower was great! Location at Green Park was perfect for us and close to everything we needed.,5,2018,07,11

144,Small room and many stairs,"Each staff member was helpful and kind every time that I needed something. However, my experience in the Hotel was not good because of the size and location of the room where I stayed. A small room where the display of the fornitures made difficult to go around the bed. There was not enough space to take our luggages to where the luggage rack was, so I had to carry it over the bed, wich was also small. 

To get to the room I would have to either take the stairs, or take the elevator, than go down a few steps, pass trough a glass door and then go up some other steps again. Not really practical .",3,2018,07,09
144,"friendly, modest priced, central London hotel","small rooms, friendly staff- especially those in the restaurant.  Very close to several parks and major London sites such as Buckingham Palace.  Very easy to get to and from Heathrow either by taxi or tube.",4,2018,07,09
144,best Boutique Hotel in London,"This was my 4th stay at the Flenings! It truly is the best hotel in London!
It has a second to none location and the public areas are so beautifully designed and the rooms have stunning interior! The staff is so attentive and thoughtful. Great breakfast and best eggs Benedict in the city! I will be back! Thanks again for another perfect stay",5,2018,07,09

144,Introduction to London ,"They say location, location, location is the most important part of living. We lived for a week in the amazing residence of Fleming’s Mayfair and it set us up for having a great base for a week in London. However, it was more than a place to stay as the staff went above and beyond on each occasion.  Whether it was from the concierge desk or the breakfast staff it was a truly great way to start our holiday.",5,2018,07,06
144,Another excellent trip,Usual high standard from Flemings- great place to stay when in London for old fashioned service and gorgeous surroundings - super staff and lovely comfortable rooms - near to green park tube so easy access around London,4,2018,07,04
144,Ormer restaurant is amazing!!!,Excellent staff. Warm and welcoming. Great service. Location is excellent. We ate in Ormer and this experience made the weekend. Amazing food and amazing service.

Staff were super friendly and helpful and it was the ideal base from which to explore London. There was often a wait for the lift but we got fit taking the stairs. We didn't eat at the hotel but we did go to the bar which was a real treat. Luxurious surrounds, impeccable service and amazing cocktails.",5,2018,07,02

I had a wonderfull stay in London and I`ll be back this October again.
Flemings is my second home in England

144,One of the Best Hotels in London,"We have stayed many times at the Flemings and cannot fault anything. The staff are exceptional, they are welcoming, friendly, professional and very helpful.  The rooms are furnished well with a great deal of thought for the comfort of their guests. The location is ideal and even the bedrooms on the front of the hotel and reasonably quiet for London.
The recently refurbished restaurant and bar are stunning, although we didn't have chance to dine, we certainly will on our next stay.",5,2018,06,24
144,Absolutely Outstanding!,"I stayed at his hotel recently for business and I absolutely loved the experience at this hotel.  The staff was outstanding and there was a classic / modern feel to the stay (including service).  The room was great and every detail was top notch (toiletries / furnishings etc).  I was given a very nice room  and when I requested a fan, one was brought up immediately.  I also thought the bar downstairs was awesome—relaxed atmosphere to either get some work done with professional staff all around you or spend quality time with your significant other.  Thanks for a great stay!",5,2018,06,23
144,"3rd stay in as many months, can’t fault it. ","A very conveniently located hotel for tube and offices. 
Very friendly and professional staff, nothing is too much trouble and nice little touches everywhere, like a welcoming card. 
Rooms can be compact but very comfortable and heated bathroom floors are something i actually want at home!
Breakfast was also very nice, both the continental and desperate dishes. 
Highly recommended. ",5,2018,06,22
144,Just amazing!!,"Stayed in london for 4 night with my husband  Spent weeks trawling the web to find a decent hotel
near Bond St to have a great experience. Tried several that were fully booked and eventually found the Flemings which was a good price and had good reviews. We got a taxi from paddington which took about 7 mins and cost £8. The hotel is
up a side street just opposite green park and green park tube station. Lovely entrance/reception. Extremely friendly staff. We had arrived 2 hours earlier than check in but our rooms were ready. The rooms were lovely, everything we needed was there free safe and fridge/mini bar/coffee/tea etc.. We had taken champagne to have a toast before we went out and we rang and asked reception if we could have some glasses. A few moments later 4 champagne flutes arrived on a silver tray! The beds were comfortable, there wasn't any noise 
from the street so we had a good nights sleep. We needed to get taxis several times and each time a member of staff walked to the corner to hail one, all for a smile! The hotel was very attractive
and in good order throughout, a buffet breakfast was included which was good. I will certainly be booking this hotel on my next visit to London",5,2018,06,22
144,Tiny Double Room!,Very safe neighbourhood with a good choice of eating places nearby.  This hotel is also very close to Green Park Station so convenient for travel should you wish to use the Underground.  Located near several shopping areas.  ,4,2018,06,22

144,"Location, location location!","New couldn't have picked a better one!  Just a few minutes walk to major sites, beautiful Green and Hyde Parks, and in close proximity to the tube.  What we DIDN't know about, but were pleasantly surprised with, was the easy access to the quaint Mayfair Village ""alleyway"" restaurants and pubs!  This little area had a very European feel to it.  The hotel staff was friendly and the rooms, though expectedly on the small side, were adequate, comfortable and  quiet.  We would book this place again.",4,2018,06,21
144,"Fabulous hotel, great location","I stayed at Fleming's for 3 nights. Wanting to be central, Fleming's offered the perfect Mayfair location,  near St. James', and just minutes from the West End and Soho. My double room was small but perfect for one person. Continental breakfast was fine and there are plenty of decent options nearby (Hide or Wolsely for example) for anyone wanting something more substantial. All I would definitely recommend Fleming's.",5,2018,06,19
144,Family and Friends Weekend,"Well presented, clean and professionally run Hotel in an excellent location,perfect for us within walking distance of most things , although local history surrounding the Hotel could be promoted.Everything on the edge of perfection.Well Done.",5,2018,06,18
144,Lovely little hotel.,We stayed at the hotel Saturday night. We were in a studio suite. The room was quite large and was decorated to an extremely high standard. It really couldn’t be faulted. The bed was very comfortable too. ,5,2018,06,18
144,One night stay in London,"Excellent good location, very friendly professional staff. I did not have breakfast but will do next time I stay. Lovely room, as a woman on my own I felt very safe and comfortable in this hotel due to its size small boutique.",5,2018,06,18
144,Highly recommended,"This is a lovely hotel, in a great location. Room was small but I expected that, nevertheless it was very comfortable and largely clean (damp pink mark on carpet which I think they had tried to clean). But you get a robe and slippers which is a lovely addition. I will definitely return and would recommend it.",5,2018,06,18
144,Fantastic Hotel so good I don’t want you to book,"Fantastic Hotel so good I don’t want you to book. The room is a fantastic staff excellent and location 2nd to none if you want to be in the right place in London.
Found the concierge is helpful and I left a very expensive pair of diamond earrings in the safe, which they arrange to send to me by Corriere with no problem. 
Amazing honesty And good communication with regards to the sending off my earring.
Also, she is really helpful in arranging local bookings and advice for travelling.
A really good point of this hotel is that as it’s an independent its individual so It is not staying in the chain as the majority of hotels in the area are.
Therefore would recommend to stay here.",5,2018,06,17
144,"Don’t accept ground level, street side","This is an SLH property undergoing renovation they should not book hotel during the incessant hammering   Restaurant is worth a visit.  Excellent menu and service.   Street is also a bit trashy.

Lower rates for construction and better warning",1,2018,06,17
144,Fabulous Hotel,"I had one night in London and searched for a reasonably priced hotel in the city center.  Fleming’s was only 175 GBP for a single , all the other hotels I looked at were far more .  I took a chance in booking it and couldn’t believe my luck in finding this gem .  The hotel itself is lovely and my room was completely renovated and beautiful . The staff was so friendly and attentive I felt like royalty. The location is incredible, I walked to Buckingham Palace in 5 minutes and Westminster Abbey in 15.  There are also many great pubs and restaurants within one block from the hotel.  Stay here you will be happy !",5,2018,06,16
144,Perfection,"This is such an adorable boutique hotel, which is exactly what I was looking for. It's actually part of the Small Luxury Hotels of the World group. My room was small, but perfect. Modern, clean, stylish. Not to mention in what I consider to be the best neighborhood in London. Very hip, walkable and full of food, drink and shopping. The service was lovely as well – I would stay here again and again.",5,2018,06,15
144,Our experience,"Excellent, well located smaller hotel with very friendly and helpful staff. We booked bed and breakfast, the breakfasts were exceptional. We did not use the dining facilities other than for this.
We will stay here again subject to pricing being similar.",5,2018,06,15
144,Great Location and Service,"Perfect location for easy access to both the hustle and bustle of the major shopping areas and the beautiful green parks of London.  Great breakfast, great staff, brilliant bar, lovely rooms.  One of my favourites.",5,2018,06,15
144,Excellent location and comfort,"Just a few blocks from Green Park, Picadilly Line, Flemings Mayfair delivered on a quiet room, excellent air-conditioning and no smoking anywhere in the building. Soundproofing was also good. It's a bit pricey for a small room, but the storage and closet space was well-designed. The large glassed-in bathroom (shower only) gave the room a more spacious feel. The room was perfect for the solo leisure traveler. The staff was friendly and the bed turndown was appreciated. I always looked forward to going back to the hotel to recharge and rest. ",5,2018,06,15
144,Wow!,"Spent one night at Flemings for a weekend in London and I wish it had been more! Excellent location just off Piccadilly across from Green Park so within walking distance for shops and tourist attractions. Service in all areas was fantastic from check in to bar service to concierge. My partner was observing Ramadan and I asked if he could have breakfast delivered early (4am) and this was no trouble at all. We upgraded to a deluxe room for £30 which was nicely decorated with a lovely spacious modern bathroom. My only complaint would be the room was a little on the small side. We had drinks in the bar and the cocktails were expertly made with care which you could observe at the bar.  We didn’t eat apart from breakfast which was a good selection including smoked salmon on the continental side but the burgers being delivered in the bar looked amazing! Great service, great quality, great find. We will be back! ",5,2018,06,12
144,Value for money in central location,"We stayed 2 nights in a small double room. As far as we understand the hotel was recently renovated and everything is in top condition, certainly. There are some faint smells, whether due to the renovation or other, that are slightly irritating.
Breakfast (buffet) was good and the coffee excellent. The staff was mostly friendly and professional.
Only almost minus points: Lack of places to put wet towels, but they get changed constantly. Pillows uncomfortable, ut others available on request as we found for our 2nd night.",4,2018,06,12
144,"Beautiful property, extraordinary service.",The staff are very proud of their newly remodeled property and it is head and shoulders above its competition. The location is excellent with services and restaurants on site as well as close by in the Mayfair area.  This really is my favorite place to stay in London. I hope to repeat the visit soon. ,5,2018,06,12
144,Great stay at Flemings Mayfair,"High cleanliness standard, helpful and friendly staff and great location.
Will definitely recommend the stay to friends or colleagues.
Always my top list of hotel stay in London, few minutes walk to great restaurants and shopping district.",5,2018,06,12
144,Short stay in London,Very good choise for short stay in very attractive location.  I enjoyed it and find that tine room is really tiny. But if you need it only for sleeping you will find all you need. Clean and  quiet room on the corridors like a labyrint.,4,2018,06,10
144,Disappointed and massively over-rated ,"We stayed here two nights at the end of our London trip. Here are a few facts:
Room is small and can only fit two pieces of luggage
Our room is in an adjacent building and to access the reception we need to get through the street to the main building.  This is not convenient especially at night. This never happened to me before at any other hotels. 
The reception is friendly but there was not any drink at the lounge, even tap water.
The sound proof is terrible and we can hear next door talking and music - very loud. The lift is very small and can only fit two people and luggage and at some point it did not work. 
We ordered two milk porridge in the breakfast buffet and thought that it be included as the other 4 hotels we stayed in this uk trip did so. But we were charged £15 afterwards without given notice before our order. 
They basically charges for everything. 
Compared with the other 5 hotels we stared during this UK trip , this one is the biggest disappointment.",1,2018,06,10
144,Saddened,"This was a return visit after 8 years and it was a disappointment.  The hot water did not work;  the rooms were tired and attention to detail was lacking.     On the upside, my husband dined in the Hotel and did enjoy it.",2,2018,06,09
144,Ormer and Flemings,"A lovely hotel, great location and very helpful and friendly staff. The food at Ormer is amazing. We had the tasting menu, and loved every morsel. Can’t wait to do it all again. Highly recommended. The bar team also made us some amazing cocktails that weren’t on the drinks menu - just ask.",5,2018,06,09
144,"Great location, comfortable stay","The room was very comfortable, heated restroom floors, heated towels, great location near everything.
A short walk through the park to Buckingham Palace, a block away from the bus tours starting point. Take the classic tour, get tickets right in the hotel lobby. A nearby restaurant called burgers and lobster was excellent.",5,2018,06,05
144,Small luxury hotel in central location,"Had a wonderful 4 night stay, hotel is in great location with large, comfortable rooms. Is a short walk to the Green Park station where you can catch a few train lines and is also walking distance to both Green and Hyde Park. Would highly recommend ",5,2018,06,04
144,Good afternoon tea - but no refills,"We went today for afternoon tea. It was very nice and actually a bit above Standard. We had many afternoon teas including very upscale and this one can hold up - except in one regard: unlike other upscale hotels, the Flemings does not offer refills on afternoon tea. What you see is what you get. It’s a bit of a shame given the price you pay. Otherwise it’s fine. ",4,2018,06,03
144,London stay,"The Fleming in Mayfair is a nice small hotel, my room this time was way to small and didn’t have a shower just a bathtub. The staff are always nice and the location in london couldn’t be better, Mayfair is a very nice hood. ",4,2018,06,03
144,Great Little Luxury Hotel,"I have just left Fleming’s Mayfair and can’t recommend it highly enough. It’s a beautiful hotel in a great location. A quick walk to Buckingham Palace, not too far from Fortnum & Mason’s, a £10 trip to Trafalgar Square and close to the stops for tourist bus services.

The staff are very attentive and made my stay an absolute pleasure. Thank you",5,2018,06,02
144,Great hotel in Mayfair,"My wife and I just celebrated our 15 year wedding anniversary at the Flemings hotel, Henrik, I can't thank you enough for making our special occassion a memorable event in our life that we will not forget, your team is incredible, keep up the great work, great hotel in a great spot, cheers ",5,2018,05,30
144,"For two quick nights it was fine,","Our experience was fine, neither outstanding nor poor. There was nothing memorable about our two night stay. The property and specifically the room was very clean, although our room was TINY. We tried to get an upgrade but there were none available. The staff were welcoming enough, even sending a bottle of wine to our room, I would describe this property as smart casual, and being that it is London and hotels are quite pricy the over all value was simply okay.
I might stay there again but would certainly not go out of my way to do so.",4,2018,05,28
144,Random one night stay,"I made a late booking following a sudden decision to visit London and sought out a boutique hotel in central London within reach of the West End etc. This hotel didn’t disappoint, it measured up well to the claims on its website and is a delight. We were offered a room upgrade for £30 on arrival, the room was immaculate and stylish although could have done with a couple of easy chairs to relax in. We went out so didn’t use the restaurant or bar (which did look quite pricey although you’d expect so) but the breakfast was excellent next morning and based on the whole experience we would definitely visit again. Expect it so set you back a bit though for boutique near Green Park.",5,2018,05,28
144,Beautiful Hotel and Great Service,"We had a weekend getaway for two in London and stayed at the beautiful gem.  Rooms we do Ely decorated and spacious as well at quiet — it did not seem like anyone else was there!

On Saturday morning we asked the concierge for a dinner recommendation (Ryan Alden).  Ryan gave us several recommendations, then scheduled a table while we were out.  Upon return he handed us a slip with the restaurant name, time and gave us directions to a lively French restaurant.  He even asked for outdoor seating.  Outstanding service.  We will be back.",5,2018,05,27

Room was clean and comfortable, restaurant food was excellent quality served by very personable personnel.
Location is central, within walking range of Green Park, Hyde Park, museum of natural history, etc.",5,2018,05,26
144,"Great location, small rooms",We booked this hotel in London at the advice of our travel agent.  It was a great location close to Green Park and Buckingham Palace.  Many restaurants and sights are withing walking distance or easily accessible by TUBE or BUS.  I stress this as we found relying on taxis for transportation was expensive and slower due to traffic. The service personnel at this hotel were very helpful and responsive.  The concierge was most helpful in providing us directions to sights and how to use the public transportation to get there.  We were also pleased with the responsiveness an friendliness of the the restaurant and other personnel. Our only complaint is that the rooms are quite small for a luxury rated hotel. For a hotel in this price range I would have expected larger rooms.      ,4,2018,05,23
144,quick stay in Mayfair,"a new place for me, but nice, cosy, convenient and not the usual international chain hotel. The room was nice, comfortable, with a good bed ... a bit weird to sleep under the street level, albeit slightly",4,2018,05,22
144,Mayfair Lady,"Property is fabulous, a compact gem, and in a terrific location - just about everything you could want is just a short walk away. Staff are professional & polished, always there to help - no questions asked. Definitely on my list to revisit.",5,2018,05,22
144,A lovely stay in this luxurious hotel,"We had booked a twin room to be close to Buckingham Palace, where my son was receiving his Gold Duke of Edinburgh award. When we got there, it was to find that we had been upgraded to a huge apartment- the height of luxury with a bathroom each as well as a bedroom each and one to share! Everything about the room was lovely - except perhaps that every clock said a different time, and that the water took so long to run hot, both in the bath and the shower, but they were very minor details. We ate in the Ormer restaurant, where the food was magnificent, the sommelier did a wonderful job pairing wines for us, and as a highlight, the kitchen prepared a special dessert for my son to say congratulations. The staff were attentive, but personable with it. There was a small mix-up, but this was handled quickly and graciously. All the staff within the hotel were friendly and helpful and made us feel nothing was too much trouble.",5,2018,05,17
144,"A fine London stay, and excellent staff!","We booked 4 nights in London at Flemings Mayfair before our cruise departing out of Dover.  The hotel is in a great location, central to everything, yet in a quiet spot.  We booked with included breakfast, which was a great way to start our day.  Our room and bath were well equipped, though the room was a bit small as can be expected in a classic London hotel.  The hotel staff is great and sets Flemings apart from the rest.  Very friendly and helpful in every way.  Concierge staff helped with booking and recommending shows.  The location made it easy for us to see 4 shows in 3 days.  We plan to book Flemings Mayfair for our next London visit and recommend without hesitation.",5,2018,05,16
144,very good!,"excellent position, staff is very kind and professional, michelin starred restaurant is a fantastic experience, room a little tight but probably because it was a standard room. nothing more to add: very good!",4,2018,05,16
144,Exceptional top end boutique hotel experience,"A memorable stay. Differences were; the high standard of everything that makes up a great hotel and the consistency of being made to feel welcome by all staff in all areas at all times -  and their eagerness to help, regardless of request. Well done",5,2018,05,15
144,Superb in every way.,Second time we have stayed at Flemings and the staff were still as professional and friendly. Room was spotlessly clean and beautiful decor. Bath with powerful shower attached. Food at dinner in Ormer restaurant was amazing - staff professional and courteous. Can’t wait to stay again. Fanatastic location.,5,2018,05,14
144,Fabulous stay at a beautiful hotel,"We had the pleasure of staying at this fabulous boutique hotel last Friday, and although we were at an event for most of the evening, we thoroughly enjoyed our short stay and would highly recommend it to anyone wanting a central London stay",5,2018,05,14
144,London Marathon Weekend.,"My wife and I stayed for two nights of the London Marathon weekend. The Hotel's facilities are excellent with spacious rooms and excellent service. We dined in the Restaurant with Shaun Rankin's menu's. The cuisine was exquisite, but not only that. My wife has some very specific dietary requirements. The staff went out of their way to adjust her dinner to accommodate those needs while still maintaining the basic promise of the dish. Brilliant. Finally, throughout our stay, the staff were exceptionally helpful, very welcoming, and nothing was too difficult for them. Overall, a thoroughly enjoyable experience. Richard and Hilary Barnes.",5,2018,05,08
144,Always the best place to stay in London,"When you are travelling away on business it is always nice to have a place to stay that is welcoming and where nothing feels like it is too much bother. Flemings is that place. And to top it off, the food is fabulous and the rooms are clean...what more could you want?",5,2018,05,08
144,Lovely hotel - Beware of room by elevator!!,"Great location and lovely hotel. Staff is fantastic and friendly. Ormer restaurant is fabulous. Make sure you ask for a room as far away from the elevator as possible. Ours was right next to it, room 300, and it was miserable. I'm surprised they can even sell this as a room. We booked the Executive King, one category below the Junior Suite so it's not like we booked the lead in/lowest room category. I asked for ear plugs the first night but the second night I couldn't wear them because we had an early flight and needed to hear my alarm. when I called down for ear plugs I was very clear why I needed them. To be fair, we did not ask to change rooms. If we had, I'm sure they would have been accommodating. Unfortunately, we got back to the hotel after being out all day late in the evening and our belonging were already settled in the room. Being that we were only staying 2-nights and we were more than halfway through our stay, we didn't want to repack and relocate. When all is said and done I would stay there again, I'd just make sure I was in a room as far from the elevator as possible. ",4,2018,05,07
144,Short holiday,"We enjoyed the stay for our short holiday in town in one of the spacious and comfortable studios. It's a nice place to go, you will to be spoiled by friendly and careful personnel. The hotel is in proximity of parks, but very close to a lot of town attractions, near tube station or at just a walk distance.",5,2018,05,07
144,Astounding Venue,"The room was fantastic. The charming decor was really appealing to my wife. I like the sharp use of the space, comfort, and roominess. 
One of my favorite venues now. I called concierge and room service a few times - and each time service was friendly, and so accommodating, fast. 
The dining was great..the breakfast menu was astounding.
The accommodations, room service, room bar...everything was first rate.
I plan to stay again in the coming months and have already recommended this place to a few friends who will be visiting London soon. 
I’ve stayed at places, both clubs and hotel venues, that’ll go unnamed at nearly 2x the rate, and like this place exponentially better.",5,2018,05,07
144,Luxury stay in London,"Perfect location for first time visitors, everything is so close by. Wonderful staff, exceptional food, great cocktails :)
Everyone was so friendly and helpful, Flemings Mayfair would be our first choice when returning to London",5,2018,05,04
144,Small Discreat Hotel,"Flemings is a small discreat hotel, but top notch. The fact that it is a small with narrow corridors hotel, with a town house which does not connect directly with the main hotel, still  makes it an intimate place to stay.  The hotel staff are charming and efficient.  The bar and restaurant is definitely not to be missed.  Our room was gorgeous and we thoroughly appreciate the upgrade.  Will definitely rebook on my next trip to London.",5,2018,05,02
144,Flemings Mayfair April2018 trip,"Stayed for 13 days in April 2018, in this boutique luxury hotel. Very comfortable and convenient for the business traveller. Well appointed, quiet rooms, friendly staff, good reliable wifi and an unbeatable, safe and very well connected central London location.  Highly recommend.",5,2018,05,01
144,"Wonderful , elegant stay in London.","Really elegant nice hotel in the best area of London. Nice and professional staff , kind and efficient..
The room was more than expective , nice forniture , bathrooms , beds ... everything perfect .
It was very clean , deep clean ( I saw the method from cleasing people ).
",5,2018,05,01
144,Wonderful hotel in the centre of London,"This hotel is wonderful: my double room was always clean and comfortable, as well as the towels, the slippers and the bathrobe. Every evening I found a new bottle of water and a glass on my bedside table. Breakfast was good too, even if the brioches didn’t seem always fresh. The staff was really kind and friendly. I recommend this hotel also for its position. ",4,2018,05,01
144,DEFINATELY NOT DELUXE,Stayed here for two nights.   Very surprised they can claim our room on 4th floor was luxury - absolutely not.   The bar lounge areas were lovely and I'm sure they do have nicer rooms than ours which was a dated bathroom - very small room which was in no way luxurious.   The main thing this hotel has in its favour was the restaurant Ormer by Shaun Ranklin - which is first rate.   The staff were all pleasant and friendly although we waited ages for our tea and coffee at breakfast - in fact we had eaten before we got it.  We were told there was a queue for teas and coffees at breakfast - this should be addressed as slow again second morning too.   We are not sure whether because we booked Secret Escapes deal we were given one of the old rooms??      Not awful but for the price you most certainly can get more deluxe than this.     Best reccomendation - go to the restaurant - it is fabulous food but stay somewhere else if you are expecting something wow.,3,2018,04,30
144,Not a real deluxe room,"First, staff was helpful and friendly. Hotel is well located near Green park, subway station and Buckingham Palace. Breakfast was really good and wifi also. 
I paid more to have a Deluxe room but our room (#60) was directly on the street on the ground floor. Was really noisy, i was really tired after 3 nights because i have not slept well. Just down our window was the staff staircase.",3,2018,04,29
144,Business visit,The hotel is in a perfect location. Started the day with a walk in the parks at 5 minutes distance only. Shopping and westminster Area is also at walking distance. Room is very clean and well equipped. Continental Breakfast was rich. ,5,2018,04,29
144,Fantastic hotel,Stayed for a Sat night.  Excellent friendly staff. Comfortable well appointed room (exec double)- good bed and spacious double shower.  Breakfast was great both food and the dining room.  Perfect location very close to green park tube. Really liked that on Sunday breakfast is till noon and check out 2pm.,5,2018,04,29
144,Perfction,We stayed at the Fleming’s Mayfair for three nights in a Deluxe Double and were thouroughly impressed with the entirety of our stay. The location is ideal and the staff very friendly. Our room was spacious and very well decorated and updated. You will not regret your stay here!,5,2018,04,27
144,"Perfect location, great service and clean","The hotel is located perfectly, near the busses, underground, Victoria station, and green park. The staff is great, professional and polite. The hotel is clean, hotel rooms, bar, breakfast area, bar and restaurant. 
",5,2018,04,27
144,Thank you,"To be clean is very important for me. Thank you for this.
I am used to have more detailed long breakfast in London. In Flemings it was incompleted :)
Beside this food was high qualified and delicious.

",3,2018,04,26
144,Very nice hotel!,"A nice hotel in a great position of London. It is in a quite street. 5 minutes to Piccadilly Circus.
Polite hotel team, clean and comfortable room and good breakfast. 
I recommend Flemings Hotel Mayfair! ",4,2018,04,24
144,London Marathon 2018,"A real delight to have stayed here for the London Marathon, the staff were extremely helpful and informative about anything we needed to know and a perfect location.
If you want to treat yourself to a small friendly hotel, look no further",5,2018,04,23
144,3 night stay,"Excellent throughout - the staff in general are a credit to you.

The dinner on our first night was wonderful and the waiters are very knowledgeable and the chefs are excellent.. The wine selection was vast and in another world I would have tasted more than just the one bottle.",5,2018,04,23
144,My favourite London hotel.,"The reviewing process doesn’t allow for it - you have to put family or friends whereas I was with both. We all love Flemings. 
It was my birthday celebration and we had a lot of fun. The staff always make us feel most welcome. ",5,2018,04,19
144,Very nice hotel,"I suggest this hotel. It is a clean and nice hotel. I had a vey nice experience when staying in this hotel. I would only suggest to include a light breakfast into the rate for any stay.

Best regards, Andrea",5,2018,04,19
144,luxury hotel in Mayfair,"Great location in Mayfair near Green Park, Hyde Park, Regent Street, Buckingham Palace, Westminster, Piccadilly, etc.  Beautiful interiors and friendly & helpful staff.  Our 1 bedroom suite was clean, quiet, and large, with 2 bathrooms and a kitchen, perfect for our 3 nights there.  This was our fourth stay at the hotel, and we will definitely be back.",5,2018,04,18
144,Comfortable choice for Mayfair,Small hotel with several apartment style options. Staff very friendly and helpful. Excellent location. Very good value for Mayfair area. Some rooms are a bit small but in line with the price. Very good breakfast buffet and nice bar area offering limited menu. ,4,2018,04,18
144,Great Stay,"Clean Room, great size for London, staff very helpful and attentive, great breakfast.

Check in very quick, along with check out. Foyer very nice, along with the bar and the restaurant.

Thoroughly recommended!!",5,2018,04,16
144,1st time at this intimate hotel,"This hotel is ideally situated near Green Park. All the facilities were top notch, especially the bar. The place feels luxurious without being mad money. It really is a small luxury hotel. Staff could not be more helpful. We will return.
",5,2018,04,15
144,Lovely stag ,"Great location 2 mins from green park station. Staff are friendly & helpful. I have stayed here many times, this was the first time I’d had a ground floor room which I’m afraid was quite noisy.
The rooms are lovely, but I will make sure to request a high floor in the future.
",4,2018,04,15
144,Fabulous hotel,"We stayed here for 1 night in an executive room. Fabulous hotel; lovely room with a great bathroom, welcoming and friendly staff . Great location. Really nicely decorated. Loved the bar, the cocktails were delicious. Special mention for Donny who was super friendly and helpful.  Would definitely use this hotel again.",5,2018,04,12
144,Great standing but I had a poor sleep,I was disapointed when I discovered the room as I was not expecting a single bed. During the night there was a reccurrent noise every few hours which could be a boiler or the air conditionning. The room was far to warm as well. The hotel is still a great standing overall.,2,2018,04,12
144,"Room too small, hot and loud","Thel room was very small, it was too hot because I could not reduce the heat in the bathroom. And when I open the window of the room (towards the back of the buidling) the air conditioning was way too loud. There are certainly better rooms than the one I had in this otherwise good Hotel.",3,2018,04,12
144,Welcoming stay at beautiful Mayfair hotel,"I rarely stay in a London overnight as I live very close to the centr of town, but as a special treat I booked Flemings. I received a very professional but friendly welcome. The hotel is bijou but beautifully interiored and rooms have all the luxuries you would expect to find in a Mayfair hotel. I really enjoyed it - thank you. ",5,2018,04,08
144,Charming Modern Boutique in heart of Mayfair,"Great value smaller hotel in the middle of Mayfair on a quiet street.  Short walk to Green Park tube stop and other tourist attractions such as Buckingham Palace, Churchill War Rooms, and the shopping of Regent Street.  ",5,2018,04,02
144,"Comfort, good cocktails and great breakfast what more could you want for a London stay!","We chose this hotel as the decor looked good, it was near to the restaurants we were visiting and there were a number of excellent reviews and it did not disappoint. 
The staff are friendly, the beds are comfortable, the continental breakfast and cocktails are delicious, what more could you want for a weekend away.
We stayed as a party of six, with four rooms. The style of rooms varied a little, the ground floor one was slightly larger. There were coffee making machines in each, heated bathroom floors, excellent showers, lit wardrobes and comfy beds.
We spent a little time in the bar which is very comfortable and sophisticated. There is another room for tea and lunch which is exquisitely decorated, where we had coffee before leaving. 
The staff (and there seem to be a lot of them to meet and greet everywhere you go) were friendly. I was celebrating a birthday and there was cake in the room when we arrived plus a candle and cake with breakfast. All fun!
So thank you Flemmings for a wonderful stay, we all enjoyed it. A little bit of luxury in London and we do hope to return.",5,2018,04,02
144,The best find in London,"Whether it's for business or pleasure, Flemings is where you'll want to be.  Brilliantly situated and incredibly warm friendly, you can't ask for a better hotel.  My room was immaculate and comfortable.  Breakfast, included in my rate, was first class.  It was the perfect hotel for my business trip and I would stay for personal vacations as well.",5,2018,03,31
144,Lived up to expectations,"Stayed here on business and was very impressed. Very good service and a wonderfully decorated hotel with interesting room styles and bars/ restaurant . Being near Shepherds market means a great place to stay whilst checking out this lovely part of west London. I was lucky enough to be upgraded and the junior suite I had was truly lovely. Room service was great as well, food hot and well cooked, prices reasonable for this part of town as well. There's a lot of hotel competition  in this area so you have to be good just to be average. Flemings I felt was better than average. A great  place to stay whilst exploring the Mayfair area.",5,2018,03,31
144,50th Birthday Weekend,"We booked a junior suite with a set menu dinner at Ormer in the evening, for my husbands 50th birthday. We had a wonderful evening and a lovely stay at the hotel. There was two small cakes in the room with Happy Birthday on. ",5,2018,03,30
144,Vacation,"It was my first time at the Flemings Mayfair . I liked the Hotel ,specially the location, great, close to Fortnum & Mason, Burlington Arcade and all the shops. Very well connected by bus or underground, if you want to go to the Tate Modern. Rooms are good, bathrooms little small. Breakfast is good although I would've like some more fruit. But I recomend the hotel.",4,2018,03,29
144,A great value hotel in Mayfair for a business traveller,"Excellent staff and service, refurbished rooms, good breakfast next to everything. The single rooms are small but for a good value. The drawing room caff is great, same with ormer restaurant. I strongly recommend it. ",5,2018,03,29
144,"Lovely hotel, kind staff","Everybody was so friendly from arrival to checkout! I was here for a rather stressful and busy work trip and the hotel made everything so much more relaxing. My breakfast every morning was lovely (the continental buffet was part of my room package). The concierge was incredibly generous and patient. Room and the cleaning were wonderful, location great as it allowed me to do a little bit of tourism in between my work activities. Would love to return someday!",5,2018,03,27
144,Very disappointing for the price paid ,"Was really looking forward to staying here. Easily the most expensive hotel I have booked. I got the impression because we had booked through Secret Escapes we were given the worse room in the hotel. It was small, poorly decorated, and the windows opened out onto some kind of extraction fan. The bathroom was dated and the power of the shower was weak. My experience of this hotel is you are paying for the location. Which I’m disappointed to say was the only great thing about this hotel. The rest for average and certainly not worth the money. I wouldn’t return 
I will leave a separate review about the restaurant as this was a completely different experience. If you do stay at this hotel. You must go to the restaurant ",3,2018,03,26
144,Comfortable home from home in an excellent location,"We stay frequently at Flemings and have always found it to be an unfussy, comfortable hotel with excellent service. The hotel is good at responding to specific requests (we always ask for rooms away from the street front) and can often offer an early check-in, which can be particularly useful if, say, arriving late morning for a series of afternoon meetings",5,2018,03,26
144,Pleasant Hotel but I am not sure why it has such great reviews.,"We visited just before Xmas 2018. There were two receptionists checking in guests on our arrival.   We waited for 10 - 15 minutes to be attended to as there was a problem at the desk with one guest. I would expect with a hotel with such great reviews that we would have been offered a seat and maybe a drink in the nearby cafe/bar rather than left standing.....or that the concierge who was standing watching at an empty desk opposite would have been employed to look after us rather than leave us waiting. We booked a superior room which was newly decorated. It was small, a bit grim due to the colour choices and smelt of cooking coming up from the kitchen below through the open window. There was nothing special about the room.

The hotel is pleasantly decorated and has an intimate feel due to the warren of corridors to the rooms and smallish public areas. The basement bar is very attractive and quite opulent with good service. We visited as part of a celebration for my husbands birthday. I had mentioned this on my booking.....it was not aknowledged in any way. I have read that others were sent cake to their room for special occasions....not a big deal but most hotels of decent standing would acknowledge a special occasion in some way.

We had a good nights sleep in a very comfortable bed.  Breakfast is served until mid-day on Sundays, this was very welcome as we had been to an Xmas dinner and dance the night before. The breakfast room is very attractive, Art Deco in style. On booking, our reservation stated that breakfast was included but when we ordered a full English we were advised that there would be an extra charge. I was a little annoyed at this as when I booked I noticed that on some room/price options it stated ‘continental only’. I purposefully selected a room that did not include the ‘continental only’ version of breakfast.  When I mentioned this to the waitress, she had no interest whatsoever so we just paid the extra as we could not be bothered to complain (feeling tired after a late night!). There is a small buffet area.....an ok but not great selection. We waited some time for our breakfast, watching those who arrived after us being served hot food first which was again annoying. When it finally arrived the breakfast was of reasonable quality but nothing special.

All in all, I would visit again if other options were fully booked but I am not really sure quite why there are so many excellent reviews. I would suggest that this is a reasonable four star option with a pleasant intimate feel but we did not observe any of the wonderful service extolled in other reviews. So.....pleasant, relatively central for the West End but nothing special. ",3,2018,03,25
144,A wonderful evening at The Manettas Bar,"I booked an evening out for cocktails & bites for my friends birthday.  What a delightful experience we had.  From the moment of making the reservation to actually turning up on the evening I cannot stress how courteous & efficient the staff are.  This was evident with every member of staff we encountered that evening,  I must admit that I am still to come across an entire team of staff doing their jobs so efficiently & delivering service with a smile.  Special thanks to Dumitru Bocan, who did an excellent job right the way through from making the reservation to actually fixing our cocktails on the day.  The way he delivers his role is highly commendable.

The hotel itself is situated in a great location and the interior is in keeping with a small luxury hotel in Mayfair.  The Manettas Bar was very warm & cosy & yet very plush.  I would definitely recommend this place & would have no hesitation in returning.  All I ask is the staff keep up the good service.  Thank you for making our evening so nice & special.",5,2018,03,24
144,Perfect location and a wonderful find!,Loved our stay at the Flemings Mayfair and highly recommend them for stay if you are visiting London. Its especially great for first time travelers. It is across the park from Buckingham Palace and couple mins from the Green Park underground station. Bus stops are right next door as well. The hotel in itself is luxe and a gorgeous little place. Loved our time there. The first room we were hosted in didn't overlook the street and we wanted a street facing room. The reception was able to switch it around for us in no time. The breakfast is great in the morning. They have some fabulous restaurants in their hotel but we did not get a chance to try anything other than breakfast. ,5,2018,03,23
144,Delightful stay,"Our family of four, which includes 2 teenagers, loved our stay at Flemings Mayfair. The decor was very appealing and all of the amenities were immaculate. We stayed for three nights and we wished we could have stayed a week. The location is fabulous!",5,2018,03,21
144,how disappointing and expensive for what we recieved,"Bbooked this as a treat for myself and my daughter as knew I couldn't take her to less than a first class Mayfair hotel for our girly weekend as she is the sales manager of a high end events management and publicity company in London. I don't get to see her often and wanted to make it special. Room allocated was pokey but adequate. On arrival  reception staff were welcoming. Problem was no heating in the room, a window that did not/have ever closed, and it was -6C in London, radiator that hadn't worked for years, no bathrobes, no toiletries, no bath plug, no face towels etc. We had a lovely evening catching up in the bar to escape the cold and were extremely well looked after by the waiting on staff but we returned to a fridge of a room. Next day my daughter took charge when we returned after visiting one of her first class venues in the bank district and insisted they sort the problem out. After a housekeeper looking at the problem and declaring it could not be sorted as there was nobody available, my daughter got on the phone! They immediately offered us another room and she insisted they wait until we return from the theatre and she had checked it out. We returned after our evening out and were upgraded to a suite and the head concierge had made sure the heating was on. Room was nice and warmer than the last one but no bathrobes again so my daughter returned to our old room and retrieved the ones that had miracously appeared once we went out for the day! The new  room was warmer but 1 small vertical radiator that resided in the corner of a large room when the old windows let every draft in, is just not acceptable. The warmest place in this ""suite"" was the bathroom as it had a heated towel rail. I have a heart condition and when we where in this new suite I lived in fluffy socks, cardigan, bathrobe, shawl and my coat. The room was freezing all the time. My daughter was very worried about me as the cold was causing my angina to flare up and my hands and feet were permanently icy cold so I was getting pins and needles, which usually results in a hospital admission. Just for clarity I am not an old lady I just had a cardiac arrest in my 40s so have an ICD fitted.  So rooms here are very cold , heating inadequate due to poor fitting windows and poor placing of radiators to suit the space. Housekeeping poor as issues should be reported and resolved before guests arrive but the young ladies that clean the rooms are amazing. Friendly, thorough and the minute you go down for breakfast they are in and thoroughly clean your room and make sure you have all you need. Breakfast is ok but insist on boiling hot water for your tea. Greg is wonderful and very attentive. Beds comfy and lots of hot water. check they have put milk in the cupboard or like me you will be drinking black tea. Overall just poor attention to detail which is not what you expect of a hotel in Mayfair. Location good. Ditch the continental breakfast as no big shakes and full English is not included in price of stay (hidden in booking site) and swap for eggs Florentine/Benedict... scrummy. Overall I paid a lot for what I thought would be a lovely stay and was VERY let down. I know my daughter will be taking this further with the management. A huge letdown in every aspect",2,2018,03,19
144,Lovely secret gem in Mayfair,"We stayed for 3 nights in an executive king room. The size was huge, the acoustics were great and the decor lovely and modern.
The service was always very good, in the reception and also in the concierge desk.
The breakfast is served downstairs, a bit underground for me, but it was very good too.
Location is absolutely fantastic!
Loved the hotel and definitely would come back.",4,2018,03,19
144,"Brilliant hotel, superb services, nice hotel ",First time stay.  Very impressive. Super polite and professional front desk staff.  Nice and helpful conceige.  Great breakfast and friendly services.  Comfortable room and bed.  A small gym which makes business travel more comfortable.  Highly recommended! ,5,2018,03,18
144,Brilliant Staff,"Great welcome, great staff ... the only thing to take the shine off was the 4 times the fire alarm rang at 2am in the morning for 5 seconds at a time. Took a bit of the shine off what was a great stay",4,2018,03,17
144,Home.,"The art of any hotel anywhere is to try to be all things to all people all of the time. Flemings in Mayfair does this to the very best of its ability. The hotel is amazingly located in the heart of Mayfair within walking distance to the world class shopping of the west end of London and many of the cities top attractions . 

The rooms are luxurious and stylish and with all the required in room amenities. 

Being a hotelier myself I really understand just what it is that makes a hotel special. What  it is that sets this hotel apart from many others that I have stayed in in London are the staff. The team are just the right amount of courteous, professional and accommodating. This of course comes from the GM who is always around making sure the very high standards are always met and they are.

The breakfast was OK with a nice selection of fruits, cereals and cold cuts. Hot breakfast is available as an extra.

The restaurant is an absolute master stroke, quite unassuming it offers some of the finest food and best service you could ever wish for. It surerly is very very close to receiving it’s first Michelin star (which it totally deserves).

Overall a wonderful experience and a place I was happy to call home for a week.

Will come back for sure.

",5,2018,03,17
144,Recent stay,"As always the hotel was excellent. The staff were courteous & very friendly, & the accommodation was of a very high standard plus very comfortable. I am always made to feel very very welcome at Flemings. I would recommend it to anyone.",5,2018,03,16
144,New favorite London hotel,Service was exceptional.  My suite was gorgeous.  Dinner and drinks experience at Ormers was beyond expectations.  Probably my best London hotel experience ever (and I've had a few).  Every member of staff I interacted was very helpful.,5,2018,03,10
144,Met all our requirements and requests,"A lovely warm greeting from the reception staff who despite us appearing before check in time were very accommodating  in all our requests for a quiet room , with non allergenic bedding and numerous other request from us. 
We were delighted to receive a lovely upgrade ( we had booked for one night as we were dining  at a special champagne and caviar  event at the excellent Ormer restaurant located in the hotel.)
All the staff from chambermaids to maintenance to concierge and to the front doormen were charming, helpful and warm in their approach.
A very well run hotel which projects warmth, and efficiency  and competence throughout.",5,2018,03,10
144,Lovely hotel ... but check the location of your room,"At check in, we were told that our room was in the townhouse, a short walk along the street.  This would not have been our preference.  Our room was small, as was the bed.  The bed was hard and uncomfortable, as were the pillows.  Very stylishly decorated though, and with a v nice bathroom.  Staff are friendly and efficient.  Would stay there again but only if we established that our room would be actually in the hotel, a little bigger, with a decent sized comfortable bed!",4,2018,03,10
144,Par excellence ,"Excellent venue for a corporate afternoon tea.  Well Organised.  Very well presented food although I always bribe it should be Cornish Clotted Cream that goes with Scones and not Chantilly
Friendly and knowledgeable team 

Great venue ",5,2018,03,09
144,Great Location with Style ,Really handy for Green Park tube. On site restaurant excellent. Loads of culture within easy walking. An ideal couples hotel with stylish rooms and very friendly staff. Good value too considering the overall experience. ,4,2018,03,04
144,Most delicious afternoon tea,"One of the best afternoon teas I’ve ever had.

The tearoom decor is cozy, yet stylish. Very posh, wait staff are incredible.

The must have are the desserts though. Absolutely to die for!!!! 

Can’t wait to go back.",5,2018,03,04
144,fantastic service,"Sometimes things do not quite to plan and for those of us in service based industries how the problem is solved is what matters.  Flemings culture through their business is entirely customer focused and as such you will never hear the word NO irrespective of what might occur.  The quality of the rooms is exceptional and the cleanliness is very very good.  The staff know that the customers matter and you can see that in their entire approach.  

The bar is amazing and some how going out for dinner now seems to be a mistake.  

Afternoon tea is very good and the staff are very helpful and sociable.

The location is superb with Shepherds Market not more than 2 minutes away.  10 minute walk to Piccadilly Circus, 1 mile to the top end of Conduit Street, 10 minutes walk to New Bond Street.  Its a really good location and escaping London the next day by car is easy.

Car park is literally 2 minutes away.  Value parking is available but seriously its a 2 min drive.  

Thank you to the entire team for helping us have an amazing hotel experience in London.  We have stayed at some of the best hotels in London but I have to say Flemings service tops them all and that makes a huge difference to us.

One tip I would give is to get rid of those little service charges.  The prices are what they are and at hotels of this quality adding service charges on bills is weird.",5,2018,03,04
144,Snowy London 2018,"This is my second stay at Fleming’s Mayfair and it was predictably excellent in all respects. It is my “go to” for business hotels, and a benchmark for other cities as well. I plan to return next month and look forward to the experience. ",5,2018,03,03
144,Fantastic Hotel,My wife and I stayed here for our anniversary and from the moment we arrived were looked after and offered a cup of tea or coffee while we waited to check in. When walking to breakfast the staff directed us to the reastaurantvand referred to our surename which is unusual attention to detail. The Ormer restaurant paid particular attention to some specific dietary requirements of my wife despite us both having the tasting menu. All in all a very good experience with the exception of the in-runny poached eggs for breakfast. ,5,2018,02,27
144,Birthday celebration,"We stayed overnight at the hotel with friends to celebrate a special birthday. Beautiful boutique hotel in a great location. Our room which was located next door to the main building was reached via a quirky old fashioned lift decorated like a library. We kicked the evening off in the bar with a few pre dinner drinks and I have have to say that the ambiance in the bar was lovely. We had dinner in the hotel restaurant called Ormer and the food and service was truly amazing. Basic uninspiring breakfast buffet which was a bit disappointing. The quality of the food was good, but I expected more choice. The staff throughout the hotel were very friendly and helpful. We would definitely stay again. ",5,2018,02,27
144,Mayfair Flemings,"Excellent place to stay. Very good food. I'm especially partial to vintage hotels with character, and the Flemings Mayfair certainly has that in abundance. Location is perfect. All of the staff are very helpful (especially regarding locations of restaurants & London sights) and knowledgeable.",5,2018,02,24
144,Getaway,"I booked this hotel for me and my mum as a 2 night treat along with Dinner at Hestons, afternoon tea at the Ritz and Champagne up the Shard.. So I wasn't bothered about pricing, just wanted somewhere in a good location with some luxury and this ticked all the boxes.
Firstly it's still independently owned which is a rarity in London so that was an attraction point. I also got a a good deal via some work perks I have and I knew I wanted to be in Mayfair so I went ahead and booked one of the higher end rooms. I can't remember the name of it but I think it was an executive King room. 

The room itself was beautiful, as was the hotel itself and all the staff were faultless. We enjoyed quite a few drinks in the hotel bar after coming back from shopping etc and loved the laid back atmosphere and the decor.

The only thing I can say is our room seemed to be next to a generator, not a huge problem as it was winter and we didn't have the windows open but still very audible through them. We don't need dead silence to get off to sleep though so we were okay. It was loud though and in summer if you opened the windows you wouldn't be able to sleep! Another small gripe is the added room service charge. I like to tip the amount I feel and it irritates me when it is already set out for me. I paid it as like I said the stay and staff were fantastic BUT I would have just liked to have done it off my own back. Although I know it is discretionary..

Overall I wouldn't hesitate to book here again. The location is fantastic, stones throw from the Ritz and Green Park tube station as well as plenty of shops, cafes and restaurants. We loved our 3 day luxury mini break and would recommend the hotel to anyone fancying a bit of the same

Also, breakfast was included in our stay and we just opted for the continental which was more than adequate with literally the world's BEST home made granola! My mum even tried to get the recipe out of one of the waitresses, it was so good and everything else on offer was more than enough for the day though you can pay a bit extra for something hot!",5,2018,02,23
144,Worst hotel i have ever stayed,"You have to think twice if you are planning to stay in this hotel. I dont know where to start, my money has been taken from my wallet and the customers director didnt help at all. My stay was only for two days and due to this incidet all my program is ruined. In order to prevent any more issue i put do not disturb sign to my door and specifically told them that i dont want any room service, however when i came back to my room the sign was taken off and room service get into my room.
Worst experience i have ever had and will make sure none of my friends, family or colleague will ever stay at this hotel.",1,2018,02,21
144,Amazing stay at Flemings,"We had an amazing stay at the Flemings Mayfair Hotel. We only stayed for a night but the staff made us feel at home and unique. We stayed in a Deluxe Double room, which was on the 1st floor. We enjoyed Ormer (restaurant) as well : the food is just delicious ! Thank you !!!",5,2018,02,21
144,Always fabulous,"We love coming back to this wonderful property with very comfortable rooms and amazing decor. We usually need two rooms next to each other and they have many different options to acommodate that, so we always have some nice quiet and very private corner hallway etc.
Everything is spotless and beautifully designed. The downstairs bar is the best and the drawing room very charming as well. Every member of the staff makes sure the guests are happy and are enjoying their stay.",5,2018,02,20
144,Perfect location for a London stay,"We stayed for 2 nights at Flemings. The location is absolutely amazing, it was quite, clean and the staff were so friendly and helpful. The cocktails at Manettas bar are some of the best I’ve ever had! ",5,2018,02,19
144,High quality Boutique Hotel,"Stayed at Flemings Mayfair as part of a British Belmond Pullman journey - decided to book afternoon tea as well. Really nice hotel with excellent staff, and sumptuous surroundings. Easy reach of Green Park tube station or St James and Hyde Parks. ",5,2018,02,15
144,A gem of a hotel,A perfect boutique hotel in the heart of the city.  The comfort and friendliness only a small hotel can provide.  The food is amazing.  The staff is most professional and genuinely friendly.  I recommend the hotel to anyone who wants to experience London at its finest.,5,2018,02,15
144,Excellent stay,Highly recommend this hotel!!  Lovely stay for my mums birthday. Had afternoon tea in the drawing room which was great. Stephanie who was the guest service manger was very professional and made us feel very welcome. ,4,2018,02,13
144,Excellence,"We had a reservation for 2 connected rooms, as our kids cannot sleep alone in other separated room. It was no possible to find this configuration at check in, so they gave as an apartment with 2 rooms, a living room, 3 baths, much more than we had originally, and for the same price as booked, great service!!",5,2018,02,12
144,Fabulous hotel,"Great location and superb service.   The room was spacious and clean.  The bar is cozy and breakfast was great.   We will definitely be returning.  Feels personal, much nicer than the obvious larger hotels but definitely the same standard",5,2018,02,12
144,"Flemings, Mayfair","I have been staying at Flemings for two or three years on my frequent trips to London. And as long as I am still travelling to London from my home in Australia, I will continue to stay there. It has a very unusual 'home away from home' feeling - the staff are very friendly, and to me it doesn't feel like I am staying in a hotel. The location is superb, with easy walking access to central London, as well as the parks.",5,2018,02,12
144,Always a great stay!,"Yet another stay at Flemings in Mayfair.  This is a well located, upmarket boutique hotel.  Hip rooms, great breakfast and a nice bar too. I was travelling for business but it is equally suitable for couples on vacation.  I would see it as a first choice for family travel.  Great restaurants nearby and Green Park tube station is close by.",4,2018,02,12
144,"Nice, friendly hotel in great location.","This is a nice boutique hotel in a great neighborhood.  The service was excellent (although I was put off by them adding an automatic service charge to my room at checkout.  After questioning it,  I was told that it is discretionary but that it why we can leave tips in the room).  My first room was large on an upper floor with nice furniture but had a mildew smell coming from the room air conditioner. I was then moved to a lower floor room which was renovated and had clean smelling air.  The room service menu is very limited (basically snacks) and the basic restaurant (drawing room) also had same limited menu.  There are nice options to eat nearby but the hotel should improve the meal options for single travelers who don't want to be forced to eat out.",4,2018,02,10
144,Cliff,"The choice at breakfast was excellent. Everything was cooked to order and was excellent. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff and they were very friendly and efficient.
Look forward to our next visit.
",5,2018,02,10
144,50/50. One room was great the other not so much,"Staff were very helpful and polite. We were complimentary upgraded to a deluxe double, which was nice. However, my friend wasn't upgraded and their room (which I also booked) was below expectation for the cost I paid. The room was small, dated, and the bathroom had areas that were not well maintained. It is a shame as I wanted to book a nice room for each couple and enjoy a stay in Mayfair yet he and his partner would have been more comfortable in a premier inn at half the price. This is the only thing that let your hotel down as everything else was nice. But unfortunately it would deter me from recommending it to anyone. As I would expect the quality of my room to be the minimum standard in your hotel. ",3,2018,02,08
144,"Excellant hotel, great location","Stayed here on business.  Flew in early and staff could not be more helpful as we rushed to get ready for a meeting.  Staff always had a smile and welcoming manner.

Great location for all of the meetings we attended.

The history of the hotel just added to the ambiance.",5,2018,02,08
144,Amazing hotel,"As soon as stepped out of the cab outside the staff couldn't do enough for me. I was treated like an old friend and made to feel very welcome. A quick check in and then taken to the most loviest room with everything I would need. I'm fussy where I stay and was so pleasantly surprised. I held two meetings in their bar area and my clients loved it and again the staff made everything run so smoothly.  I  don't normally bother with breakfast but was up early and I'm so glad I was as was so tasty, I opted for smashed advocado on sour dour with poached eggs.  I go back in a few days and cant wait to try the gym and would more than happily recommend this to anyone looking for a great experience in the heart of Mayfair.",5,2018,02,06
144,Fabulous 2 bedroom apartment over Christmas,"Lovely large and comfortable two bedroom apartment steps away from Piccadilly. So easy access to public transport and all amenities for London.

A grocery service was easily accessed and the very helpful hotel staff assisted.

A recently renovated hotel in the smaller streets of Mayfair. The two bedroom apartment came with a spacious living area, an excellent kitchen (on which I cooked Christmas dinner!) and two lovely complete bathrooms.

The quality of the furniture and apartment was of an exceptional standard. It was very exclusive and quiet.The bedrooms were beautifully appointed and the beds very comfortable. 

I loved staying in this hotel apartment. It was faultless and I was sad to leave.",5,2018,02,06
144,Stay,"A sumptuous hotel, with delightful staff , certainly adds to any special occasion. Well located to many restaurants, sights and the tube. Nice room. Good food. Really enjoyed the healthy breakfast option. ",4,2018,02,05
144,business,"Very enjoyable stay. 
Clean rooms and friendly and welcoming staff.
An overall excellent experience. 
Would definitely recommend!!!
Excellent boutique hotel to be used whether you are travelling on business or pleasure!
",4,2018,02,05
144,Lovely gem in a great location,"We could not fault this hotel. From the greeting at the front door all the staff are friendly and helpful but not overpowering.The room was spacious for London with a nice seating area. beautifully furnished. The bathroom was small but quality fittings and Elemis toiletries. The continental breakfast offered a huge choice including different breads, smoked salmon and fresh fruits.One of the nicest hotels we have stayed in and brilliant central location.",5,2018,02,04
144,Interesting experience,"Good service, nice breakfast, great location but the room I was given left a lot to be desired. I for some reason was give a ground floor disabled room just by reception (room 77) despite not being disabled. The view from this room was a large metal 'wall' inches fro the window. Furniture just looked old. Maybe wrong to judge on a single room but that it what they gave me.",4,2018,02,04
144,Great Hotel.  Great Location.,"A perfect location for central London stays.  A 10 minute stroll from Buckingham Palace, Oxford Street, Soho and right next to the Royal Parks.  The Ritz is just around the corner but in house restaurant Ormer is fabulous so no need to leave!  Great restaurant and bar and fabulously helpful staff.",4,2018,01,29
144,Excellent Experience in London,"Flemings Mayfair is truly a gem  Excellent service, excellent accommodations and excellent location.  We truly enjoyed our stay there and look forward to visiting again.  And to recommending it to friends and colleagues.",5,2018,01,28
144,Nice stay in Mayfair,"Very nice hotel i Mayfair. Clean room and friendly staff. Nice continental buffet breakfast. Close to Green Park station, easy travelling with the Picadelly line directly from Heathrow. We will like to come again.",5,2018,01,28
144,Business,"Small boutique hotel, central with newly refurbished rooms, very clean and quite.
Recommendable for business and for leisure. Fair prices for a hotel of this standard.
I would definitively recommend the hotel.",4,2018,01,26
144,Well located,"Hotel is in a great location walking distance from a lot of popular districts, shopping, all the major department stores and Buckingham Palace. It is well maintained and the staff is very friendly. My room however was tiny. Literally the smallest room I’ve ever stayed in. I am petite and traveling alone so I managed but it would likely be too tight for a couple or someone larger. (The doorways, shower and space around the bed (1-1/2ft) was minimal). You should look into this further if you consider booking. The hotel also isn’t equipped with usb chargers so you’ll have to bring your own. There was also a lot of noise in the morning people talking and door slamming on the 2nd floor not sure if it was patrons or staff. There’s a little square around the corner with a couple of restaurants - shepherds market- that’s quaint and perfect to grab a mea. Otherwise you can walk to soho 15 or so minutes away for more restaurants, bars and pubs. I didn’t try any of the hotels other facilities.",3,2018,01,26
144,Back Home!,"Stylish Hotel. Great location in London for tourism, business and shopping. Great hotel facilities and even better staff and service. I will keep coming back. It is like home in London.I recommend the restaurant as well.",5,2018,01,25
144,A Gem in Mayfair,"We have returned to this hotel for the past four years, and every year it gets better.  The location in London is superb:  walking distance to major attractions, first class restaurants, and shopping.  It is a boutique hotel with excellent staff, comfortable and functional rooms, welcoming restaurants, and a superb ambience.  No long waits for elevators or line ups for checking in or out:  everyone is special at this hotel.  Thank you",5,2018,01,20
144,Good Mayfair Home,"Good small Mayfair Hotel, very friendly and efficient staff, excellent service and food. The room we had was small but well put together, and quiet as far as external noise (no traffic or aircraft) but we did notice the man in next door room on phone to India the next morning - in fairness he appeared to be trying to make himself heard there without the phone! Brilliant breakfast. All in all fantastic value.",5,2018,01,20
144,Pleasant,"We stayed at Flemings after a recommendation, reception looks good, staff very nice - our room clean, but very small. We were in a double on the 4th floor. I am sad to say that we didn't find anything special about this hotel that would make us return when we next stay in London. On the positive side, good location, but very expensive area, bar good and cocktails very nice, breakfast (buffet) was very well stocked with a large choice of foods.",3,2018,01,20
144,"Super hotel in great location, with great staff","As the title says, I look forward to a return visit in the future. Super location for wondering into town, parks, tourist sites etc and a very warm welcome from the team.  Nice little basement gym and comfy bed, perfect. ",4,2018,01,17
144,Christmas At Flemings; Want More Could You Want?,"Many years ago I used to work in Mayfair and I'd often pass Flemings - particularly at Christmas - and vow I'd stay there one day. In December 2017, I eventually managed it (delay not due to cost or opportunity either; I'd just never got around to it previously) and I was not disappointed. I'd had Afternoon Tea in the Lounge back in February but staying in the hotel for a night over Christmas was just magical. Beautifully appointed everywhere, staff friendly and helpful, great bars, rooms, décor and a stunning breakfast delivered to the room on Christmas Eve. Just wish I'd done it before now. Make sure you don't miss out.",5,2018,01,13
144,Great hotel,"Excellent . Great hotel,great location,fantastic staff . Excellent bar ,restaurant and food looked first class. The friendliness and attitude of all the staff made my stay extremely welcoming.
Room first class.",5,2018,01,12
144,Amazing concierge but with flying flees and noisy rooms,"The lovely lobby with the many staff welcoming you as a guest is a nice and warm feeling guesture. However, i did not like my stay here. Just simply because the first room had an amazing working bathroom floor heater but soon as the flying flees (we did not open the window) started to appear it became a nightmare that it actually bit my wife's face twice. We requested an immediate moved, the request was delivered without a shadow of care that they have biting flying flees. The second room looked great, bigger bathroom with 2 sinks but doesnt mean anything because it is ice cold like a freezer as they moved us to a broken floor heater with them knowing that. That was kind of livable until the flying flees starting appearing again in the bathroom annoying us, we know we couldnt do anything except patience until we leave. Nonetheless, if you think these are minor events, wait till you see the results of their thin walled rooms that you actually hear and know the person in the next room when he/she is taking a showing. This is my brutal honesty of why i did not like this hotel and Will not visit again.",2,2018,01,11
144,Amazing Hotel,"This is the second time we stay at this hotel. The best hotel service ever! Everyone so kind and helpful, very clean and food is great. Some of the staff even remembered us upon our arrival. So welcoming, whenever we travel to London we are decently staying at Flemings Mayfair!",5,2018,01,08
144,Very nice - like the design,It is wonderful hotel. Recently renovated and very stylish. The designer did a very good job and you can also see that on all the details. Rooms are very clean and modern with special features. The staff was friendly and the breakfast was very good. Overall a very nice experience.,5,2018,01,08
144,A wonderful hotel,"The room and staff was everything wonderful
I was really grateful 
Thank you for always kindly talking to me though I am not good at English 
I am thankful 
I appreciate received very polite and comfortable service ",5,2018,01,07
144,"Great hotel, perfect location","Beautifully decorated rooms. 
Location is fantastic; central London with Mayfair, Oxford Street and Soho all within walkable distance.
Staff and service excellent. Staff were friendly and knowledgable. Concierge always on hand to help.  ",5,2018,01,07
144,Perfect for short stay and great location.,"Nice atmosphere, staff superb and very dog friendly ! Deluxe room a little cramped, but nice bathroom and being on the ground floor the small patio helped with the sense of space.
Would definitely stay here again.",5,2018,01,05
144,hospitality here is strong.,location is perfect for mayfair. you really dont need to go anywhere that isnt walking distance from flemings. its a boutique hotel. which means you get a fantastic service from checking in to room service to an evening cocktail. its also incredible value considering where it is & how fantastic it is.,5,2018,01,04
144,Lovely hotel situated in a quiet location,"The staff at this hotel were superb. Friendly, professional abd knowledgeable. Very pleasant room and spotlessly clean let down marginally by the urban rooftop industrial inward view. Very comfortable bed to rival my own. Bit of a hike to the room, disabled persons should make it clear they need easy access. But generally a very positive experience.",4,2018,01,04
144,"Fantastic cocktails, fantastic suite, fantastic staff","We stayed here having seen the hotel on our last visit to London and liked the friendly feel it had. The staff are genuinely very happy to be part of your trip and happy to help, guide and generally chat.  We felt it appropriate to have some cheeky cocktails in the seductive feeling bar before our room was ready; managed a cheeky tuna burger whilst we were there,  which was great. The suite, with outdoor space in London is a bonus and the decor is trendy and makes you feel special. I loved the honesty bar and am pleased to say that I was honest . We will return very soon - Thankyou for having us .",5,2018,01,03
144,special London New Year,"customer care and familiarity make the stay in your hotel to remember.
the courtesy with which we were assisted was equal to the availability shown above, especially for those of us who are unfamiliar with the English language.",5,2018,01,03
144,Lovely London Hotel,It is a lovely hotel with a terrific location and exceptional staff.  Everyone is helpful and accommodating.  The dining and bar options are terrific for one person or a small group. I did not care so much for the new bath and hair products.  The beds are comfortable and bedding very nice. ,5,2018,01,02
144,"Great location, fabulous staff!!",I came for New a Years week. The hotel is across the park from Buckingham Palace.  The Green park tube station is a tree block walk and it’s a straight shot to and from Heathrow.  Mayfair is convenient to everything and if you like to walk there are so many things to see from this central location. ,5,2018,01,02
144,Fabulous small hotel!,"Great small hotel located in the Mayfair area near Green Park and St. James Park. Ormer Restaurant in the hotel had great food and service, and there were a number of other restaurants within walking distance. Beautiful, clean rooms, comfortable beds, exceptionally friendly helpful staff. ",5,2018,01,01
144,Perfect small London hotel,"We enjoyed a wonderful Christmas week at this elegant but understated hotel located close to parks, palaces, shopping, museums and countless pubs and restaurants. It was also a good value compared to other hotels in the neighborhood. ",5,2018,01,01
144,Flemings Mayfiar,"Perfectly situated in the Mayfair section of London off Piccadilly, the hotel is a short walk to almost everything. A tube station is close by as well. Superior service with pleasant and helpful staff",5,2018,01,01
144,Luxury at its best,"A very comfortable room, full amenities and a wonderful overall experience. The dinner at Ormer was also a 5 star experience to remember. The location of the hotel was very convenient, in an upmarket neighbourhood and near the tube station.",5,2018,01,01
144,CHRISTMAS BREAK,An amazing hotel . High quality of customer service . Excellent Continental breakfast and the dinner served in Ormer restuarant was excellent. Room was spacious tastefully decorated. Beautiful Elemis products. Very clean room. ,5,2017,12,30
144,Well done,Good experience stay ; friendly staff especially the breakfast restaurant where they make me cup of honey tea bcos they knew I have got sick (sore throat). Well done! Same goes to concierge staff. Keep it up,4,2017,12,27
144,"Conveniently located, small rooms, poorly appointed","I stayed here recently as a recommendation from the conference I was speaking at. The hotel is conveniently located to St. James Square etc. I had a less than satisfactory experience. the staff was polite and friendly and they were the best part of the hotel. The facilities and rooms were less than optimal.
1) The room was ready hours later than was promised. They had overbooked and then could not accommodate in right room
2) I was in a room next to the linen closet initially and then had to change it.
3) The room I eventually stayed in was noisy as at end of the walkway and staircase
4) Rooms had not storage space for suits and garment bags, while the beds etc were good the rest of room was crammed.",2,2017,12,26
144,Short Trip,"This was our third visit, we stay for 3-4 days each December.  Ideally located for shows, cinema and restaurants. We have always had excellent service, the accommodation is very good and the breakfast is excellent.",5,2017,12,24
144,Family stay in the 3 room apartment,An overall really enjoyable and trouble-free stay at this lovely hotel with a great location:  either in walking distance or direct underground connection to all the important sights. We will definitely return there.,4,2017,12,20
144,Never again,"My room was so noisy that, despite being exhausted, I was awake all night long.  There were doors being slammed (some sort of passage) that was pretty loud.

The room temperature was too high and there was no temperature control in the room, so it was either too hot or too cold, after opening the windows.

But the worst was the shower, where the water temperature would fluctuate significantly every 30 seconds, so you either takes a cold shower with 2 second splashes of warm (good temperature water) or you would take a warm shower with splashes of boiling water every 30 seconds. 

",1,2017,12,19
144,Charming hotel in the heart of Mayfair,"Was assigned an apartment style room which was charming, cozy and well appointed. Downside is that there are some stairs to get to the lifts which mean that you may need the help of a porter if you have large or heavy luggage. Location is ideal, in the Mayfair area, near shopping districts and a tube station. Would be happy to stay here again! ",4,2017,12,16
144,Birthday treat,Such a lovely hotel - everything is at an exceptional level at this place. Beautiful decor and Art Deco look. We stayed in an executive double room which had a fab double shower in the en suite. Friendly staff and great full English breakfast. Highly recommended. ,5,2017,12,16
144,Great Discovery,"Dr. Alexander Fleming discovered Penicillin in September 1928.
We discovered his namesake Flemings Hotel last week.
We stayed in a studio Suite in this beautiful hotel and had a wonderful time for the 3 days we were there. Very well appointed room with quality furnishings and a very comfortable bed. a nice sitting area with 2 couches and a separate television. The bathroom was very luxurious with double wash basins....large double walk in shower....mosaic tiled floor and high quality towels and toiletries. The staff were excellent and looked after us very well. We were in London to meet up with friends so did not eat in the restaurant but I would guess the experience would be as good as the rest of the hotel. Location is great....just yards from Piccadilly...we would definitely stay here again. Well done Flemings.",5,2017,12,16
144,Faultless. ,"Our eldest son treated us to a pre-Christmas treat and Flemings. He's dined there a number of times and it has become his favourite restaurant in London. We now understand why. On his recommendation we chose the tasting menu. All dishes were interesting, beautifully prepared and very tasty. All the staff from reception, to servers and sommelier were friendly and courteous, exactly the right side of formal, without being stuffy. A perfect balance. I can't praise this venue highly enough. ",5,2017,12,15
144,Quiet little Mayfair gem,"Read the London Telegraph review, this hotel was well situated for shopping, sightseeing and eating, very quiet street, would stay here again. Staff were friendly and helpful, room was clean and the bed and bedding top notch. ",5,2017,12,14
144,small room,"the room was a bit small so I think that in order to have the same votes I gave to your staff, the room should be wider than the one I had. 
The breakfast was very good and all the staff Always very kind.
Thanks!",4,2017,12,14
144,Excellent stay at hotel,We had an excellent weekend at Flemings hotel. The staff are so welcoming and friendly. We had our dinner at ormer restaurant the night we arrived and the dinning experience was absolutely amazing! I had a lovely birthday celebration with my family will definitely call back again for another occasions. Thank you so much Flemings. ,5,2017,12,13
144,December stay,"We loved the hotel, the interior design and the location. The staff was quite unfriendly and impolite. We coldn't enjoy to maximum our stay at the hotel. We arrived one day later because we were stuck at the airport because of snow storm. Keeping in mind the sircumstances, the hotel didn't offer us any discount and warm welcome, but stressed us even more for outstanding preauthorization payment. ",3,2017,12,13
144,Underwhelmed ,"Nice looking hotel in great location, but that’s the good points. We had a room on the 4th floor that had an overpowering stink of stale water as soon as you opened the door to enter, windows had to be opened to clear the smell. We complained twice, but the response entailed spraying air-freshener which had no impact. The teabags & milk capsules were not replaced by housekeeping, had to chase after a housekeeper for replacements, disappointing for a 4 star hotel. Just be careful when booking a room including breakfast as this is only for a cold buffet(quite limited for a hotel of this supposed standard), hot courses are available at an additional charge. We have stayed in the Hilton across the street a few times which is very similar, but based on this visit the Hilton wins easily.",3,2017,12,11
144,"Location , service and new rooms","Very nice place to stay. My only issue was the size of the room and bathroom . Very very small. You can imagine from the corridor picture. 

Service was good. Breakfast was good too. 

Stayed for 1 night only. ",4,2017,12,11
144,Nice hotel well located,"Overall a nice hotel, well located and nicely decorated. 
Some temperature issues in some rooms (I was there on a business trip and some colleagues complain that their room was either way too hot or much too cold). The staff did not help provide a solution despite assuring me they would. ",4,2017,12,11
144,Very good stay,"overall very nice stay, very friendly staff and the room I had was brilliant. very nicely decorated and nice comfy bed.
perfect location

144,Just amazing!,"Staying at the Flemings was a complete joy. The staff was the friendliest of any hotel I've ever stayed at. The rooms were a great size, much larger than expected and the decor was stunning. The hotel is made of 7 combined townhouses, making it feel cozy and unique. The food, especially breakfast was incredible and the concierge was so helpful. Heated bathroom floors and towel racks were a great bonus perk. Attention to detail was impressive.

The staff were all extraordinarily helpful, with great advice from the concierge on daily plans and excursions. Included English breakfast is delicious with great variety of cooked-to-order and buffet foods to choose from. There is a very relaxing and convivial lounge for evening cocktails. Ormer, the hotel's Jersey-inspired signature restaurant, is a special treat, while a more casual restaurant off the lobby is good for a relaxed lunch or late-night dinner. The rooms are comfortable, clean, and beautifully appointed; renovated recently. Location, across from an entry leading to St James Park, is walkable night and day to theaters near Picadilly Circus and also a number of the major museums, Buckingham Palace, and many other top sites; very easy underground and taxi access as well. A few steps behind the hotel is Shepherd Market, a lovely warren of shops, English pubs and multi-ethnic restaurants. While we were vacationers, we also saw lots of business people who evidently found the hotel well suited to their needs. Highly recommended.",5,2017,11,27

144,"A gem of a hotel - friendly staff, clean and great facilities","I cannot say enough positives about this hotel, I have stayed in many hotels in the location but finally I have one that not only lived up to my high expectations it exceeded them.  From the warm welcome at checkin - and early checkin in (I arrived from an overnight flight from Africa) - the staff all round were the fantastic - to the room, with one of the most compfortable beds I have slept in, to the tastefully decorated room with TV and coffee making facilities.  The hotel fits its niche perfectly - not a big chain that treats you as a number - but a warm friendly hotel - beautifully designed and in excellent condition - no creaky floors!.  Breakfast was excellent - with great choice on the continental.  The big surprise was dinner - I decided to eat at the restaurant - sensational - what ever you do do not miss the apple crumble - to die for!

144,Weekend Overnight Stay,"A very enjoyable stay, the only negative comment I would make is that the room was very hot and there was no way of turning the heating down or opening a window.  Turning the air con down didn't appear to make any difference.  However the quality, service and professionalism received from everybody we came into contact with was excellent.  I would definitely recommend a stay at this hotel.",5,2017,11,14
144,Great location,"Lovely hotel excellent location. Unfortunately we were next to the lift so did not sleep well! We had a few drinks in the bar which was very expensive.

144,Wonderful Small Luxury Hotel,"Second visit to this lovely hotel, but the first in a few years.

It is, quite simply, fabulous. The rooms are small, but beautifully clean and well appointed, the bar and restaurant are wonderful and the whole place has an elegant and chic feel.

But what really makes this hotel is the attentiveness of the staff... all of whom simply can’t do enough for you. 

A really great place from which to explore everything that the West End of London has to offer and I’ll be returning very soon.",5,2017,11,11
144,Wonderful place to stay in London,"Apart from the small - but very clean - rooms, you’ll get a lot more than you’d expect for the price. The location is superb, the breakfast is delicious and served by a very attentive staff.

144,Convenient and comfortable,"We visited London in October and stayed at the Flemings for a week.  First, it is very comfortable.  It is a relatively small hotel so it has a pleasant atmosphere.  The staff was invariably friendly and helpful.  The rooms were a good size and decorated warmly.;

It was a great neighborhood with the Tube close by.  There were many eating places to choose from, some chains but many local pubs and restaurants.  It is in a lovely part of London.  A half  a block away was Green park.  A short walk through Green Park and you arrive on the left side of Buckingham Palace.
My wife has said she will never stay any other place in London..",5,2017,11,08

Would definitely stay there again. ",5,2017,11,07
144,Another Fabulous Stay,"Have stayed at Flemings on several occasions and it never disappoints.  My favourite London hotel by far.  From the service to the breakfast it always exceeds my expectations.  We chose Flemings again on Saturday to celebrate my birthday and spend a fun filled night in London.  

We arrived early to maximise our stay and to our delight the room was ready early.  We always book a deluxe room as they are newly renovated with gorgeous decor and very comfortable.  

Classic rooms are yet to be renovated and are far from the luxury of the deluxe rooms.  Please be aware as we have made this mistake before.  The deluxe rooms however are definitely worth the extra cost and are beautiful. It's the first time we have had a street facing room and we loved having the view.  I was very, very impressed with the new addition of Elemis products in the bathroom, my favourite skin care brand! 

We returned in the afternoon following a wander through Mayfair to find a celebration cake in the room ! A very unexpected, lovely gesture.  The cake was delicious thank you very much Flemings!

The continental breakfast was wonderful as always and the staff were very welcoming and full of Sunday morning cheer.  The extended breakfast time until 12 made for a very relaxed morning.  

Overall a very pleasant stay yet again! Flemings is a beautiful privately owned hotel in a great local with fabulous amenities and service.  Would highly recommend!

144,Value for money,"We have stayed at this property in years prior. On this trip Nov 1-3 we got placed in a tiny room on the 6th floor of a separate building. 3 stairs just to access the elevator. The wall paper and decorations were nice, but not worthy of the price for a room so ere was no where to put your luggage, so you have to climb over it to leave the room. We’ve had better rooms and better pricing in the past at this property, so I guess just be aware. There are lots of other options in the neighborhood.",2,2017,11,05
144,"Best location, best staff!","From the moment you arrive, from the doorman to reception, concierge to valet, you appreciate the friendliness and helpfulness of the staff. They all go out of their way to make sure your stay is comfortable ",5,2017,11,05

144,Lovely hotel,"Excellent service from friendly staff on arrival.
We stayed in room 111 which was clean and well presented. No view is available from the windows.
The tv is set at an angle to the bed which makes watching it from bed awkward.
great coffee machine - once you've worked it out. Nice to have a bedside radio too. Wardrobe good, well lit with large mirrors.
The location is superb too. right on Piccadilly, opposite green park. 
Only issue for us was that housekeeping missed our room when we were out on Sunday. 
",5,2017,10,31
144,simply SUPERB,"This hotel goes far beyond providing accommodations. The staff are knowledgable and extremely friendly. Have drinks in the luxurious yet inviting bar- you will find unique well crafted cocktails. Then make your way to Omer, when your palate will be tantalized. Flemings is the gold standard for hospitality.",5,2017,10,31
144,Outstanding,"3 of my friends also stayed at Flemings last Thursday night. One from Austria, one from Belgium, one from England and me from the US. We meet twice a year in London and will book again for our next re-union in 2018 ! ",5,2017,10,30
144,London Gem!!!,"From the moment we stepped into the lobby of Flemings Mayfair, we knew we had made the right decision.

I would recommend this hotel and look forward to staying again    ",5,2017,10,30
144,Poor and Expensive,"We were put in an annex of the hotel, no info on how to use the elevator. At least had an elevator. The room was tiny and I was told that the others were smaller still. The bed was terrible. I had a crisis of column that almost took me to the hospital, had to spend the last days of the trip under medication. We stayed at 15 different hotels on the trip, this was the worst, considering all aspects.",2,2017,10,29
144,Great location!,"My only complaint about the property is the room size.  However, it is older and quaint, and priced well given the prime location.  The bars are very well appointed and very comfortable.  First rate friendly staff.",4,2017,10,29
144,chic boutique heart of Mayfair,Chic and cool and welcoming design. The Concierge staff are very welcoming so are the bar staff. I feel they are over staffed and too many loiter around the Reception. There was a major incident in the Reception with a disgruntled guest and it was not handled well so it got very unpleasant. It lacks Senior Management. The rooms are comfortable and welcoming and love the décor. No make up mirror in bathroom for ladies.,4,2017,10,27
144,Great hotel in every way!,"Beautiful decor, serviceminded staff, a wide Choice at the breakfast buffet, Central and Nice location are among the Things I really enoyed in this hotel!

144,Bob's Review,"When booking make certain the elevators are working if you are assigned a room on upper floors. Manetta's bar is great for cocktails or light dinner. Hotel location is perfect for walking to theater, Hyde Park, and Trafalgar Square museums and to Green Park tube for getting anywhere else.",5,2017,10,23
144,A shot of British Victorian feeling,"The only thing I disliked, was all the up and down inner stairs from the elevator to the room and the room size, both typical of the old victorian architecture. The room, although small was fully equipped and completely dead silent during the night.",4,2017,10,23
144,Convenient but discreet hotel.,"Well located with very friendly and knowledgeable staff. Ideal for our overnight visit to the theatre near Leicester Square with easy access to other sightseeing venues like Green Park, Picadilly, Regent/Oxford Street.",5,2017,10,22
144,Great old hotel,"This is a wonderful old hotel. The staff are perfectly trained - polite and courteous without being overbearing. The restaurant (Ormer by Shaun Rankin) is superb. The tasting menu was brilliant. I stayed in an annex which involved a short walk along the pavement. Marginally inconvenient in the rain but not a big issue. Lovely room. Opposite Green Park tube so very central. 
Highly recommended. ",5,2017,10,21
144,Lovely stay,"Excellent staff, lovely rooms and nice selection at breakfast. I will definitely recommend to my friends and colleagues and will stay again on my next London trip.

144,Excellent hotel and location,"Great hotel, the staff is wonderful. The Omer restaurant is one of our favourite. Only negative notes are the room sizes and the noise level from passing subway and we could hear the guests in the above room walking about (squeaky floors). ",5,2017,10,21
144,Excellent weekend break,"Chose hotel as it was a short walk to a wedding we were attending and was booked through Secret Escapes, so a bargain.  Very happy with our choice.  Everything was lovely.  Although the room was ""compact"", it was beautifully furnished, and clean.  Bathroom was also compact (fortunately we only used the shower - the bath was quite short), but lots of hot water, lovely fluffy towels and nice toiletries.  Plenty of choice for breakfast (had the continental) with no need to upgrade to cooked.  Apart from it's proximity to the wedding, it's in a good location.  However, by far the best thing about this hotel is the staff - they were all extremely pleasant and helpful.",5,2017,10,20

The business development manager Viktoria was so professional and helpful, all the way from the time we first enquired, to the stay itself, really going above and beyond to ensure our stay was perfect – which it was! 
Picking a hotel can be so tricky sometimes and Flemings Mayfair was exceptional. Seamless and friendly service, wonderful personal touches, a fabulous home away from home. We stayed in one of the apartments which was stunning, but having looked at a few of the other rooms, I can say they are all unique and beautiful.
Location is very central, in the heart of Mayfair with fantastic amenities as well. Strongly recommend.",5,2017,10,19
144,Nice hotel in a great location,"Over the past year, I have been using Flemings Mayfair as one of two hotels in London.  Its location is wonderful.  The rooms are small but well-organized.  The staff is friendly but not always well-trained to handle the front desk or to answer basic questions (e.g. what are the hours for the fitness center).  Unlike many other small hotels in London, it as a fitness center, an excellent restaurant (according to friends) and a top notch bar.   All of the good things make it possible to overlook the problems.",4,2017,10,19

It feels like walking into a Parisian hotel but with a fantastic modern twist. We loved the bar, a haven of style and calm offering the most delicious and original cocktails. We look forward to eating in the restaurant which is sadly closed on Sundays. The bed was very comfortable and there was absolutely no street noise which is amazing for London. We walked from the hotel through Mayfair to Regents Street, Covent Garden, Soho etc which were all no distance at all. We also had to leave early the next day and they very kindly brought the continental breakfast to our room. Terrific boutique hotel, would highly recommend to anyone.",5,2017,10,10

144,Nice hotel - just did not like the too small room,"There was no room upgrade available (status benefit for ""inspired"") and  ended up with the smallest room I ever had in any hotel in London. I liked the dishware at the breakfast - very stylish. And I brought the ""elemis"" products back to my girlfriend. Since they are her favorites she told me to stay in this hotel again :-)  - let's see, guess not in that small room anymore.",4,2017,10,09
144,perfectly pleasant 'leading' small hotel in Mayfair,"perfectly pleasant 'leading' small hotel in Mayfair: very friendly front office, concierge and restaurant staff, smallish but nicely appointed rooms, very convenient location right by Green Park/ Piccadilly",4,2017,10,08
144,Flemings Mayfair,Lovely and charming hotel very centrally located.  Comfortable and quiet. This was my second visit to Flemings and I will most certainly return.  We loved the location and made good use of the well-appointed gym.,5,2017,10,08

144,Disappointed - expected better,"Generally disappointed with the room, bathroom and level of room services.
Good location, friendly staff and could be a great place to stay if the room had the facilities as stated.
More attentive doormen would also improve your first impression.",3,2017,10,08

Main attractions are within walking distance, the food is excellent and the luxurious decoration up to standard.",5,2017,10,08
144,Comfortable well situated hotel,"I almost always stay at the Flemings Mayfair when I am in London for business as it is perfectly situated to go to work, back to the airport and to walk into the center of London to enjoy museums, restaurants and opera and theater. The rooms are not large but are well decorated with quality amenities. The bathrooms are wonderful, this time I had a newly renovated bathroom with a walk in shower and with a rain showerhead. The staff is helpful and the breakfasts wonderful",5,2017,10,07

Breakfast quality is excellent.",5,2017,10,07
144,Disappointed,"Put in annexe with lift and one narrow staircase in event of a fire. Asked to be moved to main hotel which has several exits. Main lift out of order.
Air-conditioning unit smelled slightly mouldy so turned it off and opened window.
Alpharooms.com quote breakfast included (usually hot and cold buffet, not pricey menu or cold). 
Staff helpful.",3,2017,10,07
144,Disappointing for the price paid,"I know its in Mayfair District but other boutique hotels offer more (including room size) for the price paid.  Plus the elevators were not working during my entire three day stay.  Since there apparently was no quick fix, I would have expected some sort of gesture from the hotel for this MAJOR inconvenience from a purported five star hotel, but none was forthcoming.",2,2017,10,07
144,Nice Hotel best location,"nice hotel,  nice style. good location , very cosy bar, unfortunately the elevator did not work, and the rooms had been on the fourth floor. they should tell us before or give us complimentary drinks in the bar. Staff was very helpful and friendly ",4,2017,10,06

144,DON'T BOOK THIS PLACE:,"BOOK THIS PLACE AT YOUR PERIL! 
I booked in April 2017, to stay here in August, with no pre-payment required. Emails from Booking.com (the search engine I booked through) continued to tell me until the day before my date of arrival that the booking was secure; I even had correspondence with the hotel directly, which gave me added confidence that the booking was safe. 
Lo and behold, when we arrived at the hotel (late at night, as a result of flight delays), we were told they had lost our booking, and the hotel was fully booked, so we would have to go elsewhere. We then spent the next 3 hours (until 3am) sitting in the hotel lobby, whilst the hotel staff, together with Booking.com staff (we got through to them on their ""help"" number after a 30 minute ""on hold"" period) looked for an alternative hotel. 
The hotel refused to compensate us at all (other then inviting us to return for a cup of tea and a chat the following day: why would we do that??), when it was clearly their fault. They offered no explanation other than that they had over-booked the hotel. 
Book this hotel at your own peril!",1,2017,10,03
144,Business trip,Last stop while on a business trip. Excellent service! Would highly recommend at the right price. Restaurant for dinner was excellent and the service there was excellent as well. I look forward to my next stay!,5,2017,10,03

144,Almost stuff are very kind and friendly.,Almost stuff are very kind and friendly with smile. It  makes me happy and  comfortable staying. I think smile is the most important for service. The hotel is good location and very convenient anywhere to go.,5,2017,10,03
144,Good value for money for business trip in Mayfair,"I was in London for a business trip. The hotel is nicely located only a short walk from Green Park tube station which means you can easily access it from Heathrow airport with the Piccadilly line.

Rooms are recently renovated and very comfortable, though quite small as in most hotels in London. The breakfast was excellent and the staff was friendly.

Compared to nearby hotels that I've used before Fleming's offers very good value for money.",5,2017,10,03
144,Very nice stay,"Great hotel in a great location and the staff are friendly and helpful.
The bar is nice and serve good cocktails.
Make sure you book your breakfast at time of booking or you find yourself paying a lot of money for an average breakfast.

Overall really good stay and would definitely go again",5,2017,10,01
144,Great hotel in the center of London,a wonderful place to stay while in London either for business or pleasure. A most attentive and friendly staff and a fabulous restaurant and bar.

It's also within walking distance to many of Londons attractions and shopping districts. ,5,2017,09,29
144,Fleming delivers again,"Super-efficient short-notice reservation by phone, were given several options at competitive prices, and our selectioon, the upper level one-bedroom suite provided excellent space and classic style, served as the perfect base camp for our Friday to Monday wedding anniversary stay in London. The staff, sincerely professional, but still with a home-away-from-home feel to it, made sure our stay was the best at all times, from check-in through to check-out, booked dinners, events and taxis. We will be back again, and again. ",5,2017,09,28
144,Staff,The staff at your hotel was amazing. The concierge and doorman were the best. The breakfast staff knew our name everyday and remembered our breakfast our breakfast order. The 3 course lunch was one of the best experiences I have had.,5,2017,09,26

144,A lovely birthday weekend,"We have just rerturned from spending a weekend at the elegant Flemings Mayfair hotel. The occasion was to celebrate a milestone birthday. It was a lovely gesture to receive the extras in our room for the birthday event.
Flemings is a beautiful boutique hotel with welcoming and helpful staff. The decor is stylish and elegant. Our spotlessly clean bedroom had the most comfy bed and pillows.  Wifi is complimentary and excellent. The breakfast buffet was varied and delicious. And the service was superb.
Flemings was in a convenient  location. Great for  shopping or exploring vibrant Piccadilly. We took a leisurely stroll through the Royal  parks to Buckingham Palace and beyond. When we visit London again, Flemings Mayfair will be our no. 1 choice for a lovely hotel.",5,2017,09,26
144,Miss,"I lived Flemings Mayfair for several time, The staff is friendly, the room is quiet and clear, the location is very perfect for shopping, whatever travel to harrods in 20 mins, Mayfair, regent street in a few mins, and also there are some nice restaurants nearby.   ",5,2017,09,26
144,"Flemings Mayfair, simply the best","The location is superb, moments from good restaurants and shops. When arriving the staff make you feel so welcome, its like home from home. The rooms are clean, beautifully decorated and the beds are so comfy. I cannot recommend this hotel enough. Also great if you've got children as they have connecting doors and because of the hotels size you feel very safe.",5,2017,09,26
144,Great friendly place,The staff here are extremely friendly and efficient - from the front office to the Drawing Room to the room cleaning staff.  I would happily stay here again as the location is also excellent.  The range of dining options is also a bonus.,5,2017,09,26
144,Best Place to be in London,"The hotel is excellent. We will recommend to our friends for sure. two special points: 1) negative: room service needs to be 24hs; 2) Positive: Concierge is perfect !!! very solicitous, very professional and deserve a special recommendation.",5,2017,09,25
144,Great Location,The hotel has a great location and the staff was very cheerful and helpful. The room was small but clean and comfortable. The bathroom was small and it was very difficult to get into the shower. I would recommend this hotel to family and friends.,4,2017,09,25
144,Great hotel,"Beautiful hotel tucked into a quiet street. The breakfast and dinner services were the most warm and inviting, but all other service touchpoint felt a bit ""cooler"". The hotel is very quiet and almost feels empty in the lobby and drawing room areas. The room was wonderfully large, clean and well appointed, although we stayed in a suite/apartment, so i have no idea if others are comparable.",4,2017,09,25
144,Gem Boutique Hotel,"I booked this hotel on Hotels.com based on the reviews that were written. We didn't use the restaurant, but the Hotel itself, staff and rooms were excellent. Would definitely come back if in London again.",4,2017,09,25
144,Great stay in London!,Best hotel in town! Great interior. Perfect situated. The rooms are stylish and exquisit. The bar is very comfortable with a great drink and exclusive drink card and it's one step away from Piccadilly! Couldn't ask for more! Looking forward to come back soon...,5,2017,09,25
144,Enjoyable stay!,"Traditional hotel! Staff courteous, friendly and professional! Love the touches like the doorman who can rustle up a cab from thin air and knowledgable concierge! We had a reasonable size room with good facilities. The location just off Piccadilly is excellent! Close to Langans one of our favourite restaurants and an easy walk to Covent Garden with its lovely shops and market plus great places to eat! ",4,2017,09,24
144,Weekday business stay,"During this visit I stayed in room 200. Unfortunately, this is next to the elevator and I found that the noise of the elevator doors (squeaking) and the elevator motor kept me awake for the vast majority of the night.",5,2017,09,24
144,Nice boutique hotel in a great location,"I have stayed at the Flemings for the first time last week and everything was fine. While it is not on a five star level, it certainly is one of the better hotels I have experienced in London. The location in the middle of Mayfair, close to Hyde and Green Park is awesome. The tube is two blocks away and yet it is amazingly quiet, set back from hustling Piccadilly road. The room was rather small and I would have expected nicer furniture for desk and chair. The bed is good and so was the bathroom, which was almost the size of my bedroom. Breakfast was a definite highlight at normal London rates. ",4,2017,09,24
144,Great atmosphere,"A great hotel in central London, elegant and warm.
Extremely gentle staff. Nice breakfast as well.
I stayed two nights and I am planning to be back. 
I suggest this hotel to whom is looking for a cozy atmosphere as well.",5,2017,09,21
144,Excellent Stay – Hand Down,"I booked here based on other Trip Advisor reviews and was not disappointed. The hotel itself is beautiful and feels regal in a contemporary, non-fussy way.

I stayed in a deluxe single room – which, although well appointed, was tiny. The room was gorgeous and comfortable but easily the smallest I’ve ever stayed in. Don’t make the mistake of thinking you can squeeze two in as this is truly a single. Bonus points for the heated bathroom floors and towel racks – a must for those cold London mornings.

The staff was welcoming, helpful and attentive. Our luggage was lost somewhere between Amsterdam and Paris. Upon our arrival, the Concierge offered to locate it with the airline. The gentleman at the front desk even offered to open the kitchen when I called to inquire about food at 3 in the morning. 

The location is great for tourists. Situated just off of Piccadilly, it’s within walking distance to many points of interests: Buckingham Palace, Bond Street, Westminster Abbey and Big Ben.",5,2017,09,20
144,Excellently situated,"Excellent hotel with some of the best staff we have ever encountered.  The team are friendly, attentive and make their gusts feel valued.
Really well situated for tube travel sightseeing around London.",5,2017,09,19
144,Lovely stay in a plush hotel,"Had a very comfortable one night stay in a Classic room. Warm welcome by friendly staff. The hotel is beautifully decorated and has a classy feel. Thanks for the extra treats in the room for my wife's 50th birthday, which was the reason for our stay.",5,2017,09,18
144,View of plumbing,We booked this hotel because of trip advisors reviews . The hotel is convenient to central London . Room's are compact . Bed is firm and pillows so so. But my biggest disappointment was the view or lack of it . Drawing open the curtain revealed the back of the buildings with all of the external pipes and very little natural light . Not impressive for any room in an expensive five star boutique hotel . I will only come back if I had a view out to the street .,3,2017,09,18
144,Another fine stay,Enjoyed another excellent stay at Flemings. Freindly professional and none of the big business feeel of some of the larger hotels in the west end.  Would throiugy recommend to anyone looking for a good central location but that offers genuine warmth and comfort. ,5,2017,09,18
144,Great Hotel Experience,"Great location.  Hotel had all the amenities we want.  Good gym, and the room was very quiet. All around service was excellent.  I cannot think of a negative.  The staff was always very welcoming, and the checkout was easy.",5,2017,09,17
144,Flemings Sept 11,"Excellent hotel.  Great service and comfortable rooms.  Fantastic location.  Can walk to restaurants, tourist attractions, and business appointments in Mayfair.  Don't stay on the first floor overlooking Half Moon Street - can be noisy in the early hours.",5,2017,09,17
144,Our home in London,"My husband has business regularly in London and this is where we always stay. We love the location. We've been coming since before the hotel was renovated. While it was lovely before, it is very posh now, but still cozy and personable.  Room size varies according to the rate, but all are well equipped and luxurious. There is now a Michelin starred restaurant and a lovely little jewel box of a bar with a most accommodating bartender. ",5,2017,09,17
144,Classic understated elegance with genuine attention to detail.,"We had an amazing experience at Flemings, we would definitely stay there again! The level of service, the understated elegance of the hotel, and the attention to every guests wishes make this a place we would return to on each of our visits to London.",5,2017,09,15
144,A lovely hotel in a very convenient location.  We will happily book again next time we visit London.,"Our room was beautifully furnished and very comfortable with plenty of space. A lovely complimentary basket of fruit was delivered on arrival. The bed and pillows were very comfortable. Everything was spotless and there was plenty of storage for our clothes and suitcases. As promised, a car was awaiting our arrival at Heathrow and was also proved to take us to St Pancras Station on departure. All staff were friendly and very helpful.  Flemings is a great place to stay when visiting London.",4,2017,09,14
144,Mini vacation,Overall lovely stay. Rooms clean and cozy. Friendly staff. Check in time could be a little more flexible especially for those flying from overseas or at least have room available at check in time and not have to wait another 30 minutes. ,4,2017,09,14
144,Fabulous Boutique Hotel,"A beautifully refurbished and restored boutique hotel in a great location.
Staff go out of their way to assist and are friendly and attentive without it being too intrusive to your stay.
Food was great overall,  though we didn't dine in the restaurant, only in the bar.
The rooms are spacious and beautifully designed and our bedroom was also larger than expected.
We will definitely return!",5,2017,09,14
144,Mayfair hideaway,A beautiful hotel in the heart of Mayfair - lovely charming and accommodating staff - clean and quiet rooms - Shaun Rankin's Ormer Restaurant is just beautiful in both decor and atmosphere - the food is just exquisite ,5,2017,09,13
144,My stay at Flemings,I have stayed at Flemings on a number of occasions. The rooms and hotel are very elegantly decorated. The staff are wonderful and make you feel very welcome. I would thoroughly recommend that you consider staying there next time you are in London. ,5,2017,09,12
144,Flemings Mayfair,Lovely hotel in Mayfair.  King Room was spacious and very well appointed.  Great beds! Staff was very nice and courteous.  I asked for an late check out and they were very gracious in options that would accommodate me.  ,4,2017,09,11
144,First time at the Flemings Mayfair,"I usually stay in SoHo neighborhood but was booked at this hotel at the last minute.  The hotel is very nice and clean, my room happened to be a nice size but other colleagues were not so lucky.  Staff was friendly and I really have no complaints other than the location was a bit out of the way for my needs.  It was a good hotel for the rate.  Bar/lounge areas could stand to be updated and a bit more modern. ",4,2017,09,11
144,Flemings Hotel - Weekend Break,"Excellent location.
Very warm and relaxing welcome.
The room was very clean and beautifully decorated.
All staff were very friendly and helpful. We unexpectedly needed to bring our 10 month old daughter and the room was fully equipped on arrival with a lovely travel cot and amenities. 
",5,2017,09,11
144,Great hotel with great location,"We stayed at Flemings Mayfair from Thursday through Sunday for a business trip. Exellent service with good, clean rooms. There is an air of tradition in the walls. A plus is breakfast until noon on sunday, as well as check-out until 02.00 PM on sundays. well worth a visit!",5,2017,09,11
144,A charming small hotel in a wonderful neighborhood.,"We loved everything about Flemings. The staff is friendly and efficient, but the real bonus is the spectacular michelin starred restaurant right downstairs. There are two beautiful small bars, one elegant, one tucked away and cosy, for sharing cocktails with friends.",5,2017,09,09
144,So posh!,"My daughter and I can not say enough about Flemings.  The location, the staff, the food, the décor.  Everything was a total treat!!  We can hardly wait to return.  I especially loved the attention to detail in the beautiful towels and bed linens. So luxurious at the end of a full day exploring London.",5,2017,09,08
144,Small Boutique Luxury,"The Flemings Mayfair Hotel is a Small Luxury Hotel brand.  it has been a secret for many years.  The location is perfect and having a quiet side street in London is great for sleeping.  They have recently completed a makeover and it is spectacular.  Please keep in mind it is a small hotel, but it exudes luxury and service at every level.  
Their new restaurant, Ormer Mayfair is one of the newest and best in the Mayfair area.  The food was fabulous.  The bar is quiet and comfy and an ideal spot for some interesting drinks and a delicious charcuterie.  The Concierge staff is very helpful and friendly. . 
I have stayed here several times and I will continue to return.  The Flemings Mayfair is MY favorite place to stay while in London.",5,2017,09,07

144,"Good Location, Lovely Decor and Staff","Originally was given a very small room, presumably as I had booked on a offer, although the hotel wasn't full.  The staff were helpful and quickly offered us a larger room for an additional charge.  Breakfast was included in the price of the stay but this was only Continental.  If you want anything else there is an additional charge of £19.95.  It's a lovely hotel in a good location and the staff are friendly and professional.  Bear in mind their restaurant, Ormer is closed on a Sunday if you plan to stay then.",4,2017,09,05
144,Luxurious little gem!,"The Flemings Mayfair is in a great location, has beautiful rooms and common spaces, and was a super find!

It is five star level quality with the coziness and personalization of a boutique hotel. Superb.",5,2017,09,04
144,A good hotel,"An amazing quality of room, with a non-cooperative staff at times.

Mr.Jack (a concierge staff) was very helpful, whenever needed. 
Drinks and staff at Manetta bar were outstanding.

To conclude, it was a great trip wit friends and a decent stay.",3,2017,09,03
144,FOREVER FLEMING'S,"My second stay at Fleming's, and it was even better then the first time : Room just a little bit bigger, same for the patio, and the cutest thing, an honesty Gin bar...... a shame I don't drink Gin, it was so lovely.

At Fleming's you feel at home, relaxed and oh so welcome !",5,2017,09,02

144,Great location - small rooms,"The hotel is in a great location in Mayfair, and on arrival the reception was friendly and efficient. We had booked a standard double on a room and breakfast basis. The room was very small, even by London standards, but was very quiet with little outside noise. It was disappointing to be charged an extra £10 per person for a cooked breakfast which took 45 minutes to arrive. Also, watch out for the additional service charges that appeared to be added to any cost incurred.",3,2017,08,27
144,Very comfortable,"Stayed here with my mother for 6 days.  It was a fantastic location - close to the Tube (Green Park), but we mostly walked: Buckingham Palace, Hyde Park, Westminster, Churchill War Museum, Knightsbridge, Kensington Palace, etc.
Great breakfast included.
Had a fantastic meal in the restaurant one night: lobster ravioli, followed by duck!!",5,2017,08,26
144,Excellent location and service at Flemings Mayfair,hotel is a bit small but with very good service and friendly staff.

144,My favorite Mayfair,"I have stayed at all of the hotels in the Mayfair area, and the Flemings Mayfair is definitely my favorite. I had the small standard room, but the finishes and amenities were the best I have seen in the area. Everything is designed with comfort in mind in a modern classic flare. On top of the facilities, the staff were always above and beyond helpful, and the door ready umbrellas are perfect for those typical rainy London days. I will stay here whenever traveling to London in the future.",5,2017,08,25
144,Hidden Luxury in Mayfair,"The Flemings Mayfair Hotel is such a great location.  it is to everything and it is a small boutique that exudes luxury throughout.  it has undergone a complete refurbishment and it sparkles like a jewel.

Will definitely be back to stay again next time I am in London,5,2017,08,24
144,AUGUST 2017 STAY,"Service upon check in was satisfactory. My deluxe double room was cozy but very small (maybe because it's a London Hotel) and smelled a bit musty and dump. Hotel location was definitely a plus so I could walk to all my favourite spots in the city. Tea and scones in the Drawing Room were amazing and dinner at the restaurant was beyond fantastic. Downside for me was the white wine in the mini fridge. It did not taste fantastic.
I will definitely stay the hotel again but will probably opt for a suite.",3,2017,08,24
144,very nice hotel,"The hotel ist very nice. Best location for visiting places of interest. The staff is very friendly and helpful.
The rooms are comfortable and beautifully furnished. The breakfast is simple but very good. ",5,2017,08,24

144,Exclusive boutique hotel in the central location,"Amazing hotel with stylish decor and friendly staff. The site is just at green park, accessible to Bond street and Piccadilly. The decor is very luxurious. The hotel is located in the quiet street in spite of central location. Would definetely stay there again.
",5,2017,08,21
144,Perfect hotel for a weekend break!,"The hotel is beautifully decorated and our room had a lovely, luxurious feel to it (although the main light shade was a bit big for the size of the room!). The size was great for a weekend getaway in central London with a lovely bathroom and big shower. The Nespresso coffee machine was a real bonus! All staff were incredibly welcoming and attentive without being over-bearing. Our evening meal at the Ormer Mayfair restaurant was a particular highlight, I would recommend dining here to anyone staying at the hotel. The food and service were both exceptional. The hotel is in a brilliant location across the road from Green Park and only a couple of minutes walk to the tube station. We will definitely look to stay here again on our next trip to London.",5,2017,08,21
144,Beautifully laid out hotel..,"We only stayed one night but it was a delight!

The hotel is well located near Green Park tube and its various busses. It is placed over several buildings which meant there are a few steps along the coridoors and even in our room there was a step down to the ensuite (which was well appointed - see pic)! The 'rainfall' stule shower was just right and more than sufficient towels were laid out.

The tv had a few options, the music selection was a nice surprise.. Except you had to 'play' every song (that could be our lack of tech know-how) which became a little tedious.

The room came with out an iron, but a quick call to Housekeeping sorted that out.

It had a safe, an umbrella to use during our stay, comfy 'his n her' slippers plus the usual shoe shine and sewing kits.

The only point of note that could have been better was to have been advised of the 'discretionary' service tip on arrival rather than at check out. It would have made me more mindful of how I tipped if it was covered at the end of our stay. On this note, the service was good, particularly the welcome we received from Greg at breakfast. Oh and the salmon with the dill sauce is a must.. It certainly complemented yhe freshly squeezed orange juice! 

Overall a lovely stay and something I would be happy to repeat should the occassion arise!

144,"Excellent Location, Wonderful Hotel","The Flemings Hotel in Mayfair is located in the heart of London, just a couple blocks from the Green Park station for the Underground.  This made it an ideal location for our vacation (easy access to anywhere in the city). Despite this super-urban location, the hotel was very quiet, and located a block from a very nice area of restaurants and shops.  So it felt secluded while being adjacent to the comings and goings of Westminster and Piccadilly.",5,2017,08,20
144,Very quiet place,Overall it was a good experience the location is perfect for me and my family for sure I will come back and recommend it to my friends and also the internet connection was very fast And the atmosphere was very quiet ,4,2017,08,20
144,Great Location,We stayed for 7 days in a suite and 2 bedroom apartment. It was great however the size of the apartment was small however it fulfilled our needs... I recommend this hotel. Excellent Location and staff,4,2017,08,19
144,Excellent location......service questionable,"Stayed one night on business. Hotel based on old world charm, rooms on the small side but equipped with Flat screen tv, tea/coffee making facilities, shower and bath combination, air con plus a.comcortable bed.
Thd downside is no ironing board or iron for which, having asked twice, I still had to wait 40 minutes,  which in turn made me late for an evening appointment, this level.of  service at this price range is simply not acceptable.
On the plus side the hotel is excellently placed to visit all the main attractions that London has to offer, also the hotel restaurant ""Ormer"" is exceptional. Reception and bar staff friendly and helpful.

144,Final comments of our stays at Flemings Mayfair in London England,"Perfect, stunning boutique hotel. Staff are warm and friendly and most efficient. Most accommodating 
 High tea is lovely, and generally food is delicious and well prepared. We have no further tips. Ar guidelines as everything was perfect.",5,2017,08,17
144,Delicious afternoon tea,Courtney took care of us from when we sat down to when we left!  He explained what we were having and the selection of teas.  He even included another petit four when we told him that we were celebrating our 25th wedding anniversary - tas well as taking pictures for us! Definitely come again as it was yummy and with Groupon good value for money!,5,2017,08,16
144,Best hotel in Mayfair,A Wonderful hotel in Mayfair with an amazing location and wonderful staff. With the addition of the new restaurant and bar last year this hotel must be one of the best hotels in Mayfair especially for quality and value. We always aim to stay at Flemings when in London.,5,2017,08,16
144,Great Experience,"Enjoyed our stay.  Excellent location for Picadilley and Buckingham Palace.  Service was great, breakfast had a large selection, including gluten free.  Room was quiet, clean, and everything worked as it should.  ",5,2017,08,16
144,Great Place!!,I enjoyed staying at this hotel because it gives great service. It is walking distance to great attractions in this gorgeous place. The rooms offer great comfortable beds and restrooms even have heated floors. ,5,2017,08,16
144,A fabulous place!,"I would recommend this hotel to everyone. It offers exquisite comfort and quality with wonderful, helpful staff. The decor is beautiful, the rooms are delightful and the service impeccable. The two bedroom apartment is just perfect for a family gathering with its own outside area and bar facilities. It felt like home from home as it was so spacious and delightful. Thank you to everyone who made us so welcome. ",5,2017,08,16
144,LUX STAY,"The decoration of the hotel, also the bar, rooms are very successful and the spaces are handy. The whole staff is warm-blooded. They know their business well, they are friendly and very helpful. We were a crowded group.  Mrs.Adile was very interested in us and helped. Her Communication and coordinated work with the team are not out of sight. The location of the hotel is very central and the local shops and bars and restaurants in the back streets are very useful for social life.
The bar is quite satisfying as is the presentation and variety. However, it is very important that a living environment is formed and protected. If this approach to business management continues, your otel  will take an important place in  London luks boutique hotel market.
",5,2017,08,15
144,Life at Flemings,"Great hotel with a superb location. The rooms are very small even by London standards. There could be better promotion of the hotel facilities. I wanted a hotel with a business centre which they advertised as having, but it did not exist. Beds were very comfortable and the bathrooms are very modern and clean.",4,2017,08,14
144,First class service,Staff in all departments were very friendly and keen to help. We were upgraded which was a pleasant surprise and would have scored 5s across the board but the air conditioning unit was pumping out a strange smell in the room. Lovely breakfast with a decent buffet offering and pleasingly a gluten free selection. ,5,2017,08,14
144,Great location & friendly staff,"Perfectly placed to explore Mayfair , nice welcome and clean room .
Remember you`ll be paying Mayfair prices so expect hidden extras like breakfast & top whack drinks.
Our tv kept freezing every 10 mins so that was annoying.
And breakfast took 35 mins from ordering to receiving it - even though we`d paid extra for a hot breakfast",3,2017,08,14
144,Fantastic and very special Hotel,"Flemings Hotel is very special. The staff and quality of the bedrooms are exceptional. Its location could not be better for sightseeing and shopping. I would not stay anywhere else now in London, give it a try and treat yourself!",5,2017,08,14
144,Exceptional,"A beautiful hotel in Mayfair near to all amenities.  The staff were very welcoming and friendly.  The bedrooms clean, modern and comfortable.  The food at Ormer Mayfair was wonderful.  Flemings is everything a four star hotel should be.",5,2017,08,14
144,first time and probably last,"We stayed the last week of July my son and I. When I made the reservation I  had asked for two beds, but they gave us a room with one bed, that means that they do not take into consideration the client's requirements. They changed us to a small two bed bedroom. The shower leaked because water came out under the shower's door, so that meant the bathroom became all wet. I think this hotel  doesn't deserve 4 1/2 stars
I must say the staff was very friendly",1,2017,08,11
144,Regular visitor,"Use this hotel for corporate vists and hosting clients. Exceptional quality and very courteous staff. Great food, very ambient bar area. Superb breakfast. Attentive staff, great location in the heart of Mayfair.",5,2017,08,10
144,A little gem in Mayfair,"Love this hotel and we will definitely stay with them again. Staff were friendly and attentive; room interior was lovely and posh; bed was really comfortable. We appreciate the personalised touch when the receptionist walked us to our room. The location of the hotel is perfect - short walk to Bond Street, Regent Street and Oxford Street. There are 3 parks near the hotel if you fancy an afternoon walk in the park. ",5,2017,08,10
144,A gem of a hotel,"Stylish boutique hotel on a quiet street off Picadilly near Green Park. The property underwent a tasteful and luxurious renovation recently. From the very cool bar, to the beautiful rooms, this was a great experience all around. We stayed for 4 days, and wish we could have stayed longer.",5,2017,08,09
144,Excellent,"I can really recommend this hotel for service, value and location. My wife and I are looking forward to booking another visit soon.
Its clearly been renovated since our previous visit, the room was to a very high standard and could not be faulted. ",5,2017,08,08
144,Stylish Modern Rooms in Mayfair,"Rooms are modern and stylish, unlike other hotels in the area. Size is good for the area, but not huge.
Bathrooms are new and much cleaner than other Mayfair hotels. Find Shepherd Market, one street over, for lots of  restaurants.",5,2017,08,08
144,"Lovely Hotel, great location","Absolutely fantastic. Visited for birthday celebration, was upgraded upon arrival. The only negative I would say is the late night room service menu is limited and pricey, (soup, finger sandwiches).
Hotel is beautiful, stafff are great and the location is ideal. 
Will be returning soon! ",5,2017,08,08
144,Excellent independent hotel in the heart of London,"Only stayed one night, but really impressed with the whole experience, will definitely use again.
Great location, and lovely quiet room, we were upgraded to a deluxe room which was well appointed . Friendly attentive staff, who helped with local information.
",5,2017,08,08
144,Excellence all round,"It is several years since we last stayed at Flemings and since then the whole hotel has been renovated and what a wonderful job they have done. We loved the new colour schemes in the corridors and rooms. Our room (211) was extremely comfortable and quiet. The bathroom was gorgeous and so luxurious. Breakfast was excellent - lots of choice on the buffet. Special mention must be made of the breakfast room staff. Without exception friendly, courteous and most efficient. In fact all the staff throughout the hotel were very well trained and friendly and it was lovely to see smiling faces everywhere - they all seemed to be enjoying being there. The position of Flemings is superb - so close to Green Park Station, Piccadilly shops, Park Lane, Kensington etc. Despite being in the middle of everywhere it is so quiet and peaceful to return to. Highly recommend!",5,2017,08,07
144,Fabulous Flemings,"From the moment we arrived to the time we left we were treated with nothing but courtesy and respect.  We arrived early only to be told not only was our room ready, but we had been given an upgrade.  We were personally shown to our room and was talked through the facilities in the room, explaining about the complimentary things in the room and how to work the air conditioning, etc.  There was a small problem with our room key but this was swiftly rectified so there was no problem.  In the evening we dined in the Ormer restaurant which is in the basement of the hotel.  A fabulous experience was to be had.  We had a drink in the stylish bar and was shown to our table where both mine and my husband's chair was pulled out.  We were offered to have a glass of fizz which I accepted but my husband wanted another glass of the Sancerre he had been drinking, this was not a problem. We made our choices (lobster ravioli for me, crab for my husband) followed by the Cote de bouef to share which was cooked to perfection.  We had some assistance in choosing a red wine with the beef.  Our waiter who was Spanish recommended a fine Rioja and it went perfectly with the meal.  We had no room for dessert but opted to take a glass of the Rioja into the bar.  A few minutes later another waiter came in with a lovely little pastry tart with ""happy anniversary"" written in chocolate (it was our silver wedding anniversary) and some delicious petit fours.  The room itself was very comfortable, never needing to adjust the air conditioning and some Elemis products in the bathroom.  Breakfast the following day was lovely, we opted for the continental, the choice was amazing and the coffee was delicious.  The orange juice very freshly squeezed was very refreshing on the palate.  We would love to go back and experience this again, hopefully not to wait another 25 years to do so!  Thank you to all the staff, you made it a truly memorable visit from start to finish.",5,2017,08,07
144,A FAB STAY,"The best place to stay in Mayfair, great room, fabulous friendly staff and tip top cocktails! Breakfast the following morning was incredible with a fantastic selection to choose from. I would definitely stay here again",5,2017,08,07
144,Show Visit,"What an amazing Hotel and staff, every thing was perfect except for Building work across from our room started at 5am every day and woke us, Front of house should of made us aware of this and maybe offered us a different room, highly recommend this hotel to everyone.

Darron Horne",5,2017,08,07
144,highly recommend,"This hotel is very good in services and location.  It's very near tube station.  There also are many shops around this area.  Hype Park just opposite the hotel.  Very near Regent Street and China Town.  It is in the heart of London.  
",4,2017,08,07
144,Excellent hotel,"I spent 1 week on vacation at the Flemings Mayfair.  The staff were very courteous and helpful. The rooms were luxurious and  clean.  The restaurant at the hotel was excellent, with wonderful presentation and delicious meals. Due to the smaller size of the hotel, the wait staff were able to quickly pick up on preferences for breakfast drinks and meals, so the service was quite personal. The location was very central to stores and historical sites. Absolutely a five star experience.",5,2017,08,06
144,A gem in Mayfair,"Excellent location and a wonderful hotel. Hotel is chic, spotless, and recently refurbished with an accommodating, friendly staff. We were waylaid in London for one night and lucky to get a large room for our family last minute. Close to tube station and the charming Shepherd Market shops and restaurants.",5,2017,08,04
144,Great Mayfair Hotel,"A great hotel with a location to match, not forgetting the quality of the staff who work at the hotel. I would definitely use this hotel on my next trip to London and would have no problem in recommending other visitors to try this luxury hotel out. ",5,2017,08,03
144,Just ok ....,"Booked through Secret Escapes and had a deal for one night in a classic double with continental breakfast included. Please we didn't pay full price as I would have been really disappointed.

First the positive :
Excellent location - right neat Green Park tube station.

When arrived our room was already ready to check in although it was only 11am and we shouldn't have been able to check in until 2pm.

Hotel and room nicely decorated - what you would expect from a Mayfair Hotel. Our room was well furnished - if somewhat small - but it was by no means luxurious. You are really paying a premium for the location.

Staff were friendly and polite but not overly helpful.

Now the negatives :

On arrival I had to put £25 on my credit card for anything I bought from the hotel during my stay. I didn't put anything on this tab but the money wasn't refunded to my account until 4 days after our stay.

When we removed the throw from the bed in our room, there were what looked like blood stains on the sheet underneath it which was quite off putting.

We could hear quite a lot of noise from adjacent rooms, particularly when we were in the bathroom. Also we were disturbed a few times in the night by other guests coming back along the corridors and closing room doors.

We had the Continental Breakfast which was included in the morning but were also given a menu of additional cooked items that we could pay for. We only found out after eating our breakfast by overhearing a waiter telling other guests that instead of the continental breakfast we could have had one of the other breakfast items for half the price shown on the menu. We would probably have done this if we had been made aware when we arrived in the dining room. That said, the choice of the continental breakfast was good, although toast wasn't offered upfront and I had to request it.

All in all a pleasant enough stay, but because of the above negative points I don't think I would return.",3,2017,08,02
144,Mid week break,"Excellent place to stay from start to finish . The staff were friendly , the room was fabulous & the breakfast was lovely. Would recommend to anybody . The location was hard to beat also , handy for Green park tube and not far from London Euston . ",5,2017,08,02
144,Gorgeous hotel in the heart of London,"My husband and I stayed here at the weekend, the hotel was gorgeous.  Spacious lobby, and rooms were lovely, shower was extremely inviting as was the bed. 
The staff were so friendly and nothing was too much trouble, after our evening out in London we decided to have a late night drink in the hotel bar Manettas, and the waiter was so helpful providing the most wonderful service.  As were the staff on the door, they ran and got us a taxi as it was raining, offered us umbrellas - every little touch was catered for.

We had such a lovely stay, would highly recommend it - and will definitely be staying again.
Thank you",5,2017,07,31
144,Perfect boutique hotel,"Warmest of welcomes from the German male on reception. I arrived extremely early (11am) but a room was available. I received a room upgrade and was introduced to a lovely bellboy who not only took time to show me around the hotel's facilities (this was my first stay) but helped me to me room with luggage and explained all amenities.  

The room 102 was small but perfectly formed. The quality of furniture, fixtures and fittings are beautiful. We had a shower rather than bath and toiletries are Elemis. Good quality bed linen and aircon was great. 

The only things (if i be super picky) I suggest is cleaning outside of bedroom window and the room could benefit from a foldaway luggage rack as you need to sit your cases on the bed as the furniture tops are too nice to use. Wi-Fi signal was weak in the bedroom but still usable. 

A bonus is the lazy Sunday 2pm checkout for all guests and breakfast is served till 12noon. This is something i never had before but a lovely touch. 

The cocktail bar was really nice. I enjoyed a whiskey. The staff were extremely attentive. Watching them create their cocktails was quite impressive.

Breakfast - great continental buffet selection (salmon of exceptional quality) and the staff also gave a polite and professional service.

You can really tell that 15million refurbishment was money spent well. They acheived a balance of period features and modern elegance. The lift was quirky (like a library) stained glass windows on each floor. Fresh flowers in abundance, the little details were everywhere.

Concierge was extremely helpful and accommodating. I needed to find a nail bar (i had broken my extension and needed it fixed) 

The staff in this hotel are really what make it special. They fall over themselves to assist you with whatever you may need. They really take great pride in what they do and the passion shows. 

To sum up.... I am blessed to be able to stay in the best hotels around the world and found my stay faultless and superior to The Savoy. 

I beleive actions speak louder than words; As such I've cancelled my stay at Claridges on 12/13 August and rebooked Flemings, I look forward to returning to this hotel. 

",5,2017,07,30
144,Great hotel except for 1 thing. ,"I stayed in the apartment version.  It was wonderfully decorated and equipped.  There was 1 fatal flaw.   When walking from the bedroom to the main room or vice versa, the doors would slam loudly.   I resorted to leaving shoes in the doors to decrease the noise.  I would definitely stay there again.  The location was excellent.   The Green Park subway was convenient.  

The staff was great.   That includes Francisco.  ",5,2017,07,29
144,Feel Special,"This is an amazing experience and one I will endeavour to do again. From the beginning you are made to feel special and treated as if you are the only guests in the hotel that they have to take care of. As its a smaller hotel you get to meet most of the team and all are very friendly and helpful. I would recommend for couples especially as its a period building there is something romantic about the setting and although interior Is modern it fits in with the buildings period style. I got to use the gym although not large it doesn't need to be. Some of the best equipment I have ever had the privilege of using. 
I recommend the restaurant highly, prices fit in with area but the food surpasses some of the restaurants I have had the luxury of visiting in the past. Great selection, beautifully served and taste sublime.",5,2017,07,28
144,Beautiful,"Our stay at the Flemings Hotel was beautiful. The staff were friendly, kind and helpful. The area was lovely and perfect being in central London close to many attractions. Teh service was great, room was always cleaned to top standards. The breakfast was delicious!! Enjoyed it so much particularly the french bread with maple syrup! Would recommend this hotel to anyone. Thanks for the lovely stay :)",4,2017,07,26
144,FAB!,"FAB location, staff, surroundings, and overall experience.  Can't say enough about this hotel.  
Easy to get to the tube, main attractions of the city, great restaurants, the shops and theater.  The hotel restaurant is sublime and is a gastronomic experience.  The rooms was clean, chic and had all amenities needed (Comfortable bedding, luxe towels, etc.).The entire staff are there to meet your needs, be helpful and do whatever it takes to make your stay memorable.  I have been to other hotels in London but Flemings is top notch.  Plan to stay again.",5,2017,07,26
144,Amazing find!,"Located on a small side street off Piccadilly, it's not immediately obvious, however when you find it, you won't be disappointed.
Luxurious, modern and sumptuous decor is in keeping with the beautiful Georgian buildings which make up the hotel. The rooms are large and stylish and the public areas, bar and restaurant are beautiful and sophisticated.
This is a privately owned hotel and has a boutique feeling about it. The staff provide an impeccable and personal service.
Well worth every one of its five stars. Amazing!",5,2017,07,24
144,Another good stay,"I've stayed at Flemings a few times including last week, once again the service was excellent, very friendly. I like the refurbished basement breakfast dining room, and I recommend this hotel if you want to stay in the Mayfair area.",5,2017,07,23
144,Excellent Service,"I recently finished a lovely stay at the Flemings Mayfair. 

Pros: Attentive, friendly, and knowledgable staff. Delicious breakfast. Ideal location. 

Cons; One lift. Stairs on each floor (not the best if you have mobility issues).

I very much enjoyed my stay and would certainly return.",4,2017,07,22
144,Fantatsic hotel in a great location,"The location is perfect, the rooms are welcoming and decorated with taste and people working there do anything to please you, great staff!
Besides the restaurant of the hotel is excellent.

Rooms are quiet, all modern commodities, room service has an excellent choice as weel.",5,2017,07,21
144,Beautiful hotel in superb location,"Stayed at the amazing Flemings for one night with my wife and son, could not have asked for a better hotel; It is not only modern and luxurious, the service is also exceptional.
We will definitely return.",5,2017,07,20
144,Better than ever,"We just had our first stay at Flemings Mayfair since the renovations completed last year. Already a favorite destination, the new, improved Flemings Mayfair is even more a jewel. The refreshed decor and new restaurant are very impressive. The service, ambiance, and location remain outstanding. Nice modernization touches: power outlets for USA and USB chargers, free Internet",5,2017,07,19
144,Always a warm welcome,"You always receive a warm welcome here. The hotel is lovely staff helpful. Nice bar, restaurant etc. My only concern on this visit was that despite booking a twin room and re-confirming this on arrival, we were there early so checked own to leave our bags. I explained on check in that we needed a twin room, also explained why as I was with my son. The room were allocated did indeed have twin beds, but they were together, no space between us. The bathroom whilst lovely, was just a opaque glass screen, which meant privacy was very limited (you could here every noise). Also we asked the concierge to recommend somewhere in Bishopsgate for breakfast, which he did, however he didn't suggest booking, so when we got there we found we needed a reservation. But the hotel is a great position, and for central London the rooms are quiet. With lots to do close by. I will still recommend and re-visit.",4,2017,07,19
144,Luxury at the heart of London,"Hotel location is just great, position at a quiet area just by Piccadilly stress. 5 minutes across the park for Buckingham palace, few minutes walk to Piccadilly square, Regent street etc.
The hotel is clean and rooms are furniture with all that you need all is with good taste.",5,2017,07,15
144,"Humour, Style and Warmth When Least Expected","I booked Flemings Mayfair for one night. Rather than have my meeting out and about in London, with all the palaver of getting around and - more to the point - getting BACK after an evening out, I decided to book the restaurant.

Yes - it is - by some standards - expensive. However, I was down there working, and I reckon I'm worth it. No one else does, but I do. So there.

Is it worth the money? Absolutely. The most interesting aspect for me was the staff. I had - perhaps foolishly and perhaps with a tad of bias - expected a polite, but aloof - or at best - distanced mien. I arrived far too early for check-in, but I wasn't keen on carting a bag around London on foot, plus i's good to see where you're staying. The receptionist was warm and friendly. She explained the room wasn't yet ready, but she checked me in and took my bag for me. I was also offered a brolly on the way out.

Returning to the hotel, I had the same friendly greeting. I was handed over to a member of staff who showed me to my room - his patter was superb. I should add that the receptionist also was very funny indeed.

The room was well-appointed, spotless and comfy. Lush towels and dressing gowns supplies. No coffee-making facilities I thought, but I'm used to that from various countries where that is not the norm. However - I was wrong: I optimistically/stubbornly decided to search, and lo and behold, behind a door were the facilities. Wot? No shortbread? :-) Coffee, tea, etc - the usual suspects. Nicely - and discreetly - laid out. Perhaps too discreet, but I suspect I missed something obvious; this mob are just too good to drop the ball like that, so I'm blaming me.

Down to the cocktail bar before dinner - the staff know their cocktails!

In fact - the staff I encountered at Flemings Mayfair ALL knew their subjects to a high degree. And ALL had a sense of humour.

Dinner was sublime. Absolutely top drawer dining. I've cheffed; I've eaten most levels of places - this is up there. An inventive, intelligent menu; good produce, well-handled. The wine list is superb, and the recommended wines at the dessert stage are the ones to go for - cracking pairings.

Back to my room, which had been turned down during dinner. The bottle of water by the bed was a nice touch.

All in all, if you're looking for a does-what-it-says-on-the-tin hotel: a base for running around; this might not be for you. It is pricey. But if you want to be looked after; if you want something special...

If you want to spend some money on yourself, your partner, or some random stranger in whom you've taken a philanthropic interest of grand proportions - Flemings Mayfair will not disappoint.

Do it - you're worth it.",5,2017,07,14
144,Quiet luxury near heart of London,"We visited Flemings having received an offer as we'd been severel times previously and whilst we enjoyed it in the past, felt that it had become very pricey. The deal was still expensive but as they've recently been refurbished we were keen to see what had been done so decided to treat ourselves. For a London hotel our room was spacious, and very well equipped although no view from the window. Luxurious bed with lovely sheets, the new carpets are lovely and deep pile, the bathroom was modern and had a large walk-in shower. Good location for exploring London and good access to the Tube Plenty of choice at continental breakfast but coffee pot would be better than just a cup of coffee. There may be cheaper options but for a treat it was worth it.",5,2017,07,11
144,Small things matter,"We stayed here in 2013 and feel little things matter , overall the hotel is perfect, very clean , perfect location , beautiful décor and friendly staff, however just a couple of minor things, the coffee machine if needed had to be taken out of it's purposeful looking cupboard and moved around room , as no plug socket  available, and when we stayed in 2013 the toiletries were all White Company instead of whatever was available now, and little things like this do make a difference, apart from that all perfect.",4,2017,07,09
144,Solid choice & fantastic hotel bar,"Stayed here 2 nights recently and it is a lovely modern hotel. Room good size, king bed, lots of light, plenty of closet space (& hangers), vase of fresh roses, little love seat and good natural light. Bathroom was very nice and modern even if we lacked hot water one night due to a line being cut- out of hotel's control and they gave us a 10% discount for the night.  Very good professional  service.  Location is great for walking to everything.  

The hotel bar is really great!  It is like being in a jewel box, very plush but not overdone w nice lighting, artwork and top notch (if a little pricey) drinks.  But if a good hotel bar is on your must have for your hotel- this is definitely the place.",4,2017,07,09
144,Great location and hotel!,"We stayed at Flemings for a couple of nights. The location is right in the heart of Mayfair. Our room a deluxe double, was compact. Everything was very clean and the bathroom had a lovely rain shower. The only down side was the enclosure leaked making the floor wet and the bath mat soggy. Continental breakfast was included in our rate. The selection was excellent with ample coffee, juice and food. The staff serving breakfast were very professional and helpful. We would go back. I just wish SLH would offer members the same rates as the 'membership' discount websites- and SLH won't match these prices either.",5,2017,07,01
144,"Brilliantly located, equipped, finished and appointed hotel in Mayfair's best area. And at reasonable prices!","This hotel is a great find and very reasonably priced for its location. The service was also excellent, by young people perhaps with less experience but very nice, totally natural, and very willing. The rooms are as well appointed and equipped as any hotel we have stayed in, including five stars. The dining Is excellent and the hotel in general very well built and nicely furnished and fitted.  With a four star hotel of this category, who needs five star hotels?  Contragulations to the owner, the management, the staff
And thanks for making our stay so comfortable.",5,2017,06,28
144,Nice Hotel!!,"Location wise it's walking distance to Green Park underground (5 mins walk), also extremely convenient to shopping area like New Bond St (15 mins)

Room is a bit small but it's pretty much London standard, another positive is the bed are extremely cozy

Cost wise it's on high end side but also pretty much London standard 

Will definitely recommend for couple or Business purpose visit ",5,2017,06,24
144,Wonderful Mayfair Hotel,I stayed at the Flemings Mayfair on Half Moon Street over a June weekend. It is a wonderful small hotel in Mayfair just off Green Park and close to all of the shopping. My room was spacious with an excellent bed and bath. It even had a small private patio. The bar and restaurant were very attractive and the restaurant's food and presentation was world class. The best thing about the hotel is the staff. There seems to be friendly staff everywhere and they are always anxious to help. The concierge was very helpful in securing us a last minute booking at a great restaurant on a Saturday night. I have stayed all over London looking for that hotel where I really felt at home and this is it. It will be my new base of operations when I come to London.,5,2017,06,22
144,Location Location Location ,Very nice hotel. Terrific staff. Well furnished & appointed rooms. Maybe I'm not used to staying in my own town but seems like a lot of money for a very small room; and what's going on with that wardrobe? Space between rail & drawers not big enough to hang a shirt let alone a pair of trousers! But the location is fantastic!,4,2017,06,14
144,Perfect hotel in wonderful neighborhood,Spent 5 nights at Flemings in May and loved it. The room is comfortable and well laid out. The breakfast buffet is huge and varied. The staff is helpful and attentive. I would go back again. Metro is close by as is Green and Hyde Parks and many really good restaurants. I love Mayfair.,5,2017,06,12
144,Everything was perfect! ,"A truly delightful three days. I wanted to stay longer.  This was our first stay at Flemings.  I was over the moon.  The room decor was beautiful (and immaculate).  Service was excellent. The location couldn't be better.  I can't wait for our next visit.  Thank you, Flemings! ",5,2017,06,09
144,Great hotel,"We stayed here in May for Chelsea flower show.it was a good quick checkin and the man who showed us our room was very good,explaining everything in the room.the room was small but lovely,there was plenty of wardrobe space.the staff were fantastic and couldn't do enough for you.the area the hotel is brilliant,loads going on with pubs and restaurants.the hotel bar is lovely with a good atmosphere the bar staff are also fantastic.the only reason I didn't give it five stars was on the last morning a workman was outside our room at 08.30 drilling and hammering in a cupboard.",4,2017,06,07
144,British hospitality at its finest...,"Very comfortable, quiet deluxe room, wonderful bathroom (rain shower & enormous bath) with superior amenities. Every member of staff was just lovely, ladies and gentlemen looking after ladies and gentlemen... 
The included breakfast was not ostentatious but more than adequate and 'the works' were available if required.  Fantastic location both for walking the city, but also for public transport and taxis pass the door...  Treat yourself, you won't be disappointed!",5,2017,05,31
144,Gorgeous little gem of a hotel,"We visited the Chelsea flower show last week and had an overnight stay at Flemmings  with dinner bed and breakfast included , I can honestly say that it is one of the nicest hotels we had stayed in London! It has recently been refurbished but has kept a traditional glamorous feel.the staff were so friendly and helpful but with great personalities. The food was amazing in the Michelin star restaurant , we upgraded our package to the tasting menu , amazing !,,Also great location to walk around London ,we walked to Chelsea, Buckingham palace, through Hyde park to Harrods, all with great directions from the concierge thank you . ah also forgot to mention gorgeous cocktails !",5,2017,05,30
144,Charming with great location ,Loved this modern and well appointed boutique hotel. Stayed here on my honeymoon and was very happy with the location. It was centrally located and the staff was excellent. The hotel had all the right touches and we felt very pampered during our stay.,5,2017,05,26
144,TRULY AMAZING BOUTIQUE HOTEL - STAFF WAS THE BEST!,"I will start with what I loved most about this lovely boutique hotel....the staff.  Where did they find all of these amazing people?  Service and care were far above anything I have seen in many years.  After years in the hospitality industry as a Director of Sales and Catering I am a little picky.  The Flemings Mayfair staff were not only properly trained, they were smart and genuine.  Thank you Stephanie (desk), Andrew (concierge), Gilberto (guest services) and the young man from Turks and Caicos whose name slips my mind right not.  Every request was met promptly and with kindness.  

The hotel itself is simply lovely and in a wonderful area.  It is a series of connected townhouses that make for a great boutique hotel that is very nicely appointed.  Our room was large by European standards (Room 311) but not all of them are this big.  But don't stay in your room.  Go to the dining room for a full English Breakfast (or the lighter buffet) then head out to see the city. Then have Andrew book a tour for you.  Also want to note that the hotel is very quiet, no traffic or city noise.  Great for sleeping. 

Not knowing the city we just took a chance.  We could not have been happier.  Located close to Green Park and the tube station as well as the Hop On and Hop Off buses.  Easy walk to Buckingham Palace.....Mayfair neighborhood is easy to navigate, safe and lovely for an evening stroll.  Be sure to visit Shepard's Market after work for a great experience.

The Fleming Mayfair also decorated for the Flower Show.  It was delightful!

Overall rating for this hotel is 5 stars.  Well worth the money.",5,2017,05,26
144,Nice location !,"This boutique hotel is very well located in Half Moon Street (Mayfair), few meters away from green park and from Picadilly, it as certainly a first class location. You will also find many restaurants, shopes and bars nearby.The hotel was recently refurbish, very stylish and chic, with a beautifull furnished public area. Staff is very friendly and helpfull. Rooms are very clean, the cleaning team is doing a brilliant job to keep your room clean, a big thank you to them. But there have been some disapointement also. Rooms (standard) are way to small, it's difficult to move inside the room. The temperature in the room was way to high ( do not chose a room on the 4th floor). Soundproofing of the rooms was also bad, i could ear people walking, talking and the television of my neighbours. Last but not least there are no really courtains the room so as soon the sun shine you have the light comming in. Then i asked for an adaptator and i never got it in my room had to walk around the citiy at 11 PM to buy one. I was also supposed to have a bottle of white wine, that i never got. Overall my stay was pleasant due to the location but i did lack of sleep due to the all above points. To me there are better solutions in London.",3,2017,05,24
144,LOVELY PERIOD BOUTIQUE HOTEL,"I recently booked this for nine friends as a surprise for my sisters 50 th birthday.  Flemings is situated not far from Green Park Tube which is a perfect location.  
  We were not disappointed! 
 From contact prior to arrival,  to checking out the staff were efficient, helpful and  friendly. 
I booked three of the rooms through Secret Escapes but was unable to book a room for three through them so contacted the hotel directly.   During our conversation I told them the reason for our visit and they certainly played their part in making the surprise special for my sister by including two complimentary bottles of  prosecco and a plate of petit fours with a birthday message . 
  A special thank you to Petronela who organised this!   
We stayed in the executive king room which was of top quality and contemporary design, very comfortable and clean with bathroom/walk in shower room.   We chose the  buffett continental breakfast  which was delicious with a wide choice of fresh fruit, croisants, pasteries, cereal, juices etc.  This was beautifully layed out in Ormer Restaurant.   Manetta's Bar was relaxed in atmosphere, with lots of charm, character and period features as has the rest of the hotel. 
( Photos, overview etc on hotel's own website are accurate) 
I look forward to staying at Flemings again!",4,2017,05,18
144,Excellent hotel ,"I booked this hotel for a one night stay as a 70th birthday present for my mum, the location was excellent, 2 mins walk from Green park, where we sat in deckchairs drinking rosé before walking through the park to Buckingham palace.
Every member of staff were very polite and friendly, the room was very comfortable, breakfast was included for us and the cappuccino and almond croissant were perfect.
I would definitely recommend this hotel.",5,2017,05,16
144,Excellent Secret Escape,"We booked an overnight stay for a Sunday evening via Secret Escapes.  We had a great deal for an Executive King room.  

First impressions on arrival were that the staff was extremely organised and efficient.  They were friendly and professional in the way they managed a flood of late-checkout guests with the hopeful early check-in guests.   

Our room wasn't ready on arrival at 1pm so we left our bags at the hotel and had a stroll around the area and off to our lunch venue.  The area is very pretty and the Shepherd Market enclave feels like a film set.  Would like to return there for drinks/dinner at some point.

We received a call at around 3.30 saying our room was ready (noted this was a bit
late as official check in time was 2pm).

When we got to our room, we were pleased.  The room was at pavement level (unusual) but with sufficient privacy provided by sheer blinds.  However, we would not have wanted to raise the bands so it was a tad dark within the room.  

It was a good sized guestroom and absolutely beautifully furnished.  The photos of the executive rooms on the website are accurate.  Classic and modern at the same time, with lovely lighting and light fittings.  Bathroom fitments were Duravit and Grohe - excellent quality.  The one thing that would have been better was a separate walk-in shower, but space clearly did not permit.  The shower was pretty powerful and easy to use.  

People with mobility issues might find it difficult to negotiate quite a wide rim around the bath when stepping out of the shower.

The bed was comfortable and the room quiet overnight.

Check-out gave us the only annoyance.  My husband had a packet of crisps from the mini bar without checking the price.  Mistake.  The cost of the pack was £3.  The ""service charge"" that went with use of the minibar  was  £5.  So the cost of one bag of crisps was an eye-watering £8.  

So from a warm and fuzzy feeling about the place we went to ""Are you kidding?"" when leaving.  What a shame.  Anyway, we should have read the mini bar list more closely, I guess.

A week later and we are remembering the place nice and warmly, and we know we'd go back if we could get a similar deal.  Regular prices are at least double what we paid.",5,2017,05,15
144,Very nice beautique hotel,"This is quite a small hotel at a very good and central location in Mayfair. Though the rooms are quite small, the hotel is proving you with anything you wish: friendly and diligent staff, good food, cleanly rooms and service at its best. 

As per my option, the best hotel in the wider area.",5,2017,05,13
144,Orrner restaurant,Superb meal at this stunning new restaurant. First class service and the food by Shaun Rankin was wonderful. Michelin star to follow soon I suspect. Great atmosphere and a very pleasant bar area. Food from Jersey was excellent.,5,2017,05,12
144,"Not bad, but what is the definition of luxury...?","We spent two nights at this hotel in May 2017 (because we had to be early at several important and early meetings at Pall Mall) and we had a comfortable room, no issues and slept well, but we still give it an 'average' rating because it is less than it pretends. The question we got left with after our stay, is: 'what is the definition of luxury?"". Is it floor heating in the bathroom? Is carpet so thick it feels like a cake walk? Is it a couple of slippers 'for her""? Is it the free drinking water? Is it door posts elaborately carved? Is it 20 people in the lobby scrambling to open the door for you? We came to the conclusion its a bit of everything and there are many hotels that offer it, some in London for less (except the 20 people in the lobby, those are annoying, particulalrly with their obviously feigned interest in you). There is one dominating feature with this hotel however, and that is that it wants to make you feel that the 330 pounds sterling per night are deserved by the owner. So if you are willing to spend those and happy to be harassed by 20 people in the lobby, than Flemings Mayfair is an excellent choice. It's central location is great, there are some nice pubs and restaurants in the area, London is at your feet. And all that in an area where prices are unusually high anyway.",3,2017,05,12
144,Good service. Nice location. Smart interior.,"A nice little hotel slightly hidden off the main roads of London.  

Just used the place for a business meeting - a nice, comfortable lounge area with good coffee served by efficient friendly staff.

Nice foyer; everything seems very efficient and very clean.",4,2017,05,10
144,Lovely gem with fabulous staff in great neighborhood,"We recently stayed at Flemings Mayfair and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Although we normally stay at another hotel, Flemings was a wonderful change for us.  The Mayfair area of London is very  beautiful and safe, and so is Flemings. The staff at Flemings greeted us outside the hotel and stayed with us and chatted with us throughout the check-in process until time to see our room. When we saw our room (we upgraded to a suite 704), we were escorted by Francisco who provided a wonderful tour of our room and the hotel.  The room was very spacious - 2 bedroom, 3 bathroom and kitchenette, plus a sitting room! It is outstanding - very spacious. The hotel staff constantly assisted us throughout our stay too.. There is a workout room with good a new equipment onsite too. I would highly recommend Flemings!",5,2017,05,10
144,Excellent hotel fabulous staff,"From start to finish this hotel was amazing, we stayed here for my friend 50th birthday there were a group of 9 of us they couldn't have made us more welcome , the staff are so friendly and nothing is to much trouble . The bar and cocktails were lovely and the staff at the bar and at breakfast were all amazing too Gregg at breakfast was friendly and professional at he's  job .Thank you for a wonderful stay you made our weekend and we will certainly be back .",5,2017,05,07
144,Very pleasant surprise,"We felt so welcome from the minute we walked up to the front door. We will definitely be staying here in the future and Flemings could well become our default hotel when visiting London. We had a small delay at check in, but we were treated to a lovely coffee while we waited. Nice touch!",5,2017,05,06
144,Perfect in Every Way!!!,"My fiancé and I decided to stay in London before heading on to Cambridge. We could not have chosen a better place to stay. The Flemings Mayfair is tucked away on a quiet street but within walking distance of everything we wanted to see and do. From start to finish, everyone at the Mayfair made us feel welcomed and well looked after. They helped us with directions, recommended and booked a fantastic dinner spot, and helped us find the best option for a creme tea. The room was small, but this is London not Wyoming. If you're looking for a well-appointed hotel, centrally located, and with a staff prepared to go above and beyond....you wont be disappointed at the Flemings Mayfair!",5,2017,05,05
144,Cosy hotel in nice location,"I stayed here with a friend and had upgraded the room so we had an excellent stay.

Staff was friendly and helpful and we really enjoyed our stay.

Everythibg in the room was cosy, well functioning and clean. No noise from the street or from other rooms.

We didnt have the hotel breakfast but there are many other options close by.

Even the bar of the restaurant had a nice athmosphere (not so busy but still nice).

Would happily return. 

I would recomend going to the Burgers & Lobsters restaurant that is located very close to the hotel. ",5,2017,04,30
144,Underwhelmed,"The check in was efficient and courteous. The layout of the hotel is a bit challenging with narrow corridors and steps. The room I had? Close to tiny with a queen bed and just a enough space to walk around it and no view. Not exactly uncommon in London. Small bathroom too match. The room was nice and clean and had the basics. Nowhere near *****, but location is great.",3,2017,04,29
144,FABULOUS FLEMING,"Lovely hotel, with a happy staff, and it shows ! From the moment you walk in they make you feel so very welcome ; Check in is a breeze, roomservice is fast, and the shower is like it should be : Lots of water, lots of power.
If you can, try room 075, it has a cute little patio, gives the opportunity to sleep with the doors open, just like home !",5,2017,04,23
144,Great hotel and staff,"Me and my wife fancied a short weekend away in London, we found this hotel by luck and thank god we did. 

The location is perfect with great access to the underground and walking distance to main shopping areas' sad well.

Room are good quality spacious and  really well looked after.

The breakfast the next morning was amazing 

From start to finish our stay at this hotel was fantastic we return again in September 👍",5,2017,04,20
144,Loved the Lazy Sunday!,"What a find!  Great hotel, recently renovated and, at the time of our stay, operated a Lazy Sunday offer.  Breakfast served until noon with check out at 2pm.  Great location, super helpful staff and a lie-in - what's not to love? 

Almost forgot, lovely drawing room which served great lunches and the best flat white coffee I've ever had.  Definitely returning here when next in London.",5,2017,04,19
144,Would recommend this hotel.,"We booked two executive king rooms through secret escapes and had a lovely surprise when both our rooms were upgraded, one to a studio suite and the other to a one bedroom apartment. The lady on check in was extremely polite and helpful, and showed us personally to our rooms which was a nice touch. We were also given a voucher for 20% off lunch/dinner in the restaurant which we didn't use as we already had reservations elsewhere. The rooms were great. They were very spacious and had everything you could need in a hotel room and more. The bed was comfy and the rainfall shower was lovely. I didn't want to get out of either. The room were quiet with no noise from neighbouring rooms or outside. The hotel is in a good location only 2mins from closest tube station and 5 mins to Buckingham Palace. We had breakfast included in our package and although the breakfast was tasty and a great selection, the service was unorganised. First, the staff couldn't find a table place us, walking us through the restaurant. Once seated, drinks we ordered were forgotten and even when we reminded the waitors, they still didn't come until after several requests. Hot food ordered also took a long time to arrive. They were very apologetic, acknowledging that service was not up to standard as they had been busy. It was a blemish on what was a perfect stay. I would definitely stay again.",4,2017,04,15
144,Great Location ,"Solid 4* boutique hotel in heart of London, located in a quiet street (yes it does have a few) with easy access to main pints of interest. It has been tastefully refurbished and offers a warm welcome.  

Bedroom not the largest but this is London and boutique it was well appointed and the bed was more than comfortable, again must give a shout out to the lovely decor. 

Lovely hotel bar and restaurant food was really tasty, staff very friendly. 

Overall would recommend.",4,2017,04,15
144,Fantastic customer service,"We stayed for one night in an executive room. It was beautiful and the bathroom huge, with a massive bath. The customer service was first rate, from friendly checking-in staff to the concierge showing us where everything was in the room and the restaurant staff being very attentive. The decor is glamorous, a lovely little place in a perfect part of town. ",4,2017,04,09
144,Good Afternoon Tea but no clotted cream,"We enjoyed an afternoon tea at Flemings. The relatively small Drawing Room provided  an intimate ambience. Staff welcoming and efficient. Wide range of teas and well present sandwiches and cakes. Disappointed that the cream was Chantilly cream. I do believe that clotted cream is essential for a quintessential English Afternoon Tea. At full price I would suggest this is over priced at £48 per head even with champagne, but in our case this was mitigated with a 2-4-1 offer",4,2017,04,06
144,Service and Rooms a Little Lacking,"I think we just had a particularly poor experience the day we checked in, but overall I was pretty underwhelmed by this hotel. We were personally escorted to our first room after check in, which seemed like a nice touch, until we realized we had to be escorted because the room was isolated on the first floor behind the bar area! I know this is a boutique hotel, so all the rooms are unique, but it was incredibly noisy and felt like they just squeezed a room into this area when they could have expanded the bar instead. 

When I approached the reception for a change, the woman who had checked me in immediately said she didn't have any other rooms as if she knew exactly what I was going to say. I was a bit put off by that because after I politely made my case that the room was already pretty noisy at 3pm, she reluctantly rechecked her system. Suddenly she found us a much better room but tried to deter me from switching by emphasizing the standing shower. When I went to see the room, it had a fabulous rain shower which we loved! It was a very strange experience and felt like she just didn't really value us as customers - maybe because we were just staying one night.

The other women at the desk who eventually facilitated our change, however, were very helpful and we appreciated the change in room. Though it was smaller, it was much nicer location wise. 

I just felt for the price of the room, it is not great value for money. The bath products weren't great quality and the towels and robes were a little ratty. The hotel location is good, but I felt that the hotel could be a little more polished. When we would come through the front doors, we were often just ignored which seemed unusual. I stayed in many other boutique hotels of a similar caliber in Europe during this vacation, and I just felt this was a bit of a letdown in comparison. Though I love the location, I think I would choose a different Mayfair hotel in my future travels.",3,2017,04,04
144,Subtle & Luxurious,"Staff were all amazing, polite and efficient from the moment we arrived in a taxi.  Room was just wonderful, well equipped, well designed, extremely comfortable bed, superb facilities, clean and all very well designed - Electricity sockets where you need them, bathroom that is superbly equipped and doesn't steam up.  Everything is quality and whole Hotel has a nice ambience.   A wonderful visit, and a Hotel that we would always now come back to if staying over in London.  Well done Flemings",5,2017,04,03
144,"Good location, but facilities ...","Great location, right in Mayfair.
Helpful and friendly staff, smooth check in and out.
Rooms are tiny, not sound proof and could use a refreshing of furniture, etc.
Not easy to work on laptop sitting on a low stool instead of chair, and TV located on an angle with the bed, not comfortable
Bathroom is ok, but shower temperature is unstable
Breakfast is good, fruit variety not so great though
Overal OK hotel for a short  business trip",3,2017,04,03
144,"You book for the location, but you'll return because of the staff","Flemings has the most wonderful location, in the heart of Mayfair, and quite near the underground and within walking distance of the West End.  The hotel truly delivers an exquisite British experience, with all the amenities of a larger establishment but with a lovely boutique sensibility.  While the location is great, the accommodations and dining options are super, the best part of the experience is the incredibly consistent, attentive staff.  Each member of the team truly goes out of their way to make you feel special and at home.  This is my home in London and I commend it to anyone who wants a unique and warm experience.",5,2017,04,02
144,Exceptional late Mother's Day treat ,"Lovely small newly refurbished boutique hotel. Took my mother for a late Mother's Day afternoon tea on a Sunday. We had afternoon tea in the intimate drawing room which was decorated luxuriously yet very comfy and not stuffy at all. The tea was exceptional, especially the cakes which tasted and looked amazing. The staff were very friendly and attentive, great service. I would definitely recommend!  ",5,2017,04,02
144,Wonderful Afternoon Tea,"I've enjoyed a number of afternoon teas in London and elsewhere, but none quite as much as at Flemings.

Served in a small room off the lobby, the tea selection was interesting, the cakes, scones and sandwiches were delicious and the service was outstanding.

Bypass all the famous teas and choose Flemings if you have the chance.  They couldn't provide a tastier or more elegant experience.",5,2017,04,02
144,Wonderful small hotel on quiet street in great location,"Flemings is a small hotel with exceptional staff who go out of their way to be helpful and
friendly.   The food is excellent.   Green Park tube and buses on Piccadilly are right around the corner as is Shepherd's Market with many restaurants.   We have also stayed in their penthouse apartment with two children.   With Sainsbury's supermarket a couple of streets away it is very easy to have breakfast and dinner in and also lunch with a nap afterwards before you go out again.   Playing tourist is tiring!   One of the summers we were there it was extremely hot and the a/c saved us.",5,2017,04,01
144,Afternoon Tea,"This was my first experience of afternoon tea and if I could give more than five stars I would. Tim greeted us warmly right as we entered and was the purest definition of an English gentleman, making our entire time there comfortable. His fellow staff were equally attentive and friendly. The room was beautifully kept and just the right size for comfort.
I had peppermint tea and it was the best I've ever tasted. The food was delicious and we left relaxed and stuffed!
The location of the hotel was a quick jaunt from Buckingham Palace so we slipped in for tea following the changing of the guard. We were able to get a 50% deal, try checking online beforehand to see if it's still available.",5,2017,03,30
144,"Great location, great pleace!","A great location, easy to get everywhere, good experience at check in and check out. The staff is so friendly that any request is easily solved. One of the rooms was recently renovated but the other one was not and it was a  little inconvenient. But everything else was great.",5,2017,03,28
144,Fabulous Hotel - hidden away,"What a fabulous place to stay, in a prime location in our fabulous capital City.   From the warm and friendly welcome, from all staff, to the comfortable and stylish rooms - I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough.",5,2017,03,26
144,Fantastic experience ,"Beautiful rooms, delicious food and impeccable service. From the moment we arrived we were in love with this hotel. There are many things that are amazing about this hotel, but what really stood out was the service. Every member of staff remembered our names and wished my partner a happy birthday. We were made to feel really special and would definitely love to come back for another stay. If you pass up this hotel for another in Mayfair you are a fool. ",5,2017,03,21
144,Sleep deprived,"We booked through Secret Escapes. The room was nicely furnished, clean and comfortable. But the hotel has a large on street electricity generator which makes a constant loud noise. We were on the fourth floor and could hear it all night and day (even with windows closed). I understand it has been there for several months to provide electricity to the hotel. This made it impossible to sleep and we were very tired the next day. Also, our booking included continental breakfast (on the menu at £19.50). We asked for a poached egg instead (on the menu at about £11). We were firmly informed we would have to pay extra for poached egg. This didn't seem to be a very flexible response, although I realise it was a variation to the booking. Once the generator has gone, this would be a very nice hotel in the heart of Mayfair. The concierge were very helpful.",3,2017,03,21
144,"Great location, super friendly staff and very nice breakfast.",The staff was very friendly. The room had enough storage place and the bathroom had perfect lighting. Beds and bedlinen were super comfortable. Breakfast was wonderful and the location couldn't have been better. We had a very pleasent stay and look forward to the next one.,5,2017,03,14
144,Weekend Shopping Trip,"I stayed here during a Christmas shopping trip to London. It's a wonderful location, friendly staff, and very quaint furnishing. Only downside is that the rooms on the ground floor can feel very dark (and noisy if you keep the windows open). I would still highly recommend it for a stay in London.",4,2017,03,13
144,Nice with glitches,"I have been several times to ormer restaurant in Flemings hotel but this was the first time we have stayed at the hotel. I really liked the decor and ambience of the hotel  ,staff were friendly and helpful but I did have an issue with our given room. The windows at front of hotel give no insulation to noise and it was akin to sleeping by a motorway and on top of that a problem with the kitchen ,activates a generator at 7 am right below our room   Considering the price I think you should expect a good nights sleep as the bed was very comfortable but I certainly would ask for a room to rear of hotel",4,2017,03,13
144,Traditional Afternoon Tea,"I always wanted to have a traditional afternoon tea but never found the right occasion despite having lived in London for almost two years. During my latest visit, I decided to finally take time and enjoy the experience. I couldn't have found a better place than the Flemings: Exquisite teas and a great selection of sandwiches and cakes. The service was excellent, the Flemings' drawing room beautiful. While strolling around the streets in Mayfair, it's perfectly located to take a break and enjoy this British tradition. I notified the hotel in advance that I am vegan and they prepared delicious sandwiches for me and a berry plate to enjoy with my tea. I simply couldn't resist trying their scones which are to die for.",5,2017,03,11
144,Shocking,"I stayed February 24 to February 27. On February 25, my phone was stolen out of my hand while I was standing on Wigmore Street by two guys on a motorbike who sped by and grabbed it. I took a cab back to Flemings under the mistaken belief that the concierge at my hotel could help me to call Verizon in order to have my phone shut off. After explaining what had just happened to me, he called the local Verizon store, which was closed, and handed me the phone before walking away. I was on hold for several minutes while the security guard on the other end tried to find their 800 number for me. I finally went up to my room, found the number and called myself from the room. Next evening, a cop showed up in the hotel lobby to take my incident report. This was done in the lobby, in front of the two women on duty at the front desk. At no time did anyone ask me what had happened that warranted my making a police report. At no time did the concierge or any other hotel staff contact me in order to see if I had gotten the problem resolved or whether they could do anything else to assist a female traveling alone who had just been robbed, as reported to the concierge. To top it all off, they charged me 52 pounds for using the phone in my room in order to call the Verizon 800 number to report the theft of my phone. Hotel room and location are fine. Management and staff should be ashamed of themselves. 

Flemings may like to know that I was in England on business, being a tour operator and having been invited by Visit Britain to attend their travel trade conference in Brighton. Not only will I never stay there again, I will never put another client or tour group at their property. 

At the tail end of my trip, I stayed at Duke's Hotel in St. James's Place, where prices were comparable and service was off the charts. Well done, Duke's!",1,2017,03,10
144,perfect stay,"Best location, very near to Green Park tube station, to the Green Park garden, to many restaurants and to Bond Steet, Pccadilly and Regant Street.
Very friendly welcome, we arrived in the morning and our Studio Suite was ready for us after 15 minutes.
Nice tearoom and very nice bar, all of the staff were very friendly and helpful.",5,2017,03,08
144,Afternoon tea,"We enjoyed our afternoon tea in the Drawing Room, the staff were friendly and attentive.
The selection of  cakes and sandwiches was good. We had a  2 for 1 deal so the whole experience was very good value.",4,2017,03,07
144,Excellence at a reasonable price,"Stayed here mid february(2017) . Has all the trappings of quality. The down stairs bar/ restaurant is cosy , well appointed and to be expected the light lunches were delicious. There is a smaller bar to the left of the roadside entrance which was ideal for as a party of 14. Rooms were a tad on the small side but well appointed . Bed very comfortable and bathroom a reasonable size. All in all a pleasant stay",4,2017,03,06
144,Second Visit.,"Our room wasn't quite as big as last time but last time it was immense. This hotel is in a great location, easy to access from Euston. I can walk to great shops and restaurants. 
The staff are delightful and helpful and it is a haven. It has become my ""go to choice"" when in London - im already planning my next stay.",5,2017,03,03
144,Beautiful boutique hotel in the heart of Mayfair ,"We stayed here for only one night but really enjoyed our stay. The room was lovely and had some lovely touches. The highlight for us was the fabulous cocktails we had, expertly served by Mario and the other bar staff, highly recommended! ",5,2017,02,28
144,Tiny beds and great service,"""Standard room"" a bit too small and bed surely too small (ask for the size on booking...). Otherwise just excellent. Freshly renovated, first class location and charming personnel ready to assist you.",4,2017,02,28
144,One of the nicest hotels I've stayed in,"Stayed for one night, booked through booking.com, a good deal with breakfast. The level of service was amazing, nothing too much trouble for the very friendly staff. Room was lovely, upgraded to a deluxe free of charge. Lovely décor and spotlessly clean. Beautifully furnished public areas. Made use of the bar during the evening. Breakfast was delicious with homemade granola and fresh pastries. Wouldn't hesitate to stay here again highly recommended",5,2017,02,28
144,Luxury in Mayfair ,"The moment you come in you feel as if everything is done for your comfort. Rooms are nicely decorated ; bathrooms with rough marble are very chic. I had lunch in the restaurant and it was almost gastronomic. One slight bemol for the breakfast buffet : fruits are only passable, viennoiseries are just ok and the overall choice is not very exciting.",5,2017,02,27
144,Great Stay,The hotel is charming beautifully decorated. The staff friendly and helpful.  We stayed in the 2 bedroom apartment and it was perfect for 2 kids and 2 adults.  The location of this hotel is perfect. Safe. Easy.  Very close to an underground station and loads of places to eat.  I would absolutely recommend this hotel.,5,2017,02,27
144,London Trip Feb 2017,"Nice hotel, friendly staff and good location for the Mayfair area ! Comfortably rooms and nice decor and at a reasonable price for this standard of hotel. Would stay again if I need to be this part of the City !",4,2017,02,27
144,Perfect,"Hotel/flat was perfect for my family.  Accommodations were beautifully appointed.  Classy and updated.  The flats were fully equipped with what you needed for your stay.  2 bedroom and 1 bedroom flat even had a washer/dryer.   
Staff was wonderful - friendly, knowledgable and attentive.  
Location was good.  Close to public transportation as well as walkable to some main attractions, dining and night life.  Easy to get taxis as well.   
There was nothing I did not like about this property.  I would visit again.",5,2017,02,22
144,Great afternoon tea in a beautiful interior,"I highly recommend this place for afternoon tea. The hotel is very nice and the staff are very attentive. I highly recommend the afternoon tea here and the attention to detail is spot on. Thank you to the lovely man and woman who took the time to serve us and explain all about the tea. My only negative is that the afternoon tea food did take an hour to come out. We had to ask a few times. However I will be back, thanks for a great Saturday afternoon.",4,2017,02,19
144,Great Stay,Clean and comfortable. Very accommodating staff. Great location with a couple of metro stations within walking distance. Decor is very appealing. The bathrooms are spacious and food was decent. Happy to stay here again.,5,2017,02,16
144,Valentines Afternoon Tea,"Lovely afternoon tea with husband on valentines day. Had to change booking twice over the phone and staff were very helpful and accommodating. 
The drawing room was lovely. Tim, who served us, was fabulous. The tea itself was great - with additional sandwiches when requested. It was as good as any tea we've had in London's top hotels. Would thoroughly recommend! Thanks again! :-)",5,2017,02,14
144,I was especially happy with my room and satisfied with the services and amenities,"My room was perfect - clean, renovated, comfortable- next time I return I want to stay in the same room :)
The bathroom was very nice with heated floors.  The water pressure was perfect.
My bed was 2 twin beds stuck together as a King.  It was generally comfortable but I usually woke up in the ledge between 2 beds.
I loved the couch nook to relax and watch tv before retiring to bed.",5,2017,02,13
144,Afternoon Tea one of Mayfair's Best,"I ventured with my daughter to the Drawing Room of the Flemings Mayfair for Afternoon Tea. The whole experience did not disappoint! From the moment we arrived at the door of the hotel, the staff came into calm action with friendliness, professionalism and a very high standard of customer service. 

The decor was beautiful, apparently it has been recently modernised. When we entered the Drawing Room, we was met by the impeccable and lovely, Tim, who took over the preliminaries as we were seated at a lovely window table. My daughter was impressed twice, first - that Tim addressed her by her name and secondly, his pronunciation was correct! Her name is French sounding and people generally say it wrong first time!   Lets not forget about the Teas - a carefully thought out selection of fine teas from The East India Company, specially selected for the Flemings Mayfair. We choose the Flemings Breakfast Blend and Lis-han Oolong teas, which has beautiful and unique flavours. The range of sandwiches and petit fours were really delicious; a clever menu that not only looked amazing, it also danced with your taste buds. The pièce de résistance was the scones, with the Jersey Chantilly cream and strawberry jam; they were the best scones I have ever tasted - light, warm and melt-in-your-mouth. 

The service was excellent from our host team, namely, Tim with Adina and Afina who were very helpful in our selection of teas and serving us. Not forgetting, Marina, who explained to us the history of afternoon tea and the mystery of those wonderful scones, no secrets revealed!  - Thank you chef!  Finally, with The Flemings Mayfair you will receive a quintessentially London experience and leave with a lastly, positive memory.",5,2017,02,11
144,What a wonderful experience and birthday surprise.,"The Flemings was booked for me as a 60th birthday surprise which was my first stay in a Mayfair Hotel.  It was a beautiful experience and one I will cherish from the room, meal, but most importantly the reception I received, I must confess I was a little nervous but the staff may I name just two Ryan and Paul were warm, professional and very smart making me feel so special.  The Reception staff were also lovely and they all knew it was my birthday, I even had a cake thankfully with just the one candle.  Thank you for making my birthday such a memorable time.   I would highly recommend if you would truly like to spoil a love one as my wonderful husband did.",5,2017,02,11
144,Afternoon tea for two!,"My Wife and I went for afternoon tea at Flemings today through an offer from Groupon.
The hotel is easily accessible from Green Park tube station. The hotel entrance is most welcoming and thank you Ryan Alden (Assistant Head Concierge) for your help and assistance today.
The whole experience was most enjoyable and the sandwiches and cakes were delicious. My Wife (the tea drinker) was offered a wide range of selected teas from the menu, meanwhile my Americano coffee again was great.
Highly recommended and would like to try out their restaurant too.
Thank you to the wonderful staff serving today, their attention to making our visit so memorable and to accomodating our individual tastes could not be faulted.",5,2017,02,08
144,"Renovations that have focused on superficial glitz to the detriment of comfort, safety, and charm disappoint .","Rooms are now cold and neutral, with faux fur coverlets and bathtubs that are dangerous to negotiate. Squared-off, high corners force guests to crawl in and out of the tubs. Absence of luggage racks necessitate awkward and uncomfortable kneeling  on the floor to extricate clothing from suitcases. Odd smell in the bathroom.",3,2017,02,06
144,Fabulous small luxury hotel in Mayfair,"This is our favourite hotel in Mayfair especially now after all the refurbishment.  The location is wonderful with the ability to walk to theatres in the West End and the many restaurants and shops nearby.  The rooms are very comfortable with good showers, air conditioning and free wifi all of which ticks a lot of boxes for me.  I find the staff at this hotel so friendly and make you feel that nothing is too much trouble.",5,2017,02,06
144,Fantastic one bed apartment,"My wife and step son stayed in the one bedroom apartment , over the weekend of 4/5 February 2017.
The apartment was huge, and luxurious beyond expectations. Little details like, flowers, Jaffa cakes, complimentary soft drinks, water, beer and wine were greatly appreciated . The standard of decor was outstanding , and the heated tiles in the bathroom were fantastic.

The staff were outstanding and could nt do enough. One minor point is that the reason we came back was that the hotel catered for the younger guest  and had  a theme of flemming the frog which for a London hotel was a unique selling point, extras like frog embossed slippers and bathrobe for build rent and cookies on the turndown service would have been nice, but for whatever reason I guess they have nt felt the need to keep it up. 
None the less it didn't deter from a great experience and having stayed in London many times over the last 20 years have to say this was the best I ve experienced. 
A great hotel situated 10 min walk from Piccadilly and a five min walk. From Buckingham palace .",5,2017,02,06
144,Excellent small hotel in Mayfair,"Great room with nice touches. Mid week it didn't seem full or busy. The staff were really attentive, but not intrusive.  My room was at the back, so no views. Breakfast was largely a la carter and very good.",5,2017,02,05
144,Solid hotel with good bar,Enjoyed the hotel. In a quiet side street of Mayfair. Rooms on the small side but well decorated. Professional appearance and with a great bar which is open until 1am. Friendly and well trained staff adds to the experience.,4,2017,02,04
144,Feel like VIP,"We went there, for a treat, as we bought a voucher to Travelzoo.. well for little price we had 3 main courses at the Masterchef standard.. never had anything so delicious.. from the canapés to the cocktail to the best tiramisu i have had the pleasure to eat, shame it was too small...   love it",5,2017,02,02
144,Poor soundproofing and slightly outdated rooms ,"Flemings Mayfair could be a really good choice in this expensive part of London if few improvements are implemented by the management: 

- soundproofing in rooms is horrible. You can hear every step from the corridor and many ""sounds"" from the neighboring rooms
- housekeeping staff is totally unprofessional: two days I was there, in the morning and in the afternoon they would chat loudly between themselves in the corridor, walk back and forth the corridor, walk in and out of the rooms slamming the doors constantly. Together with the soundproofing issue, this makes the whole experience a disaster if you want to sleep or nap
- some of the rooms are quite outdated. Apparently they have already started refurbishing but the new rooms are obviously more expensive than the old rooms and at this price point you can already consider a few other decent hotels in the immediate vicinity, in Mayfair
- front desk staff tries hard but keeps mixing things up. It might be the lack of experience or just sloppiness but it is quite annoying when you call to get an adapter and toothpaste and only adapter arrives. Or when you mention the noise issue and they promise ear plugs to be in your room when you come back from dinner but of course they also never arrive
- water in the shower runs in these annoying hot-cold cycles. It is constantly altering between lukewarm, warm and almost hot when you're taking the shower. 

Entry-level rooms are small and obviously nothing fancy, but are quite comfortable nonetheless. Bathroom is of decent size but most of the rooms feature bathtub/shower combo which I find quite unpractical because you can neither take a great shower nor a great bath. Time to move on to 2017 with some proper shower units! ",3,2017,01,29
144,Very nice boutique hotel,"Very conveniently located in Mayfair, near Green and Hyde parks, hotel offers very good service.Rooms are modern, and newly renovated. Breakfast was good. Prices can be affordable if there is a good discount deal.",4,2017,01,24
144,Almost perfect,"The staff was friendly. The room was small but clean and comfortable and everything was in order. A very good shower indeed. Also reasonable quiet room. Wi-Fi was free and worked well.
But... the elevator was out of order almost the whole stay. Although the room was pre-paid, somehow £10 service or whatever charge was not included. Not good.",4,2017,01,23
144,Another amazing stay!,"We love Flemings but it's the first visit since the refurbishment changes. Love the new lounge area which is stylish and relaxing, a great place for afternoon tea. We stayed in a Deluxe double, lovely spacious room with everything you could need. Customer service excellent - how to make very contact special! Finally an amazing continental breakfast - great choice. Finally drinks in the bar after the theatre was relaxing and once again couldn't fault the service with a great selection of wines. We will be back soon ",5,2017,01,23
144,"Best stay, just fantastic.","I stayed at The Flemings around a year and a half ago and it was very pleasent, decided to stay there again and checked in last Wednesday.
I was swiftly checked in by the very elegant Adile, warm, gracious and efficient was in my room 10 minutes after arriving which is always nice.
The room I was allocated to this time was excellent, fully refurbished, and perfect.
If you have ever read any of my reviews you will know that I am super finicky in regards to water pressure and water temperature. No problems here, high water pressure all day and piping hot water. I never had the opportunity to order room service but enjoyed breakfast in the morning on a daily basis. Service and food offerings great as I always appreciate nuts/goji berries with my breakfast. The waitress who greeted me happily every morning and even remembered my room number from day 2 was terrific.
The management at the hotel run a tight ship, felt like staying at a 5 star in Asia.
All the staff (expect the concierge and his number 2) made it a point to greet me and the other guests with a smile at any time of the day. 
I have already reserved a room there for my next visit and seem to finally have found a
hotel in London that I can always stay in.",5,2017,01,22
144,Hotel stay,"Excellent service food and accommodation.
Central London easy to find. 
Comfortable room and nothing was too much trouble for the staff.
We spent our 30th anniversary there abd they made us feel very special.",5,2017,01,20
144,A Welcoming Hotel,"We have made Flemings our hotel of choice when we annually visit London to celebrate my wife's birthday.  It is a professionally run hotel with exceptional individuals who ascertain that your stay is comfortable and memorable.  You are located in Mayfair which is centrally located:  Buckingham Palace is a mere 3 football fields away and proximity to shopping is enticing.  The renovations have now been completed and they are beautiful.  Our room was ""London"" excellent, the fitness center very useable, and the restaurants and staff were excellent.  This hotel is very welcoming, quaint, and fun: a recipe for a great experience.  Thank you",5,2017,01,19
144,Lunch on the 15th December 2016,"My wife without telling me booked a special lunch for us at the Flemings
Hotel Mayfair new Grill Restaurant newly opened since last September
2016 to celebrate where we first met back at a dinner and dance in 1972.

We arrived at 13.15 hours pm for our lunch and the restaurant was
already half full and were shown to very pleasant table for two. 
We chose the daily menu food and had 4 choices for the starter, main
course and desert. The service was excellent at all times and also the
Sommelier was keen to advise us of which wines would suit each course.
The designer modern plated food was actually much better than I had
expected as in the past some hotels in central London where we have
been before the quality has often been sadly disappointing, but not here..

The Flemings Hotel located down Half Moon Street just of Piccadilly London
W1 was very easy to locate and has plenty of London public transport to 
choose from including the Green Park Tube Station just a few minutes
walk away. After this visit we gave it a 10 out 10 for ambiance, service, 
cleanliness, value for money and excellent service at all times where
we were really very well looked after.

One last final lovely feature is the new cocktail bar located downstairs
and absolutely well worth a highly recommended visit for a drink or two.",5,2017,01,16
144,Fine and quiet hotel very central,"Well appointed and neat. In bathroom and dressing room no socket or plug - so hair drying only possible in bedroom. Lights need to turned on and off individually - a pain. Bathroom door activates light so one cannot visit the toilet without waking your partner up..a Room maids very efficient, replaced coffee tabs which in many hotels get forgotten.",4,2017,01,16
144,Home!,When on Rome! An iconic hotel in a big way! Convenience and comfort! Totally London calling! You will not be disappointed! Truly London at its best!i could live in this hotel!a very centrally located establishment!,4,2017,01,11
144,A very English Afternoon Tea,"We treated our American relative to an afternoon tea at Flemings. It was very reasonably priced compared to afternoon teas elsewhere around London.
The tea was taken in the Fleming drawing room - very cosy and intimate but bright and inviting. As soon as we came through the door we were greeted by the Manger Tim, making the whole experience very special. The staff were friendly and very solicitious ensuring we were informed about our experience. The champagne (not Prosecco) was cold, the tea selection just enough to entice without overwhelming & the food did not disappoint. So glad the scones were manageable sizes and the petit fours interesting (larger than we expected). All in all the ambience, the professionalism of the staff and the food made our experience very special. We did not know about Flemings before our visit. We popped our heads into the dining room below and were greeted by all the various staff around the hotel, even though we live in London this may be a lovely place to get away to for a mini break. Location was spot on very easy to get to all the central sights without too much effort. Thank you to Tim and his team for making this special occassion very special.",5,2017,01,08
144,Overnight Stay after meal in Ormer Mayair.,"We had eaten in Ormer Mayfair which is located within the hotel and decided to stay overnight to complete the experience, after a fine meal it only required then a short distance to crawl. We arrived sometime before the room was available and the concierge and reception couldn't have been more helpful or friendly. As the booking was linked to a shopping experience we went for a walk about. Upon returning to the hotel the concirge recognised us and immediately escorted us to the reception to collect the key and then onto the room which was immaculate. Possibly a little small but very clean and comfortable, it would be more than suitable for a longer stay. We had continental breakfast in the restaurant which was very tasty and included a good selection of gluten free goods. Checkout again was flawless again with friendly assistance of the concierge. The only slight negative is the service charges added to the bill which is clearly stated on booking but is only on services not the room. Considering the location of the hotel in London Mayfair it is very good value for money with a very warm and friendly service.",5,2017,01,08
144,Try here for Afternoon Tea,"We had excellent service for our Afternoon Tea visit. Despite being the only customers, we had attentive service and lots of tea, which is really important. The sandwiches were varied and tasty, the scones nice, with home made strawberry jam, and the petit fours were not petite! Different and filling. We could not eat it all. One of our group could not make it so we had theirs packed to take away so enjoyed more at home. The drawing room is a lovely room for an afternoon visit and this hotel is easy to get to, being a short walk from Green Park tube station. Do give it a try.",4,2017,01,07
144,A lovely place in a central location - thank you for making our stay so memorable !!,"My wife and I really enjoyed our experience - the room was cozy and charming, the staff were very attentive, very professional and swift to respond to any enquiry or request. The tasting menu on new years eve was beautifully served and very enjoyable. I really appreciate the attention to detail that made our stay so memorable and further underlines the value of an excellent boutique hotel (over the 'cookie-cutter' type of hotel chain) - we'll be more than happy to return here.",5,2017,01,04
144,Fabulous location,"Full kitchen, washer drier, all updated, beautifully furnished, 3 bedroom apartment- dining room living room, 2 1/2 bath, very private, excellent maid service, lovely staff. Breakfast was included, transportation from and two airport",5,2017,01,03
144,New Years Eve,"Perfect location for any type of visit. 15 minutes walk to Harrods, 1 minute to Green Park.
The room was nice, a little small for the price. 
Friendly staff , very clean, VERY warm.

I called at 11:57 to order a salad and coffee , only to be told they only serve from 12, but she'd ask the chef....
The salad was nice, I'd have preferred the dressing separate as it was very salty.

The milk was off , I called up explaining that the milk was off , but I don't think she understood me as she brought us more milk, I explained that we needed more coffee and fresh cups as it had curdled. (Apparently it was soya milk? My daughter uses soya milk and it has never done that)
We got fresh coffee promptly, thank goodness, I was beginning to get cranky, at £10 for 2, a little pricey for nothing special 

",3,2017,01,01
144,Old World Charm and Elegance,"What a charming and elegant place . We loved our 5 days stay at the Flemings Mayfair with it's Old World Charm. The staff were very attentive, polite and couldn't do enough. The room was nicely appointed.   
 
Perfectly situated in the heart of London for shopping and sightseeing with many of the attractions at walking distance, Buckingham Palace, Green Park, Piccadilly Circus , Hyde Park, Oxford Street to name a few and the underground.

Highly recommended.  We will definitely stay at the Mayfair again when next in London.",5,2017,01,01
144,Wonderful!!!,"We have just arrived for a short Christmas holiday in London and chose the Flemings Mayfair Hotel for its good location location (just off the green park and a few minutes from Picadilly).
But we have been pleasantly surprised by the incredible treatment we have received from all its staff and the services that have offered us at all times.
A LUXURY in every way !!!",5,2016,12,31
144,Great location but rooms need updating for the price,I booked this last minute on the week between Christmas and New Years for a one day stay.  I normally stay over at The Cavendish which has been updated and at the same price point.  If not a touch lower. I have posted pictures of the washroom counter which look dreadful for this price point.  Room was small which is expected for central London. ,4,2016,12,31
144,First class,Beautiful establishment with friendly and helpful staff all at a most reasonable rate in the very heart of London.  The food service was excellent. The gym adequate. We arrived on Christmas Day and the staff was overworked but unfazed. We'll be back.,5,2016,12,30
144,Affordable quality London experience,"We stayed at the Fleming and thoroughly enjoyed the experience, its position is a bonus and walking distance to many major sights around London including the underground. 
We walked to Harrod's and up to Piccadilly Circus, local pubs are near by at Shepherds Bush laneway.
The rooms are quaint and well appointed, the experience is old school and not modern but when in London and you are enjoying the history Flemings just adds to the experience.

The hotel itself is extremely clean and the hotel was refurbished some years back, staff were very helpful and the rooms service prompt and to a high standard. 
If you want 5 star this is not for you but if you want a great boutique hotel this is perfect.",4,2016,12,28
144,Afternoon Tea for Vegetarians and Vegans,"The drawing room is a wonderful place to spend a few hours on a winter's afternoon. Comfortable and relaxed seating in beautiful surroundings with warm and friendly staff.   From the moment I phoned to ask about our group's dietary requirements, I was so impressed with the care and consideration given by the team. The chef prepared three versions of the tea for our group today: the standard, vegetarian and vegan...yes a vegan afternoon tea! All were superb. I can not recommend this highly enough. A big thank you to everyone at Flemings for making it such a special afternoon.",5,2016,12,28
144,Lovely hotel great location ,"I stayed here twice in December first with friends for 2 nights then with partner.

Great location walking distance to Hyde Park, Oxford street and soho.

Staff are excellent! 

Lovely decor.

First stay the room we booked was for 3 and the 3rd bed sofa bed..... was not comfy at all. The room was at the front and quite noisy. Room service food isn't that great so wouldn't recommend.

Second stay room was lovely small but quiet so recommend to stay at the back.

Bar is lovely as is the drawing room.

Would recommend ",4,2016,12,27
144,Warm welcoming stay,"What a wonderful hotel and fabulous staff.  Everyone was so accommodating and personable.  Andrew, the Concierge, was a real gem-  so helpful in securing hotel reservations for us.  The staff in the Lounge were extremely knowledgeable.  
The location of the hotel is perfect.  
The renovations of the hotel were done with great detail.
We can't wait to return to Flemings in the future.",5,2016,12,22
144,Afternoon Tea,"I had a wonderful afternoon tea at the Flemings Mayfair. The pear cake and strawberry jam were especially good. Aga and Marina delivered an excellent service, they were friendly, nice and natural. 

Furthermore the Drawing Room where I enjoyed the afternoon tea, is small, quiet and comfortable.",4,2016,12,21
144,Wonderful Hotel,"We visited for one night for my wife's birthday
Got a fabulous, very comfortable room.  Room newly renovated with a great bathroom.  Check-in team very efficient, professional & welcoming.  Concierge service impeccable.  Nice bar to!
Great location, close to Green Park underground station - easily walk able.  Also, good shopping in Piccadilly & surrounding area.
Highly recommended & will definitely visit this hotel again when next in London
Thanks Flemings!",5,2016,12,21
144,Flemings delivers with 5 star service again,"A gem of a small luxury hotel in Mayfair, just minutes from everything. Chick and attentive service, arranged everything needed for transport, meetings - business with pleasure. Quality food and drinks. After tea time meetings, strolled through Sheperd's Market, Hyde Park and nearby stylish High Street shopping experiences. Will indeed return again.",5,2016,12,21
144,Maybe rather than Mayfair,"Perfect spot for the finer streets and shopping so a good base but a sadly underwhelming experience in the hotel. Nothing bad but nothing exceptional, or even above average. Disappointing for a fairly expensive hotel, not The Ritz admittedly but neither was the service!",3,2016,12,20
144,Awesome hotel in Mayfair,Super location. Used my Small Luxury Hotels membership to get an upgrade. Also to apply for a 2017 competition for which I await the results. Rooms very nice. Fantastic service. Bar at the lower level serves very interesting drinks.,5,2016,12,20
144,Excellent standards and location - but check your final bill!,"A traditional, yet contemporarily refurbished luxury hotel in Mayfair, just minutes from London's West End, Piccadilly Circus and shopping streets. The rooms - as is usual for London - are rather small, concierge service is highly competent and experienced and so are front desk staff. The breakfast buffet offers a wide range of choices.

Do make sure you check your invoice as several service charges were added to the final bill and only upon asking twice I was told those charges were tips and therefore optional. I dislike if optional items are simply added to the bill without asking beforehand and without explicitly declaring them is ""optional"" and find this not transparent enough.",5,2016,12,18
144,LOVELY HOTEL WITH EXCEPTIONAL STAFF,"The hotel is in one of the nicest parts of London and very convenient for the underground. It feels modern and well looked after. The room was attractive and spotlessly clean. All of the services and facilities used were delivered with efficiency. Most importantly, the hotel clearly selects its staff with care, all of them being efficient and friendly. The hotel is not cheap but I rate it very highly and would definitely use it again.",5,2016,12,18
144,Wow always good now even better ,"Thank you for a lovely stay. We were upgraded to a beautiful room. The staff are friendly & helpful. The bed was really comfortable so am excellent nights sleep. In the heart of Mayfair 2 mins walk from green park station. They now have an excellent restaurant & a lovely bar. Would highly recommend this hotel & will definitely return when in London. The refurbishment has definitely enhanced what was already a lovely hotel.
",5,2016,12,16
144,BEST HOTEL AND QUALITY OF SERVICE ,"Dear Hotel Manager and warm Welcome Team,

A so warm ambiance...all the staff were so professional...and dedicated to each guest...

Thank you so much for everything...

I'll be back...;-)

Continue this way...;-)",5,2016,12,14
144,Awful stay.,"We decided to book this because we found it very nice online, and because they did check in at 14:00.

We only had one night in London, so we had a really tight schedule.

We came to the hotel. Beautiful lobby and neighborhood, as we saw online. We got to the front desk at 14:45, and after some time the lady behind the desk told us that our room was not ready yet because of a late checkout. We kindly made the lady aware that the guaranteed check in was at 14:00, but we could still not get our room.
We were in a hurry, so we left our luggage at the hotel and rushed into the subway. 
In other hotels they would without doubt had given us an upgrade, but instead they gave us some useless pounds to their restaurant. As a four stated hotel we had higher expectations.

We came back at 17:00, and the same lady gave us our room key. When we got to the room, we were very disappointed. It was not exactly the same room we saw online and when we checked their website but we could not find the room we were in.

We called the reception, and told them that we where not satisfied with the room and that the wallpaper stuffed horses made us feel uncomfortable. The lady told us that she would call us back.

We received a call, and they told us that they where not able to move us to another room but that we could get complementary breakfast the day after. I ask for a duty manager and got to speak with the room division manager that told us the exact same. I asked him why we could not find the room online and he explained it with their high amount of different categories, even though we where fully cable if finding our category with another and a lot more stylish and moderne look on their website.

He told us about our compensations and that he could not do anymore.

This hotel did not satisfy us on, and we highly recommend everyone to find another hotel in London. It is not exactly a cheap hotel, but one thing is for sure: IT IS DEFINITELY NOT WORTH THE MONEY. 

There is the beautiful website and then there is their awful hotel.",1,2016,12,12
144,Wonderful ,"This boutiquehotel is on the best exklusive area in London and the staff is great and helpful in all kind! They support With everything you ask for and the last night we was upgraded to a new luxury room With all new furnitire and it was such a good way for us to end our trip in London! 
I Will absolutely recomend everyone to this hotel! ",5,2016,12,12
144,Treated like a VIP,"I had my 40th birthday drinks in the bar and enjoyed a weekend staycation at Flemings. Nothing was too much trouble and the service was exceptional. I was upgraded, flowers delivered to my room and surprise birthday cake. One afternoon they were not quick enough to deliver a baby chair to my room and someone came specially to apologise. Alice Helm arranged everything and made me feel like like a VIP. They made it a memory I will never forget. ",5,2016,12,12
144,Excellent stay and fabulous restaurant,Stayed for a weekend. Staff very attentive and helpful.  Rooms are lovely and clean.  Great location. Only niggle are the gigantic unwieldy bed pillows.  The restaurant is a fantastic find and will go back to that regardless of whether we stay at the hotel. ,4,2016,12,11
144,Very nice stay!,"Lovely hotel and good location! We stayed in a studio suite which was very spacious and nicely decorated. The shower is good just missing a full length mirror for the ladies!

Breakfast is expensive but nice and keep your eye out on the bill for service charges being added which you may not have authorised.",5,2016,12,10
144,Full of character this place,Right in the heart of Mayfair this hotel has so much character from the reception to the rooms. Was here on business for two days and it was very comfortable. Highly recommend for any kind of visit to London,5,2016,12,09
144,Absolute gem which impresses on every level.,"Having just returned from a two night stay in London at Flemings Mayfair we felt compelled to write a review to share our experience. The hotel has been freshly refurbished and it certainly shows. Every aspect is immaculate; the foyer, the mirrored corridors, the exquisite afternoon tea room, the basement bar, and the bedroom/ bathroom all breathtakingly beautiful. Professional, polite and attentive are the first three of many positive words that come to mind when describing the staff, with Elisabetta and Ryan being the icing on the cake. Both went out of their way to ensure from here on in, Flemings is our go to choice for any future visits to London.",5,2016,12,09
144,Overnight stay in London,"A great hotel in superb location, the rooms, bar, restaurant were in great condition and high quality finishes. All the staff very polite and helpful, couldn't do enough to make the stay feel special.",5,2016,12,06
144,Beautiful experience...,"My friend celebrated her birthday here with drinks in the bar. My experience from start to finish was exceptional as there are staff everywhere to accommodate you and make you feel extra special. 
The re-furb is stunning, very classic with every detail sumptuously thought out and the team are second to none- I can't wait to go back.  Thank you all for a wonderful experience.",5,2016,12,03
144,Great staff,"This is a decent enough hotel with pleasant rooms, through not particularly massive, but the big thing is that all the staff were very very friendly and helpful, which isn't always the case with hotels in London! Can't credit them highly enough",5,2016,12,02
144,Faboulos stay at the Flemings,"Well first of all the strategic location,  we walked almost everywhere and I never took so few cabs in London just at night back from the restaurants and to the Tate Modern since i don t tlike the tube!!!!  The magnificent Caravaggio show a walk awawy in Trafalgar Square and the fantastic Abstract Expressionism at the Royal Academy around the corner!!!!the best shopping few steps away....... the rooms are very spacious and extra tidy the staff extremely kind and attentive no crowd in the lobby where everything was handled discretely and silently..... Breakfast room very suggestive and wonderful flowers everywhere May you have any problem it will be professionally handled by the efficient general manager Mrs Bertha indeed a Memorable stay at the Flemimgs👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼
Looking forward to be back Sincerely Maria Girotto and Barbara deCarlo",5,2016,12,01
144,"Excellent Service, Wonderul Stay!","We absolutely loved our stay at the Flemings!  We travel very frequently and always chose boutique style hotels and this was truly an exceptional one.  The staff goes above and beyond to make you comfortable.  From the moment we walked in we felt at home.  

The room was stunning and the bed was beyond comfortable! We loved every aspect of our stay.  Definitely take the time to enjoy tea in the drawing room! 

Thank you Flemings Mayfair for your exquisite service! Our only choice for all our London stays moving forward!",5,2016,12,01
144,Excellent Hotel,"I have no words! Amazing hotel,amazing service,perfect location.Everything was incredibly clean and well maintained. The staff....ahh they are genuine, friendly and very professional. Benedict Eggs- the best breakfast in the word!",5,2016,11,30
144,Awful,"The only positive was the location.  Room too small.  No where to put luggage, no vanity area.  Stains on bedding and floor.  Windows looked out to dirty back of building.  No locks on room door. Bathroom smelly, cant take shower head off wall, no air flow in bathroom. Room wasn't cleaned one day, despite having the sign displayed outside the door. Staff not helpful.  Concierge were joking in the lobby, discussing personal details that a guest had asked to have printed.  I could go on.  Overall, I would never come back!  There are many better options out there.",1,2016,11,29
144,Excellent Hotel ,"This hotel has just been renovated and it's stunning! Fabulous hotel, excellent service all the staff we came into contact with we're fabulous great customer service great bar and beautiful food. Superb breakfast. Location is in the heart of Mayfair so perfect for shopping restaurants etc, I would highly recommend this hotel ",5,2016,11,27
144,I will come back,"Perfect location, excellent service (especially Veronika - it is a joy to deal with her), cosy but contemporary designed room with ""honesty"" bar. Definitely my preferred hotel next time I'm in London!",5,2016,11,22
144,Luxurious.,"We’ve just returned from a weekend away in London. The Flemings is in a perfect location at the heart of everything from the Palace, Hype Park, Soho etc and only a 10 minute walk back to the Thames. The hotel itself is luxurious, it’s extremely welcoming and we had a wonderful time.

The staff were helpful, I don’t think I touched a door at the hotel and any questions were set with a smile. The drawing room was comfortable, warm on and cosy on a cold late autumn evening. I’ve seen a lot of reviews about the size of the room, we only booked a double but it was fine, plenty of movement around the bed, nice bathroom with a lovely heated floor and fantastic rainfall shower.

Comes with all of the tea making facilities and nespresso coffee machine, and the usual slippers, robes and an umbrella in the room in case you want to nip out. It’s warm, comfortable and clean. They’ve got you covered. If you’re visiting London I’d recommend it to anyone.",5,2016,11,21
144,"Great Hotel, awesome staff: Veronika is perfect","Classy district (can hardly do better), beautiful hotel (everything looks and smells brand new), super hot duvet, perfect breakfast but above all Veronika at the check in/check out desk was simply as perfect as you can imagine: super nice, super smiling, super helpful... I would recommend this Hotel just for her! If Veronika is at the desk, you know everything will go perfect!
Other staff people were great too and cleaning people were taking super care of our stuff left in the room during the day.
Lower marks on the bed but just because I sleep perfectly only in my own bed",5,2016,11,18
144,"Cramped spaces, elevator out of order, restaurant overpriced","I was attending a conference at a nearby hotel and the conference organizer had booked a room at the Flemings. Upon arrival and after check-in, I was first shown to a room which I can only describe as a walk-in closet. A truly claustrophobic experience. To top that off, the airco did not work, there was a constant drone of the machinery on the roof of the nearby hotel restaurant and the phone disintegrated in my hand when I picked it up to call reception.

To be honest, reception did eventually find me another room after almost an hour's wait but it was on the 4th floor. As this hotel is really a maze of interconnected buildings and the sole elevator was (and remained) out of order, I cannot say I was impressed.

The second room was slightly larger but the bathroom was so tiny that in order to dry off after a shower, I had to step out of the bathroom.Next to the bed there is a plastic cover under which I assume is located a central vacuum cleaner connection. It was absolutely filthy and clogged with wads of accumulated dust and filth. I suppose this hotel is not for people with asthma or allergies.

I had dinner once in the classy-looking but almost empty restaurant. The food was pretty good but the menu lacked in variation and a simple, quick meal like a burger or steak are not available. The prices are truly atrocious which may have contributed to the fact the place was almost empty with the 6-men/women staff standing idle most of the time.

All in all, this was not an experience I would like to repeat and a hotel which made it onto my personal blacklist. At GBP235 and over (excl.breakfast) a night it is not cheap either. I expected (and deserve) more bang for the buck.",3,2016,11,18
144,Excellent location but the rooms are VERY small,"We stayed at this hotel last year and really loved the location so we decided to stay again.  However, for the price that we paid the rooms that we got were terrible.  We were first sent to a room that did not have enough room for my husband and I to put our bags anywhere.  After telling them that the room was too small, they moved us to a SLIGHTLY larger room.  There really is no lobby to speak of.  And although the staff are very nice and the hotel is very clean, i don't see why the front desk staff have to give you the worst rooms available when the hotel is not even half full.  We were supposed to get an upgrade through the Amex Plat card services, but were told none were available, again, although the hotel was not even close to full.  The hotel has very low ceilings and the hallways are a dizzying maze of connected hallways.  Both times that we have stayed there, there has been construction right outside our window and we were given street level rooms.  We will not be staying there again.  We walked around and found a wonderful hotel nearby at the same comparable rates with a bustling bar area and restaurants within the hotel.",3,2016,11,14
144,Beautiful hotel and newly referbed rooms,"This hotel is beautiful. The newly refurbished rooms are stunning and the attention to detail is outstanding. In the lobby there is a table of cake, drinks, patisserie and more for you to snack on all day long as well as the usual complimentary refreshments in your room. 

The breakfast was delicious and freshly cooked to order. There is an option to have breakfast in your room by hanging a pre order sheet on your door handle too. 

They are currently having work done so there was scaffolding and what not. But it didn't disturbs my stay one bit. Definitely will be returning. ",5,2016,11,11
144,Great staff & central location!,"This hotel is not a XXL one but more like a smaller family hotel, gives you a feeling of intimacy which we really liked and it is more a boutique one. The hotel is in a calm street just a round the corner from Green park metro station, which perfect for sightseeing and visiting other parts of London by tube. First of all breakfast is amazing, we had an english one included (big fan of it) and can say they have the best one I have ever tried. Big and nice furnished room on the 3rd floor was ours with great bathroom. Staff is amazing helped us with a lot of info and gave us meal box last day since we left the hotel very early, tnx guys! Hope to see you again soon and stay at your lovely hotel.",5,2016,11,09
144,Very nice hotel,"We had a nice room well furnished - very clean. Nice bathroom with a tub what I love. Very friendly reception (German speaking). Very good continental breakfast - with a perfect menu for extras. Top location only a few steps from underground, shopping areas, Buckingham Palace, and Greedn Park.",5,2016,11,07
144,Fantastic Stay and Surprise Upgrade,Was a lovely surprise to be upgraded to a one bedroom apartment. This was a beautiful large sitting room with kitchenette. Large bedroom with luxurious furnishings and a large bath/shower room. Lovely to have your own front door to enter rather than having to pass through reception. My birthday cake delivered to the door was a super touch. Will definately return,5,2016,11,02
144,Glad to be back,"As a mature couple retired and now residing in Vancouver we decided that travelling the world is our hobby and we will pursue it as long as staying healthy and financially able. For a while we continued to return to London as a part time consultant and tried different hotels to match our needs and standards. About 3 years ago we picked Flemings and now fully retired it is our staring point when exploring Europe or even other continents. It is relatively small, in Mayfair, central London close to,  or having close access by Metro, to most interesting points of London. It is on a small street relatively quiet for a bustling city like London. It has all the facility one needs away from home on holiday or business, rooms of all sizes, a business center, gym facility, bar and restaurant and more recently been advised about special rates in a parking nearby. The management is absolutely beyond reproach and the results of a continued review of the clients needs is visible throughout your experience at the Flemings. The courtesy of the staff from the moment you step out the cab, check in, request suggestions from the concierge, the cleanliness of the rooms, the service in the restaurant for breakfast or dinner are a signature of the hotel. The hotel has gone trough a major refurbishment in the last year or so and the result is tasteful, modern, making the stay even more pleasant. I will make the note that the restaurant in its new layout and under the hand of its master chef offers a Michelin star service and superb dishes.
I will highly recommend this hotel for both business and pleasure trips as well as the restaurant for the residents of the hotel or London residents in search of an excellent new restaurant. ",5,2016,11,02
144,Wonderful rooms and excellent location,"This is a great hotel in a central location at Green Park near everything. The rooms are very tastefully decorated although some of them are rather small, which is of course not unusual in London. Quite expensive but not over the top.",5,2016,11,01
144,Apartment treat,"Having booked 2 rooms between 5 of us we were absolutely thrilled to have been given one of the Fleming apartments. The apartments are in the next door building so involves a quick walk outside but well worth the effort. Our apartment was stunning, 3 double bedrooms, 2 bathrooms and a lovely sitting and dining room. The furnishings were outstanding and everything highly comfortable. A lot of thought has gone into making these apartments first class. 
After a good night's sleep we had breakfast in the new restaurant. Frankly it was only ok. Service was attentive but the food wasn't anything out of the ordinary. Having emailed the hotel in advance about allergies the only concession made was some mediocre gluten free bread which these days is not acceptable. I have stayed elsewhere and had a full selection of options 
So wonderful rooms, good service but could do better on breakfast, especially for allergy sufferers ",4,2016,10,31
144,One night business stay,"Good hotel. Bar area downstairs very nice. 

Air con smelt of damp/mound in room when I turned it on. This wasn't what I expected for a £££ hotel which labels itself as boutique. 

Great location, close to Green Park Tube. Front desk and staff all good as you would expect. 
",4,2016,10,30
144,"Great place to stay, nice and central","It is a very nice and comfortable Location. Beds are very good and even if I was an street Level it was very calm in the evening. 
Breakfast was as well good, the Specials are a Little bit expensive if I compare it to the Locations around.",5,2016,10,30
144,Beautiful Boutique Hotel! ,"We stayed here on a 1 night visit to London as my partner bought me tickets to see Wicked. The location is very central, a 5 min walk to the nearest tube station. 
The hotel is very exquisitely decorated and is quite lavish and luxurious for the price. On arrival at 2pm we were told that our room wasn't ready yet, even  thought we were told check in was from 2pm. We were told to come back in 45 mins. However at 330pm our room was still not ready but just before I started to get a little irritated we were upgraded to a suite - happy days! 
The room was beautiful, and I loved the bath. Fantastic amenities and a welcome touch to have a Nespresso machine in the room. 
The staff are friendly, warm and welcoming and there was also a surprise turn down service when we got back later that night. 
Would highly recommend to anyone visiting London who likes a hotel that is a little more special than the usual run of the mill chains. ",5,2016,10,23
144,Great Location - Wonderful Stay,"I was here for business for seven nights (lucky me) and made the right decision booking here. 

When I arrived, my room was not yet ready even though it was past check in time. I was given a small room in the meantime while they finished cleaning my room, so I could rest and complete some work. 

The staff was very friendly my entire stay. 

My room was very nice and much more spacious than I thought it would be, as my other London stays have been cramped. 

Everything was incredibly clean and well maintained. 

The hotel is very close to Green Park which has a line straight to Heathrow. It's about half a mile walk from Piccadilly. There's a Pret, Eat, Burger and Lobster and an M&S food if you need to pick something up quickly. 

The only issue I had was the bathroom floor heating wasn't working, but I kept my slippers around and it was fine. 

I'll be staying here again when I travel back to London. ",5,2016,10,23
144,"Elegant renovation, great location, a bit over-complicated","The hotel was still finishing its construction work when I stayed here.  This did not interfere with my stay.  The style is a modern classic English design, or something to that effect.  A lot of money clearly was spent and, for the most part, in good taste.  The location is terrific with an easy walk to Regent Street and the Royal Academy of Art.  The Green Park tube station in a five minute walk.  The front desk staff was excellent.  Very comfortable beds.  Quiet room.  I had dinner at a sushi restaurant on the next street, Myama.  No atmosphere at all, but the sushi and sashimi were excellent and I would go back.

What do I mean by the hotel being overcomplicated?  Some of the issues will surely be worked out. The lobby felt a bit like Leicester Square station at rush hour.  It wasn't always clear if the person approaching me actually worked at the hotel. The staff didn't seem to be watching each other so be prepared to be asked the same question a half dozen times.  I chalk this up to the the hotel's newness. The breakfast staff was friendly, but confused, another issue that will likely work itself out.  

However, there are more ""structural"" issues that were maddening.  First, I found it confusing to move around the hotel.  It has a funny network of hallways and stairwells, reflecting that it was created in part from joined townhouses.  This could be charming (like at Hazlitt's), but I found it frustrating.  I think the interior designers could have thought more about how to navigate guests through the hotel.  I was never able to find my way to the breakfast room without help and one morning had trouble finding my way back.  Trouble finding the lobby from my room as well.  If I lived here, I would learn it.  But this is a hotel and I have other things to do. Second, in the rooms, the lighting scheme is problematic in a similar way.  A confusing array of switches around the room that are anything, but intuitive. I don't want lighting that requires hotel staff to come up to my room to explain how to use it while I'm trying to dress for dinner. (Similar issues with a confusing interface on the TV remote.)  Third, while the bathroom is richly appointed, its design suffers from similar problems.  Strange lighting. The glass partition on the shower needs to open out when exiting the bath/shower, but then it blocks your ability to get to the towels.  Beware stretching out in the bathtub that you don't slice your head open at the sharp edges.  

Would I come back here?  It has many things going for it.  It is also expensive and there is no shortage of luxury boutique hotels in London.",4,2016,10,18
144,"Business meeting - Quiet, subtle and polite","Whilst I didn't stay here, I used the dining and tea room facilities.  Both were to a high standard and it made a sensible Mayfair meeting point to conduct business.
The staff were extremely polite. I will visit again with overseas clients.",5,2016,10,18
144,best little hotel at central London...,"small, cosy & comfortable...
everything is new and done with e great eye for details and quality...the crew is great and friendly without the ""london-atitude"":-)
its central an the tube is about 250 meters away, perfekt!!!
PS: floor-heating at the bathroom...love!!!",5,2016,10,16
144,Just great!,"Great friendly, attentive staff, great room and facilities, great location and great value for money, we will stay again. Although on the doorstep of theatre land it is tucked away so really quiet, Burger and Lobster just round the corner!",5,2016,10,11
144,a grand way to take  in London,"very warm and friendly staff, eager to help and enhance your trip. room well appointed, stylish, too bad no outside view from room. the bathroom light goes on automatically so is hard to not disturb my sleeping wife. bar staff and restaurant staff really helpful. especially gilberto alvarez",5,2016,10,10
144,Great hotel with fantastic staff,"The hotel is located in Buckingham Palaces backyard so to speak, and is in walking distance to just about everything. The staff is welcoming and the service is outstanding. We really got the feeling that they were there for us. The restaurant at the hotel is amazing - we could not have had a better start to our stay in London👍🌷",4,2016,10,09
144,Lovely Decor but Small and Average Stay,"The decor of the room is lovely but my gosh is the room small even by London standards - stayed in a standard double and it's overpriced. The other downfall is that when I stayed there they were doing renovations and very early morning (7.30am!) I could hear the drilling. It was just annoying even while getting ready to head to work. Another point I'd like to make is that in a hotel of this calibre I would expect small amenities in the bathroom i.e. cotton buds, cotton balls, a box of tissue but none of this was to be found which to me is really odd. There was no breakfast served except the grab and go (muffin/ water/ piece of fruit / coffee). I just think that overall you could get more by walking around the corner to the Chesterfield where the service and amenities are much better.",3,2016,10,07
144,Ground Floor Room,"I had a single room- and in London I have quickly learnt that Single Room reall really means room for 1 person and a single bed. There is not much room to move around, bed was small, I felt very clautrophobic. But that happens a lot in London Hotels, I have leardt that over the years.

But the worst is staying in a ground floor room. there were people passing in the street and looking into the room, so I could not keep the curtains open, making it even more clautrophobic. Also, the noise of the cars driving through the street at my level did not contribute to a good night's sleep.

Nice fittings, decor and furniture, but the room was a no-no for me.",3,2016,10,04
144,Fabulous boutique hotel in the heart of Mayfair,"The Flemings Mayfair just went through an extensive renovation and it is now a crown jewel.  Part of the Small Luxury Hotels group of boutique hotels, this one is a gem.  The staff to guest ratio is high, the service is impeccable, friendly and helpful.  There is a Michelin restaurant, Ormer Mayfair, which deserves a dinner or two, as well as a great bar and drawing room for drinks and high tea.  The rooms are comfortable, clean and well stocked.  The location is great for getting around London as well as dining in neighboring areas.  Whether you are going to London for business or a holiday, this is the place to stay.  It's small, it's charming and the service is everything you could hope for in a small boutique hotel.",5,2016,10,01
144,Better than average but not 'very good',"I wish TripAdvisor offered a 'good' option for ratings as I feel a bit mean rating this hotel average as it's better than that.

However, for comparable money I have stayed at better hotels in London.

The friendliness and helpfulness of the staff cannot be faulted but I found the rooms a bit cookie cutter and a bit cheaply furnished (can't stand those faux fur throws!), likewise the toiletries were very basic. But my main complaint is about housekeeping standards - visible cobwebs on the light fittings and cornices. Everywhere else seemed perfectly clean but attention to detail is a bit lacking.

Also, on the ground floor you can hear the tube running from the early hours.

I would return but only if my other preferred options weren't available.",3,2016,09,30
144,Delightful and delicious afternoon tea with exceptional service!,"The Drawing Room at Flemings Mayfair Hotel is a lovely place to have a relaxing and elegant afternoon tea with friends and family. Although the sandwich menu had some traditional favorites, the chef also included some interesting and tasty twists to tea sandwiches. Unlike many herbal teas that can sometimes taste too earthy or too flowery, our herbal tea was a smooth tropical fruity blend with a nice punch of flavor.  We received exceptional service. 

The Flemings Mayfair came as a bit of a surprise to us.  My friend has lived in London on and off for decades. She originally wanted to bring me to one of the traditional tourist restaurants for tea. However, she changed her mind and chose the Drawing Room at Flemings Mayfair because she liked the setting when she looked online.  When I walked into the Drawing Room, I immediately agreed with her decision and knew that this was a better fit for me.  The Drawing Room is smaller so it feels comfortable and intimate.  We did not feel like we were in a room surrounded by people. Instead, the cozy, but still well lit, room felt like the perfect place to sit back, relax, and connect.

It is easy to rate a restaurant highly when everything goes right.  I think that a true test of taste and service begins when something goes wrong.  When we arrived for our tea at the Drawing Room, we immediately noticed that all of the tables were occupied.  We approached the hostess and told her that we had a reservation for afternoon tea. She checked her list and could not locate our names.  My friend showed her our online reservation and receipt. The hostess immediately apologized and said that there must have been a problem with the system.  Unfortunately, since the tables were occupied, she asked us if we would not mind sitting at the bar for a few moments.  We agreed.  

The next thing we knew, she brought us two lovely glasses of champagne to apologize for the error.  The hostess then said that she would be happy to be our server to give us more specialized attention.  She went over the menu with us so that we would not have to wait to order until our table opened up.  It was actually really nice going over everything at the bar.  We were closer to her eye level.  It almost felt like we were in on a secret when she leaned over and quietly discussed the different items on the menu.  I told her that I was a vegetarian.  I also told her that I don’t like caffeinated teas and only drink herbal ones.  However, I wanted something different – not the usual mint or chamomile tea.  These restrictions did not faze her.  (In this day and age, these requests should not faze anyone, but I am often surprised by how so many servers get annoyed.)  She asked the chef to make a few sandwiches that were not on the usual menu.  My friend eats meat so she made sure to note that the vegetarian sandwiches should be placed separately from the meat sandwiches.  (This is something that I normally have to request and even then many restaurants still don’t get it right.)  As for the herbal tea, she said that she had a new tropical tea in the back and it was not on the menu yet. She brought out some of the dry tea for us to smell. Incredible!

Soon, our table in front of the fireplace was ready. On a rainy, chilly day, a seat in front of the fire with a pot of tea felt like heaven.  Because we ordered earlier, we did not wait long for our tea and food to arrive.  Before we took our first sip, the aroma of the tropical fruit tea was intoxicating.  It was both delicate and full-bodied without the cloying sweetness or overpowering acidity of some tropical teas.  Within minutes the hustle and bustle of London melted away.  

When our three-tiered server arrived at the table, we smiled and almost giggled.  It was exactly what we wanted.  (Normally, I do not take pictures of my food, but I did so on this day because we were both enjoying the experience so much.)  We nibbled on our yummy sandwiches and caught up on life – as old girlfriends do.  Before removing our plates, the server asked us if we wanted more sandwiches.  We did not.  Instead, we shifted our focus to our delicious scones with jam and clotted cream.  Mmmm. Then, it was time to try the colorful array of chocolate treats.  We were quite full after the sandwiches and scones so we lingered – to allow our tummies to digest and make some room.  The staff did not rush us.  Finally, it was time to eat those chocolate treats! Delicious! It just doesn’t get better than ending on a chocolate note.   

We left our afternoon tea with replenished souls and very full tummies. It was truly a delight.  The Flemings Mayfair Hotel provided us with a personalized, cozy, tasty, and elegant afternoon tea experience.",5,2016,09,29
144,Quality hotel in a great location,Going to a gig in London and wanted to stay in the Mayfair area so I looked up Flemings. Glad I did as the rooms are nice and big with lots of the latest gadgets to keep you entertained. Hotel staff at the desk are friendly and helpful as are the staff in the bar which has a quality cocktail menu. Worth a visit for sure. One criticism is the Shampoo and conditioner you'd expect better stuff for a hotel like this.,5,2016,09,29
144,amazing overnight stay,"found a good deal here via an app....and was not disappointed....the room was huge and had what some might call 2 singles...some 2 small doubles...also had a sofabed and desk/tv/wardrobe/chest of drawers

bathroom had both bathtub and multijet shower.

parts of hote were being redone but it does not affect you....

location is opposite Green Park and 3 blocks down from the station so easy access for tourists",5,2016,09,27
144,London trip,A lovely Mayfair boutique hotel. Numerous staff who are superbly trained with the customer the number one purpose.  Recently had a substantial refurbishment.  Had only me complaint which is why I have marked it as four stars.  Sadly was Mayfair priced but not quite Mayfair value.  Maybe I'm too critical!,4,2016,09,25
144,Night in London town,"Booked this hotel on a whim for a quick getaway in London. We live close enough for a cab home but thought we would give it a go. Must say very impressed with the hotel, it's just been under a major refurb and the bar and restaurant are simply stunning. Many of the bedrooms have been refurbished as well so when checking in see if you can get one of those, beware some are on the street which is experiencing building work so if looking for a major lie in then ask for a back room. Not the cheapest of hotels but shepherds market is moments away for cafes and bars as is a tesco metro. Almost don't wish to praise the bar so that it stays quiet but it's a great find. All in all a great hotel for business or pleasure , very good location and despite being 150 plus rooms feels intimate and boutique like. Staff incredibly attentive. Green park tube 5 mins away, selfridges a pleasant 10 min walk through some beautiful quiet back streets. ",5,2016,09,25
144,Elegance and superb service!,"We have just returned from a weekend away in London, staying at Flemings Mayfair. We have stayed here many times before and this time it did not disappoint. The staff were professional, smart and keen to please and the service they provide is subtle but first class. Our room was lovely, with all the necessary facilities. Last time we visited there were a few problems while the upgrade  to the hotel was happening, but it was worth it, because the whole hotel looks great! 
Don't forget to try some of the house cocktails- they were very good.",5,2016,09,25
144,"Great location, beautiful rooms","The hotel is in the middle of a big renovation, so the lobby was completely bare.  This, however, was made up for by the friendly and attentive staff members and easy check-in.  The room was small, but very beautiful; the finishes and touches were stunning.  Good water pressure in the shower.  The location of Flemings is perfect and I'm looking forward to staying here again once the renovations are complete.",5,2016,09,20
144,Great location and wonderful friendly staff,"Stayed with my Family, Wife and two kids, for a two week London vacation. 
At Flemings Mayfair, the answer was always Yes.
The courteous hospitable staff made sure to deliver and exceed the expectation. Most important, with a Smile.
Super Location.
Definitely our first choice for future London Visits.
Would not hesitate to recommend to all, whether visiting for business or pleasure.",5,2016,09,17
144,"Our ""Go To"" Hotel in London","We really like this hotel when we go to London.  We developed a personal relationship with the Manager when we stayed there the first which was years ago.  We've always been successful getting a good room (ask for a corner room) with ample space.  We love the location and because it is on a side street, it is relatively quiet.  The service is consistently excellent.  Housekeeping go out of their way to satisfy our needs and the Concierge service is spot on with their recommendations.",5,2016,09,17
144,Amazing afternoon tea! Best I've had!,"I have enjoyed a few places for afternoon tea but this is the best location so far. Impeccable service, friendly and accommodating, delicious food. Booked the location for a baby shower and the location could not have been any better. Drawing room is beautiful. I could not fault the staff or location 3 mins walk from green park station. So easy to get too, will definitely be back! Well done!!! ",5,2016,09,17
144,Weekend Treat,"First stayed at this hotel over 15 years ago and bagged a bargain at the time by being upgraded to one of the apartments that are on offer in the hotel. At the risk of having a damaging effect on my nostalgia, decided to book my wife and I into this hotel for a child-free weekend and a birthday treat for my wife. We can safely add my wife to the list of fans of Flemings Mayfair. The standard double rooms are small, but in a quirky, boutique hotel way. We were greeted on arrival by the concierge who took our bags up to our room and there was a nice little birthday cake that had been made by the staff waiting in the room with a nice Happy Birthday greeting. The little things matter and this place is not the cheapest, but it is in Mayfair. Didn't eat any main meals in the restaurant, but did have the breakfast which was excellent value and well cooked. Service was exceptional and would definitely recommend to anyone who is not on a budget.",5,2016,09,16
144,Small room but great location,"Booked 2 rooms for the family for a 2 day birthday visit to London which we informed the hotel beforehand.  Our room was very small and claustrophobic but as the hotel was full they could not change the room until the following night so we did not take up the offer but appreciated the gesture.  The rooms were very clean but I have stayed in better hotels for the same money.  Staff were extremely helpful but the foyer (currently undergoing an upgrade was lacking in atmosphere)  Brilliant location for our Radio 2 Hyde Park concert and theatre production of ""Beautiful"".",3,2016,09,16
144,Beautiful location and afternoon tea,"We took our daughter to Flemmings for afternoon tea as part of her 16th Birthday present. The location was easy to find but in a nice quiet street so away from all the hussell of London. 
The hotel was lovely. Very nice decor and had just been through a refurb.
We had a superb afternoon tea in a bar area. Very good service and very nice food. Well worth the money.",5,2016,09,15
144,Shaun Rankin Restaurant,"My wife and I went to the 'soft' opening of the new Shaun Rankin Restaurant at Flemings - a hotel restaurant we had been to previously. It was a thoroughly enjoyable experience - the staff were attentive, friendly and extremely professional - an absolute delight. I had Rabbit to start, Venison for main, and cheese board. I would recommend Flemmings for both a celebratory meal or if you want to treat yourself. Definitely will be going back.",4,2016,09,15
144,"Overpriced, pretentious, poorly designed in a great location","We stayed here one night while passing through London.  It is situated in the heart of Mayfair close to Green Park tube station, Picadilli (theater land), Lecister Square (movies and street performers) and China town all in one direction and Knightsbridge (Harrods etc) in the other.  It is also a short walk from both Green and Hyde Parks and Buckingham Palace.  This is an expensive area and we expected to pay the rate we did for a night's stay.   This is a small, narrow hotel, established back in the mid1800's and has been totally refurbished.

There was a porter, a door man, two receptionists and what seemed to be a manager all buzzing around being overly efficient to the point of irritating.   For instance grabbing our bags from the cab, including the carry on bags that had the money to pay the cab, before we could even get out of the cab, leaving me to have to go inside to retrieve it even though I told the porter I needed it back.  

The lobby is cavernous and badly designed, one small uncomfortable sofa against a wall and no where expose to sit.   On check in they were trying to offer sherry or port but no where to drink it, fashion over practicality, or just pretentious.   

The rooms split over several floors are accessible by one lift (elevator), which is decked out in kitschy fake library books.  Our room had a queen bed, white, heavy, duvet (comforter), and had a heavy folded fake (hope it was fake! )bear skin throw at the base of the bed.  The was an on suite bathroom accessible by walking sideways past the end of the bed and the wall.  The bathroom has a sensor in the ceiling which turns on a light, very nice, unless you need to use it in the middle of the night and then it shines in the eyes of the person still trying to sleep.  It is not possible to turn it off, which considering it was used 3 times during the night was disturbing and annoying.  Also of note, there was a deep bath in the room but hard to climb in and out of and hard to control too without getting scalded or frozen too.   It would have been so much easier to have a shower instead, but it is an another example of form over function.  

There were some welcome touches including a turn down service where they closed the hard to reach curtains for us and left us a small plastic bottle of water.  

This seems to be a property that is proud of its appearance and has p,entry of staff where they can be seen, all costing money to supply and maintain.  But they don't offer a coffee or tea making facility in the bedrooms just a fancy expensive coffee maker in the lobby that serves less than half a cup of luke warm coffee on the largest setting.  More form over, oh you know what I'm going to say...   

So the next morning, after a disturbed nights sleep and without the ability to have a shower, we checked out.  Not an experience we'll be repeating here. We will use one of the Raddisons instead,in Lecister Square or even the Hilton across the street from this one.",3,2016,09,12
144,Lazy Sundays,My wife and I spent a wonderful Saturday night at the hotel. The room was very comfortable and had been very recently refurbished. The added benefit was that the hotel offers a Lazy Sunday opportunity where breakfast is served till 12 and checkout is delayed until 2pm. Just what you need after a long saturday night out in the greatest city in the world.,4,2016,09,09
144,"Strong location, underwhelming hotel","While the Mayfair location is great, our stay had a couple glaring issues--the lobby is being renovated, so you enter and are confronted with paintless walls, part of the lobby closed off so equipment can be stored, etc. As ambiance goes, this is decidedly lacking.

Our room on the other hand was well-appointed, with a comfortable bed and attractive lighting and a large bathroom.

The biggest issue was that the already limited room service menu was depleted of vegetarian options because ""we restock on Mondays"" (this was a Sunday night stay)...the best solution the hotel could offer us was takeout pizza, which is sorely inadequate for a luxury hotel.",3,2016,09,06
144,Beautiful Hotel,"Lovely hotel is in a great location in the heart of London close to Green Park underground, with West End shops and Green Park 2 minutes walk.
The hotel has had a lot of work done to it to a fantastic level
and staff are as good as anywhere I have ever stayed.",5,2016,09,06
144,Afternoon tea here is a must!,"We arrived for our afternoon tea on a Groupon deal and were greeted by Tim who took the time to ask our names and make us feel so very welcome. Sometimes when you are on a deal you are made to feel slightly inferior but this was not the case here. We were served beautiful champagne and the afternoon tea, including chocolate scones (thats a first for me), was delicious. We were made to feel incredibly welcome and looked after without it being over bearing. It was just lovely. I would highly recommend this hotel for afternoon tea. Thank you for a wonderful experience.",5,2016,09,01
144,"When In Mayfair, Stay At Flemings!","Stayed at Flemings for Valentine's weekend and wow - what a perfect boutique hotel for a romantic getaway, whether it is Valentine's weekend or not. This hotel won my heart! 
From the moment you enter the premises, it oozes class and you're treated like royalty. The staff go above and beyond to make you feel welcomed and at ease.
The rooms are beautifully furnished and fit for everything you may need for a weekend break.
The foyer provides a small table holding refreshments for you to help yourself to throughout the day which is a spectacular touch - from a breakfast selection, to lunch, afternoon tea, evening nibbles such as cheeses etc.
Finally, room service was excellently presented and quick to arrive.
I will definitely be returning when revisiting London.",5,2016,08,31
144,Great small hotel,"We were there when the kitchen/restaurant were undergoing a remodel, which is unfortunate. The location is outstanding...5-10 minute walk to Buckingham Palace. The staff is outstanding; very attentive and addressing guests by name. There is a lovely parlor, where we ate while the restaurant underwent renovation. The menu was limited, but preparation was outstanding. Great wine list. The rooms are very comfortable, quiet, and well-appointed.",4,2016,08,30
144,Could have been so much better,"Location and building were great. Young lad who came to fix our to was very polite and professional. 

Rate when I booked included breakfast I was sure but hey it never and at £230 for less than 12 hours with not even a coffee and a croissant for breakfast is a bit tight. The room smelt of cigarettes which was confirmed by the lad that fixed our tv that needed a reboot ?? Finally the worst partt was a small grey haired lady at reception whom was clearly someone senior in the business giving a member of staff a public bollocking. She said that he was dancing with a guest the night before I think at an event in the hotel and that he and other staff were not concentrating and as a result £15 was short in the till float. She said ""some people don't care here"" to which the lad being told off defended himself. She backed off a little and then said it was not good enough with a stern tone. Fair enough one might say !! But why is a disciplinary hearing being held and heard in public. It is a private business matter between employer and employee therefore not to be in the public domain regardless. If he did get sacked for the allegation then he has a case for wrongful dismissal id say. All that in 11 hours at the Fleming hotel and they charged me for it !!! Wow. Never again.",3,2016,08,30
144,Excellent stay,"Staff very welcoming, check in was efficient, offered sherry / port - which was a nice gesture

Room was at the front of the hotel, and was very comfortable

Breakfast was very good, service attentive

Great location, close the the London Underground, Green Park, Mayfair and Piccadilly",5,2016,08,24
144,"Location, Location, Location","We stayed in London for 2 nights prior to our Baltic cruise.  The Flemings Mayfair was a very nice hotel in an amazing location.  They have just undergone a major renovation and our room had some minor glitches, but the staff was super helpful and fixed the items that were important.

We walked everywhere from the hotel. Some sights, parks, museums, cafes and shops are all within easy walking distance.",4,2016,08,23
144,Full of Charm,"I went to London to celebrate my cousins college graduation. The Flemings Mayfair is as unique in design as it in staffing. The location is ideal, it is located in a very posh side of town . It is also central to the tube, parks, and many eatery places. I love that my room was quaint,unique and full of character. The elevator that took us to our room was designed to have a library in it and it made me feel as if I were taken away to another time and age. Every morning the hotel did provide a small lovely selection of fruits and muffins and Nespresso coffee as well as water, I was appreciative of this. All and all the hotel is a classy and unique establishment and I would recommend it to anyone who ask.

With Gratitude,
Samantha",5,2016,08,23
144,Lovely location shame about the hotel 😦,"Beautifully located hotel just a short distance from many of Londons main attractions, staff very accommodating, helpful and knowledgeable about the area.

 Sadly during our stay there were major renovation works being carried out leaving dust everywhere, a loud generator running 24/7 just outside the hotel making for an awful nights sleep, for a top London hotel the rooms are extremely small, fixtures tired and decor really could do with a touch up, sadly won't be staying here again , the cheeky tip add on needs to be optional at the end not added then having to be removed extremely embarrassing for the client !!! This i know is common throughout London stop it's not necessary !!!",2,2016,08,23
144,Disappointed,"I spend time in different hotels in the major cities I stay in, as well as going back to old favourites, and high hopes of this highly regarded hotel, just round the corner from the Stafford where my business associates were staying.

Once I had arrived and got in the front door through skips and building materials, the small lobby was efficient enough. I had arranged to drop a hire car for collection and agreed the hotel would keep it somewhere as parking was an issue here. There then appeared a very discombobulated concierge who seemed to be indicating I had to go and park it...no chance after I had taken the trouble to ensure it was OK for me to simply arrive and leaves keys with them.

This seemed to set the tone for the visit, which really just wasnt up to standard.

I found the staff to be rather cold and unaccomodating, almost superior at times in their attitudes. Something I have rarely found in London top end establishments frankly. 

I had booked a junior suite, it turned out to be on the ground floor, right next to the builders access to the lower floor where work was being done, work that started noisily every morning I was there early. The restaurant was out of action and a limited menu was available from the tiny bar the hotel had. This information was also not clear when I booked the hotel and I find that tiresome too.

The room was OK, smaller than I am used to, and bathroom too, very small indeed. It was comfortable and the usual amenities were provided. A couple of nice additional touches included refreshments and snacks available to guests in the lobby.

On check out a service charge was applied, a tip for housekeeping, which after some discussion around it being discretionary, it was removed. Hotels in London need to stop doing this automatically and embarrassing customers in to paying, or we simply wont go back. If it is discretionary then ask the patron if they would like to add it...Im paying for a hotel room, I don't expect to have to tip the person making my bed (if they even get it).

it is in a nice area, close to Buckingham Palace and just over the road from Green Park and a short walk from lots of shops and the hub bub of London...perhaps it is some peoples cup o tea, not me though and I was happy to spend sunny days afterwards at The Mondrian, one of my London faves!

All up, not the best, and a disappointment so be warned...",2,2016,08,19
144,Brilliant staff let down by hotel,"Whilst staying at the Flemings Mayfair this weekend it was apparent that as booking a twin room the standard of what is advertised versus what you get are 2 different things. 

There was a hole under the carpet near the window, paint falling off in bathroom and poor quality fitments in wardrobe. The air conditioning cannot be adjusted in temperature on in speed. And there was a generator running in the night that kept both of us awake.

On the other hand the staff were helpful and friendly just unable to do anything.",3,2016,08,15
144,Touring London ,We had an amazing few days in London. Our stay at Flemings Mayfair was wonderful.  We enjoyed the beautiful accommodations; free breakfast items and afternoon snacks; and proximity to the Green Park subway station.  (Our only qualm was that we had to have 2 rooms for our family of four people.) The Flemings staff is top notch and staying here again would be my first choice.,5,2016,08,13
144,London Vacation,"Hotel was exquisite, rooms were small but comfortable. We were served a glass of Port  when we arrived. Breakfast was not included and it was very expensive so we bought some fruit and muffins and had breakfast in our room. This hotel is just across the road from the Park and across from the park is Buckingham Palace It was centrally located so walking was the best way around. Cabbies were not helpful.",4,2016,08,10
144,Afternoon tea,"Popped in for afternoon tea and it was lovely. We had pre booked and on arrival told it hadn't been confirmed and two other couples who arrived had the same issue. The afternoon tea itself was very nice, sandwiches and scones were good but sweets mediocre. ",4,2016,08,10
144,Luxurious and excellent location,Luxurious hotel in the best location I've ever stayed in in London. The hotel is currently being upgraded which did not detract from our stay. Furnishings and bedlinen luxurious. Stylish high spec new bathroom. Excellent helpful staff (many Londoners) who knew the city well and were very happy to help in any way. I would definitely stay here again. Highly recommended,5,2016,08,07
144,Visit to Flemings,"This was a terrible stay.  I saw originally on the website at the time of booking that the restaurant was under construction but it didn't say that the whole hotel was under construction!   Forget sleeping in or taking a nap.  Drilling, banging, hammering... you name it!  Our first assigned room was across a construction site, walking on plastic and everything :(  we moved rooms after complaining and the second room was better but the  noise was no better at all.  The WIFI was intermittent throughout our whole stay, which made working impossible.  I also asked for 2 extra pillows and that was greeted with an unfriendly 'ok'.  Also a member of staff walked in on me while changing clothes with no knock on the door.  A horrible stay for the price charged.",1,2016,08,04
144,Pleasantly Surprised,"Stayed here just for one night, and for the first time, this week. I travel around the country with my job but only occasionally stay overnight in London. This hotel stood out for a couple of reasons; firstly, the staff were outstanding; better than most I've stayed in around the country. Nothing was a problem, always smiling, welcoming and courteous. The rooms are very good, not huge, but well appointed and comfortable. I know it's of little significance or value, but having refreshments in the lobby is a nice touch too - it might not be unique, but it certainly isn't common. I'd go back tomorrow. ",5,2016,08,03
144,"Great Staff, Great Location",Had a fantastic weekend staff at this hotel are always attentive and nothing is ever a problem. The location is perfect for a trip to London. Parking is the biggest challenge but again the hotel take full control of this for you.,5,2016,08,02
144,Lovely but beware,"I have stayed here many times over the years and am delighted with the upgrades they have made to the rooms and hotel.  However, be aware that the work still has 2 months to run.  I had no problems with builders' noise but my husband did when he stayed a couple of weeks ago and a guest I spoke with last week said he and his wife were being woken up very early by the noise.  My only personal criticism relates to the provision of breakfast.  A continental breakfast was included in the price of my room, thankfully as I would have been disappointed if I had paid for it.  The selection was very poor and not up to their usual standard.  I know that they do not have their usual dining facilities but I hope that they are not charging their usual price for breakfast.",4,2016,08,02
144,Excellent Again,"Stayed at the Flemings for one night and thoroughly impressed yet again by the service 
Wonderful staff very comfortable bed and a fabulous location.cannot wait for the new restaurant to open in September . Will be back to stay at flemings soon.",5,2016,07,31
144,Super location,Stayed for a fourth time but on this occasion only because the RAF Club was full. Excellent location with friendly and efficient service. Rooms not large but perfectly ok and I'm sure the top end ones are larger. Sadly missed the new restaurant being open but it looks good and I hope to try it later. Bar service excellent and had a great late night chat about all kinds of stuff with the lovely lady serving. Will continue to use as my back-up location in Mayfair when my club isn't able to accommodate. ,5,2016,07,27
144,Luxurious hotel,"We arrived at this hotel and were greeted by some very friendly staff.

We were offered a choice of upgrades on rooms and were very kindly shown a few however we declined as our original choice was sufficient for us.

Very comfortable room and bed - bathroom could do with an update though. 

It was nice that there is always something that you can eat or drink in the reception area or if you need to grab breakfast on the go it is available, and included in the cost of your stay.

Fantastic location - close to tube and in a beautiful area.",5,2016,07,26
144,Great stay,"Such a lovely hotel,great staff and beautiful rooms.The only issue was some noise from room above when they were walking about but we would definitely stay there again.nothing else to say but having to use more words!!",4,2016,07,26
144,A one night stay,"Following a family gathering my wife and I stayed for one night. As it was late when we arrived, somewhat tired and emotional, I don't think I was able to appreciate all that the hotel had to offer!! The staff were friendly and welcoming, the room, comfortable and well appointed and the bed, welcoming! We had a Continental breakfast in the morning - satisfactory but nothing special. When we left  I didn't feel that I had stayed somewhere special - functional and central , yes - but not outstanding. I have stayed in many other hotels less expensive and just as well appointed.",5,2016,07,22
144,Ready soon,Luxury with a homely feel is possibly the best way to describe this hotel and with the refurbishments almost complete and the restaurant opening in September it is going to be an exiting time to stay this autumn . I cannot fault this hotel in any way except that some rooms can be a little small  and claustrophobic but it will still be my favourite London resting place now that the Savoy has become so expensive .Half-moon street must be the best street name ever !,4,2016,07,20
144,Small but clean and beautiful,"The deluxe single room was quite small for a weeklong stay but quite immaculate and beautifully appointed.  They offered in room dining for our included breakfast due to the  restaurant renovation.  My only complaint is that I didn't always get a breakfast order card in my room each night and had to call room service on a couple of occasions.  Otherwise, the staff was friendly and much less stuffy than some of the other Mayfair hotels.  Laundry service was on point and the concierge was extremely helpful.",5,2016,07,19
144,Wonderful stay for three generations of our family.,"Once again, Flemmings Mayfair was our perfect home away from home in London. While it was a remarkably busy week in and around London (Wimbledon, the Farnborough Airshow, etc.) and at the hotel (interior and exterior construction) the team at Flemmings could not have worked harder to make us feel at home. They did a fantastic job of dealing with morning breakfast and food throughout the day despite their main restaurant being under construction. Our rooms and apartments were all beautiful (but some are quite small, so read room descriptions closely), the staff and service could not have been better, treats and small gifts awaited our two young sons every day and we could not have had a better stay. Branca and her team are simply the best and treat all guests like family and friends. We will be back again for sure and would not consider staying anywhere else in Mayfair. Many, many thanks. ",5,2016,07,17
144,Beautiful Whimsy,"I have had the pleasure of staying here a number of times.  This one the pleasure of introducing my granddaughter to this marvelous spot.  Food is excellent and the staff kindly and entertaining.  Every corner holds a surprise.  I found just today that we were missing a cashmere sweater and a leather jacket. I called and they says yes we had left them behind and they would post them tomorrow.  Where else in the world would you find that?  Courtesy, integrity and friendliness.  The concierge is the best.  Superlative experience. ",5,2016,07,13
144,Ralph lauren stay,"We were put in here after we won tickets to wimbledon through Ralph Lauren and to start with it is in a fantastic location ... literally 3 min walk through a lovely park from Green Park tube station and a 5 min walk to The Ritz. On arrival our room wasnt ready but they took our bag and checked us in. The staff were very pleasent but lacked the personal touch and seemed slightly like they didnt want to be there! On check in we went to our room and it was lovely ... felt a little cramped but had everything you really needed. There was complimentary coffee and tea and your standard toilerties. The whole place is under refurb so the view from the window is scaffolding but no noise or any bother. They say they have 24 hour room service food but its only soup or sandwichs or beef cassorale ... i think the commoner in me would have prefered burger or even some chips ... but thats just how i like to eat at 2am! My one gripe is the walls are so thin!! At 4am the lady next door decided she needed to call someone on speaker phone for 2 HOURS and we could not only hear her conversation as loud as day but the speaker phone too ... for a hotel of this stature would be soundproof'ed' abit better which kind of ruined the night ... i have not ranked the hotel for this, any lower than the one star less i gave, just due to the fact you would assume people had a bit more consideration which i understand isnt the hotels fault! Breakfast was continental and had your basic fruit, cereal and breads with a few antipasti thrown in. Husband had a full english which cost us extra (when you book bed and breakfast just make sure you pay for which one you will be eating as 2 sausages and some bacon cost us £6 after we didnt realise as someone else had booked the room for us ... just got told bed and breakfast) ... and dont forget they will add on a service charge at the end ... which i know is standard but on a fully paid room still took us back but again not the hotels fault. In conclusion ... lovely place to stay (location great) ... but not really somewhere i would stay if i was booking personally but the sound of the new resturant is very nice and would probably visit there for drinks and food one day ... after i catch up on my sleep or lack of ... after hearing all about some ladies fun filled day in London ... she spoke in chinese ... so i think thats what she was talking about ... i slept well on the train home though!!",4,2016,07,13
144,New favourite.. with room for improvement ,"First stay at Flemings on Friday night and overall it was a good stay. Check in and welcome was professional and largely organised. The room we had was a Deluxe Double which was compact but very comfortable. It had a small terrace but was blocked off owing to building work on the building. Also the a/c wasn't brilliant so the room was hotter than we would have liked and we couldn't open the doors to the terrace. 
Breakfast the next morning was pleasant. A buffet of continental items and hot options to order. I had a vegetarian cooked option which was very tasty. 
The decor really is lovely and hotel is well laid out. They are soon to open a fine dining restaurant so that will be a plus. They have a small gym and use off site facilities for spa etc so you need to walk for that
Apart from the niggles with the room I also felt the staff were a bit hesitant and not really organised. That showed at check in and breakfast and left me a bit confused as to why. I am sure it's fixable as Flemings should be the perfect bolt hole in Mayfair 
",3,2016,07,11
144,"Definitely British Service, central location ","The service was wonderful and they have coffee service and snacks for free in the lobby throughout the day.   We stayed first in room 61 on the ground floor next to the bar and service area.   Don't stay in that room if your a light sleeper or you will hear a little hustle and bustle out the door into the early evening and miring.    Other than than, the room was delightful.   Then we moved to a one bedroom apartment which was great.  It included a full kitchen with clothes washer and dryer that was crucial as we were in the middle of a four week trip.  Each cycle of laundry took nearly 2-3 hours so plan accordingly!    However slow the wash went, we were happily relaxing in our living room, wonderful bath and ample bedroom.   Sparing no expense? Get the apartment! ",5,2016,07,10
144,Excellent experience!,"My daughter and I visited London a couple months ago and everything about Flemings Mayfair was exceptional! The staff was very helpful, accommodating, and overall awesome! Andrew made our stay unforgettable and Flemings Mayfair is definitely a place we would come back to. ",5,2016,07,09
144,This hotel is currently under total reburishment,We stayed at Flemings 21st to 24th June on arrival we were met with a hotel under total reburbishment and workmen everywhere. We were shown to a tiny dark room workmen outside the bedroom window I raised the wooden blind to see what was going on and part of the blind fell and hit me on the head and arm. We were reallocated to a different room on the 4th floor a little brighter but much the same size. We were told by The Reception Manager we would be allocated a refurbished room on 22nd this never happened. The lift during our stay was out of operation which meant climbing four flights of stairs. As the restaurant was also also under refurbishment  there was very limited seating. We were never ever advised of this refurbishment and find this a disgrace. It is our fourth stay at Flemings and it was my birthday gift. All in all a complete disaster. Never during our stay were we offered a complimentary breakfast or meal which would have made us feel better at least. BRIANCA the manager normally looks after us so we are left very angry. My advice dont go near this hotel until the refurbishment is complete we intend to contact the hotel direct.,1,2016,07,05
144,Refurbished rooms,Just make sure when u book it's a refurbished room the first room we were offered was so small and taty in fairness when I complained and I was ready to walk out they sorted for the next night better room,4,2016,06,29
144,Nice stay,"I only stayed for one evening and stayed in the tiny room offered for single. It was really quite lovely and the staff were very nice. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 was they are under construction and although it didn't disturb me per se, a few amenities were unavailable. I would go back again in a second - oh and the location is great too.",4,2016,06,29
144,Great location and service,Completely out of expection as I stayed in a Flemings in Munich (not sure if they are the same group). Elegant rooms with full amenities and an honesty spirits bar. Very spacious with a living area and a double use bathroom. Right outside Green Park and tube station. Walking distance to key attractions and shopping.,5,2016,06,27
144,"Great location, excellent service","The room was small and noticeable old, but everything was clean and our room was very quiet.  The service was excellent and all common areas were chic.  Location is perfect for sightseeing, dining out and nightlife.",4,2016,06,25
144,Great hotel in a great location,"We have previously stayed in Flemmings and returned because we knew we could depend on the quality of service. The staff are polite and helpful, we were offered an upgrade to a newly refurbished room on arrival.",4,2016,06,21
144,"Excellent hotel, our new London favourite!","Having stayed in London too many times to remember, I must say that this hotel is by far the best! What a find! From start to finish, we could not fault this place. The staff are excellent, very friendly, professional and courteous. From offering us a drink of port and food whilst our room was getting ready (we arrived earlier than check in time) to arranging cabs, nothing was ever a problem. The rooms although on the smaller side (but who needs a massive room anyway when there just the two of you!) had everything you need and more! Beautifully decorated, immaculately clean and top quality finishes and furnishings. Little touches like a hand written card and complimentary Jaffa cakes! Although we didn't stay for breakfast, we were told that there's was a free breakfast in the lobby with pastries etc. 
The Drawing Room is quaint and quirky. Just fab. 
The location of the hotel is the best, walking distance from attractions such as Buckingham palace, and with it being in central Mayfair the shopping is to die for, and the tube is right around the corner. 
We hope to rebook at the hotel in July and bring our children and my mother in law which will give us the chance to sample the food. 
Thanks again to all the staff who made our weekend extra special, K. Turley and E.Horton",5,2016,06,19
144,Perfect!,"Flemings hotel is simply wonderful and in the perfect location. The service was excellent from very friendly professional staff. They couldn't have been more helpful.  

The room was extremely comfortable and the bathroom had the most amazing shower. Spotlessly clean couldn't have wished for more. 

I will definitely be making a return visit and would certainly recommend.",5,2016,06,12
144,"Fabulous service, excellent location","Flemings is a wonderful hotel.  They go out of their way to provide amazing service.
We arrived from SFO to London at 8:30 am and thought we would have to hang out for hours before our room was ready.  Just then Brancs, the service director approached us and told us to treat ourselves to a full breakfast and she would make sure a room was ready within a half hour.  Not only did she accomplish this but she upgraded us to a three bedroom apartment!  I would recommend this place to anyone, good food, great service and unbeatable location.",5,2016,06,11
144,A Boutique Gem in the Heart of Mayfair,"A beautifully designed hotel, extremely well located, Flemings Mayfair is as aesthetically pleasing as the service there is first class.  The rooms, done in an Art Deco style, are meticulously executed, down to each detail. Likewise, the public areas are similarly tasteful and innovative.  The staff, with the exception of one, went beyond the bar - catering to every request in a most professional and diligent manner.  Overall, very impressive.",4,2016,06,11
144,Flemings - Always a joy!,"I've stayed at Flemings many times and have to say it's my favourite London hotel. Perfect location, lovely homely feel and utterly charming. This break - in spite of renovations taking place - meant a much smaller, unrenovated room, which was fine, clean and comfortable but was a bit disappointed with cleanup - no tissues (over two days) and used towels were folded and left on windowsill in bathroom. But overall it was as lovely as ever and of course it'll remain my first choice - I'll be back soon!",5,2016,06,10
144,Charming & Friendly,"Flemings Mayfair offers friendly, personalized service and is conveniently located in beautiful Mayfair. Flemings Mayfair is mere steps from Green Park, excellent restaurants such as The Wolseley and Quattro Passi, art galleries and luxury boutiques. I look forward to my next visit.",5,2016,06,09
144,Nice little boutique hotel in great location,"This small hotel in located in the heart of Mayfair about a block from the Green Park Tube stop.  It is a few blocks from Bond St. and Berkeley Sq. and about a 15 minute walk to Trafalgar Sq.  Newly appointed rooms, fast WiFi, and a very helpful staff round out the picture.  There is also what appears to be a sophisticated restaurant, though I didn't have a chance to eat there.  Not cheap, mind you, but what in Mayfair is?  I would certainly consider returning on my next visit.",4,2016,06,04
144,Enjoyable stay and great location,"Quiet street location in a beautiful pocket of London to explore. Double room small but very comfortable, the staff at Flemings made our stay unique. Every person we interacted with was lovely - this added so much to the enjoyment of the trip.
It was good to be so close to all the very busy attractions, then return to this comfortable welcoming quiet small hotel.",4,2016,06,04
144,"A nice Hotel, Therme minutes away from Green Park Underground Statio,which","Gibt's you a director Underground Connection in 45 Minuten to Heathrow . The Hotel Sems to be completely refurbished.they arme still Renovationsdienst The Restaurant Area, what Soulsänger be finished in June. Wehen Checkens in ask for a silent Room!",5,2016,06,02
144,Good concept but not same as others in price range,"Pros- good location, style of decor, friendly staff.
Cons- Hard bed, tiny bathroom, very warm room- could do with a fan rather than having the air con on all night.
Centrally located to walk to most places in London but also near Green Park tube so very easy to get around.",3,2016,05,31
144,Great Service and this dispite of ongoing refurbishment work,"I stayed at the Flemings the first time last week and it was truly a good experience with the best of it being the outstanding service.

Already at arrival the Flemings is showing its best face with everybody welcoming you with nice charming smile.
With that one could almost forget that the hotel is undergoing some refrubishment work.

The rooms while not large are very nicely decorated and while clearly some years into its time still looks all in good shape. The wifi is working well throughout the hotel and because of the hotel being off the main road its very quiet what is great for a good night sleep. During the daytime between 8 am to 6 pm however there is some noise from the work performed that if staying at the room might possibly be an issue.

There is free coffee ,water and some cake and snacks offered at the lobbyarea throughout the day . The breakfast is either served at the small daybar or in the room at no extra cost. 
What ever option for breakfast you might choose the service is just outstanding and this not limited to breakfast.",4,2016,05,29
144,Just perfect ,"My partner and I had the pleasure of staying here for the night and what a delight it was, the most beautiful decor and ambience, set in a perfect location, evening drinks and breakfast in the drawing room were top class and the staff second to none, absolutely faultless, we are looking forward to our next stay, special thanks to Ryan for your exceptional hospitality- Thank you Flemings ",5,2016,05,28
144,A new London favourite,"Wow, what a find. We’ve walked past Fleming’s dozens of times over the years and never actually thought about going in; from the front it looks small. It’s actually several huge town houses knocked together to create a wonderful mid-sized hotel.

Let’s start at the beginning. We had a wonderful welcome and even though we were first time visitors Reception had that wonderful sixth sense and knew who we were.

We were shown to our room by Paul the Rooms Division Manager. He had a confident smile when he showed us to our room on the 3rd floor and I’m not surprised – it was stunning.

We were lucky to be in one of the newly refurbished rooms. The décor is extremely attractive and of the highest quality. Our room was very clean and beautifully presented. Plus they had slippers which are made to fit men rather than 8 year olds!

Breakfast is currently in the bar/lounge as the restaurant us undergoing a major refurbishment (re-opens August 2016) but this didn’t matter.

The breakfast staff were excellent, Matthew deserves a special mention for the way he was running a very efficient, tight and friendly ship. Breakfast was tasty I had one of my best eggs benedict ever.

We enjoyed breakfast in our room on the 2nd morning as we had a very early start. It was beautifully presented, hot and tasty. 

There was a little confusion when we checked out but it was quickly sorted with the receptionist taking full responsibility. I never mind an error, but in a hotel when someone accepts responsibility and fixes the challenge immediately, with no fuss, the establishment goes up in my estimation. 

So would we return? 100%! In fact, we have book a further 4 nights in the next few weeks and we can’t wait to experience more of Flemmings.",5,2016,05,27
144,Very welcoming staff,"The staff are a delight at this establishment - warm and helpful without being fawning. This is a very well appointed hotel, with subdued and elegant decorations. A nice touch are the complimentary snacks and refreshments which vary throughout the day. The 'breakfast to go' was sufficient as we had a late start and only wanted a small amount to eat as we had a lunch booked elsewhere. The location is excellent, just across the road from Green Park. The only reason this is not a 5 star rating is because of the scaffolding around the building. As we booked in on a Saturday, our stay was not affected by the building works. The room rate of £180 was very good value - the price will probably shoot up once the building works are completed.",4,2016,05,23
144,So you want to visit London,"And you want to stay in a good  moderately priced hotel, centrally located in a good neighborhood, only separated from  Bucingham Palace by the narrow Green Park. But that's not all. You want a hotel with modern nice room, excellent service, pleasant and helpful staff. If I got it right than the hotel you are looking for is the Fleming Mayfair at Half Moon Street.",5,2016,05,22
144,A wonderful hotel in a great loaction,"Just stayed the night, but we had a wonderful time and will definitely go back. 
Great location with Green Park a minute away, so a perfect base to explore London from with shopping, theatres and museums all within easy reach
Staff really friendly and helpful.
Our room was small but perfectly formed.",5,2016,05,22
144,Anniversary Weekend,"Would have been 5* but we hadn't been informed re building work that started at 8.00am on Saturday am would be occurring! Staff were attentive but not intrusive, enjoyed the complimentary refreshments in the foyer, and loved the location",4,2016,05,19
144,The worst ever SLH hotel in London I have every stayed,"I am a fun of SLH and normally stayed in the No11 Codgan Garden while I am in London. Due to refurbishment of Codgan Garden, I decided to try the luck with Flemings which turned out be a big mistake. I stayed there for 9 nights

On the second day, I got a call from them saying I need to evacuate from my room and move into a new room as the the water was leaking from the floor above me really badly so I had to move into a new room like refugee. The thing which made me angry is the hotel  mgt just left me alone and did not make an apology until I talked to the front office manager next day.

The level of service was lack of accuracy and consistency. For example , when the room service is done, my tray for breakfast was still left in the room over 4 times. When I ordered the breakfast , something was always forgotten. 

When I checked out, I picked up that they overcharged me and asked why they did that. They said it is the guest responsibility to check the bill whether it is correct or not and they did even not say a simple ""sorry"" for the error. My point is as hotel it is their duty to produce a accurate bill for the client.

Over all, not very nice experience and wont go there again if I have the choice to choose other SLH hotels in London",2,2016,05,16
144,Excellent hotel,"The hotel is first class, staff very helpful and friendly they can't do enough for you. We stayed in a one bedroom apartment everything you could ever need provided. The best hotel we have ever stayed in. Great location for sightseeing, restaurants and theatres. Would highly recommend",5,2016,05,13
144,Top class hotel in the heart of London,"Stayed in Felemings Mayfiar in London recently and really enjoyed my stay.  The location for me, in Mayfiar, was spot on and very close to Hyde Park.  Staff were friendly and very professional, the room was ideal, compact but very well layed out.  I stayed in one of their newly refurbished rooms, which was superb.  They offered water and fruit complimentary which was nice and they also have a small bar downstairs where guest can make coffee, have fruit, water, small snack, shich is also complimentary.  
The hotel  is gong through a refurb at the momet but there was none of the disturbances which you would normally associate with this, which was great. Half moon street is also quiet and I enjoy a good sleep in an amazingly comfortable bed.  All in all, a 5 star experience.",5,2016,05,13
144,Seventh stay,"When we come to London we stay at Flemings Mayfair, this year was our seventh time, and we loved it again!! Everything was great as usual!! Next vist to London and also next stay at Flemings Mayfair. We want to give our compliments to all the staff they were all friendly and kind! See you next year or the year after!!  ",5,2016,05,10
144,"Nice hotel, good location ","Very nice hotel, the room was a bit small and cramped for us but as we wasn't going to be in the room much it didn't matter, we bought a standard room.

Love the bathroom! We didn't get slippers as advertised though, but it didn't matter much to us.

Lovely location, close to everything we would come back and stay again. 
",4,2016,05,10
144,Lovely boutique hotel with courteous and friendly staff,"Flemings is ideal for a couple or single on a short or long stay.  The rooms are beautifully appointed; apartments have all the comforts of home including washer/dryer.  Hotel is under renovation so main restaurant is not yet open but breakfast room is charming.  This hotel is ideally situated for access to the West End for Theatre, is walking distance from Knightsbridge shop and Bond Street Shops.  

I stayed 12 nights - the Staff knew be by name and were courteous and friendly.  I would definitely stay again.",5,2016,05,09
144,Great hotel.,So many good things to say. Firstly all the staff were fantastic. Really friendly and helpful. The location is very central and easy to get to anywhere from here. The room was very comfortable and the air conditioning was great. It actually worked like it should work!! I'm not the best sleeper but the bed (and the bedding) just seemed to hug you. Slept so well. The only fault which I'll get over was that the room was a lot smaller than I though it would be but it was very clean and had everything you need. Loved the nespresso machine. I would have no issues staying again. 😀,4,2016,04,28
144,Lovely short stay wish it was longer,"We were so welcomed into this well appointed and very friendly hotel.
The staff were stunning. The room although small was lovely and the bathroom was great.
We will definitely be back very soon this was a great find for the odd shopping or business day in London.",5,2016,04,27
144,Birthday Celebration,"The Mayfair hotel is ideally situated with excellent rooms.  Ryan, the concierge, was outstanding.  He was extremely helpful and cheerfully made all of the arrangements that we requested.  His recommendations for dinner were excellent.

The entire staff was very pleasant and attentive.  During our stay the restaurant was closed for renovation and not available.  The hotel made accommodations for the guests to have a complementary continental breakfast.  ",5,2016,04,25
144,Mark Davis,A one night stop over in Mayfair. Beautiful hotel with friendly and attentive staff. Spotlessly clean room and high standard of fittings and decor made for a superb stay. Really quiet room - didn't hear a peep from anywhere else - and I am very sensitive to noise. Would highly recommend this to anybody want to stay in the heart of Mayfair and nearby connections to the Tube.,5,2016,04,24
144,Overnight stay at Fleming 20/4/16,"Have stayed at Fleming's a few times over the past few years. We always go back as the hotel is first class,staff are very attentive,rooms are brilliant ! Last year there was a lot of refurbishment going on at the hotel and work has now been completed. This year we were greeted by lovely Diane. She took us to our room in the new wing of the hotel,room 704. When we entered there was a small reception corridor then several other doors lending of it. Diane opened one door to a lovely bedroom,then she started opening the other doors. To cut a long story short,she had given us an apartment ! Two bedrooms,kitchen,living room,two bathrooms, I could quite happily lived there. As mentioned we have stayed there a few times,staying in ""Executive"" rooms-very grateful for the upgrade. Because of it's locality,the next day we walked across the road to Buckingham Palace as there were celebrations for Queens birthday. Sending our best regards to Branca,Andy,Pedro,Russell,Charlie,lovely Hilary(Italian) in the restaurant. Reference Branca,wishingher a speedy recovery from her illness-see you at our next visit.",5,2016,04,23
144,Another Excellent Stay,"Although the hotel is undergoing major refurbishment we found that our stay was up to our previous excellent experiences. This hotel is always sparkling and clean, the staff attentive and the location perfect. Cannot fault this hotel in anyway, including an excellent controlled fire evacuation, activated by a small refurbishment fault in the kitchen.",5,2016,04,20
144,probably the best 4 star service I've expierienced.,"I have been travelling the world for 36 years , but i have to admit that this hotel has one of the best concierge and reception service of a 4 star  around. they have no parking but they have an efficient valet parking service.Rasa changed our room for a better one. and they have a nice little breakfast free service for those who are in a rush, rooms are not huge but have everything in a stylish effective decoration.",5,2016,04,20
144,Private Patio and  private Gin Bar Experience,"Stunning Studio Suite with a patio and a fantastic Gin Bar stocked with one of the best Gins on the market so far! We were absolutely delighted when we discovered the patio that came with our suite were we relaxed for the afternoon until it started raining so we had to relocated to the Drawing Room where we continued exploring our passion for Gin !wonderful ambience and spot on service that's all I can say!
Definitely our new favorite London boutique hotel! We will be back !",5,2016,04,15
144,Comfortable Stay at Flemings but some issues.,I have stayed at thus hotel before and it has always been comfortable - this time not as good an experience though. The hotel is undergoing refurbishment currently so there is noise from 8.00 am to 5.00 pm. My room was 100 on the first floor and the room was small but well appointed. The bathroom was tiny. The quality of sleep was poor because of a green flashing light on the smoke alarm - really irritating. Overall not up to the normal standard this time.,3,2016,04,15
144,Flemings Mayfair,"Both myself and partner stayed here for one night and from the minute we stepped in to the hotel it was like a different world. The concierge Ryan was the first staff member that we saw and from the off set he was nothing but helpful professional and very welcoming. The hotel was lovely and Both my partner and myself Thoroughly  enjoyed our stay. Would highly recommend this hotel, both the hotel and staff were great, outstanding in fact.",5,2016,04,08
144,"Quaint, yet luxurious","Staff is wonderful and the rooms are luxurious! Beds- very, very comfy. My room was newly renovated. Beautiful and clean. Location is perfect too! I didn't get a chance to dine, but did have an after dinner drink in lounge/bar. Nice!",5,2016,04,06
144,Unprofessional receptionist,"The location is great for sure, however the hotel is quite old. The shower in our room is bit broken as the water split all over the roof! Biggest problem is the two receptionists charged my boyfriend credit card several times as there's a transaction problem, and there were not listening to what we were saying. The whole fee of our staying should be around €540, while my boyfriend got charged over €1100 in total. Sure those money gonna come back eventually, but their unprofessional manner just totally turned us off, as they have no clue of what they were doing",2,2016,04,05
144,Fashionable & Ultra Friendly,"Having stayed at the Flemings Mayfair for 5 nights - all in all - it has been a real treat. Amazing location, lovely rooms, all renovated, all new, nice and spacious but most importantly the staff is just incredibly friendly. From arrival until departure one felt really taken care of - a big thank you to everyone - we will be back shortly ...",5,2016,03,23
144,Comfortable stay but nothing special,"We stayed here Friday night.  I had sent an email to the hotel to request for a quite room.  We arrived late evening and were assigned a room on the 1st floor which was up a staircase by the reception.
The room we were assigned was quite but was clearly one of the older rooms that had a bit of wear and tear.  Older furniture, electrics in bathroom made a funny noise.  Shower old but worked well.  Very comfortable bed.
Not much dining options in the hotel until the new restaurant opens which will no doubt be a big asset to the hotel and for guests but until then the hotel doesn't offer much in services available.  I was a little taken back when asked did I want to pay an additional 5 pounds for a service charge when I checked out.  I would have thought this should be added to the price of the room when booking as it is awkward and odd when been asked do you want to pay this.  I declined as I didn't use any of the facilities. I would gladly pay this and more with a fully functional hotel. The hotel is in a great location for London and has comfortable beds.  Overall an ok stay but would wait until refurbishment is completed before considering a stay in this hotel again.",4,2016,03,20
144,Excellent Location and Service,"After only two visits, the entire staff knew my name and needs. I has specialized amenities each day. It was one of the best stays I have had in Europe. Smaller bedrooms, but great space in the bathroom. Literally steps from Buckingham Palace and Picadilly circus, on a very quiet residential street.",5,2016,03,19
144,Best Hotel In Mayfair,"The Flemings Hotel in Mayfair has been recommend to me by some friends.

It was my first stay with them and I really enjoyed it.
The service was super friendly and they would try to maximise the comfort at the hotel during my stay. The newly designed rooms are offering great possibility to relax a bit from the hectic London.

Once the new restaurant and all renovations at the Hotel will be finished this summer the Flemings will be the best boutique Hotel in Mayfair.",5,2016,03,16
144,Wonderful Hotel and Refurb stunning but..,"It always interests me when something goes wrong - how will the staff react. This is my second time to Flemings and I love it ( for the record my husbands 5th time). Location is great for running in the parks in the morning, shopping during the day. It was really nice to hear some English ascents coming from some of the staff as well ( a rare thing in London). There is nothing nicer than being ""welcomed back"" especially in London where competition is high! The hotel is currently going through a major refurd  - ( our room was outstanding) BUT management you let yourselves down  BIG time with your breakfast. Yes we were told that the restaurant was closed due to the refurb so we were prepared for a different experience. We chose the B & B rate - English breakfast. What a disaster! Why was the priority to CHARGE for the breakfast at 24 POUNDS rather than the guest experience. What about under promise and over deliver? You could have done that so well. But the main priority of the poor lady serving breakfast was making sure she charged us all. In the process she was stressed and short with other staff. Not a great way to start to our day. I noticed one guest was asked about 6 times what him room number and name was- poor guy was so annoyed he did not end up getting his eggs. Suggestion - until your kitchen and restaurant is complete, why don't you just offer comp B & B?  Confirm this on check out. That is a wow factor. I will be interested to hear the GM's comments.I still love the hotel but managing issues could be improved. I did not get the names of the guys on Concierge - but they were by far the outstanding staff during our stay!  PS - one last think please do not vacuum outside room 125 early in the morning.",5,2016,03,16
144,Superb service,"We visited this hotel on Saturday 12th March and we had a really lovely stay.We stayed in a junior suite room 75 to be precise.The decor is modern with an unusual twist as you spend time in the room you really appreciate the interior more .The lighting is fantastic especially in the bathroom.There is a lovely magnifying mirror which is a godsend when doing ones makeup.The towel dressing gowns are lovely and fluffy.The whole room was very spotless and we were even left complimentary water and chocolate.In the foyer there are complimentary coffees cakes sandwiches ect depending on the time of day.But what is really outstanding in this Hotel is the service.All staff are professional but very warm and friendly too,nothing is too much trouble .
I would highly recommend this hotel for room service and location and would definitely visit again. Just as a final comment my husband said he had not had such a good nights sleep for months.",5,2016,03,14
144,Fantastic weekend,"My girlfriend and I had travelled down from Nottingham for the weekend for an event in Mayfair. Up on arrival I was greeted by a lovely gentleman who took my bags, lead me to the reception and offered me a glass of port. The reception area was beautifully decorated and done to a very high standard.
We. Had chosen the duluxe double room and were lead to the room quickly and given a quick run through of everything.
The room was gorgeous, very clean, well decorated and had everything you could need.
The bathroom was also lovely and the monsoon shower heads are great.
We proceeded to drinks in the drawing room which once again was gorgeous, they had a fantastic selection of spirits, wines and champagnes to chose from.
I would certainly recommend visiting the Flemings Hotel as it was a fantastic experience from start to finish.

144,Great Stay!,"Staff were very welcoming and friendly and very attentive. Single room was a welcome surprise. Bespoke, well fitted out with the best facilities, wifi for music, nespresso machine etc,
Usually single rooms are an afterthought 'what can we do with this cupboard' Not here This was  an excellent newly refurbished room well designed, with a great palate of materials and furnishings. I will be back!",5,2016,03,05
144,the noise !,"Great location, great staff, great room but dont go until they have finished the renovations as the noise is intolerable ! handy for mayfair and the restaurants and shopping, shepherds market is just round the corner as is park lane and piccadilly, great for familys as is a semi residential area and not to busy.",3,2016,03,03
144,Lovely weekend,We had a lovely weekend at Flemings. Everything was perfect staff very friendly and helpful and they couldn't do enough for you. The breakfast was lovely. The apartment was spotless and the decor was of very good taste. It was very close to all amenities including theatre land china town Oxford street and Buckingham palace. ,5,2016,03,01
144,Little fairytale,"I stayed for 2 nights at the Fleming Mayfair with a friend.
We where welcomed by a group very sweet personnel.
The way you want to arrive after a long travel day.

All i can say is..Sweet people and walking distance to the city.
A perfect way to explore London.
Really had a pleasant stay.. Thank you Fleming Mayfair",4,2016,03,01
144,Fabulous hotel. Excellent location,"We stayed at Flemings the last weekend in February 2016 having secured a deal on Booking.com.  The rooms were reduced due to renovations being undertaken at the hotel.
The location is fabulous.  Having never spent any time in Mayfair and Green Park we were pleasantly surprised of the ease at which you could get to the West End, The Palace and all other major attractions by foot.
There is an abundance of cafes restaurants and drinking establishments within tneighbouring streets and the busy Shepherds Market around the corner.
The hotel was five star and superb.  All the staff were really friendly and helpful.  Nothing was too much.
Free coffee and fruit in the foyer for breakfast, complimentary was available.
The room and bathroom was lovely.
A really lovely stay was had.  The hotel is being refurbished to a high standard and a Michellin starred chef is to be at the restaurant.
We would love to return but I fear the prices in the future would be beyond my reach.  Shame.  Recommended.",5,2016,02,29
144,A hidden gem,"If you're looking for a hidden GEM, Flemmings in Mayfair is a very good spot. 

Awesome and cosy design. Green park tube is a few minute walk, very handy for getting around.

Very nice boutique hotel in the heart of London, the staff is at it's finest.",5,2016,02,25
144,Be carefull,"Be carefull: construction noise from monday till Saturday.  Redecorating 2 of 4 level. Can't get any sleep and the bed was shaking. Asking for discount, no chance. The guy at the Rezeption sad i shoul read the small print. Charging the full price is not fair from my point if view.",1,2016,02,23
144,Perfect location,This hotel is so close to everything you need to see and easy access to the tube. Quiet area and very nice size room. The service is very good and the staff friendly. I would recommend staying there. Beds are very comfy and you get some fresh fruits and coffee in the room.,5,2016,02,21
144,60th Birthday Treat stayed 3rd Dec to 4th,A little late with this review! Just to say Thank you to all the staff and management for making my 60th Birthday last December 3rd so special . We were treated like VIPs with a glass of champagne in our room to celebrate my birthday. The manageress was so kind to us . I believe they are having some improvements on the restaurant done at the moment but that would not put us of staying .Looking forward to staying again soon in April .,5,2016,02,21
144,Lovely little spot in the heart of Mayfair,"Very nice little hotel in the heart of Mayfair, the staff were excellent, very well turned out with impeccable manners, customer service at it's finest.
The hotel is undertaking a refurbishment at present however no distributions we noted by either myself or my partner. 
We did not dine at the hotel so can not comment of the food, however the small bar area to the right was lovely for a quick bottle of bubbles before venturing out.
Nice touch with the real coffee and quick breakfast on the go in the main reception.",5,2016,02,18
144,Great Location.  Excellent staff.,"Stayed in December.  Really good location for Piccadilly access.  The staff are excellent - thought they were very helpful and genuine.
Food, and we only had breakfast, was not great - it seemed very very expensive for not very good quality.  But that may just be London pricing.",4,2016,02,15
144,The Place To Stay In London…..,"I stayed at the hotel for one night February 13th 2016
The hotel is excellent, in a good location, excellent value!!. Large comfortable double bed. The bathroom was also a good size with a large bath and separate shower cubicle. Everything was perfect, from the welcoming and professional staff at the reception desk to the concierge , Doorman , bar & Restaurant staff 
It is located in a quiet side street close to Green Park tube station, over the road from Green Park (a short walk through the park to Buckingham Palace), West End in fact very central for everything.
We was also told Michelin star chef Shaun Rankine will be opening a new restaurant at Flemings in July 2016
Thoroughly recommended!

144,"regretably,you are a lack-of-sympathy hotel","I booked your hotel room via Ctrip Agency and prepaid for this room. The booking number is 840143327, my name is FENG/YU.  The check-in date is 10th Feb, 2016 and the check-out date is 12th Feb,2016.
Staying your hotel room is included in my vocation plan in London. But unluckily, two week ago, my father got a hospital check and the diagnosis was devastating. He got a cancer. I have to cancel my London journey and cancel your hotel room and I really need to care for him.
I wrote a email to Flemings hotel and attached my father's health report. I explained that he got Descending Colon Adenocarcinoma. He got a surgery and I attended him in hospital till now. Although I know this room payment is irrevocable referring to your rules, I hope I can cancel my booking and get refund. 
At the same time, I expressed if in future I have an opportunity to enjoy my vocation in London again, I still will choose your hotel.I hope I can get your understanding and your consent about the cancellation and refund.

But your reservations manager just give a impractical advice: in no more than 3 days, I can transfer it to my friends. You know, I am in China and entering UK needs strict visa-approval. I feel terrible about your lack-of-sympathy communication. In my plans, I reserved other three London hotels:the Ritz London, the knightsbridge hotel, the Royal Park Hotel London. They all three refunded the reservation fee to me, which made me believe the London Hotel industry is full of compassion.But your hotel, Flemings Mayfair, took a entirely- different measure, gave a lifetime-terrible impression and lifetime-unforgetable experience.",1,2016,02,14
144,Lovely afternoon tea,"My wife Jean and I had a magnificent afternoon tea at Flemings mostly due to the excellent service from Matthew and his staff. We started off with champagne and some amazing teas and sandwiches, scones and cakes. There was so much that we had to take a doggy bag back to the hotel. Also delighted to find out that Shaun Rankine will be opening a new restaurant at Flemings  on 1st July. No doubt it will be Michelin star standard",5,2016,02,13
144,Mayfair Boutique!,"Excellent boutique hotel in Mayfair. Great location and fabulous decor. It feels like home as others have suggested and far more intimate that your larger and grander establishments.

The price of breakfast was very unreasonable but there is lots of choice outside of the hotel...

Good bar area!",4,2016,02,13
144,my suite stay at Flemings Mayfair (FEB 2016),"Due to work I get to stay in some amazing hotels around the world. Sometimes, rarely, I get blown away by a great hotel. Flemings Mayfair has just done that. 

London's hotels were full to capacity this week which saw me stray from my Starwood, Club Carlson Gold perks to make a reservation at Flemings. 

The two bed suite they put me in was out of this world. Silk wall paper, endless space, seamless tech connections, soundproofing and amazing discrete service which lead to my complete serenity allowing me to get work done and rest. 

I rarely write reviews, but I felt compelled this time, as this experience has just seen me just open a SLH CLUB membership. 

There are two things, other than my awesome massive suite, that made my stay special that perhaps only long term/frequent hotel stayers will appreciate:

1. The omelette they made me for breakfast in the restaurant was possibly the best omelette I've ever had. Hands down. 

2. As I finished breakfast a dashing man I'd never met came casually to my table and discreetly calling me by my surname he said ""Good morning Mr. ####, I hope everything in your suite is ok."" I asked my waiter later who this man was and he mentioned it was the GM Henrik. As a solo guest, I truly appreciated this small gesture from him. Thank you sir! 

I will stay at Flemings Mayfair again I recommend you do as well. 

Peace! ",5,2016,02,12
144,A true taste of Mayfair,"It is rare to find a hotel that offers all the attributes of a true sophisticated hotel with exemplrary service. Flemings staff did just that. It's unpretentious, rooms luxuriously spacious and placed right in the heart of Mayfair. Accessible, covenient and intimate. Just what we needed. Thank you for a memorable stay.",5,2016,02,12
144,Friendly Boutique Hotel,"Very friendly boutique hotel with a very central location and next to the tube (Green Park). The bedroom was very good, however the bathroom was a bit outdated. Breakfast was well arranged with plenty of choice. The hotel is currently being renovated and a new restaurant will be opened in summer 2016.",4,2016,02,11
144,Home away from Home,"I was in this hotel during a business trip. I was in the apartment suite ,I have no words to describe it. I really felt at home,Just arrived we were warned that there were renovation works in progress, but we didn't heard anything, they told us they are making new rooms and they will have a  Michelin restaurant in the basement.
I can't wait to return as soon as they finish restructuring in order to see the new rooms and the restaurant :-) The General Manager and all the staff are great and make a difference. The complimentary bar in the entrance is amazing and also the complimentary minibar unusual in London!!!",5,2016,02,08
144,Good hotel,"Was travelling on business - stayed there for one night. Fairly central - avg sized rooms though. Helpful staff and very clean. Yes, I would go back for sure.
Walking distance for a few landmarks and great for business.",4,2016,02,01
144,3 Day stay,"Polite staff always willing to help and very clean rooms
The hotel was being refurbished in the kitchen and therefore breakfast was not available but no matter as I was directed to many of the ""local"" 5 cafes for great breakfast ",4,2016,01,31
144,Excellent location and facilities,"Flemmings is a well located hotel, near Piccadilly. Although certainly not a 5*, it is a good quality four star hotel. Its very well kept. Rooms are comfortable, although not large. Good breakfast. Nice staff. ",4,2016,01,30
144,Great staff,I stayed at Flemings for the second time this year.  I was totally impressed with the quality of the staff who worked tirelessly to meet all my needs. Loved my room as well. Hotel is well located to enjoy all that London has to offer.,5,2016,01,27
144,Beautiful Hotel,"This is by far the best hotel that we have stayed in London. From first entering the hotel to leaving the whole experience was amazing. The staff were very welcoming but equally discreet, the feel of the hotel was very intimate & special and the suite room was lovely.
This will definitely be our fist choice hotel on our regular visits to London.",5,2016,01,26
144,An unforgettable experience!,"It was an experience to remember. The hotel newly renovated offers stylish chic interiors but the highlight were the people. Everybody was so welcoming and helpful showing genuine interesting that we truly felt like home! Breakfast is fantastic. We also had dinner twice in our room and it was excellent. The location is perfect, right in the middle of London's sightseeings. Definitely we are going back! Thank you all for your kindness and warmth!",5,2016,01,23
144,"Swanky rooms, great service","Excellent location just off green park, very comfy bed and huge bathroom. Service was excellent, particulalrly knowledgable and helpful concierge. Very rich breakfast, including a nice selection of hot dishes. The perfect stay in Mayfair, will certainly go back.",5,2016,01,14
144,Best Team,"I have stayed at Flemings many times. This time I went there with my two sons. I love this hotel; it has everything: good location, excellent service, spectacular breakfast and dinner. I think that nothing could be better.

The team that works there is one of the best I have ever founded. Ms. Lirio Moreno - who is working at the restaurant - is so efficient in his job, with a great attention to details, and so warmth that she made our vacations one of the best we have ever had.",5,2016,01,11
144,"Perfect start to the New Year, Room 708","We arrived on New Years day and prior to arriving, were told we had been upgraded to a Suite.  Upon arrival, we were notified by Reception that we had been upgraded to an Apartment.  We were shocked at the size of the room, which was beautifully decorated. We had two bathrooms which were so clean and spacious.  The lights were great, where we could have mood lighting and there were switches in various places which was handy.  There were USB sockets in the wall plugs which was very handy to charge our phones. The services was unbeatable, the Man on reception remembered our room number which was great attention to detail and felt personal. We called whilst in the car and the same Man helped us with directions and where to park due to the road closures which was very helpful. The breakfast was very tasty and we had the full English breakfast. The doorman open the front door and everything felt so personal. A couple of minute walk to the Green Park tube station and really gave us a great start to the year. I would stay here again with no doubt and thank The Flemings Hotel for our rememberable stay.",5,2016,01,10
144,Best afternoon tea ever,"Excellent service, fantastic, cosy setting and superb champagne, tea and food. Nothing could possibly have been better! Me and my two girlfriends just visited for afternoon tea, but the hotel has a perfect location for staying in London - I will definitely consider staying here during my next visit. ",5,2016,01,08
144,Third visit and will return,I have stayed at Flemings on three different occasions now. The classic double rooms are not massive but look to have been renovated recently and are very comfortable. I like the true boutique feel of this hotel with its friendly staff. I will happily stay here again.,4,2016,01,08
144,Great location!,Our family of three stayed 4 nights at Flemings Mayfair and thoroughly enjoyed our stay.  The staff is very nice and caring.  They also knew our names and would address us whenever we came in or went out.  The rooms are small as I believe most of the hotel rooms in London are but they met our needs.  We intend to go back and stay at Flemings in our next visit to London.,4,2016,01,05
144,"Excellent location, staff and service. Thank you.",Spent a weekend break in London. The staff could not do enough to help and the hotels perfectly located with excellent facilities. Located next to Green Park station and Piccadilly. The breakfast was superb.,5,2016,01,05
144,Very Friendly and welcoming staff,"My mum and I had lunch at Flemings on Boxing day.  The service was fantastic and the lunch was utterly delicious.  All the staff we came across from the concierge to cleaners, were so friendly.
We are booking for an afternoon tea in Jan and I can not wait!",5,2016,01,02
144,Christmas Unwrapped,"The perfect location for hassle free, relaxing stay over Christmas. Hot and well paced Christmas lunch and a chance to use as little or as much of the Flemings services as one wishes. Wide choice of breakfast, spacey, clean rooms and always plentiful but discreet staff to assist.

Christmas at Flemings is a firm family tradition.",5,2016,01,02
144,Half term break ,"I spent a night here over half term with my two children. The room and hotel were fabulous, clean, luxurious and the staff were very attentive. Couldn't ask for anymore! The location is great, within 2 minutes walk from the tube station. Would definitely come back.",5,2016,01,02
144,Cool little place to stay in Mayfair,Really liked this hotel.  Had a lot of character and the staff were some of the most friendly I have come across in a London hotel.  Its an old hotel so corridors and rooms reflect that but very stylish and I would recommend it.,5,2016,01,01
144,London weekend,"The hotel booked us into a tiny room, which we found very claustrophobic. However, after a quick discussion with the reception staff, we were re-allocated to a perfect room. Food was excellent, so were the staff. Very central for all our needs, with a tube station around 500yds away. Highly recommend.",5,2015,12,31
144,Lovely central location for a decent price,"We really enjoyed staying at the Flemings Mayfair. Absolutely fantastic location, cute boutique style rooms, nice breakfast etc. I would highly recommend requesting a room on a higher floor away from the road as half moon street can be VERY loud during the night (especially when the bars kick out) so you want to be as far away as possible from all the noise!",4,2015,12,29
144,Great hotel experience,The staff were friendly and very helpful. The room was cozy and pleased with the facilities provided in the room during my stay. The hotel was easy to locate when I arrived  and it was close to locations I wanted to visit.,5,2015,12,28
144,A little gem!,"Looking for somewhere special as a treat for our 40th wedding anniversary I wanted to avoid the larger impersonal 5 star hotels in London.    Flemings provided exactly what I wanted - a small oasis just off  the hustle and bustle of Piccadilly.   The hotel is charming and immaculate, but of course it is the people who make the difference.   Every staff member greets you with a smile and makes you feel welcome, while being efficient and attentive.    We never once felt like ""just another guest"".   We would both thoroughly recommend Flemings to those looking for a special and rare experience in Central London.",5,2015,12,23
144,Perfect,"True boutique hotel. Cosy, on a quiet street in wonderful Mayfair, minutes from Piccadilly or Oxford and the park. Service  is great with helpful and always polite and smiling personnel at the concierge, the door or the reception. Nice small but well equipped gym. Will come back. ",5,2015,12,22
144,'Romantic Weekend',From the second we arrived until the time we left on the second day we received exceptional service. Concierge were extremely attentive and polite and the hotel management could not have done anything more to make our stay any more wonderful.  Fantastic location fantastic warm friendly atmosphere.,5,2015,12,22
144,Boutique Hotel ,"We have stayed at the Flemings twice before and love the location, ambience and wonderful service. The staff are without exception delightfully helpful and warm. We had a classic room which was very luxurious but too small for a long stay but perfectly okay for 1 or 2 nights. Close to underground, West End , Oxford st shopping and all the most visited places. Also close to Soho and many great restaurants and pubs. Only minus was the breakfast which had little variety and very boring for a longer stay. Would definitely stay again.",4,2015,12,21
144,Fantastic stay,"My friend and I stayed two nights, the staff couldn't  do enough to make our stay comfortable. 
The location is great for the sights, the tube and taxis are easy outside or at the end of the road.
The room was comfortable and although  facing Half Moon Street was very quiet.
We will definitely return and would recommend",5,2015,12,20
144,Wedding Anniversary,We celebrated our 10th Wedding anniversary at this hotel.To start with we were upgraded to a suite on arrival with a bottle of bubbly sent to our room. All staff knew that we were celebrating a special occasion.We thoroughly enjoyed our stay,5,2015,12,20
144,Has Everything you would Need,"This boutique hotel is located in a prime spot and it won't burn a hole in your wallet staying here.  I found the rate reasonable for what you are getting.  The hotel is located 2.5 blocks (5 minutes walk) from Green Park tube station which makes it very convenient if you are arriving at London City Airport or to get around London.  Nearby the hotel is Piccadilly Circus and Regent Street. Fortnum and Mason is about 2 blocks away.

There are many restaurants located in this neighborhood so finding a place for a meal is not a problem.  If you don't want to venture outside to dine the hotel also has room service.  The selection on the room service menu was decent and fairly priced.

The Concierge team is very helpful.  The front desk team is efficient - the check in and check out process was quick.  Overall I found the staff in the hotel very friendly and helpful.  Included in my room rate was breakfast.  The breakfast had a wide selection of food that you can choose from - from cold to hot dishes.

The single room was perfect for a solo traveler.  Wifi was complimentary.  ",4,2015,12,20
144,Great location,Perfect hotel for hitting the shops and good value too. Room clean and service for breakfast good too. If the hotel is full expect a little delay in being allocated a table - breakfast is mix of self serve and table. Worth signing up to helps email newsletter to receive details of offers and promotions.,5,2015,12,17
144,Unlucky with the room,"I stayed at the Flemings Mayfair for the first time. Unfortunately the room I got was some of the smallest I have ever stayed in and quite noisy. It had a single bed and felt like a shoebox the size of 6 sqm. The room was on the ground floor right next to the street, with some construction work going on almost right in front  of my room, despite the fact I had indicated and mentioned to get a quiet room. For a price of GBP 205 excl breakfast even in London I have stayed in better rooms.
Having said this the room and the entire hotel was very clean, well equipped with all necessary amenities and had a nice touch to it. The staff was friendly and the location is great for anyone planning to have business in Mayfair or plans to go shopping in the vicinity.
I did not try the restaurant nor the spa so cannot comment on both.
I would consider coming back to give it another try but next time I would ask for a better room.

",3,2015,12,17
144,As good as the first time!,"We just love this hotel but for so many things.  The location is ideal, the staff are simply wonderful and cannot do enough to make your stay special and lastly the hotel is so comfortable.  It clearly caters for the US tourist as it has the essentials right ie; air conditioning, good showers and super breakfast.",5,2015,12,15
144,Another great stay at Flemings.,"Just back from another great stay at Flemings....a great place to stay in London. We have always loved this Hotel......fantastic location, quiet setting, nice rooms, and lovely staff. The Hotel may be going through some upgrading, but that has never been an issue when we have stayed, and the evidence shows that the effort will be worthwhile. Cannot praise Flemings enough....a great play to stay in London, and staff that always look after you.",5,2015,12,14
144,Simply loved it,"I am writing this review from my hotel room here in Flemings.... I simply love every detail about this hotel....the location is really central, turn right to knightsbridge and High park walk left to  new bond st or piccadilly circus, cross green park right in front to Buckingham palace...I upgraded to a room with a street view and a spacious double one... But worth every penny... The housekeeping and concierge service r amazing.... The breakfast selection buffet of freshly baked breads, cheeses, fruits, juices, salmons...and the egg Benedict , or freshly made omelettes or pancakes  would fill you up till dinner...despite I am generally a freak, For the first time in my life... I would spare some time to stay in my room...and really enjoy it",5,2015,12,14
144,A few staff letting it down.,"Very happy initially with this hotel, location is great, green park tube is a 2 minute walk so very handy for getting around. We had a lovely room, no view but hey. 

Problem was we were woken on the saturday morning at around 07.15am by building works in the room adjoining us, I actually thought they were going to come through the wall it was so loud and the wall was vibrating when i put my hand to it. Ok, so these things happen but I wanted to raise the matter nonetheless. I spoke to a lady at reception after breakfast who firstly denied there were any building works going on (what??) and I went back to my room. Coming out of the lift I met a few guys in builders clothes and I followed them around by the stairs and surprise surprise they were working away....lots of them. Spoke to the same lady on the way out, still trying to deny their existance!! I said Ive seen them, they are there and if i was going to be woken early again could i move room. She said oh they won't be there on a sunday (these invisible builders who she was denying!!). Anyway, more fool me, I let it go and yes they were back on sunday but at a later time. It was just her attitude, I wish I had her name, she mad me so mad.

Waited almost 25 minutes to be seated for breakfast on the sunday morning (no problems on saturday). Again an idiot restaurant manger that felt it below him to clear tables was the problem. When we got second to the top of the queue we could see at least 2 free tables but he was just standing by doing nothing to move things along despite everyone in the queue complaining.

My husband raised the matter of the builders and a member of staffs attitude at checkout and we had a lovely apologetic girl who made up for the other girl somewhat. I know renovations have to happen but trying to deny what was going on and making people out to be stupid is not on.

Would have given a higher rating and stayed again if it wasn't for her but sorry, won't be back.",3,2015,12,10
144,"Excellent stay! Great location, wonderful service, trendy furnished rooms!","We fell in love in this hotel and its stuff, they were all very kind and friendly, happy to help with anything to make our stay better and they did! the rooms are a little small but comfortable. The location is great, 5 min walk to the tube station but we mostly walked as it is only 10-20 min to the other central areas. we will defiantly return to this fine, exclusive, luxury, beautiful hotel!",5,2015,12,08
144,Very quiet pleasant hotel with friendly staff,I stayed two nights at this hotel including one day when ill with a bad cold. The receptionist rang after my wife was concerned to see if they could help which was nice. The hotel was very convenient and the staff friendly and efficient. The breakfast was good,4,2015,12,07
144,"Peaceful, comfortable stay at Flemings.","I had the pleasure of staying six nights at Flemings Mayfair in October, along with my adult niece.  We had booked a two-twin room, but I would call the beds more like American double beds.  While our room was not huge, we had plenty of room for the two of us and the bathroom was incredibly spacious.  We were always greeted with friendliness and smiles.  There were a couple of mornings at breakfast where the staff seemed a little busy and therefore we felt a tad ignored, but overall we really loved the breakfasts - both the hot meals and the buffet offerings.  We didn't experience any noise problems that I've seen some people complain of and the wi-fi was always strong.  

Most of all, I can't say enough about how awesome the location is.  The Green Park tube station is so close.  Green Park itself is literally across the street and a straight walk over to Buckingham Palace.  We did a pretty equal amount of walking and tubing and found it all so easily accessible from Flemings.  We were sad to leave London and wished we had doubled the length of our stay.  

My niece and I both said that when we return to London we won't hesitate to stay at Flemings Mayfair and will heartily recommend it to any family and friends travelling to London!",4,2015,12,06
144,"Flemings, a gem of a hotel, off Piccadilly.","We were returning guests to Flemings, a 4* hotel well located, just a 3 minutes walk to Piccadilly and 5 to Green Park station. We appreciated the complimentary upgrade to an Executive room, which was spacious & very comfortable. It was also a nice touch to be welcomed by a bottle of Prosecco in an ice bucket, as a gesture by the hotel to celebrate my fiancée's birthday. We dined in the hotel on both nights of our stay and the food & service were both excellent. Particular mention should be made to Marina for her attention to detail, enjoyable conversation & faultless service. We also appreciated friendly & excellent service from other members of staff, namely Ciro, Milana & Farouk. Breakfast also excelled in both the choice & quality of food & service. It was a nice touch that Branca, the Guest Services Director came to talk to us at breakfast & made a point of checking that we had enjoyed our stay. She explained that there would be an extensive refurbishment programme in 2016, covering more of the bedrooms and the Restaurant. It was good value for money. Well done Flemings. We shall be back!",5,2015,12,06
144,Rooms too small for me!,"I know it's Mayfair and I know London is not cheap, but my room was really too small and even worse they are renovating some rooms on the 4th floor which will wake you up. Breakfast Buffet is good but not special. Service is friendly and efficient.",3,2015,11,24
144,"So disappointed, rude staff, shabby room, wouldn't return...","My husband did much research before booking this hotel and this seemed perfect for location and facilities. He booked it for my girlfriend and I for one night only and did so weeks in advance stating on the booking we required twin beds which I also rang to confirm. Upon arrival at the hotel the receptionist announced that the room we had booked wasn't available?!?! I was obviously pretty shocked as it wasn't a last minute booking, she said there wasn't a room with single beds available therefore suggesting we share a double bed, now we are friends but neither of us were prepared to do so! I asked how this could possibly be seeing as we had booked weeks before and also twice requested a twin room, at this she shuffled off to return with another member of staff who then in a very sarcastic rude manner kept saying, well madam it's subject to availability... No apologies at all. At this I said that I would under no circumstances would have booked the non-refundable room, she muttered something then said oh well we will have to upgrade you and made some phone calls for a room to be made up, this now meant I room wasn't ready so we had nowhere to freshen up after our journey. I asked when the room would be ready and she said she just didn't know...
Off we went very unimpressed expecting a lovely upgraded room on our return only to find a double room with two single beds pushed together into a double? We went on to find a large mat of hair from someone's hairbrush on the carpet and a extremely grotty bathroom, broken tiles, filthy grout, dirty vanity area. 
We were too cold and tired to do any more than go to sleep at this point.
The breakfast was good.
After breakfast we ventured upstairs and had a brief look around the floor below us which was absolutely stunning, newly painted, new carpets etc, nothing like the 2nd floor we were staying on! (See photos) If we had been upgraded as she had suggested I daren't think what our previous room was like, even worse?!?!
I mentioned all the above when asked how our stay was when we checked out, the member of staff smiled and apologised but it was almost as if he didn't care as we had already paid!
I looked at my original booking to see if it said subject to availability as she had told me but what it actually said was subject to pre-booking which I had done and also had rang to confirm.
I would not return to this hotel and would not recommend it due to the above 😏",1,2015,11,24
144,Amazing.........,"From the moment we entered the Hotel, I knew we were in for a great family weekend break.
All the staff in the hotel were friendly & courteous. The room was a refurbished one (225), on the front of the Hotel. A great room.
Comfy bed, & a lovely ambiance.
We dined on the first night in the restaurant downstairs. Great food & service.
Breakfast was plentiful. Lots to choose from.
Location wise, the Hotel is near Green Park Tube station, & Shepherds Market is just around the corner.
I judge hotels by Staff, as a good hotel with poor staff is not good, but a poor hotel with good staff helps.
Flemings is a great hotel, with great staff.
P.S - I saw no Prostitutes at all, as the previous reviewer seems to think there is there. If I had seen any, I would of whisked my family away from the Hotel.",5,2015,11,22
144,"Outstanding Hotel, Superb Breakfast","We were rewarded for taking the time to choose an independent hotel which on the night in question was charging little more than many of the so called ""budget"" hotels in the city. Everything about this hotel is just right. Great location, extremely good value and welcoming staff in all parts of the property. Breakfast was a particular highlight; it was clear that great care had been taken is selecting the finest quality ingredients which were accurately cooked and served with great charm. Congratulations.",5,2015,11,18
144,It's ok! ,"Quite disappointed with our room..very tired, worn carpets, chipped furniture.I was told on arrival that we had a coffee machine in our room but all we had were cheap instant coffee sachets ...I would've expected it to be much nicer...it was a birthday treat and I was a little disappointed. .. Breakfast and location were very good!  Staff were polite! It's a shame as I've heard such good things about it..and u was really looking foward to it.",3,2015,11,17
144,Very nice Afternoon Tea!,"I took my best friend to Flemings for afternoon tea today. We ate in the new drawing room which was very nicely decorated, the seats were really comfortable and we sat by the fire- very cosy! We got to choose from a choice of 13 teas and got topped up as and when we wanted more. The food consisted of sandwiches, scones and little cakes/pastries. The sandwiches were really light and tasteful. There were 4 different filling choices which gave great variety. Sometimes I find sandwiches in restaurants a bit dry but these were devine. The texture of the scones were great, really light and fluffy. There were two with sultanas in and two without which was good as my friend does not like raison/saltanus. The little cakes were also delicious, really danty- clearly a lot of effort had gone into them. We were very full at the end and asked to take a left over scone away with us!

The staff were great- the lady who served us was very attentive and explained everything well. 

It was not busy at all, however. To the extent that we found ourselves whispering at points because it was very quiet. I think it could have done with a little bit more atmosphere but some people might like there only being them and another table in a room.

Thanks Flemings!",4,2015,11,15
144,Beautiful hotel but.....,"I ve been to Flemings Mayfair for a third time and i can say that this time i was a bit dissapointed.The hotel is in a great location, close to a tube line where you can go anywhere from there, about 5 minutes walk from the hotel.The rooms are really nice and clean, the staff friendly and helpfull most of them at least but...

The first day we arrived, a girl from the reception escorted us to our room, and on her effort to be polite she kind of ask an inappropriate question which offend my friend and colleague, but we tried to look not offended.She probably didnt realise that it was a question not to be asked.Secondly they have some issues with the breakfast team, and to give an example, one of the days my friend had a breakfast meeting with a colleague from London and some from the staff where interrupting them several times during their meeting to ask them if they had finish with breakfast, and they felt that they were rushed to finish their breakfast and leave...not a good feeling..Later that morning i went down to have breakfast as well, and i ve notice that in most of the table there was always something missing from the tables like, a spoon, a plate, a fork, small details but as im in the tourism business its something that i dont like.Also when we orderd two omelets, despite the fact the breakfast room was not full, about 7-9 guests, we had to wait for  almost 25 minutes for them, and when they brought them, they took them to an other table next to us, the wrong one, eventually they realised their mistake and gave them back to us.Their team needs to work better together, they were not organized.Third issue, we were staying at the first floor, which had been renovated, and most of the time when we exit the elevator to go to our room, the corridor was really really cold.Probably because they were keep renovating the area to this floor...

Generally the hotel is nice, clean rooms, good location!",3,2015,11,14
144,Business trip,"Came to stay for a business trip last weekend. Lovely hotel and the service is excellent 5*s on service. It's in a great location, close to tube links and all the beautiful buildings eg the queens palace. Breakfast was average, not much choice. A strong 4 stars, would recommend!! ",4,2015,11,14
144,Nice Afternoon Tea,"My husband and I enjoyed a very pleasant Champagne afternoon tea in the elegant grill room at this hotel. It wasn't busy at all. Staff were pleasant and attentive and the food was nice. We had a selection of finger sandwiches, which we were offered more of, but we had started on our scones by then so we declined. There was a good selection of cakes. Tea was replenished on request. A slight distraction was that a waiter was standing folding napkins literally right behind where my husband was sitting for a lot of the time. Apart from this it was a very relaxed and enjoyable experience and we weren't rushed at all.",4,2015,11,13
144,Delights in centrally located Flemings hotel,"Although my upper-floor, interior room was small, it was tastefully decorated , and with all the needed amenities - including an umbrella!  and the daily newspaper delivered each morning.  The very pleasant staff could not have been more accommodating.  It is a joy to stay in a hotel where opposite the elevator is a stained glass window documenting the date of the building: 1731! A half-block walk takes one to Piccadilly, and Shepherds Market, with its varied restaurants having replaced antique shops, is steps away.",5,2015,11,11
144,Lovely Hotel in Perfect Location,"This is a stunning hotel with excellent staff, where nothing is too much trouble. Rooms are very comfortable and furnished with mini bar, honesty gin bar, tea and coffee making facilities.  Small details have been thought about to make your stay very special. Ideal location for restaurants and sightseeing. No need for expensive taxis as you can walk to so many places.  Would certainly recommend Flemings.",5,2015,11,10
144,Great location and standard,"Stayed for a weekend with my sister for her ""Bachelorette"" trip. Hotel was nice and clean and is located near the Green Park underground. We didn't have to change trains travelling to and from Heathrow; very easy. We had a beautiful room, enjoyed breakfast and cava and staff was friendly and helpful. We are familiar with the area from previous visits and we enjoyed the short walking distances to Soho, Regent Street and New Bond Street, to mention some. Afternoon champagne at the Ritz and dining at Hakkasan, both near by, are highly recommended. I would stay here again.",5,2015,11,09
144,Amazing place,"My wife and I arrived for a one night stay for my birthday ( our second visit this year ) on arrival the girl on the reception realised it was my birthday, she upgraded our room which was recently refurbished to an extremely high standard and within a couple of minutes of being in our room a member of staff knocked on the door with a card from the staff and a birthday cake !!
We would not even consider staying anywhere else now when we visit London.",5,2015,11,07
144,A pleasant overnight stay,"I stayed at Flemings overnight as had an early train to catch from Paddington the following morning. I was lucky enough to have been accommodated in one of the renovated rooms and it did not disappoint! The room had everything one might need: a comfortable bed, adequate adjustable lighting, various mod cons and etc. Fresh fruit on arrival was a pleasant surprise. The shower was very well-equipped and warm with additional heating. Overall the room felt very luxurious without being overbearing. A special thank you to staff who accommodated me at short-notice and went above and beyond to make sure I had a pleasant stay. It is unfortunate I only stayed one night and didn't get to experience this great hotel in full.",5,2015,11,05
144,Lovely Hotel Centrally Located with a Great Staff,"Stayed at Fleming for 3 nights beginning October 11, 2015. This is a very worthwhile 4 star hotel in an excellent location: just north of Green Park, surrounded by shops and restaurants in all price ranges and variety, and a 4-minute walk to the Green Park tube stop. The hotel has a very comfortable feel and is filled with fresh flowers. It has a very upscale feel yet is in no way intimidating or off-putting.The public rooms are nicely decorated and the service in all of them is warm and friendly. We arrived VERY early in the morning, well before our room was ready. We were offered storage of our luggage and free coffee prior to spending time seeing the city. Staff was exceptionally helpful and polite throughout our stay. They assisted with confirming reservations and other activities that we needed to complete. When we arrived back from sightseeing, our luggage was in our junior suite. The guest room was lovely: clean, very nicely decorated, quite comfortable in size (especially for London) with a separate sitting room and a small, private outdoor seating area (no view). The lighting (especially the bedside adjustable reading lights), amenities and good-sized bathroom make for a most enjoyable stay. A bowl of fresh fruit was on a table in the sitting room. The restaurant is nicely decorated and the service as well as the food was equally good. Full English Breakfasts included a buffet of cold items supplemented with items ordered off of a menu. All hot items we ordered were well prepared and very good. A ""study"" or drawing room near the front of the hotel served as a meeting place for small groups or individuals to have coffee, tea, or drinks throughout the day: very comfortable. I could not have asked for a more pleasant stay in London. Highly recommend Flemings.",5,2015,10,31
144,Super Afternoon Tea,"We met a close friend for afternoon and although we were early they served us a really good choice of teas and coffee, plus the traditional sandwiches, scones and cakes. They were very generous and topped everything up continually. We loved the newly refurbished tea lounge, with the beautiful trompe l'oeil paintings, which were outstanding. The service was very friendly and helpful, so much appreciated. The bill was quite high but we expected to pay Mayfair prices. Only quibble was the air con was turned up high, so although it was very mild outside, it was actually colder in the cafe. We took a look at our friends room, which was very attractively decorated with a gorgeous bathroom, plus a fur throw on the bed, which we thought would be a lovely treat. A great improvement on the old Flemings which was tired and scruffy.",4,2015,10,31
144,Good value hotel in a perfect position,"My recent one night stay at Flemmings was the second time I have stayed there and I was not disappointed. I had a single room that was well fitted out but I thought the grouting round the bath could have done with a better clean. As on my previous visit I found the staff to be first class and most helpful. The location of hotel close to Green Park subway station and the heart of London must makes this hotel one of the best value hotels in this area of London. The full English breakfast is, in all honesty, too much for one person but nonetheless one of the best I have had.",4,2015,10,28
144,Amazing!,"I absolutely love this hotel, it is a beautiful hotel with wonderful staff. I have stayed here a number of times with my boyfriend. The hotel looks lovely inside and the rooms have always had a boutique feel.",5,2015,10,24
144,Disappointing stay,"Myself and my sister booked a twin room several months in advance. On arrival we told only a double room available.  Not pleased accepted this but found the room was equipped with only one of everything ie 1 towel, 1 cup and saucer, 1 dressing gown etc. There was no apology from the manager and although extra items were placed in the room, a second cup and saucer was still missing.  It was obviously designed as a single room, it was small and dingy.  For the money it was very poor having stayed in hotels in London before and got a better standard room for the price and also better customer service.",2,2015,10,21
144,"Flemings ""Great Place""","Excellent location, good rooms, efficient and kind staff. Undergound is close and many restaurants around. Breakfast was good but slow service for the eggs. Most probably will stay again which has already happened several times.",5,2015,10,21
144,Returned  to Flemmings Mayfair again!,"Apart from the great location of the hotel, so near Bond street, Oxford street, Piccadilly, St. James's and so many other places, all within walking distance, just  a few minutes away, the main reason we stayed again with my wife at this beautiful design hotel in Mafair is the great hospitality extended to us  by every single member of the personnel and the great effort they made so that our stay was as  pleasant as possible. All staff are absolutely great but the concierge team really surprised us this time by the speed and the top quality service they offer when  arranging  bookings whether this is theatre tickets or a table at a restaurant or guidance as to where to go and see. They are absolutely fantastic and with this opportunity I thank them for their great service.",5,2015,10,20
144,Fabulous,"Great choice of hotel for a central London break - not only is the hotel itself beautiful, it is located in a quiet street, yet minutes' walk from Green Park, Shepherd's Market, Piccadilly etc.  Fantastic breakfast; wonderful staff (kind, attentive, friendly) - would highly recommend and will be back!",5,2015,10,19
144,Excellent all the way around!,This is a lovely hotel in a wonderful location.  The room (mini-suite) was fabulous! The staff was great! The only problem was having to leave....  Looking forward to returning again some day!  Construction during the day.,5,2015,10,14
144,"Great location, decent room but I have had better for the price","Location: if you are looking for Buckingham Palace etc then it gets no better than this

Checking in: the room was not ready until nearly 3pm which was a let down but they did upgrade me

Room: very good standard of bed and room size was great. The bathroom was a little tired and the shower not very good but overall I was happy with it. Very clean.

Staff: Very good on reception and everyone I spoke to was helpful. However 2 staff members had a very audible row at breakfast which was a little embarrassing for guests.

Food: The food on offer was great but the continental breakfast was no where near the standard of rivals for choice.

 Hotel generally : This is a very decent hotel. The checking in issue and breakfast experience were the only reasons I marked it down. I expect a room to be ready by 3pm especially when checking in is 2pm. I don't expect staff to row publicly. Breakfast choice could have been better.That said the hotel is very good and I would stay there again.",3,2015,10,14
144,Fabulous Mayfair gem,"Attention to detail encompasses your luxurious stay. Great location - steps to green park, Fortnum and mason, bond street, Piccadilly Circus and you can walk to oxford through the neighbourhood . Branca and her staff are fabulous. Book with breakfast if you can. The renovated bar off the lobby is a lovely place for tea or drinks to relax. ",5,2015,10,12
144,Damp smelling room with a mouldy bathroom,"I usually stay at the May Fair Hotel whilst I am in London but decided to stay in a ""boutique"" hotel for a change. Not a great idea.
I use booking.com to book as you don't pay when you book, I was surprised to be charged the full amount immediately upon booking (9 months in advance). 
The room was nicely decorated but it smelt damp, I found the source of the smell quickly as the grout in the shower area was mouldy, it was disgusting. The bathroom in general needed a complete update.
When checking in I was asked what newspaper I wanted and was amazed when I checked out to be charged for the paper.
The mini bar fridge wasn't cold.",3,2015,10,10
144,Discreet Luxury in Mayfair.,"Stayed here whilst hosting an evening welcoming a colleague from Greece. Booked direct and got a cracking price. The staff are amazing every one went out of their way to make my stay a great one. Classic hotel, plush and welcoming. Would definitely recommend. Superb location if eating in a restaurant in Mayfair 2 minutes from Green Park underground.",5,2015,10,05
144,Disappointing experience,"Stayed at the hotel 2 nights. We were surprised that our room was not at the main hotel building but rather two doors down in a building on third floor. There was no connection with the main hotel and one had to go out to access dining area, bar and reception desk. The carpet in the room was frayed and torn. Apparently each floor had one room and our elevator did not work twice. Surprisingly nothing was mentioned at the time of check in. Front desk was polite and concierge was helpful.",3,2015,10,04
144,Charming Hotel,Charming hotel in the heart of Mayfair. The rooms are small but cozy. Very good breakfast. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Within walking distance of good restaurants and various touristic sights.,4,2015,10,03
144,Great location and service,"Tenth visit in a year and even better. Stayed in one of the refurbished rooms. A great overnight stay. Staff are really helpful and friendly. Great location with lots of excellent restaurants nearby and only a few minutes walk to Green Park tube station.
",5,2015,10,03
144,WONDERFUL AFTERNOON TEA,"Went for a Chocoholic Afternoon Tea with Champagne yesterday, it was a birthday treat for my Mum. I have previously had dinner in the Grill Restaurant, which was lovely.
 
We were in The Grill Restaurant , decor is amazing. I cannot remember the names of the staff who looked after us (sorry), they were lovely and attentive from the moment we walked through the door, nothing was to much trouble. Lovely glass of champagne whilst we perused the tea menu , nice sandwiches, choc scone to die for, gorgeous cakes. They even brought out a small birthdays cake and sang to Mum. We had a wonderful time and would definately return for tea or dinner, I would thoroughly recommend this venue",5,2015,10,01
144,"Great location, luxurious rooms and friendly helpful staff","we had booked three rooms several months in advance for a group of girlfriends celebrating birthdays.  On arrival the hotel didn't have what we had booked available, but as they upgraded us to their beautiful jubilee suite, I won't be complaining!! The only issue was which two of us would put up with staying in the 'ordinary' room.   The beds were extremely comfortable and luxurious, the decor was beautiful throughout and the staff were on the whole attentive, friendly and helpful.   There were a couple of small issues; they need to keep on top of the mildew in the bathrooms, this was obviously a result of damp, the bathrooms had all been thoroughly  cleaned but mildew marks are a bit off putting and not what you expect in a hotel of this standard.  We had breakfast included and opinions were divided, only two of our group do not have a background in catering so not the easiest bunch to please. We had to ask several times before we were given lemon to accompany tea, the tea was pretty much finished before the lemon arrived.  The muesli ( I think homemade) was delicious, the cooked breakfast was made with good quality ingredients (with the exception of the sausage) and was well presented but wasn't warm enough by the time it was served.  The toast was, like most hotels, soft and underdone just coming to pieces when it was buttered.",4,2015,09,29
144,Cement Mixer!,"We booked the Flemings a few months prior to arriving.  We were not informed of the building works the hotel is currently having done.  On arrival we were shown to our room.  I was expecting great things as most reviews are really good, and of course, it is not cheap.  We were shown to a room which was obviously straight out of the 70's!  It was dreadful.  But, worse than this, the smell of wet cement was overpowering.  When I looked out along the coridoor, the room right next door to us was a building site, with cement mixer right in the middle.  I went down to reception and simply said, that room is not acceptable and I would like to be moved.  The receptionist said she would move us but not until later in the afternoon.  This was ok, as we went out and did the toursity bit in London.  We came back around 6 p.m. and were show to a beautiful room on the ground floor.  It had just been refurbished.  I did wonder why we had not been given this room first and would have avoided the dissapointment the the first awful room.  If I were you, when booking I would insist on a newly refurbished room.  My son was also staying with us and he had his own single room.  This was not very pleasent either.  The shower cubicle was awful with black mould in all the grout.  Would I stay at the Flemings again?  No.  I would book elsewhere.",3,2015,09,28
144,Perfect stay in Lonodon,"My partner and me stayed at Fleming Mayfair four nights from Tuesday to Saturday. Upon arrival we were greeted with friendly efficiency and warmth. The hotel is situated close by Piccadilly and Green Park, with the subway station with the same name, only minutes away. Although Piccadilly has intense traffic, you hardly noticed it.

The hotel itself is originally tree different buildings witch makes the floor levels inside a little bit challenging if you are handicapped in any way, because the houses has different high and size. But it is also very charming. 

We hade a Classic Double room and it was a small room, with a small bathroom. However the layout of the room and bathroom was such as it worked very well. 
The bed was very comfortable. There was a desk with lots of power outlets, an armchair, and a big flat screen TV and AC. One of the best things was the free Wi-Fi that hade good bandwidth. 

The restaurant and breakfast room were situated in the basement without any windows. It was a bit chilly, and I don’t know if there was a problem with the heating or it was suppose to be that way. We had the continental breakfast and it was very nice with lots of things to choose from, toast was included. 

Our overall impression was that Flemings Mayfair is a perfect place to stay at. The staffs were very friendly and helpful with everything. Checking in and out was quick and efficient, and we could not have been asking for anything more. We will definitely be back and can recommend this hotel for a comfortable London visit.",5,2015,09,27
144,"Cozy boutique hotel, great location","Our recent trip to London began at the Flemings Mayfair. This SLH (Small Luxury Hotel) property was a pleasant, comfortable hotel for our three night stay. Close to Green Park, Hyde Park, Buckingham Palace, shopping, museums and great restaurants. Cozy, but comfortable, nicely decorated and clean. Bed very comfortable and bathroom well appointed and a good size. 
Small fitness room which was a nice feature for stretching and a brief workout prior to our morning runs. For runners, this hotel is in the perfect location close to many parks. Breakfast in downstairs restaurant was good - both hot and cold food and as it was my first experience with a typical English breakfast, certainly way more food than expected. Service from all staff excellent. Concierge service was well informed and had some helpful tips for getting around, things to do. ",4,2015,09,26
144,Comfortable convenient and quiet,Room was quite small but more than adequate for single person for 1 night.  Bathroom clean and lighting very good!  Staff were very friendly and helpful.  Bar food and restaurant menu a bit limited on choice but quality was good. Location is in my view fabulous - but I love that part of London,5,2015,09,24
144,Expected More!,"For a hotel that describes itself as luxury boutique I was very disappointed. I stayed in what I can only describe as a cupboard. This is definitely the smallest room I have ever stayed in, even for London! The room was on the 3rd floor tucked away at the end of a corridor. There was no bedside table, the shower did not work properly, there was a bath robe but it was very old and slightly discoloured. The room was very hot so had to have the air con on, which was very noisy. For the price paid there are better places to stay in London.",3,2015,09,23
144,Classy on all levels.,"Extremely happy we choose this hotel. The staff in the Drawing room were very friendly and attentive to our needs. The concierge Andrew was super helpful. We loved our newly decorated room, so spacious. Thank you to all concerned who made a great effort to make us feel welcome. Home from home.  ",5,2015,09,23
144,Weekend in London. ,"Good boutique hotel in Mayfair. Location really good for all the touristy spots...the palace, the parks, harrods, the national gallery all within a short walking distance. The rooms are a tad small but nice. 
The staff are very helpful and polite. Didn't dine at the hotel just had breakfast there which was good both days.",4,2015,09,22
144,London paradise for 8 nights ,"Wow, what a fantastic stay! This hotel is situated on a quiet street in the center of London, just 5 minutes walk to Buckingham Palace. Hotel is very well kept and we absolutely loved the new rooms. We usually don't post online about the trips that we take, but this stay was just exceptional! 
We will definitely be back soon, probably to do some Christmas shopping! 

Oh and a little advice: ask for first floor rooms. We had room 128 and our friends 126. ",5,2015,09,22
144,"Nice enough, but lacking polish","The reception and door staff at Flemings Mayfair are exceptional and were a pleasure to deal with. However, whilst the hotel is very pleasant, I don't think it falls into the ""exceptional"" category. 

Check-in was painfully slow, and many of the bedrooms are absolutely tiny (would be uncomfortable with two people in the room). 

The bar serves excellent cocktails. ",3,2015,09,19
144,Wonderful visit!,"Four of us stayed at the Flemings on Half Moon for three nights the first part of September.  The hotel was picked because of the location but we are happy to say it was a wonderful stay all the way around.  We felt safe and secure the entire time.  The staff was great from Nadia, Pedidro, everyone made it a joy filled experience.  The rooms were fresh and clean.  The beds were very comfortable. I was surprised how big the bathroom was.  Thank you Flemings!",5,2015,09,17
144,Disappointment on our second visit,"The first time we stayed here two years ago, we had a fabulous experience.  This time things have changed.  We requested a quiet room and ended up in a room over the entrance way.  The room was dated and awaiting renovation (as there were renovations going on down the hallway).  After my husband mentioned this, they said they would take care of everything and switch us to a very quiet room.  When we came back from our day out they had put us directly above the renovations which was much much louder.  I then went back down to the front desk and insisted we be moved.  It wasn't the most cooperative experience but we ended up moved.  We were then told by the manager that for our trouble they were going to send us up cupcakes which did not ever appear.  Even though the new room was supposed to be an updated room, it was basically new wallpaper on the walls and/or a fresh coat of paint.  Otherwise the grout around the tub looked the same, the furniture looked the same and the windows were still not soundproofed.  For the equivalent of $500 Canadian this was not the service we were expecting.",1,2015,09,15
144,Fabulous in every way,"Stayed here with my sister and mother for her 80 th birthday.  The staff were all so kind and accommodating in every way nothing was too much trouble, they even arranged a beautiful birthday cake on the house which was totally unexpected. The room was clean, well decorated, a good size with comfy beds.  The hotel is well located a five minute walk from Green Park tube and ten minutes from Buckingham Palace.  Breakfast was great, so much to choose from.  A great stay and can't wait to return with my hubby.",5,2015,09,14
144,"Nice hotel, Great location, Strange service charge.","My wife & I stayed at Flemings hotel on Saturday night for the first time, we normally stay in the Hilton across the road when we want to be in this part of town, but thought we’d stay here for a change. The hotel is in a great location, just off Piccadilly and a five minute walk from Green Park tube station. Initial impressions were very good, doorman, bellboy and reception staff all very welcoming and friendly and the lobby is stylishly decorated.
We had a standard double room on the 2nd floor; the room was nicely decorated and the bed was very comfortable. The bathroom was pretty small, but big enough. Although not noticeable during normal use, the ceiling was quite low; this meant that I couldn’t stand under the shower as I’m quite tall. If you are of normal proportions this won’t be a problem. The room had all the usual bits and pieces with complimentary tea, coffee and water, decent TV, iPod dock. We did hear the odd bump from neighbouring rooms and the corridor, but nothing out of the norm. 
Turn-down service came to our room at a funny time; it must have been between 5:00 – 5:30 and we were still getting ready to go out; seemed a bit strange, but not exactly the end of the world.
We both had a good night’s sleep, the bed was very comfortable and we weren’t disturbed at all. 
Breakfast was served in the restaurant on the lower ground room; this means that it is quite dark; it’s also a bit cramped to be honest. There is a buffet for cereals, cheeses, fruit, yoghurt and juices; cooked items are done to order. Although the breakfast, when it arrived, was very nice, we had to wait 45 minutes for it to arrive. This is far too long for breakfast when you normally want to be getting out and doing something. Although we didn’t complain, we overheard a few other people on different tables complaining about not receiving their tea and coffee, apparently they had run out of tea pots… I didn’t hear the reason for the lack of espresso for our Dutch neighbours.
Checkout – I found this very strange. I had pre-paid for our room on booking, that included our breakfast and we didn’t incur any other charges while in the hotel, dinner and drinks were all taken at other establishments. So while checking out the receptionist told me that I had nothing to pay, but informed me that they normally charge guests £5 for service. I asked her what service, she said, “Just general service, but you don’t have to pay it”. Now I don’t know if it was because I had just spent so long waiting for my breakfast, but I found this quite offensive. I tipped the people who provided service to me that I deemed worthy of a tip, do I need to start tipping the reception staff too? I opted not to pay the £5 service charge but she didn't seem particularly happy and made me feel a bit uncomfortable.
The concierge kindly looked after our bag and coats while we went and did a bit of shopping before heading home. He received a tip.
I actually felt disappointed when I left the hotel that our stay had been spoilt by two silly things. Up until our breakfast experience I wouldn't have hesitated to recommend this hotel and would definitely have used it again myself (room service for breakfast!). However, the mysterious demand for £5 upon checkout left a bad taste in my mouth. I have stayed in many hotels over the years but have never heard of such a charge. It has certainly spoilt this hotel for me.",3,2015,09,14
144,Beautiful Boutique Hotel,"Lovely SLH hotel, charming reception, my partner and I stayed 1 night in Deluxe room, recently refurbished to impeccable standard. Top breakfast and by London 5 star hotel standards good value for money. Was not aware of any building noise as mentioned in other reviews. Excellent location 3 minute walk from green park tube and great for Piccadilly / Old Bond Street shopping! Highly recommended our new favourite place to stay in London which doesn't cost the earth!
",5,2015,09,12
144,Great boutique hotel,"This hotel was recommended by our travel agent who got a great Australian package for us which included breakfast, upgrade, Internet and transport to and from the airport.
The location is in rich suburb of Mayfair. It is very close to train station, 7 min walk to Buckingham palace and or Hyde park. It was about 10-15 min walk to Oxford and regent street for shopping and self ridges department stores. Very close to a lot of good restaurants, and few small supermarkets. 
The room was very spacious, serviced twice a day. It was a little noisy during the day due to construction on the next street but it seemed like construction was everywhere in London at the moment. Very quite at night.Breakfast was good with hot breakfast cooked to order.
Great hotel away from tourist hustle and bustle but still close enough to walk everywhere",4,2015,09,10
144,"Really good location, helpful staff","This was our 2nd hotel in London. 
Our previous stay was in Kensington's Crowne Plaza near the Gloucester Road station.
I popped by via the Tube to check if the room was ready at 11am but was told to come back at 2pm. Front desk (forgot her name) was nice enough to let me clear the paperwork on my hubby's behalf. However, when we came back at 1pm, we were told that the room was ready and also that we had been upgraded. Pleasant start to a great stay.
We were given a bigger room (smaller than the loft at Crowne Plaza, this is Mayfair after all) than expected and thankfully because of all the luggage we had. We could hear the ongoing renovation works occasionally but it was always in the day and not loud at all.
Tried room service once, and as it was late, the bread stated in the menu was not available and the staff was really accommodating, trying his best to offer something to please me, just over a sandwich..even personally delivered it and explained everything!

We had originally booked for 2 nights but because I hadn't been feeling well for our long European trip due to allergies, my husband suggested that we should try to see if we could extend the last few days.. I popped by the front desk and they were super nice to let us check on our airline availability and said they could hold our room whilst we did some rearrangements. 
Since the room was so good (very comfortable bed and nice-sized bathroom), we decided to continue with the ""expensive"" (since we were upgraded) choice. Guess it was to the hotel's benefit for upgrading us in the first place!
Loved the location.. The Original Tour Hop On Hop Off Bus was about 5 min walk from our hotel (we took a 48 hour package). Walked to Nobu Mayfair (not Berkeley), Selfridges (about 25min), Brown's Hotel for afternoon tea, Shepherd's Market (not a market per se but an enclave of shops, restaurants - Le Boudin Blanc, cafes, pharmacy, dry cleaner - Sole Man was cheap for laundry) and had a fantastic meal at Burger & Lobster. 
The nearest Tube station is Green Park which can be a maze by itself. Marks and Spencers Food is just above this station so we bought additional mineral water from here. 
Lots of breakfast cafes nearby.. My favourite pit stop? Pret A Manger.
We also took a Tube ride to Shepherd's Bush station for Westfield shopping mall (spend at least half a day there, munch at Jamie Oliver's). Easier to shop in this airconed mall than at Oxford or Regent Streets.
We look forward to coming back. 

The ONLY thing I hated about our stay: the sole lift. Really. Just ONE lift and it was SLOW and kinda cramped.

144,Nice afternoon tea,Went for an afternoon tea with my husband and enjoyed the experience very much. We had to wait quite a long time to be served but the waitress came at several occasions to apologise for the delay and offered us a complimentary drink. Nice surroundings and friendly staff .,4,2015,09,09
144,Thank you Ryan,"Hats off to the personnel of FLEMINGS, and especially to Ryan, the concierge. He's been very helpful to me. I'll certainly come back because of the quality of service, the charm of the hotel - very British indeed - and the great location.",4,2015,09,09
144,I arrived early. Naturally my room was not ready. Your front desk and drawing room staff were very gracious and made me,"The room 303, was fine and comfortable. Although the hall ways are claustrophobic and narrow. Not very attractive as it looks as though too many rooms have been squeezed in. Decoration is a mixture of over coloured, unsubtle colours and design.",3,2015,09,05
144,Luxurious afternoon tea! ,"I have been to Flemings Hotel Mayfair on two separate occasions for afternoon tea; my first time was with friends to experience the chocoholics afternoon tea party which was absolutely amazing as I certainly love anything chocolate and a couple of glasses of champagne! 

The second time I decided to experience the traditional afternoon tea party with a glass of champagne with all the girls in my family and just like the chocoholics afternoon tea party, it was also very divine! 

The portions are generous and you get to try a variety of different savoury and sweets, there is a large tea menu which gives you allot of choice and the staff are so friendly and helpful! 

Overall, i have thoroughly enjoyed myself on both occasions and will definitely be returning once again! Thankyou to all the staff at Flemings Mayfair :)  ",5,2015,09,04
144,Endless Night,"I have stayed at Flemings now twice in the last three weeks and I'm not sure I'll go back to be honest. Whilst the staff are terribly nice and very efficient, the hotel is in the midst of a major refurbishment. The first time I stayed my room was on the first floor and because of the refurb, you had to take the lift to get to floor one. The carpet was still covered in protective plastic and 9 times out of 10, I had to dodge builders and workmen in the corridor.  There was dust everywhere.  On that occasion, the room was fine.

I then stayed earlier this week for one night and had specified at the time of booking that I did not want to be on the first floor, and I was therefore in a room on the third.  Sadly, however, my room was right next to the lift shaft and I was kept awake virtually all night by the whirring and machinations of the lift.  Additionally, someone either next door or in the room above had a shower and the walls and/or ceilings are so paper thin, it was as though I was in the bathroom with them.  Finally, the builders kicked off at just gone 8.30am.  All in all, it was not a relaxing stay.",3,2015,09,04
144,Caution:  Under Construction,"Extremely noisy hotel.  Under construction and they don't tell you.  Noises are so loud that the rooms shake.  Starts at 0800 and ends around 1730.  If you are looking for a place to relax during the day, forget about it.  Worst experience I have had in many years and stay 75 nights a year in hotels.  Not worth the price they charge at all.  Staff at front door very friendly, but does not make up for poor quality room.  The breakfast is marginal.",1,2015,09,04
144,Loved everything about it!!,"First of all, a lot of people have complained about noise from construction near this hotel and having just stayed there, I can confidently say that we did not hear any and we were right across the street from it.  This is a fabulous hotel in a great location.  It is on a quiet street right around the corner from Green Park and the Green Park tube stop which has three lines that stop there.  You can also walk to Buckingham Palace, Picadilly Circus and Fortnum and Mason.  The room we had was beautiful and very spacious.  Everyone who worked there was friendly and helpful.  I highly recommend Flemings and will DEFINITELY stay there again the next time I am in London.",5,2015,09,01
144,Lovely oasis,"Stayed here with my daughter for the weekend staff helpful and friendly. Our room was newly refurbished was small but lovely although most city hotel rooms are small,the only complaint I have is the one mirror which is in the bathroom so you can't see to dry or straighten your hair that isn't great. Had afternoon tea it was very good, my daughter is vegetarian and the chef made up some lovely unusual fills not just egg mayo. In great location quiet but close to everywhere with green park tube station just around the corner. Will defiantly stay here again",5,2015,09,01
144,"Staff Great, Poor Quality Room","Our initial impression of the hotel was great, good foyer, nice staff and in an ideal area. However despite paying extra for our room it was dark, dingy with horrid brown wallpaper, and very small. The was only just room to walk around the bed. My room was definitely not worth £280 per night.....  The breakfast was not too bad but if you go for the smoked fish, ask not to have it in a bowl swimming in butter/oil. Kippers and haddock are greasy enough without adding extra. The other thing and probably one of my biggest dislikes was that on checkout I was presented with a bill that included amounts over the amount I had signed for at meals and other charges. The over charge for meals together with a 'booking charge', also secretly added, was swiftly removed from my bill but did leave me feeling not good about the whole place. I did like the staff I met whilst staying, they were very helpful without being intrusive and very friendly also.",2,2015,09,01
144,Quiet discreet comfortable CENTRAL luxury boutique hotel,"A much anticipated stay with a very sexy man, and with naughty adventures planned, I arrived before him and had to wait in the uninspiring foyer for his arrival.  At least they gave me some water to drink whilst I waited... but he was unhappy that they hadn't offered to call him to check that it was ok to give me the room key in his absence!

Our fifth floor room was nice enough although as usual for a central London hotel, it was small.  The quirky decor was interesting - but it closed the room in, making it feel less spacious.  There was a minibar in the room (rare these days), and also complimentary bottled water etc.  The bathroom was very bright and had a window - again a rarity!  Everywhere was absolutely spotless.  

The bed was very comfortable and was put to good use of course... in more ways than one!

We enjoyed our time in the cocktail bar.... it's colourful, arty and sexy, and the gorgeous French barman served us brilliantly and made us feel special.  With our drinks, he bought a fabulous array of nibbles and canapés, which even included some strawberries, all beautifully served.

Breakfast was excellent, we had the continental buffet and it was perfectly delicious although there were also some tempting hot dishes on offer too.  The dining room was at basement level though, and windowless, thus hiding the day's glorious sunshine, but we were soon to head out and enjoy the day anyway.

This upmarket boutique hotel is brilliantly situated in a quiet Mayfair street immediately off Piccadilly, with easy metered parking right outside, and in walking distance of pretty much everywhere you might want to get to in the West End.  

In summary, a hotel that ticks all the boxes without necessarily having a wow factor... If you're looking for a comfortable, quiet, discreet hotel in a fantastic location, though, Flemings certainly delivers... and the upgraded rooms look brighter and more spacious.

I loved my time spent in this hotel... a huge thank you to my gorgeous man x x x",4,2015,08,31
144,Quirky hotel central but small rooms ,"Stayed In the hotel for 4 nights on a business trip . Overall the hotel is clean , quirky fittings to go with the boutique theme.

Only issues I had were 

If you take a single room expect to live on your bed the entire time as there is no room to walk around at all , there is a desk however not functional in terms of space to do any work on your laptop .
And if you need to use the iron it's best everything is ironed pre visit as you will struggle to use the ironing board which must be plugged inside the cupboard .

- most mornings at 8am I was subject to the chisel drill and banging of hammers due to construction on the lower floors , forcing you to wake up and go out , this would have been fine if the website had advertised this or a discount was applied accordingly .

- breakfast was good however the staff can be a little disorganized in the morning and appear to give preferential treatment to one guest over another which varies depending which morning you go 

- electricity to the room was cut off mid morning shower before going to a client meeting , although it was resolved upon my return in the evening 

Fantastic location to london , and generally the staff are very kind , welcoming and accommodating ",3,2015,08,29
144,Appropriate ,"Stayed for one night with my partner whilst I was on a business trip. Excellent service overall, clean and centrally situated. Room was rather small though. Would have enjoyed it if it was more spacious. Very central London location though which is definitely a plus.",4,2015,08,29
144,Good hotel in the heart of London,"Good location, right in the center of London - very convenient if you want to do sightseeing and prefer to walk. I would specially notice good breakfast and nice choice for lunch and supper ( quite good sole and sea bream) and impressive choice of wines. Special thanks to all personnel. 
From negative points I would mention , that some rooms are facing inner yard where ventilation fans are installed - it is extremely noisy and almost impossible to keep windows open .",4,2015,08,27
144,I like staying here,"The location is great - quiet but very central. I stayed in room 313 which does not have a view but this did not bother me. The bed and pillows were really comfortable and everywhere was very clean. As a single traveller I always feel safe and relaxed. I like that I can get room service if I don't want to go out. The staff are helpful and the service is good, it feels much nicer than an impersonal large hotel.",5,2015,08,25
144,"Great night, couldn't be better","Went in Flemings Hotel in Mayfair on Sunday night. The receptionist was so kind and efficient. We started in the drawing room for a quick drink before dinner. Next we moved in the restaurant, we had a bottle of champagne as aperitif. The starters presentation was just perfect and the taste indescribable, main courses arrived perfectly on time and were absolutely delicious and tasty. Wine selection on the list is great and our choice was a 2012 Syrah from California, fabulous with the main courses. One chocolate desert to share to complete this delight meal. After dinner we moved in our room and the new refurbishment is completely beautiful, high quality and so comfortable. Was a great experience and I'll definitely come back soon.",5,2015,08,25
144,Great location and Service,"We booked a 2bedroom 2 bath apartment through Lisa Duncan(awesome broker) and loved every minute of the week we stayed at the Fleming. It is centrally located in the Mayfair section of London and allows you to walk to dozens of restaurants, bars and the shopping of Bond Street",5,2015,08,18
144,Nice hotel but several disappointments,"This hotel came recommended to us by friends and by our travel agent. When we checked out recently we were more pleased than disgruntled but expected better.

The service, breakfast, and location were lovely. Our complaints are threefold; we had requested two beds upon booking and were given one bed with a roll away! This was not ideal for two women in their 50s and had we known we would have booked elsewhere. It made our stay less comfortable than promised. 

Secondly we were at the end of the hall (room 230) where the construction was happening which led to noise and dust in our room. We should have been informed about the construction and the construction schedule.

In addition when we asked while checking in about using the phone in our room and we were told there would be a small fee. We were shocked when we checked out to see an eleven minute phone call to me niece cost 32.5 pounds! This exorbitant fee should be explained in detail when asked about the phone use. In a hotel  in the United States a local call is free. 

Upon checking out we were asked about our stay. We shared the positives and the concerns stated above. The staff person we checked out with offered to take off the tips from each day but we didn't accept that since it would take away the tips from all of the people that were helpful to us. It wasn't their fault we did not get two beds, were close to constructions and were not informed about the phone fee. She then offered to reduce our bill by ten pounds to compensate us. We accepted only because our taxi was waiting and the meter was running. It was kind of her but left us feeling very dissatisfied. We look forward to hearing from you about our issues.",3,2015,08,18
144,Afternoon tea lovely,We had champagne afternoon tea and the sandwiches and cakes were very nice. We also stayed overnight rooms nice and clean and staff very friendly.  Not far from Buckingham place and Hyde park good location for shopping along regent street and oxford street. ,5,2015,08,16
144,A Gem!.. that needs polishing ,"What a historical gem of a hotel hidden in the narrow streets of Mayfair. When the car pulls up and the doorman with his black suit and hat walks up you feel like you are walking into a classic movie. But.

This gem has is its surprises when it comes to disappointments. I have heard of the renovated rooms but did not know how to book them. They were not on the category of room bookings. But the room furniture I was in was not to old. The bathroom was not in a terrible state either. It's just the size of the room that was a problem. But I was to excited for it to bother me. 

The service was as expected from this small gem. Yet I was not satisfied with the check in process .. Neither was I with the check out. In both incidents the guest relations managed to get me a little upset. They r trying hard but it seems like they have to always go back to the manager and check if they can do this or that. Got me frustrated at a point. 

Again I really can't say I'm utterly satisfied .. Nor can I say that I'm disappointed to the no return. I might give this gem another chance and visit one more time.   ",3,2015,08,15
144,interesting boutique hotel,We recently stayed at the Flemings Mayfair.  It was warm in London and one reason I booked the Flemings was that it had airconditioning.  It does have ac and it works ok.  We did ask if we could have just a sheet to cover us up instead of the comforter but that never happened.  The room is tiny. Its very clean.  The whole place is spotless.  The batroom needs some tlc. The deco tile was at one time painted to update the bath.  The paint has peeled off in several spots. The grout needs tending to. Room 316 has a lovely view of a construction area area that  was never cleaned. And it appears to be a conglomeration of where several buildings meet. A dark and kind of  scary looking place! Not being able to open the blinds makes a tiny room very claustrophobic.  Our last night we went to bed early -we were leaving early to head to Nice.  Our lovely neigbors across the hall proceeded to have a VERY loud argument and slammed their door at least a dozen times from 10 till 2 am.  Needless to say we were very tired and mentioned it to the night clerk and he just shook his head.   The location is ok but indoubt I would stay there again.,4,2015,08,14
144,spacious apartments in a great location,"we stayed for the first time at Flemings on the recommendation of our travel agent.  we stayed in the 2 bedroom apartment which was absolutely fantastic.  it felt like a home rather than a hotel.  the apartment was two floors, the bottom floor housed the two bedrooms and an outdoor patio and the upper floor housed the kitchen, dining area and very spacious living room.  the apartment also had a washer/dryer (incidentally it broke but the hotel did all of our laundry for free!).  we had complete access to all of the hotel amenities (gym, etc).  the location in Mayfair is unparalled for access to Hyde park, St. James park and Green park and in walking distance to the underground, many museums, shopping, restaurants, etc.  the hotel is also situated on a quiet side street.  the staff was extremely hospitable and attempted to help in any way they could (and did!).  The concierge(s) were very helpful re restaurants, guides, logistics etc.  Overall, a fantastic experience for my family.",5,2015,08,14
144,Downgraded and disappointed,"Despite having the reservation confirmed and an email sent a week later with the room details as requested, we were Downgraded 4 days before arrival from apartment to studio. I had paid the full amount up front so that was annoying .I would have been ok if staying without children but since I wanted a separate sleeping area for the 2 kids, this meant my stay was much less comfortable than I had hoped. The hotel did compensate and apologise but it's not what i expect. I could have cancelled completely but with only 4 days to go, all the options that were available when I booked at other hotels were no longer there. 

Good service from the staff but there were lots of small details that made me realise why this hotel is not quite 5 star. The TVs were temperamental and had to be fixed but then afterwards the air con in one part of the room didn't work, there were loud running water noises in the evening, the sound proofing on the room door was non existent, room allocated for a family of 4 with 2 small children had no bath, cooked breakfast on first day took over 30 minutes so we ended up leaving and the staff were very defensive about it (it was scrambled eggs which were not made to order!). 

No serious complaints but with the downgrade and the small details, it made for an unsatisfactory stay. The staff were all very nice (apart from the defensiveness of the breakfast incident) but that's the minimum one should expect from a £500+ per night hotel. A shame really as the place has great potential. They have done a lot of renovating and modernising so I think they are trying to take the place in the right direction. ",3,2015,08,10
144,Nice hotel. Small rooms and apartments. Expensive,"I've stayed at this hotel twice already and each time pay the bill feeling stung. London hotel prices are famously inflated and Flemings is no exception. Renting an apartment with my family promised enough room in which to relax, but not being able to get out of bed without touching the wall or the window and finding it difficult to dry oneself in the bathroom without hitting the wall or the door suggest that these facilities would be best relocated to Lilliput.
The food is good and service is OK, if one counts the numerous young male besuited employees loitering in the lobby as indicative of the service level.
When we visited we had the extra treat of witnessing at very close quarters the construction of a new building opposite, providing my youngsters with a free education into concrete mixers, rebar deliveries and road closures.
All in all, exceptional only in mediocrity. Not terrible, but nothing special either.",3,2015,08,10
144,Very comfortable stay in great location!,"The Fleming just off of Green Park provides me all I need when I come for business. A very comfortable single room, beautiful bathroom, with shower and bath and incredibly large and fluffy towels. Free wifi, cable TV with many channels and minibar small refrigerator. And best of all is the location. A block from Shephards Market and many affordable restaurants. The Green Park tube station with three lines and quick access to all of London, and a short walk on Picadilly to Picadilly Circus, Coventry Gardens, shows.",5,2015,08,09
144,Disappointing,"Check-in was a disaster as I was given the wrong room number. Someone else was already in the room! That was quite a shocking welcome. I have other complaints too but have addressed them to the hotel and it would be unfair to air them all here. Now for the good -- location is very convenient. Just off Piccadilly and Green Park. Our room was cozy. Beds comfortable. If you like quirky old buildings with lots of stairs going up and down here and there, then you'll like this.",3,2015,08,03
144,Dinner at The Grill in the Flemings Hotel Mayfair,Lovely hotel staff were very polite and attentive. The food at the grill was excellent and even though we had a Groupon offer we were still given full choice of the menu unlike other reviewers of this package. The staff were very accommodating and there was no long wait between courses.  Good value for money excellent food and wine - would definitely go again,5,2015,08,01
144,Loved It!,"Stayed at the hotel twice during my visit to the UK.  Lovely boutique hotel with attentive and friendly staff.  Absolutely fabulous position in London with most attractions within walking distance. The first room was an Executive Double which although smallish, included everything we needed.  Nice big bed with lovely modern decor and clean bathroom.  Currently there is refurbishment work being carried out on the lower floor of the hotel and construction work being carried out next door but to be fair this is only evident during the day and not at all during the night.  Our first room was near the lift which could be heard if we were in our room and our air-con was somewhat noisy when used.  On our return the following week, we were upgraded to a Junior Suite next door which was fabulous.  Huge room, great bathroom and very private.  Again, large comfortable bed with good linen.  Breakfast was included during both stays which offered lots of choices.  We used the bar area once which was quiet with nice staff.  There is also a couple of supermarkets close by and Shepherd's Market is just around the corner which is full of great restaurants and pubs.  They also allowed us to store some luggage at no extra cost in between visits to the hotel which was most helpful.

We loved our stay at Flemings Mayfair and would definitely return when in London again.",5,2015,07,31
144,4 days,1st night my 17 yr old son & I had to almost sleep in the same bed!  No available rooms w 2 beds. No room for a roll away bed either. I insisted and was about to leave to find another hotel when they finally moved our room to another one that just had become available w 2 lite beds. It was tough though. Didn't like the construction noise going on the entire time. The staff was extremely helpful & did resolve our room situation. Would stay there again as long as we have 2 beds & big room. ,4,2015,07,27
144,Champagne Afternoon Tea,"My friend and I decided to treat ourselves to some champagne afternoon tea, seeing we both still hadn't experienced it yet, so we both headed straight to Groupon and came across the Flemings offer.

We were very impressed by the décor and style of the hotel and its impressive interior, it really is a stunning unique hotel. 

All the staff are very attentive and polite, so we were quickly seen to and shown to our table.  We went on a Saturday lunchtime, so expected it to be busy, as it was, but this didn't effect the service we received at all.  The selection of tea and food was just right, not too much and not too little.  

Afterwards we decided we would treat ourselves to an 'expensive' cocktail, so opted for a champagne based one, but to our disappointment, all they really tasted of, was champagne.  They still went down just as nice, but I think we expected a bit more to it seeing they were £14 each. 

A fantastic afternoon tea experience in a beautiful hotel with great staff.  Highly recommend.",5,2015,07,27
144,Afternoon Tea,"Went here for Afternoon Tea about a week ago. Booked this through Groupon and the service was good. 
Selection of sandwiches, cakes and scones with jam and clotted cream. The Macaroons weren't nice! 
We then went to the bar to have some cocktails, we got champagne based cocktails and to be honest that's all you could taste not the flavours we asked for.
All in all nice day out and something different to do.

If you book through Groupon you just pay a £6.50 service charge once you have finished your afternoon.",4,2015,07,27
144,wonderful week a Flemings!,"Just back from a week in London, where we stayed at Flemings in a one bedroom apartment.  It was a wonderful experience- the staff are exceptionally helpful and courteous, and the apartment totally first-rate.  Recently renovated with many tasteful and helpful amenities, super comfy bed, and very quiet.  We hope to return one day!",5,2015,07,24
144,Elevated standard in prime location!,"Upon my return to Flemings Mayfair I was amazed how much the refurbishment of the rooms have elevated the already luxurious feel. The new rooms are very stylish and gave me a great chance to unwind. Comfortable bed, great staff and will be back soon. I especially enjoyed having my own terrace",5,2015,07,22
144,Stunning new rooms!,"Flemings did not disappoint, we were lucky enough to be put into one of the news rooms. The colours and comfort were sublime and the little private porch was gorgeous. We had a very enjoyable stay. It's also a stone throw away from Green Park station which was very handy for our early morning travels.",5,2015,07,22
144,"Fantastic location, nice and cosy atmosphere","I would have preferred a bit more space - but then this is London, so I guess I better manage my expectations. The atmosphere is very pleasant, the service friendly and professional, and the location just fantastic. Cant say anything about the breakfast as  I decided to skip it - is healthier anyway.",4,2015,07,20
144,Mayfair Ease,"Flemings Mayfair provides comfort as well as close proximity to metro (Green Park) as well as walking distance to many attractions, including Green Park, St James Park, Buckingham Palace, Imperial War Museums, Westminster and more. Clean room and courteous staff make this a fine choice for a London stat.",4,2015,07,20
144,Fabulous hotel!,We loved this hotel for so many reasons the first of which is the wonderful location which allowed us to walk to all the popular parts of London.  The attention and care of each and every one of the staff was just amazing.  They seemed to be constantly watching to see if they could do anything for you and all with a big smile.  Very nice to have a central London hotel with air conditioning and free wifi too and our room was very comfortable.  The bar is quite art deco and easy to get quite lost in with mirrored walls!  Breakfast was very good with a buffet Continental or a cooked breakfast to order.  Will certainly stay here again.,5,2015,07,16
144,Great Location,"My family and I just spent 3 nights here.  The location is brilliant. A lot of the major tourist attractions are within walking distance but if you need to take the tube Green Park Station is less than a 5 minute walk away.  We were even able to catch a direct line train from Heathrow to Green Park which made access from the airport quick, easy and more affordable.

The hotel staff are so helpful and very friendly, which isn't always the case when you travel with a small child. We had tickets to visit Harry Potter World, which is quite a distance from the centre of London, and the concierge was brilliant.  He knew which trains to get, where to get them and he even printed out the timetable so that we could make sure we caught the fast train.

We had a Family Room which had a king size bed and a fold out.  The room was nicely decorated in an English style and it was large, especially for London standards, which is great when there are 3 of you.  My only complaint with this hotel was the bathroom.  We initially had to move rooms as our original bathroom had mould throughout the shower.  The reception manager was very apologetic and quickly moved us to another room which was improved but for the price I would expect much better.  I believe that they are in the process of releasing newly renovated rooms.

If I return to London I will definitely consider staying here again as long as the bathrooms are improved and I would definitely recommend to others.",4,2015,07,14
144,Stylish luxury....,"Flemings.....an oasis of style, peace and luxury for any traveller. From the warmest of welcomes to the elegant interior design, from the excellent food to the always attentive staff.....this boutique luxury hotel did not disappoint. First class accommodation and good value in a very convenient location.",5,2015,07,12
144,awful,"this ppace is not cheap and its not good value for money
Poor room, very cramped and noisy as its next to the lift, room 300, for reference!
I had to move having unpacked and got into my bed.
They have clearly had complaints about the room before in which case do something about it management !!!!!, no apology on check out just a request for a staff gratuity which i found appalling",2,2015,07,12
144,Always a great place to stay in London,"We stayed in the penthouse suite which is fantastic.  We loved the roof top terrace and the privacy.  This hotel is in a great location in London, the staff are fantastic and they always look after us and welcome us back each time we stay.  Thank you.",5,2015,07,12
144,"Elegant, quiet haven, great location","Calm and quiet the moment you step inside into timeless elegance of marble, smoked mirrors, wood paneling.  Sparkling clean throughout.  Great location - one minute from Green Park and an easy 3 minute walk to Green Park Underground Station and many good restaurants and attractions nearby.  Neighborhood appears well kept and safe.  Very professional, friendly and helpful staff.  Reservations gave me the quiet room I requested (facing back of hotel) and promptly helped me with questions before I arrived.  Room was inviting, elegant, calm, well thought out for comfort, with modern conveniences and reliable high speed WIFI.  Hotel has a lovely cafe. Rambunctious children will be happier elsewhere.  Otherwise, this hotel is perfect for every other type of traveler.  Quality throughout and well worth the money.",5,2015,07,09
144,Evening meal,"Beautiful hotel ,made to feel welcome ambience good meal deal very good food fantastic and the staff very attentive very quick service lovely decor would definitely eat here again cant wait for afternoon tea",5,2015,07,08
144,My favourite Hotel in London,"Coming back to The Flemings in May it felt like home coming. Very kind staff and beautiful bunch of flowers in the room. Stayed in the Townhouse which has a gorgeous Patio and might be very well one of the very rare apartments where you can sit out in the sunshine - right  in the heart of Mayfair. 
There will be new 50 refurbished rooms added in July and I had already a look what they will look like. Loved the new rooms - so different!! And  the new Library Elevator  very orginal !! 
Former Lobby Lounge  gets a new face lift and will be moved to entrance I was told and a new Michelin Star Chef (british) wil be at the helm of Restaurant /Bistro in August. 
Although it was early in the morning (6am) when I had to leave, the receptionist insisted the evening before - to  bring breakfast to the apartment - as Restaurant opens at  7am for breakfast. Got a massive basquet of Toast, fresh squeezed orange juice and large Coffee to go. Which was very appreciated.",5,2015,07,08
144,Terrible,"We took our son down to London for his birthday and all of our normal hotels in Mayfair were booked so we decided to try Flemings; a bad mistake.

They were totally renovating the first floor and our room was on the second; the noise was horrific and started at 08:00am through 6:30pm. We complained but they could not move us to another room until the next day. We moved to the 4th floor into a much smaller room (at the same rate!) which overlooked the central courtyard, where the workmen had set up their cutting machines? Still just as noisy.

The manageress was pretty offhand about the whole situation and when I stated that the hotel should have been closed during these renovations she said ""we have closed the first floor"", which was the one being renovated??

The service and management attitude was appalling; we would never stay here again, under any circumstances.",1,2015,07,07
144,Expensive top hats!,"This is a bijou hotel in the heart of Mayfair. It is very expensive (as one might expect, given its geographical position). the staff are numerous, respectful and helpful, the service excellent and the food exemplary. That quality does not extend to the accommodation, which because it is squeezed into a tiny space, fails on several counts especially when considered in relation to its cost. The entrance into the bathroom risks finger amputation, and the shower is an absurd, unpleasant and painful experience. Of more concern is the lack of adequate signage to the stairs in the corridor",3,2015,07,03
144,"Posh and Positive, except for reservation team.","Had 3 apartments with 12 people for four nights in June.  The rooms were well designed and maintained.  Housekeeping outstanding.  Reception team great.  Location for parks, sights and restaurants could not be better.  We only had one negative issue with the reservation team headed by Claudia.  We booked three townhouses 10 months before with deposit.  Three months ago, this Claudia informed me that they had had a ""computer problem"" and that my townhouse apartments had been double booked---and that I was the loser!   I got three apartments at a 13% reduction---but a 40% reduction in space!   Beyond tacky!!  Be careful.  Not too surprising, Claudia was on vacation during our visit.  Good for all!",5,2015,06,28
144,Boutique and lovely,"Really enjoyed our stay. Great location for walking around / sightseeing in central west London and close to the tube. 

Loved the decor in the communal areas, the lounge room with the sofas and fire is beautiful and such a good place to relax after a busy London day.

Our room was small-ish but sweet and didn't feel cramped.

The breakfast was heavenly and the service was great. ",4,2015,06,27
144,Terrible experience - expected much better,"Extremely disappointing. We had travelled a long distance with our 4 year old daughter and only had a day and a half to experience London and yet our room wasn't ready when we arrived at 2.30. We didn't get into our room until nearly 4 pm. When you are paying for a quality establishment this isn't good enough and I expected much better. We lost prescious time when we could have been seeing London. The hotel is also undergoing major renovation work and is right next to a major building site. Smells dust and very noisy. We were only provided 2 towels even though we had 3 people staying. We asked the maids to provide another towel and they didn't. Overall service was a bit faulty towers like. Great location, 1 bedroom apartment was large and well appointed but over all Flemings disappointed.",1,2015,06,26
144,Perfect stay from start to finish.,"We have been to London several times. I go at least once a year for business and often bring my family. We have stayed in several luxury hotels in the Mayfair area but none have been as wonderful as the Flemings Mayfair. 

Our rooms were beautiful. The location was exceptional. Breakfast was excellent. But above all, the staff/team at Flemings was outstanding. 

The service, professionalism and courtesy shown to my family and I put the service at some of London's most well-known and legendary hotels to shame. 

For our short stay, Flemings truly became a warm and wonderful home away from home.

I would highly recommend this hotel to executives, couples and families, and personally, I wouldn't consider staying anywhere else for our next stay.",5,2015,06,25
144,"Loved our room, service and location!",We stayed at the Flemings for 4 nights and enjoyed every moment. The room was spacious ( a bit more storage space and perhaps an additional table by the couch or an additional chair by the desk would make things even more comfortabl). Location could not be more convenient and the staff is fabulous in every way.,4,2015,06,23
144,"Will be good, but be careful until construction around and within is complete","Hotel is poor value at the moment for those wanting peace and quiet as there is a lot of very noisy construction around the hotel and within. They try to keep to the hours you may be out but it is not ideal if you wish to get a snooze before going out in the evening.
Otherwise the hotel is good and the staff very friendly. Location is ideal for walking to most of the main areas and handy for public transport too.",4,2015,06,20
144,At last - a treat worth waiting for !,"We had always promised ourselves a few days at Flemings, as a previous work boss absolutely refused to stay anywhere else whilst in town on business - whilst us mere mortals  were regularly relegated to more economical billets.

We were not disappointed, having upgraded to an executive room with a king sized bed ( so my better half could distance herself from my supposed snoring) . So it didn't come cheap but was worth it. The bathroom was adequate but on the small size.

Handily located a few hundred metres from Green Park tube station it was within easy walking distance of most of the things we had on our agenda  such as a trip to the theatre and an art exhibition.

All the staff gave outstanding customer care - very welcoming and not stuffy at all - as in some places .

The hotel was created from several adjacent houses so the interior is a bit of a potentially confusing journey from the lift to your room.

We had a very nice evening meal via a special "" 2 courses""  deal in the basement restaurant, and the breakfasts were tip top - especially the Eggs Benedict !

There was some construction noise ongoing as building development work was progressing adjacent to the hotel, but this was only a minor inconvenience - it did not impact on our sleep.

There was some confusion at checkout about the bill and what we had paid for in advance, but this was quickly and professionally  resolved .

We would certainly return for a special treat",4,2015,06,19
144,Very nice!,"I stayed at the Flemings Mayfair for five days in June of 2015.  It was very nice.  The staff are extraordinary and the accommodations are clean and cozy.  It is quiet, even in a room facing a construction site.  It is convenient to many landmarks and walking in the park is awesome.  Two complaints:  1) no outlet for a hair dryer in the bathroom and 2) the closet door hit a hinge on the back of the entrance door in a way that would not allow you to open the closet door completely.  The tea and coffee service in the room and minibar were great.  Found the iron; could not find the ironing board.",4,2015,06,15
144,My stay at the Flemings Mayfair hotel,"THE HOTEL AND THE ROOM

I stayed five nights at the Flemings Mayfair Hotel, a 4 star deluxe hotel.  In: May 24th.  Out: May 29th, 2015.  My room was the 418, a “classic single room” with a view to Half Moon Street.

When you get out of the elevator there are several steps in the way to the room, which makes it difficult to move with luggage.

The room is rather small buy it is plenty of nice details:

•	A welcome note by the Guest Services Manager
•	A big complimentary chocolate and complimentary mineral water
•	Double bed with a good deal of pillows and cushions
•	Iron and iron board
•	Tea / coffee making facilities
•	Bathroom with shower, bath and good quality amenities
•	iPod/iPad dock
•	A variety of magazines: Be Inspired (from Small Luxury Hotels), Mayfair Times, Sphere and Esquire
•	An umbrella
Some aspects which have to do with the category of the hotel are:

•	A porter with a galley opens the taxi door when you arrive
•	If it rains they can provide you with an umbrella which I reject due to its big size which makes it cumbersome to carry around
•	The maid visits the room at evening to close the windows, to accommodate the towels and to leave a cart to order breakfast at room the next day if you wish so
•	When I return to the hotel I sit for a while at the lobby.  Sometime later I am offered a complimentary cup of cherry

AT EVENING AT FLEMINGS MAYFAIR’S RESTAURANT

Here I am seeing myself at a mirror which is located in front of me.  I wait for dinner with a cup of red wine: wine can be had by the glass.

Both guests and other attendants are smart dressed.  Though I understand there are no rules I feel too casual garments may not suit the place.

Service is very good.  Meals are not too elaborated and the menu is short which gives you peace of mind regarding ingredients freshness.

MONDAY MORNING

A quick zapping through the TV channels.  It starts with BBC One and BBC Two and there are some one hundred options, the majority on HD, plus several radios.  It takes my attention that certain channels begin to broadcast at 8:00 am and a pair of them, BBC Three and BBC Four, at 7:00 pm.  BBC Four has a reputation of making great interviews.

When I open the room door a newspaper awaits at the doorstep.  I get out and go down through the elevator to the lower grand floor.  Breakfast is served at the same place where I dinned the night before.

A receptionist takes note of my room number.  Breakfast is of the buffet type but coffee (or tea) is provided by the waiter at the table.  Soft music is heard at the background, mostly jazz.

The buffet is well presented.  There are no toasts, which you should ask for them to the waiter, but smoked salmon is available.  I find reasonable having to ask for toasts as it is not “smart” to queue at the toaster as in other hotels.  Sugar is provided in cubes, a detail which is not too common nowadays.

A waitress asks me if the breakfast was okay and if I want some more coffee.

AFTERNOON TEA

Afternoon tea could be an alternative too dinner when you assist to the theatre or to the opera.  As restaurants in general close early (9:30 to 10:00 pm) they will not be possible to eat after the event.

The waiter explains to me the differences between Darjeeling tea, which he recommends, and English breakfast tea, which I intended to have in the first time.

An “ad hoc” structure contains three dishes.  The one at the bottom contains four small sandwiches; the one at the middle, two scones, cream and strawberries jam, and the one at the upper dish, a sort of “pétits fours”.

The waiter, who ironically is not English but French, suggests not adding milk or sugar to Darjeeling tea, so as to perceive well its flavor.   He is right.

AT CHECK OUT

The Guest Services Director asks when I plan to return to London.  She says she will be glad to receive me again.

In general the friendliness of the staff clearly exceeded their professional duty.",5,2015,06,13
144,Great Service,"A true test of a hotel is what happens when things go wrong.  When we recently checked in, found out that there would be daily construction happening each day starting early.  Without fuss, they upgraded us to a new room in a stand-alone building where we would not be bothered by the noise.  When we called back down that there wasn't a king bed in the room - as there was in the original room we booked - they had folks up there within 15 minutes locking beds together, adding a king sized mattress pad....issue solved.

Room was clean and extremely comfortable.  Concierge service was exceptional throughout our stay.

As Green Park tube stop is a 2 minutes walk from hotel - with direct access to several lines - VERY convenient for getting around each day!

Would definitely recommend!",5,2015,06,12
144,Too much construction noise inside and outside hotel! Check status and demand deep discount.,"Flemings is well located and attractive with helpful staff. At the moment though there is construction inside the hotel ( the former ground floor lounge), beside the hotel, and roadwork on the street.If you leave the hotel by 8:30AM and return after 6 it should not be a problem but be forewarned because the hotel does not do so, not even on checking in. Somehow a 10 pound voucher per day towards food or drink does not seem adequate acknowledgment of the current situation.Not helped by the airless, dark basement bar and restaurant where such vouchers might be redeemed.",4,2015,06,12
144,Excellent ,Hotel in center of our business. Also close to best shopping in London within walking distance. The Hotel service is excellent and friendly. Good facilities and english breakfast. Rooms are very nice and comfortable and tastefully designed. ,4,2015,06,10
144,Great Hotel *******,"I stayed in room 219, which was a single. Although on the small side it was very comfortable and had all the necessary requirements, including a good sized bathroom, a writing desk and ample storage. 
Service at the Flemings is superb. Whatever one needs is never too much trouble and there are always several people there to assist. The location of Flemings is great as Green Park tube is an easy walk and Shepherds Market, with its casual restaurants is just round the corner. It is also an easy walk to Oxford Street and the West End shows, as well as Hyde Park. 
What is also very nice is that the hotel is very boutique style and not a big noisy hotel, like so many. 
I enjoyed my stay so much that I have already booked to return to Flemings Hotel in September. ",5,2015,06,10
144,Excellent base for Mayfair ,"I usually stay in a different hotel close by however on this trip it was full so I thought I would try this boutique hotel, and  I was not sorry from check in to check out every little detail was seen to by the very attentive staff the doorman was one of the best I've had the pleasure of interacting with I will return.",5,2015,06,09
144,Super-convenient location and friendly staffs 　超便利な立地にフレンドリーなスタッフ,"*English follows after Japanese.
夫と二人で３泊しました。他の方もすでに述べられている通り、地下鉄グリーンパーク駅のすぐ近くで便利です。徒歩でフォートナム＆メイソン、ピカデリーサーカス、バッキンガム宮殿にも行け、さらに朝食を食べ過ぎたらすぐそこのグリーンパークで散歩をして気持ちがよかったです（リスがいて、かわいい）。スタッフの方も感じがよく、気軽に質問したり雑談したりできました。朝食もとても美味しかったです（※ビュッフェ形式の""Continental""か、それプラス卵料理の""Cooked""のいずれかを選ぶ※渡されるメニューには金額が書いてありますが、「朝食込み」で予約してあればもちろん別途請求されることはありません）。唯一の難点は部屋があまり広くないことなのですが、清潔でセンスの良いインテリアですし、先に述べたような長所でカバーできると思いました。あちこち街歩きしたい人に特におすすめなホテルです。

Stayed 3 nights with my husband.  As other reviewers already mentioned, the location is very convenient - the Green Park tube station is near, and there are many sightseeing places within walking distance.  We also enjoyed walking in Green Park in the morning after breakfast, which was very refreshing. Staffs are all nice and friendly.  Breakfast was also good and tasty (choose from the buffet-style ""Continental"" or ""Cooked"" whose your choice of egg dish is added to the buffet).  The only drawback could be that the room is a bit small, but aforementioned positive sides can cover this problem. 
 
Overall, highly recommended especially for active tourists.  Thanks for the staffs.",5,2015,06,06
144,Wonderful lunch and superb staff.,"My French grandfather was a chef at Flemings in the early 1960's, so when I saw an offer on Amazon  I could not resist treating my mother and aunts and uncle to a 3 course lunch at the hotel. They were not disappointed! Emilia and all of the staff went out of their way to make them feel like very special guests - surprising them with a complimentary glass of champagne each! They showed genuine interest in the family's past association with the hotel and nothing was too much effort. Thank you Flemings!",5,2015,06,05
144,For Business Travellers ...,"... this hotel can be recommended but I would not go there again while on holiday. During our stay there was construction work going on inside and adjacent of the house - an afternoon nap and a lie-in on saturday morning therefore impossible. We had not been warned beforehand and this is what we resent. Staff were very friendly, our room was nice enough. The location simply can't be beaten.",3,2015,06,03
144,Excellent Staff!,We loved the location of this hotel....tucked away but close to so much. Right across the park from Buckingham Palace. The concierge went the extra mile to get us West End play tickets. The room was extremely comfortable and we would definitely stay here again!,5,2015,06,01
144,A hidden jem in the London jungle,"My wife found this hotel a few years ago, stayed with a friend, the when we were next going to London pushed me to book here, I already had a preferred London hotel and don't tale to change, it was the best piece of nagging ever, I just love the hotel, the staff really go the extra mile, nothing, I repeat NOTHING is to much trouble, they welcome you as friends, not the artificial american greeting. Location is excellent, we were upgraded to single apartment truly excellent, there is lots of building going on both within the hotel and near, but we are out all day so no problem, the quality of the hotel and staff far out ways building noise.",5,2015,05,31
144,Lovely hotel in a great location.. ,"Lovely room, great location, an all round great hotel. Very friendly staff as well who helped us find a gorgeous restaurant to eat and ordered a cab for us. We will definitely stay here again on our next trip to London! ",5,2015,05,28
144,AFTERNOON TEA,"I took a friend for her Birthday for an Afternoon Tea here. The hotel was very luxurious, the staff could not be more helpful and polite and there was a never ending flow of tea, sandwiches (myself being vegetarian was no problem at all), cakes anything that you desired. Our waiter Abdul made us feel very welcome and looked after us. Overall the whole experience was outstanding even to the point without asking Abdul surprised my friend with her own little birthday cupcake with a candle. it was a pleasure to of spent a few hours in this hotel with the delightful staff and yummy food.",5,2015,05,27
144,Sophisticated boutique hotel in Mayfair,"Flemings is a great location, just off Piccadilly and a short walk from Green Park station. Very close to Shepherds Market for pubs and restaurants and the lovely Green Park to run or walk in. Perfect for the West End etc. Very friendly and helpful staff in a stylish small hotel and, for central London, not bad value.  Rooms can be small and there is a bit of building opposite the hotel and in house, but not very disturbing.",4,2015,05,26
144,Very friendly staff !,"Excellent hotel with wonderful friendly staff . There is some building work going on across the road , which is a little noisey if you open the window We always stay here when we are in London and we always feel at home here .Special Thank you to Andrew , Joseph , Marie and Nadia . Always ring the hotel direct for bookings as they always have offers . We will be back Dec 3rd for my birthday .",5,2015,05,26
144,Very good ,Had one of there suits for 1 night was very good nice and clean the bar was well stocked with premium spirits the restaurant was also very good concierge extremely helpful even had an employee go out and pick something up for me whilst I was busy would highly recommend this hotel ,4,2015,05,26
144,Many Pros; a couple of Cons,"This hotel has much to offer: great location, great staff, and great breakfast.  The location (both within Mayfair and to London generally) are big pluses.  The hotel is on a quiet-ish side street, but a little bit of street noise from Piccadilly can be heard.  The staff are fantastic.  The rooms and bathroom are small.  It had no effect on my experience, but it is true.  The bathroom was mostly clean.  As other guests said, there is construction noise, which can be heard throughout the hotel.  It has a nicely appointed lobby, but not a quintessential British feel like some others - a little more urban and chic. I found the hotel was a little less than accommodating when it came to check in time and availability of breakfast.  They should look to be a little more flexible there.",4,2015,05,21
144,Amazing.,"These apartments have a 24-hour concierge and room service. A 1-minute walk from Piccadilly and Green Park, Flemings Apartments Mayfair offer luxurious accommodation on the site of London’s 2nd-oldest hotel.",5,2015,05,20
144,Charming and very well staffed,"The rooms are extremely small.  Construction was being done to the hotel so it was noisy Monday - Friday.  The staff is incredible!  They made up for the less than desirable room.  If you need an electrical adapter, take one with you.  They charge extra for the adapter.
The dining room was very inviting and the service exceptional.  Another major reason to select this hotel is the convenient location to everything.  I would stay here again upon returning to London.",4,2015,05,20
144,"Great location, wonderful staff","Hotel delivered all that it promised. Well located, gracious and helpful staff, comfortable room, great breakfast. Nice to stay in hotel with British feel, rather than a cookie cutter, homogenized chain.",5,2015,05,20
144,Smallest hotel room I've every stayed in!,"Normally stopping in the Washington or Hilton I had expectations of this hotel, especially given the price tag. 

The welcome at reception was good, but the 'classic' room was about the same size as my bathroom at home. The bathroom was so small I struggled to get though the door, being of slight frame this did not seem right, so small in fact there was no space for a toilet roll holder!

The good thing was the quietness of the room, unusual in the area. 

The service at breakfast was excellent however.",2,2015,05,20
144,My very favorite London hotel,"I stay here every time I visit London.  The location is perfect.  The hotel is small and very charming.  Not at all like the typical generic American chain hotels, which perhaps explains some of the less flattering reviews, but, for travelers who prefer a smaller boutique hotel with a unique personality, then this is just perfect.  The staff are completely charming.  I've stayed in 5* hotels worldwide and can be terribly critical but I can't say a bad word about Flemings.  It is my absolute first choice in London.",5,2015,05,19
144,Wow.....,"This is truly a wonderful hotel.....the staff are faultless, the interiors beautiful, the food excellent. If you want that vacuous atmosphere that large hotel chains give then this is not the hotel for you. This hotel has soul and history to it and teamed with the ever polite staff and the fantastic location it has now become one of my favorite places to stay.",5,2015,05,15
144,Nowhere near a five star experience!,"Stayed here mid week on a Hotel.com booking. Service was friendly & efficient throughout my stay, although I generally had a poor experience.
My classic double for £299 was very small, with an even smaller bathroom. The small wardrobe was stuffed full of fitted hangers, so you couldn't hang up your stuff. The wardrobe door could be opened properly as the room door stopper got in the way. The standard of the decor I would describe as tatty, with wires hanging from the TV & general decorating required.
My room (306) was at the back of the hotel & nearby construction noise was intolerable. It was so load you couldn't hear the TV & started at 7.00am. Breakfast was good.
I am a regular London hotel user & this is a poor value for money property with a serious noise issue.",2,2015,05,15
144,Truly lovely and great location,"My husband I stayed at this lovely hotel for a few days. We arrived in London Heathrow airport and then took the tube to the green park station via the Piccadilly line. Just a short walk from there to the Hotel. Absolutely every staff member we encountered were so professional and courteous. They provided us with large umbrellas and easy to follow directions went venturing out. Pedro was kind enough to show us all the amenities our room provided. After we left London we went on to Germany then Paris. This hotel was above all the others. I especially loved the location. You can walk to Hyde Park, Buckingham Palace etc. Or you can purchase an all day bus pass at Green Park station if you choose not to take the underground. This Hotel has a nice little breakfast but we often opted to grab coffee at cafe Nero on the corner. We had a wonderful time in London and would mist definitely return to this hotel.",4,2015,05,12
144,Cramped and Aging,"The Good:  Great location, but don't expect a SLH (Small Luxury Hotel) experience.  Nice staff.  It was actually quiet, which was a surprise as it feels like a boarding house

The Bad:  The rooms are small--perhaps that's why it joined the SLH chain.  My room was tiny.  I could barely turn around in it.  And, tiny hallways too with steps up and down.  If you are older--definitely do not stay here.  If you're handicap in anyway, I'm not sure how you'd even manage.  The first room I got had a terrible musty room--they moved me thank goodness.",2,2015,05,12
144,Service at its best!,"My husband and I stayed at Flemings for 4 days as our first stop on our honeymoon. We were exhausted from 26hrs of straight travel and from the minute we arrived at the hotel, we knew we had picked the right place to stay. The staff were exceptional. They were attentive and went over and above to make our stay as memorable as possible. We were upgraded to a stunning apartment that had champagne, chocolates and a hand written note from the customer service manager. The sales director Colin sort us out to introduce himself so that if we needed anything he was available to assist. Brilliant rooms, sensational staff and a fantastic location. Only downside was that we had to leave after 4 days. We will be back.",5,2015,05,10
144,Couldn't be better!,"The staff, the facilities and the location were all first rate. We chose Flemings because of the recommendation of a friend who had stayed there multiple times, and found that the hotel was as good as promised. I'm told all London hotel rooms (except for the uber-posh) are small, so it wasn't surprising that the room was a bit cramped, albeit with a king size bed!  But it was comfortable, and the staff was always pleasant and helpful and interested in our welfare. The concierge especially was amazing. Would definitely stay there again.",5,2015,05,10
144,Birthday treat,"I stayed at Flemings Mayfair in a junior suite room in the newly renovated townhouse. The lift is an absolute surprise! The room was as described - large and tastefully decorated with a lovely bathroom. I was celebrating my birthday and found two cupcakes waiting for me which was a nice surprise. The breakfast the next morning was good and I absolutely recommend the eggs benedict. Staff were very welcoming and friendly. The only inconvenience was building work meant I couldn't access the gym via the hotel and had to use the street basement entrance. Overall wonderful hotel, great staff, lovely room and good location, will definitely stay again.",5,2015,05,10
144,Lovely luxury,"Fantastic start to finish.
Pulled up in taxi to red carpet had someone come and take my bag inside, i was offered port while checking in which i declined but v nice touch.

Reception and lift beautiful. Room was a double again lovely. Huge big bed with everything in the room you could need. Mini bar was very expensive though i must say.

On return to my room later someone had turned down the bed and put the bedside lamps on which was a nice touch.
Only thing was there was only feather pillows which i dont like personally had i noticed previously i would have enquired about alternatives.

Breakfast was nice but as someone else commented perhaps a little pricey.

The hotels bar is very unusually decorated which i loved! Bar man was very attentive also.

Lovely visit felt special beginning to end
",5,2015,05,08
144,"Excellent location, very friendly staff!","Stayed here for a week in one of the standard rooms. Excellent bed and terrific staff! The room was quite small and the shower, though very European, is almost unusable. The door on the shower is a half door and does not keep the water from spraying onto the very slick bathroom floor. Used the bath mat and two hand towels to cover the floor when showering. The layout of the room was such that you needed to walk sideways to get to the bathroom and clothing storage unit. Very little room to store your clothing, no dresser or drawers. The hotel is also remodeling so we heard jackhammers and construction each morning around ten. The furnishings were quite nice. Friends of ours were in a suite on the other side of the hotel and upon visiting their room we were quite impressed with the room they had. More spacious, more storage area and niceties. Overall very happy with the room and Extremely happy with the staff and location! Will stay again, but would suggest upgrading from standard to suite.",4,2015,05,05
144,My London Homebase,"I've stayed at the Flemings Mayfair several times while in London on business.  Absolutely great location in Mayfair.  Hotel is well appointed, the rooms are clean and comfortable, and the service is very good.  The hotel is an excellent value for the location, though the single rooms are quite small.  Restaurant is quite good for breakfast but a little pricey even by London standards if breakfast is not included in your room rate.  Hotel has a small gym which is serviceable.  All in all, a great, well priced place to stay in Mayfair.  I'm sure I'll be back.",4,2015,04,20
144,Afternoon Tea,"A fabulous afternoon tea. Fabulous and fantastic service. Our waitress, Magda went out of the way to make it very special for us, even bringing out a cake to help us celebrate a belated Mother's Day. Thank you!",5,2015,04,17
144,Absolutley Wonderful!,Can't say enough about the attentive staff. The property is beautiful and in a great location. We would absolutely stay here again. It will be even better when the remodeling is done....hope we can get back there and see the newly remodeled restaurant...sounds like they have some great plans.. But don't wait...if you can...go now!!,5,2015,04,15
144,Ultimately heavenly experience,"I took my friend as a birthday treat for afternoons tea. As we entered, we were greeted by a warm smile, who then took us to our table in the restauarant.
We were then shown to our table with welcoming  vibes.  The whole ambience and experience was exhilarating and beautiful.  Moses and his team were exceptionally attentive  and gave a personalised and professional service.  Definitely would return to enjoy the experience.  Thank you.",5,2015,04,09
144,Amazing afternoon tea experience,We had afternoon tea there with our 5 years old daughter and we absolutely loved it. Service was great and food delicious. We had one traditional tea option and one chocoholic option and we enjoyed everything. Would definitely recommend the place and can't wait to go back.,5,2015,04,07
144,"Amazing stay, wanted to give it 5 stars, but...","We have just stayed at this hotel for 3 nights, and I miss it! The staffs eyre so for end lay an  nice from the moment we checked in.  The lobby was plush and welcoming. The lift and corridors are nicely decorated with character.  Our room was 417 and on the 4th floor. The room itself is beautiful, clean, nicely decorated with good quality furnishings. No view but that did not matter to us as we weren't expecting one. The bathroom was the whole reason I had to drop a star - I would have given 5 stars if it weren't for the bathroom. It was tiny and clean, but the shower/bath was a complete nightmare. I like to take the shower head off to wash myself in the shower otherwise I never feel properly clean but this one was fixed to the ceiling. Also the shower head is quite large and only points straight down and so making it impossible to wash certain areas! The bathroom is definitely in need of an update. So I have to lose a star for this reason.
Breakfast was delicious. We chose not to have the cooked breakfast as we were happy with continental. There was no choice of pastries, only croissants, but there was very nice fresh bread with cheese, meats, fish, etc. lots of yummy fresh fruit, delicious cereals, yoghurt, toast. We left satisfied each day.
We slept very well each night, the bed and covers were so comfortable and the room was away from any noise. It was so quiet and peaceful.
The location is excellent, we walked everywhere. It is only a few minutes walk from Green Park tube station, about 15 minutes walk up to Oxford Street and about the same to Piccadilly Circus. 
There was free wifi in the room but it was a little slow. However you could pay for faster wifi if you needed it.
I loved this hotel and would definitely stay here again!",4,2015,04,07
144,"Flemings, Half Moon Street, Heart of Mayfair","I was so excited visiting this hotel. Memories of Michael Caine films and for some reason Ernest Hemingway ricocheted through my imagination. And the location is tucked away off the main road. I headed for the bar - which was downstairs - and discovered, a bit like Alice, that this was the start of the rabbit warren. This is definitely not the sterile, vacuous type of hotel I hate. This is close up and personal. And the bar staff really know how to pour what ever drink you desire. Here you can have intimate conversation or sit with a business colleague or drinks with friends.  
My room was on the second floor and I called the lift. Quirkily, the inside of the lift is lined with books like a library... I am just awaiting a potion in the bedroom with a label entitled 'drink me' – but I guess I did that in the bar. 
The bed rooms are comfortable, and cosy but have all you need. Neither high end design nor monotone. But everything works like it should. 
I hear breakfast is brilliant but sadly had to leave early.
But next time...",5,2015,04,06
144,Lovely Afternoon Tea,"Loved my afternoon tea today - thanks to Ali who made it a great experience for us, we had extra sandwiches and scones at no extra charge,the setting was lovely, and just 3 mins from the underground made it very easy to get to -can't wait to go back - thank you",5,2015,04,06
144,Great business stay,Stayed here on business! Greeted by a friendly chap on reception who gave me a free upgrade! Room was spacious with incredibly comfy bed! Bathroom was huge too! For a hotel in London I was impressed that there was no air con unit next to the window to keep me awake at night! Breakfast next morning was fantastic! Really enjoyed my stay here and wouldn't hesitate to return!,5,2015,04,04
144,Luxury with a capital L,"Second time stay. Love it. Out the door left to Buck House. Hyde Pk etc and right to Bond St Regent St and all things nice in the shopping & eating department - lovely walks,  no need for u/g. Beautifully furnished rooms amazing service and lovely breakfast - I wouldn't hesitate recommending it! So so much better than the inferior hilton opposite - trust me - I've stayed there too.",5,2015,03,28
144,Very comfortable but don't expect luxury,"I had a lovely stay in the hotel, the room was small but comfortable and even though we seemed to be next to the linen closet, it was lovely and quiet.  There were just really tiny things which could have been done better which I would not complain about if it were a cheap hotel, for example the White Company does the toileteries but there are some elements missing - do not forget your shampoo and conditioner like I did. The main issue I had is that the breakfast is not good, nasty coffee, buffet style cooked breakfast, scrambled egg was rank.  I think they should have just had a contintental breakfast with food orders taken from the table which would really improve it.  I would recommend not booking breakfast but walking down the road to some of the lovely cafes nearby instead.",4,2015,03,23
144,Excellent location and very friendly staff,"We were upgraded to an apartment upon our arrival.  The space was more than adequate and very lovely.  Unfortunately there was massive construction across the street so it was very loud during the day, even on Saturday, so it wasn't especially relaxing to be in the kitchen/living room area.  We could close the French doors so it was quieter in the bedroom.  This was our only complaint.  Would definitely stay at Flemings again.",4,2015,03,17
144,Return trip,"This was our second stay at Flemings and I can honestly not fault it!
The rooms are delightful and so peaceful from the hustle and bustle of London! 
The staff are so friendly and willing to go out of their way to help!
We are in the restaurant for dinner that evening and breakfast the following morning and the food was exceptional. We had the sea bass and it was the best I have ever tried. Compliments to the chef.",5,2015,03,17
144,Lovely little boutique hotel,"If you like contemporary and stylish with elegance then you'll certainly enjoy your stay.
Rooms were a good double with a reasonable en suite with shower and seperate bath. 
Toiletries weren't great, just one bar of soap to shower with and wash your hands.
Breakfast was buffet style snd you couldn't request eggs cooked the way you like. Instead pre cooked scrambled/fried, sausages, bacon and selection of juices, fruit and cereals you would expect. Smoked salmon too.
The waiters were slow in bringing tea and toast. They neglected to put salt and pepper and milk jug on the table.
Concierge was ok. Receptionist not very smiley. Parking not great outside - there are 6 bays, but NCP around the corner. 
Would stay again even with the minor details missing",4,2015,03,17
144,Very warm friendly hotel,"We have stayed at this hotel twice this year and going back again this Saturday with another 20 people for business and attending the Rugby. I have stayed at all London's top hotels but what I like about this hotel and what the Americans will also like is the Downton Abbey miniature feeling this place offers. Ok its not the biggest but its intermit, all the staff are engaged and their is an overwhelming sense they really want to help you and make your stay magical. Rooms are not massive but none are in Mayfair this isn't a modern hotel where rooms a large as its in historical Mayfair but they are of an excellent standard. The hotel is being revamped again and the standard is excellent one for a romantic break right next to all the top shops !",5,2015,03,17
144,"Would certainly stay there again. If you are less agile, check on the shower set-up!","As has well been documented elsewhere, the hotel is gradually being refurbished, so you should check with the hotel before you book. We experienced no problems during our stay.

We took advantage of an offer and reserved a King room for two nights. The room was clean and nicely furnished but had very low door arches leading to the bathroom, forcing my 6'4"" husband to duck. 

My only complaint was with the bathroom, as the polished floor made it lethal to walk on in bare feet, socks or to attempt to stand on the bathmat provided. 

The  shower was over the bathtub and so you had to clamber in and out. I am not sure if this would be suitable for the less-agile. When you tried to alight from the shower and stepped on the white, fluffy bathmat situated on the highly polished floor, it was really quite dangerous.

I requested an additional rubber shower mat (the same as in the bottom of the bathtub) to put on the floor and this was speedily brought up to the room. That solved the problem.

Breakfast was included and was very good, with a large cold buffet selection and also a hot menu. The full English was good as too was the smoked haddock (without the mustard sauce and poached egg as requested).

All the hotel staff were very friendly, accommodating and efficient.

Amazingly, when our bags were carried up to the room, they left so quickly that we had to call them back for a tip! That was refreshing.

The receptionist was happy to arrange for a slightly later checkout without quibble.

The hotel has a fabulous location just a short walk from Green Park tube and close to many of the major sights. In the evening, it is very easy to walk along Piccadilly to the theatre and restaurants or explore cute wine bars and eateries in the Mayfair streets just behind Flemings.

We would certainly stay there again as for the price we paid, it was good value for money.",4,2015,03,16
144,Fantastic would love to give it 5*,"We stayed her on a Saturday night as we had a black tie do in the area. 

On arrival we were greeted with warmth and the can do attitude of the staff oozed of what a fantastic hotel this is.

The room was beautiful, all that we needed and just two minutes walk from the venue of our dinner. The only reason I can't give 5 out of 5 was the bathroom. Unfortunately there was mildew between the tiles in the shower.

Breakfast was fabulous and the scrambled egg, seriously was the best I have tasted. Would I come back? Without a second thought, fantastic staff, beautiful room, why wouldn't you?",4,2015,03,15
144,Amazing,"We stayed about 3 weeks ago and loved it. The hotel is next to everything you could want from London. We went from the hotel doors to watching the changing of the guards at Buckingham Palace within 5 minutes. The room was a little small but perfectly comfortable. All the staff were so friendly and nothing was to much. I didn't catch his name but a young English man with glasses made the trip that much more special. As he was serving us some coffee in the Bar he noticed that my son and I were struggling with physics homework and took the time to explain the difference between volts, amps and ohms.

The check in and check out experience was also very smooth. No waiting around.

The only small Problem were the building works. But that is unavoidable. At night all the work stopped.
I would recommend Flemings to anyone.",5,2015,03,08
144,Wonderful hotel,"our travel agent had booked a room for us for the following Sunday.   Plans changed, and at 11 PM Saturday night I called to make a reservation.   The fabulous staff was expecting us and could not have been more accommodating.   Extremely well-trained.   The general manager, not on duty, called our room from his home to ensure that all was up to our expectation.

I cannot think of a better hotel experience that I have ever had.",5,2015,03,08
144,Really nice ,"A celebratory weekend in London with an overnight at the Flemings Hotel!

I think the No.1 feature of this hotel is its location. A minute or so from Green Park Tube and 10-15 minutes walk from just about everything.

Staff were very friendly and efficient. We liked the boutique style and feel and the history of the place.

We had the classic afternoon tea and cooked breakfast at the hotel which were both really good also.

We booked the room on an offer and I think as a consequence had the smallest room. The room itself was actually good but the bathroom was too small, you had to watch your head getting in and out.

A small point. We let the hotel know it was a birthday and anniversary but there was nothing mentioned which was a shame. Every hotel we've been too at such an occasion have made a small gesture.

Maybe that's what you get if you book the offer....",4,2015,03,08
144,"Not as high class as indicated on their website, disappointed !!","I've booked this hotel because it is walking distance from The Ritz. Also on their website it looks so luxurious, so I thought we treat ourselves a lovely getaway for celebrating our wedding anniversary.

I've spent £240 on lastminute.com for one night, knowing this package comes with the breakfast, but the confirmation didn't indicate that. So I emailed the reception make sure this deal is come with the breakfast, I did had email comes through to confirm the deal, but went to the restaurant for breakfast, receptionist at the counter said we are not paid for the breakfast. It is obviously the communication between the management not as effective as expected. Continental breakfast are lovely, but our cooked breakfast had been delayed for more than half an hour. All the other tables had their toast as soon as they sat down, ours need to asked twice. Coffee taste horrible.

Other than that, I was disappointed with the room that we've assigned. Bathroom & the room not as luxurious and spacious as the one on their website. It's a tiny square bedroom and squeeze in a tiny bathroom at the corner. You can hardly have space to walk around the double bed. We didn't even have a sofa to sit on, only a chair with a writing table which is squeeze underneath the TV at the corner. So if your partner wants to watch TV, you can't able to sit on the table to write. After shower, we did use the bathrobe. I notice the bathrobe not as clean, it's got a makeup stain mark on the pocket. And my husband found an empty vodka bottle in the pocket of his bathrobe. We don't mind if that's a full bottle.

The positive side is the hotel receptionist and the doorman are very welcoming and helpful. We'd requested to leave our luggage earlier before the check-in time, so that we can go to the theatre without having the luggage with us. They were kindly stored our luggage and brought it up to our bedroom whenever is ready.

Would I pay that price to stay in this hotel again, not really. I might think about Hilton that located opposite to this hotel instead. Unless it is £99 deal like another person who found it somewhere on the internet, who had left a 5 star feedback and had much luxurious & spacious room than us. I might think about it.",3,2015,03,08
144,Major renovation works happening - beware!,"Two big minuses.

1) Please take a look at the photo showing the works going on at this hotel. If you don't mind a bit of noise in certain parts of the hotel (we moved rooms because of it) this is a lovely hotel. Given the renovations works are nowhere near complete, and the premises are being given a total overhaul, this will be going on for some time - as you can see by the photo of the view!

2) The rooms are unbearingly hot. No heating was on, both windows were open, and yet we were absolutely baking. It doesn't help that rooms can open onto an internal courtyard, so there is no air flow. 

OK, a third. 

3) If you are very tall, don't stay here. The ceilings are very low. They are also painted in dark colours so appear even lower. 

Negative stuff over, there is a charm about this hotel that's appealing. Staff are friendly, breakfast is good and the location is excellent, but I won't be visiting again until those renovations works are done. 

On this basis I would say it's somewhere between Average and Good, with potential for a lot more once the work is complete.",3,2015,03,08
144,Weekend Stay.,"What a hidden gem, this hotel was perfect for our Anniversary weekend away in London. The hotel's location in Mayfair is fantastic and close to Green Park Tube Station, The Ritz, Buckingham Palace, F&M and other wonderful shops and restaurants. The hotel had  style and class which really made our stay so enjoyable. The Bar was lovely and the staff were very helpful and efficient and made great G&T's. The reception staff both checking in / out were professional and allowed us to leave our luggage whilst we waited for our room and also on the day of our departure. I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel and hope to stay again some time in the future.",5,2015,03,03
144,The time of my life!!,"This hotel is absolutely stunning, and the service was impeccable. Staff members went above and beyond to fulfill all our needs. A big thanks especially to Valentin, Rebecca, Adrian, Ana, and Claudia for all their hard work- Truly remarkabl  e. Wish I never had to leave London.",5,2015,03,03
144,Never knew this was here!,"We were booked in here as we were attending a function at the Sheraton Park Lane.  Our room was made available on arrival at 2pm, it over looked the street at the rear of Half Moon Street.  The hotel décor is beautiful and truly boutique style. Our room was a standard one, but had a really comfortable bed, and everything we could have asked for as well as a large bathroom. The only weird thing was the TV was on a side wall over the dressing table so there was no mirror and I had to put my make up on in the bathroom.
The breakfast was very good, I had smoked salmon and scrambled eggs, not the usual overcooked rubber, but lovely creamy eggs.
I would happily stay here again as the location is perfect for exploring London and Green Park station is very close by.",4,2015,03,02
144,Great Hotel,"Stayed on 21 Feb as we were going to London Fashion Week. I just love this hotel. The staff are exceptional and can't do enough for you from the moment we arrived to the time we left. Booked a classic twin and asked for one facing the front of the hotel as I'd read previous recommendations here. The room was surprisingly large with elegant furnishings, crisp bed linen and White Company products in the bathroom. Loved that there were lots of mirrors, all over the hotel actually and a comfy sofa to relax on. Had a great night's sleep in the heart of Mayfair and breakfast (buffet style) was delicious. £24 if you fancy it in the hotel, ours was included. There is a beautiful lounge near the lobby with a clubby feel. Nice to have a drink and there sit by the fire. 
I would definitely come here again. It's convenient for my favourite restaurants and shopping but quiet enough to feel like you're at home. My niece wants to come back next week! Thanks so much for our wonderful stay during a hectic London Fashion Week! Bibi Roy Relationship Management highly recommends this excellent hotel. 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟",5,2015,02,24
144,Business stay London,"I was very impressed with Flemings, having never been to London I was warned by many counterparts not to expect the shear space as I might expect back home in Australia. My counterpart’s were right however, there was more than adequate space. The room was well appointed, free Wi-Fi, night turndown. The staff were more than friendly and ever so helpful, and I might the cheeriest doorman one could ever imagine to meet. The only negative was the amount of stairs on each level, I was in room 209, even though there is a lift to the second floor I still encountered two flights of stairs, only a small negative and not much the hotel can do about it. With regards to location the hotel is positioned perfectly, literally down the street from Buckingham Palace, and only a short stroll to the tube and wonderful restaurants, a wonderful stay!",4,2015,02,22
144,Opted for very good but think I would have chosen good if that was an option!,"Ok. Fab location. Really close to tube, buck house, old Mayfair, Grosvenor square and Hyde park. 

Our family suite was good and nicely decorated but boy was it hot. SO overbearing. I hardly slept.
Bed was lovely and comfy and the from was a decent size. The bathroom is in need of a makeover or at least regrouting, but it provided what was needed.

If you can get a deal that includes breakfast, otherwise expect to part with big bucks for it. Luckily our reservation included full english and the buffet. This was of a very high standard.

My only let down (besides the sweltering room) was the staff. I ha read all the hype about them 'loving children' etc. All not one member of staff spoke to my child and only the breakfast waitress spoke with me. Totally let down the stay for me. 

I would stay here again if I managed to get a good deal, as it really is in a brilliant location and the hotel is nice :D",4,2015,02,20
144,Mayfairs Place to stay,"One of the hottest adresses in London is the Flemings Hotel in Half Moon Street. The Hotel gets a revamp and gets more glamorous every day. Close to Green Park Tube Station and stonestrow from Green Park it is ideal location for a great stay tucked away from busy Piccadilly and offers great privacy. With new and  lavishly decorated  Apartments on the other side on Clarges Street it is a perfect hideaway place in London. As the Fleming Hotel is undergoing refurbishment I moved in the adajcent Townhouse apartment, where Harrison Ford stayed for weeks and Hollywood celebrities feel happy as they can  live an independent life for months - without paparazzi waiting for them outside, which is the case when staying in Park Lane...Enjoyed Apartment 601 with a wonderful terrace to sit outside and enjoy sunshine - too cold now but ideal later on. Staff is very friendly and doing everything to help and make the stay very special. Lobby will get an facelift this month and I was told there will be soon a Michelin Star Chef looking after the guest as of July. Half Moon Street which was always a bit dark in the past is getting back on track with one Michelin Star and new glamour.",5,2015,02,17
144,Great hotel,"Recently stayed here to celebrate a birthday, we arrived early and our rooms were ready, which is always a bonus ! We had booked the executive rooms as I had heard the basic rooms are small, our rooms were very smart, with all the amenities you would expect to find in a hotel, the beds are huge! And very comfortable, my only observation is that the rooms are very hot, but I always seem to find this in hotels ! They are air conditioned, but we opened the windows. The breakfast was very good, most items you could think of on offer, and all in the very smart restaurant. We also had drinks in the bar before going out for dinner, which was good. The hotel is in a great location, but situated on a quiet street in a busy area.",5,2015,02,16
144,Chic hotel,"Flemings hotel is a beautiful stylish hotel in a great location in Mayfair. We visited to celebrate my mothers 70 th birthday and we were not disappointed. There was 3 of us in the one room, my sister, mum and myself and I slept on the sofa bed. It was really comfortable but there was not a lot of room when it was pulled out! The staff were very friendly and helpful and nothing was too much trouble. The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that the shower was temperamental as you had to try 3 or four times before it would actually come on and the breakfast wasn't good. There is not enough choice, the scrambled eggs are half cooked and everything was lukewarm.",4,2015,02,16
144,Great for business stay,"This place is ideal for anyone who travels to London for business and needs a very comfortable, warm and sunny place to stay at a convenient city centre location. The hotel is on a quiet street and from the outside you could never guess it is a hotel. it looks more like a row of Georgian houses, Yet when you step in through one of its doors, a very large hall with beautiful polished marble floor will unveil in front of you.

My room was not too large, just double bed TV, table and chairs. However their tea and coffee are of a good quality and the staff are very switched on.

I had a problem with air-conditioning switch. Perhaps when you stay in make sure they explain how to use it. In overall it was a very quiet hotel and I would recommend it to anyone travelling on business who likes a traditional and classical style of a hotel.",4,2015,02,13
144,"Very good, but tight","Flemings Mayfair located in beautiful London area, right on the Piccadilly and within stone throw from all major points

Hotel is old so rooms are tiny and corridors very narrow. It has certain chic, but you must be aware of the low ceilings and shower in the the bathroom, so having a shower may be pretty difficult. Bed is squeezed into the corner, so accessible from one side only. If you have a suitcase, you will hardly find a space to put it.

Service is ok but they forgot to clean the room once and almost forgot to call the taxi 

However it's compensated by the very reasonable rate they charge compared to the other hotels in vicinity - twice lower, so you can't really complain ",4,2015,02,13
144,Another exemplary stay at the Flemings,"I return frequently to the smart and stylish hotel in Mayfair for a number of reasons- it has a cocooning style where you are treated  as though you need to be protected from the harsh realities of the outside world .... From stepping in nothing is too much trouble from printing up documents for a meeting to doing midnight runs to all night chemists for calpol for a sick child and that's the beauty of the flemings - customer really is king -a level of service which outside of the USA one rarely encounters. 
The junior suite which we had was roomy and soothingly decorated - luxury thickly lined silk swathes the talk Georgian windows - marble and mirror lines the bathroom  - a separate overhead and body bar shower delivers a powerful blast. breakfast is delicious and copious try the sausages they are very tasty.
One element which never fails to raise a smile is the Flemings quite extraordinary and exquisite fresh floral displays that are always surprising and unique . A truly lovely London base .
",5,2015,02,09
144,Excellent,"Stayed at the Flemings on the 6th February for one night.
Perfectly situated for shopping shows etc etc staff were all amazingly helpful and they serve a brilliant full English, brilliant.
Book direct and not through a third party it's cheaper !.",5,2015,02,06
144,Best hotel experience in London,"Myself and a friend have stayed in Flemings a few times and it just gets better every time. They are so accommodating with requests and try to go the extra mile to improve your experience if they have availability. We requested a specific room number and were allocated this room even though it was a different category to what we had booked. Rooms are clean, modern with some nice touches. We were able to check in early as the room was ready. Some hotels in London are sticklers for check in time. We mentioned we were celebrating a birthday and had cupcakes waiting for us in the room. Any requests from room service or reception are promptly responded to. The location is simply perfect -10 min walk to Leicester Square. 5 min walk from Green Park Station. Well worth a visit.",5,2015,02,03
144,"great staff, location & value but rooms very small","good location and lovely staff. restaurant is very funky as is the bar. breakfast good. rooms very small (classic double is the size of a premier inn room) but well maintained, decorated with good facilities. good value",4,2015,01,31
144,Faultless,"We stayed her on Saturday night and everything from swift check in including a bottle of Champagne put in our room as it was my partner's 50th birthday. We arrived early before check in time and I'd asked if it was possible to get into the room early as we were going to a matinee. They asked us to wait in their beautiful lounge for a few minutes whilst the room was checked. We were shown to our room by a charming member of staff. The room was very nice, albeit the bathroom is small, but hey perfectly adequate.
We had cocktails much later after dinner which were superb and the bar is just delightful as are the staff.
The breakfast was great, plenty of fruit, cereals and pastries and delicious cooked breakfasts. My partner went for the full English and I had kippers. 
I left my iPhone charger in the room and only realised once we returned home. They were exceptionally helpful, the reception lady checked the housekeeping diary and they had logged the charger as found so my partner collected it the next day as he doesn't work far away, but they would have posted it.
The decor is lovely throughout, location 5 minutes from Green Park tube, with ample places to eat and drink, the food and drinks lovely, but it is the superb staff who really set Flemings a cut above. I've eaten here for dinner once and had also found the staff etc fabulous.",5,2015,01,27
144,Hidden Gem in Mayfair,"Flemings is a hidden gem in Mayfair.  The management and staff at this property made our stay delightful:  they couldn't have been more friendly and accommodating.  The proximity to Green Park, Buckingham Palace, restaurants, shopping, museums, and transportation couldn't be better.  The room was clean and modern, my only complaint was the lack of space, which of course is typical of hotels in London and Europe.  I was assured by management that the refurbished rooms will be even better with more space.  The fitness centre, restaurants and bar were also excellent.  I would have given this hotel an excellent; however, I felt that the space issue and the construction at this time downgraded my review.  We do look forward to returning next year and enjoying this property.  Thank you.",4,2015,01,22
144,Birthday stay,"A wonderful one night stay in this very funky hotel. The staff were very helpful and attentive. Nothing was too much trouble. Our room was very nice and the beds were comfortable - even the pillows!! There were even birthday cupcakes and cookies on special birthday plates waiting for us which was lovely. 
The lounge area is beautiful - luxurious chairs and a nice fire. We had nightcaps in the bar which was also very nicely decorated and had an intimate feel to it.
Breakfast was delicious - lots to choose from on the continental buffet and a good choice for the cooked breakfast too.
The hotel itself was a fab location - a few minutes from the nearest underground station.
All in all, a wonderful boutique hotel.",5,2015,01,21
144,Christmas Stay 2014,WE had almost a week in this hotel over Christmas. It is in an excellent position to all the essential places one wants to visit and close to Green Park station. The staff were very friendly and made our Christmas stay a memorable one. It has a luxurious and comfortable atmosphere. Our room was very clean and comfortable and a good size. The food at dinner and breakfast was lovely.,5,2015,01,12
144,"Great location, great quality","The hotel is well located, has good facilities and has a very professional and gentle staff. The price is very reasonable and the rooms are modern, clean and very comfortable. The only issue could be if you have a room facing the construction work going on in the street behind the hotel.",4,2015,01,12
144,A great stay at the Flemings Mayfair,"We spent recently on holiday three nights in London , we decided to book this hotel based on the reports we read .. and it was indeed a great stay. 
First of all the location is really excellent , quiet but very convenient , just a few meters  away from Green Park, and the right spot to start exploring London.
We prepaid our room and we got immediately a nice surprise checking in ... we got an upgrade to one of the new apartments .. really very stilish and plenty of space and comfort. We recommend to have breakfast at the hotel in the morning .. it is very good and the best way to start the day, we got it included in our rate in fact... good pick if you can.
The atmosphere in the hotel is someway special .. we really liked the lounge -fire open room , the furniture and also the corridors with so many nice black and white pictures from the past on the walls.  A very good choice in its category.
",5,2015,01,10
144,Lovely,"I stayed at Flemings during a 4 days trip with my mum and my sister... 
we were actually booked at the Hyatt but their kitchen decided to explode just 2 days before our arrival in London.. so looking for a family-room last minute was not easy.. 
but i found this cosy boutique-hotel, well located in Mayfair, we had a quite 3-bed room with breakfast... i have to admit... the breakfast was at least so good as many 5-stars.. and is served in a very fashion-room... apparently they have a great tea-time, but we had already a booking at f&m... the staff was very nice and ready to help at anytime, only one small note about the bathroom that was a bit small... but than you have to realize that you are staying in Mayfair and the buildings are hystorical..so... for London standards I found this hotel very well balanced between price and service. I'll be surely back",4,2015,01,10
144,Fabulous management makes for fabulous vacation!,"We spent 5 nights in London at the Flemings Mayfair and were pleased with every aspect of our stay.  We arrived on a Friday morning around 10am after a long over night flight.  We checked into the junior suite we had booked.  Our travel agent had notified the hotel that we would be arriving early and they managed to have our room ready and waiting for us upon our arrival (which was well before the specified check in time).  The junior suite was lovely and spacious but there was a large construction project directly across the street.  We were so exhausted, we got out our earplugs and took a brief nap.  We have to say that we were not looking forward to hearing this noise every day of our stay in London.  We decided to freshen up and go out to explore the Mayfair neighborhood.  On our way to the lobby we opted to speak with the front desk about the construction noise and see if another comparable room was available away from the noise.  The desk clerk was very polite, but explained there was not another junior suite available during our stay and the only room available away from the construction noise was a family room.  She also explained that the family room was smaller than the junior suite we currently had booked.  She also promised us that the construction would not start before 8am and would stop daily at 5pm.  Although these were not ideal circumstances, we thanked her for the information and began on our way.  We were then approached by the Guest Services Manager, Claudia, who had heard our conversation with the clerk.  She was very sympathetic to our situation, especially since we had booked our 5 night stay so far in advance.  She offered us an upgrade to a one bedroom apartment at no additional charge.  Although the construction was across the street from the sitting room area, you could not hear the noise from the bedroom that was separated by 2 doors from the sitting room.  We were so pleased with this option and she had the staff to move our bags from the junior suite to the apartment for us while we were out exploring Mayfair.  The one bedroom apartment was so spacious, comfortable and quiet we would book it as our first choice next time we visit London.

Everyone at the Flemings Mayfair was polite and helpful.  We visited the bar and restaurant and found the food and service first class.  The concierge was most helpful with restaurant and sightseeing suggestions.  He also made several phone calls on our behalf reserving and confirming times for activities we had planned.  The doormen always greeted us with a smile and were quick in getting a taxi for us when we requested.

We highly suggest this hotel to anyone visiting London.  The location is beautiful and near parks, shopping and restaurants.  The construction was the only downfall and is certainly not the fault of the hotel.  When making reservations I would simply bring it to their attention that you are aware of the construction and make your reservation based on what rooms are available away from the noise.  We were told the construction will be ongoing for 2 years.  If you have any questions or concerns, ask for Claudia.  She is such a thoughtful person and a perfect Guest Services Manager.",5,2015,01,08
144,Good location and friendly staff,"We stayed at this hotel only for 3 nights, but it was enough to know how friendly and caring the staff was. The first room my parents got was small and the view was to the air conditioner vents, but after they complaint they changed them to another room the day after, without any hesitation. 
Location is great, close to the park and metro station. it makes it very easy to move around.",5,2015,01,07
144,Lovely Flemings,Always nice to return to flemings - from the lovely doorman - doormen- to the friendly staff and welcome. The rooms are probably small but they're rather lovely and the windows open. Everyone on staff are friendly and helpful - I'll keep going back,5,2015,01,07
144,"Good location, small rooms","The location is ideal for business meetings in Mayfair. The service is nice, the rooms comfortable, but as expected for a boutique hotel in this location pretty small. It is ok for a shirt stay, if one doesn't spend a lot of time in the room",4,2015,01,07
144,Excellent,"First time I stayed at this hotel booked 5 rooms for my family, all rooms were excellent. A warm welcome and the location is perfect will definitely be back in the summer. Thank you to all the staff for a lovely stay",5,2015,01,07
144,A Home Away from Home,"Flemings is a cozy hotel in a perfect location for a traveler.  While Half Moon Street isn't the prettiest street in London, its proximity to Green Park, Knightsbridge, Piccadilly Circus and Mayfair make it convenient to getting around and it is quiet.  The rooms are a bit small and but very nicely done, updated and cozy with radiant heat floors in the bathroom. Whatever amenity you may be missing the staff will bring right away when asked. We also rented an apartment that was bright and sunny with a washer&dryer making it great for our 8 night stay. Flemings is a small hotel but has many of the amenities of a larger hotel and those make it even more attractive.  I only wish they might change the slightly garish decor of the bar and salon which, while new and perhaps an attempt to be sophisticated, just don't sit well with me - however, maybe I'm the only one. It seems as if they are doing a gradual make-over and it is obvious where updates have been done. And, this small negative certainly would not stop me from staying again or from recommending Flemings.  It's a gem.",4,2015,01,06
144,Excellent,Excellent location and service. We stayed in family room for 3 of us and was ample room. There were bathrobes for our daughter and even a bed time book which was great. She also has coeliac disease and was well catered for at breakfast.,5,2015,01,06
144,"Great Location, Below Average Hotel","I worked across from the Mayfair for two years, it appeared to be a great looking hotel. I was seriously mistaken when I decided to stay there on a return trip to London as I knew the location was perfect and I thought the hotel was meant to be one of the better ones, it wasn't. 

The rooms were tiny even by UK standards, they also weren't clean, The carpet looked like it belonged in an old Las Vegas hotel room, worse was the sliding glass door for the bathroom which meant you could hear every single bowel movement your partner had, the distance between the toilet bowl and your bed is about 1 meter. The views over an alley were also very disappointing and meant you never wanted to open the blinds. 

The attitude of the staff was disappointing, they were very nonchalant and dismissive. The bar was impossible to ever have a drink in however the mandarin oriental didn't have the same problem, we had our drinks there with incredible service.

Lastly I booked the hotel on a corporate rate which ended up being significantly more expensive than the rate I could have got directly through the hotel, unfortunately I wasn't aware of this until the end of my stay, obviously the occupation rate must be dropping along with the rates.

In summary the only reason you would stay here is for the location however with so many other options in the same area it wouldn't make sense to stay here. If the cost was reduced inline with what you get then there may be a case for staying here, however given the cost for my next personal or business trip I will be staying somewhere else.

My stay was 8 nights in July 2014. I travel at least once a month for work.",1,2015,01,03
144,Good location and breakfast - but that is all,"The hotel has a wonderful location in Mayfair close to Green Park and with easy access from Heatrow. The breakfast was very good, with pleasant staff and good selection of food. But the rooms are very small, both in size and height. Our room was also and almost without windows, with the hotel's ventilation system standing right outside our window and being noisy. Badly maintained room and with limited facilities. In short, this hotel is in a totally different league from other hotels in the Small Luxury Hotels of the World chain we have visited. No luxury in this hotel.

The free wifi in the hotel room was terrible. Only one device at a time, and necessary to log in several times.",2,2015,01,01
144,True Gem in London,Flemings Mayfair is amazing in many ways: tucked away on a side street very close to Buckingham Palace and a short walk to Piccadilly theaters.  Lots of great restaurants & bistros nearby. Staff is superb and courteous in every way--very personal service--they accomodated every request we had.  Rooms are super clean and luxurious--best hotel beds we've slept in this year!!  I will come stay here next time I travel to London for sure!!,5,2014,12,31
144,London visit 31/12/14,Great location near the Green Park tube station. However the hotel is quite expensive at almost $500/night USD. Our bathroom (Room 327) had mold issues as seen on the attached photo. Not something you should see at this price point. Service was excellent in the restaurant and other staff members were very helpful. Rooms need updating. WiFi is free which is nice.,3,2014,12,31
144,4 Star with lots of character and great location,"Best feature is with out a doubt LOCATION !!

We had a Family Room with was comfortable but did face the construction site. noise was no bother but it was Christmas so site was only partially active.

Breakfast was great. Good variety and quality.

Staff were friendly and helpful. Concierge service was excellent - nothing was to much trouble.",5,2014,12,26
144,A Gem of a Hotel,"We planned a weekend Christmas break & booked directly with the hotel, we thought the price was very reasonable & the the hotel looked good on their website.

The reality didn't disappoint.

Tucked down a delightful street in the heart of Mayfair the location was absolutely perfect. The hotel is not over large & has a very personable feel to it which we enjoyed.

The room we were given was not overlarge but very comfortable & clean. 

Also a large flat screen TV which had more channels than anyone would need, including all the SKY sports channels which in similar hotels we have stayed in previously have not been offered. 

The bed & the pillows were extremely comfortable & the bathroom was well appointed & the towels were again better than we have experienced previously at other comparable hotels.

Our booking included breakfast which also impressed us. Staff were very helpful & accommodating & the breakfast itself was first class with a good & wide range of hot & cold offerings.

We had hoped to find time to enjoy an afternoon Tea which the hotel offer, as it  looked both  luxurious & tempting but alas time did not allow this to be enjoyed.

Overall a wonderful hotel & we will definitely come back for our next stay in the West end.
First Class!",5,2014,12,20
144,Underwhelmed,"Arrived to find my junior suite was in a Townhouse two doors down from the hotel.Porter who showed me to the room did not offer to carry my bag.Suite was o.k but noisy from the street below, building work next door and T.V. in room next door.Bathroom was badly designed, shower screen makes bath barely accessible,can't flush the loo without closing the lid.I waited 20 minutes for my cooked breakfast to arrive in the restaurant.I specified no black pudding and I asked for 2 soft poached eggs.I got black pudding and two poached eggs that were like golf balls.I paid £426 Inc tax for a suite for one night and breakfast.For that kind of money I should have stuck with the Savoy or the Connaught which are in a totally different league.Not impressed on any level.",3,2014,12,19
144,Best hotel in Mayfair,"Just completed my 3rd visit to this hotel. Location is very convenient to all major attractions, just a stones throw from Buckingham palace and Green Park tube station. Staff is always friendly and attentive, morning breakfast has more offerings that you can eat. Always clean, lobby always smells nice especially during Christmas. Such a nice change from the large chain hotels. ",5,2014,12,11
144,disappointing room,"The best asset of the hotel is its location and overall the hotel is nice and the breakfast is good. 

Unfortunately, there is some construction work in a nearby street at the moment so my parents' room was very noisy. Apart from the noise (which is not the hotel's fault), my parents' room was lovely. 

The room i shared with my husband was very average. It was a tiny double bedroom with a small window that could not be left opened as it was right next to the A/C unit noise. The hotel is also heated through in a way that makes the rooms boiling hot despite the fact it's December. I like a cosy warm room, but our room was so hot and tiny that it made me feel claustrophobic.  At the end, we had to turn the air conditioning on at 3am as we were unable to sleep. 

I am not saying this is a bad hotel. I think we were just unlucky and received what could be called a ""room downgrade"". I won't go back to this hotel as I would not want to sleep in the room we had again.",3,2014,12,09
144,Lovely Place,"Very nice place .. I was there on business.  I love the Mayfair area.  Small bathrooms and shower and expensive breakfast, but very nice staff and otherwise comfortable room.  Near the commuter station.  I would stay again.",4,2014,12,09
144,Avoid,"Lots of staff poor management/organisation.

Promises made at reservation not kept at check in. Attempted to close the bar with no notice for a private party. Orders taken for tea but not provided. Showers not properly cleaned.",1,2014,12,09
144,Best big birthday celebration ever!,"What a fantastic few days staying at Flemings in Mayfair. The whole team were brilliant.  Attentive, helpful and not intrusive but at the same time keeping everything very personal.  Nothing was too much trouble and our apartment was excellently appointed, super clean, and modern, whilst retaining an air of bygone luxury.  We will definitely stay again.  Wonderful and no guests will be disappointed!",5,2014,12,07
144,Terrible Value,"As a businessman who travels quiet frequently I must say I am very disappointed in Flemings. Please take my word for it when I tell you don't book here, to be quite honest I was disappointed on so many levels from the minute I checked in, rooms are terribly small (even though I upgraded) walls are paper thin you can hear everything in the hallway and the maids cleaning closet, breakfast is terrible (they said a buffet was included but it was only cold cereal etc..) my key card constantly wouldn't work I had to go down and change it 8 times! Do you know how annoying that is.. Not worth your money. I never write reviews in fact this is my first one but after this experience I just had to.",1,2014,12,07
144,Exceptional value in Mayfair,"My first visit to Flemings but will certainly stay again. Great value, excellent service and so well located. My room was excellent and considering the location not that small. Comfortable bed and everything spotlessly clean. Nice bathroom which would benefit from a shaving mirror. Had breakfast which was individually cooked , not the usual dried out buffet. Bar a bit on the expensive side",5,2014,12,06
144,"A comfortable, clean and well maintained hotel.","In London we prefer to stay in Mayfair.  This was our first visit to this hotel, booked online.  The day before we made a telephone enquiry to confirm details and were greeted by an enthusiastic and friendly front desk agent. On arrival we were promptly registered and found our room to be well appointed and spotlessly clean.
Breakfast (inclusive in our case) was well presented by smiling staff.  At every stage of our stay we were addressed by friendly staff, both front of house and elsewhere.  We look forward to returning.",4,2014,12,05
144,A special place with exceptional staff,"I had Flemmings Hotel Mayfair recommended to me by friends recently,so I thought we would give it a try, to celebrate my wife's birthday. Upon booking reception enquired if our trip was a special occasion,I confirmed.....Well what a superb place. Champagne on arrival,magnificent 2 bedroomed duplex suite, fantastic bar,excellent dining room and tremendous staff. If you want a special hotel this is the ONE..... !",5,2014,12,05
144,Return vist after a long time away,"I stayed here a few times about 10 years ago and I am pleased to say that the standard of accommodation and service hasn't changed in that time.

The bedroom was well appointed, if not very large, but the bed was comfortable and everything that one would need for a single night's stay was provided.

The bathroom was small, with nowhere to place a washbag next to the sink, apart from on the floor. I am sure that those using make-up bags etc in the bathroom would find the whole thing very frustrating.

The bar area is a bit ""designer"" for my taste, and I had to sit in the breakfast area due to a lack of available seating, even though it wasn't busy.

No comment on the breakfast as I had to leave too early.",4,2014,12,05
144,Great non visit,"I booked this hotel not realising they had a draconian cancelation policy, had to cancel, not the night before, several weeks before, because my meeting was cancelled but I was still charged. My own fault for not reading the small print, but now I am being bombarded with emails about my stay and offers of discounts when I stay again.  I am afraid out of principle I would never book again",1,2014,12,05
144,It could have been better,"I stayed at Flemings 4 days, I had an issue at the check in, that I had not a booking, even though I showed them an email sent by them. it was solved but after waiting for one hour. I enjoyed the stay there and everything was so good, in terms of room location and service. I wanted to stay more because I enjoyed the area, again they could find me a place for another two days, we were 4 people and stayed in 3 rooms for 4 days. even that I liked the stay , I might be hesitated to stay there again.",3,2014,12,04
144,Left a little wanting,"Have stayed here before and was impressed, so when I had a chance to return, I jumped at it.
I stayed in a ground floor room - no view, tiny window looking up on ducts and ladders.
The room was very warm (despite it being early winter), so on arriving in the evening turned the aircon on. By the time I went to bed, I turned the aircon off (Need a quiet room). Unfortunately the aircon did not agree and every 10 minutes let out a loud sound which woke me up. Eventually by 3am and no sleep beyond 10 minutes I relented, turned it back on, put in ear plugs and managed 3 hours of fitful sleep. When I reported it, the front desk simply said they would ask someone to have a look.
Wi-fi access was woefully slow and kept dropping out and requiring a router re-set at the front desk.
TV sound was also sporadic, with the result I could not watch certain channels.
Breakfast was very pleasant and tasty.",4,2014,12,03
144,I found the true meaning of Thanksgiving at Fleming's.  I shall return there often,"On a whim, I decided to go to London for Thanksgiving on 11.11.14.  I found the hotel on Amora, at a wonderful price for a single, with breakfast.  Prior to arrival, I corresponded with Andrew the concierge,  upon arrival Branca was there to greet me and send me to the Front Room for tea since it was 9 a.m. London time and my room wasn't yet ready.  Off on my itinerary, I returned found my room charming, napped and had a late bite in the restaurant, where the service was wonderful and found the extraordinary Dessert, The Eaton Mess.( so good I had it the next nite for dinner after theater!) I asked the restaurant manager about crumpets, the next morning, THE PASTRY CHEF made me fresh crumpets.  They should be on the menu they were so good, but...then you wouldn't taste her delicious croissants. Ephemeral!  Then, my last day, the true kindness of the entire staff became obvious, when I had my wallet stolen with all my money and documents. Pedro, Claudia are only two of the wonderful individuals who helped me.  I can't say enough wonderful things about the hotel.  I received hugs when I left, I felt like I was leaving my family, albeit from many other mums.  It taught me and renewed my feeling about my fellow men.  They are wonderful.  A very safe place for women alone to stay!  I may have not mentioned the names of all the wonderful staff, but to a person they were all lovely human beings.  Thank you Flemings.",5,2014,12,02
144,Best family hotel in London!,"Everything about this opulent yet friendly hotel is faultless. The staff are so charming and sincere and made us feel so welcome. The rooms were absolutely fabulous and are possibly the best we have stayed in in London. They are huge and beautifully decorated with every possible luxury you can think of. The dining experience was also very impressive.

We stayed here with our three small children in an apartment which was more like a private townhouse. (Room 601) Set out over two storeys with its own garden this place was absolutely fantastic! The children loved it too.

Upon arrival the reception staff were so attentive to the children and made sure that all our needs were catered for. Adrian continued to check that we were ok throughout our stay. The concierge must also be mentioned for a first class service. This hotel is on the up so get a room while you can before it becomes too popular......",5,2014,11,30
144,First Class,"Our first stay at this Mayfair hotel and found the whole experience first class. On arrival we were help from our car and greeted by name. My car then taken for valet parking which was again without fuss and the two days parking charge was less than I would normally pay at the underground car park at Park Lane.
We found all the staff courteous, and all delivered a first class service. The hotel was clean as was our room.
Location could not be better and Mayfair is the place to stay in central London",5,2014,11,30
144,"Flemings Hotel, Mayfair","Really, really lovely hotel. The staff were excellent and so friendly. Perfect situation. Our room was really comfortable and especially quite, the bathroom was spotless and everything we needed was provided. Would highly recommend this hotel.
It was very quick and easy to check in as well as the check out process. 
The staff couldn't have been more helpful. Just absolutely perfect all round.",5,2014,11,29
144,Great hotel pitty about no sleep!,Lovely hotel but don't count on getting much sleep! The windows in the rooms are old wooden single glazed so although the rooms are stylish you may as well be outside with the noise and drafts. Location was great just lack of sleep for 2 days killed me.,3,2014,11,29
144,What a gem!,My wife and I had a wonderful stay at Flemings. ALL the staff were very helpful and friendly and welcoming. Excellent service. The room was well appointed and a good size for a Central London hotel. We were very happy with every element of our stay. We can't wait to return! Thank you Flemings. ,5,2014,11,28
144,Business & Pleasure,"Needed an hotel in this area without being ripped off so took my time reading reviews.
For the price and location I chose well.From the door being opened for me I was treated like a lord, 
The hotel was a tad more expensive than I usually pay but worth it compared to many in the area.
Rooms a little small but cosy.If I was stopping more than a couple of nights it could have been a problem.
Food ?Couldnt get into the restaurant booked full but breakfast was decent which was part of the board .
Had issues with the television didnt work properly also I was doing some work early evening couldnt find a pen or pencil in the room anywhere.
Small issues but hey only there one night.
Would I go again? Yes I would.",4,2014,11,27
144,Amazing experience,"My daughter in law, friend & myself stayed here for 1 night at The Flemings Mayfair & certainly weren't disappointed in any way. On arrival we were offered a complimentary upgrade to an apartment. It was beautiful, spacious & newly furnished. Very  luxurious. We ate our evening meal in the restaurant which we all enjoyed. So much to choose from at  breakfast too. Nothing was too much trouble for any of the staff. We would certainly recommend this hotel to anyone & will definitely stay here if we visited London again.
Linda Warren",5,2014,11,26
144,Only a one night stay,"I only had a one night stay, but I can honestly say it was a very pleasant experience. The important bit, the room, which was very clean, comfortable and quiet. The staff are extremely polite and attentive, especially the doormen. I would definitely recommend this hotel for all the above as well as its location, being close to all that the West End of London has to offer.",5,2014,11,25
144,Flemings was great,"Everything was just top-notch.  Remarkably nice and professional staff.  Clean and well-appointed room.  Perfect location in Mayfair right near the Green Park underground stop.

I stayed here the night of November 19, 2014.",5,2014,11,24
144,Homey Hotel -  I liked it :),"If one wanted to be picky about details there are a lot of things to be picky about, if finding fault is your thing. Putting that aside this is a hotel that you can feel comfortable in and have a room larger than most other London hotels in its class. After being at the hotel for four nights it feels like home, the staff are not ""polished"" but helpful, the location is very well suited for walking to many places of interest.
One thing to get sorted though is the Internet, the hotel claims that Internet is included in the room price but fail to advise that it is far too slow and intermittent unless you sign up to pay ten pounds for ten hours for par for the course broadband speeds!! All is not loss however, if you point out that fast Internet service has been made available at every other hotel that you have staid at, which is true for me, they will take the cost off of your invoice.
I would definitely stay at the Fleming again.",4,2014,11,23
144,Charming boutique hotel,"The Flemings Mayfair, a lovely boutique hotel extremely well located near Barkeley Square in London, consists a series of townhouses strung together. My husband and I were traveling with our daughter and her husband, and the two rooms we had were large, well appointed, comfortable, but couldn’t have been more different.  It was as if we were in two different hotels, the furnishings of both wonderfully designed.

The hotel staff could not have been more helpful to us in finding good restaurants for us to visit, getting theater tickets for us, and helping us with directions to various locations.

The dining room on the ground floor was simple with a simple menu, but quite delicious.  We enjoyed a number of our meals there.

We would certainly like to stay in this hotel again when we visit London, and we recommend it to you.",5,2014,11,19
144,Fantastic location!,"At first I was not sure about this hotel, the first room they gave us was very nice actually but the ceilings too low, we requested a change and they were very accommodating they had another room that we liked better, it was to the back of the building no view but a very comfortable room. The people are very nice and the hotel is with in walking distance to the galleries and restaurants. We are going back in the Spring 2015",5,2014,11,19
144,Wonderful Stay at Flemings Mayfair!,"We stayed at Flemings Mayfair the 1st week in November and had a wonderful time.  The hotel is just beautiful and the staff very friendly and efficient.  A full breakfast was included in our room rate and it was delicious.  We stayed in a Classic Room on the first floor and though it was small, it had all the amenities to make our stay an enjoyable one.  Queen size bed, 2 comfortable leather chairs,  large  flat screen TV, coffee/tea service & immaculate marble bath.

An added bonus - the location of Flemings is great!  Near Green Park tube station which made it very convenient to get to & from  Heathrow.  Also close to shopping, restaurants, tourist attractions!

All in all I would highly recommend Flemings Mayfair!",5,2014,11,19
144,A disappointing choice - don't bother!,"I lay in the small, dark, noisy bedroom (costing £240 per night) wishing I had either splashed out on The Savoy (only 50% more expensive ) or simply opted for an unpretentious Premier Inn.
First impressions of The Fleming with a grand modern entrance were good, as was the excellent location, but from the doorman who studiously ignored us to the many uniformed men hanging about in the lobby who were unable to show us to our room, we felt very unwelcome.
Housekeeping was fine, breakfast tasty and the location excellent, but the lack of any sense that we were valued customers made our much-anticipated special trip to this London boutique hotel a real disappointment.",2,2014,11,18
144,Expensive but so is London; great service,"Great location -easy access to Hyde Park, Green Park, Buckingham Palace

Excellent service - great recommendation for dinner at nearby pub for fish and chips (The Only Running Footman)

We got breakfast every morning as part of our room rate and it was above average hotel fare. 

Comfortable king bed (spacious especially after the smaller ones we had earlier in our trip in Italy)

Room was just OK for two, very cramped for the three of us. Low ceilings. Even lower in shower.  Actually ceiling and doorways are dangerously low throughout the hotel if you are over 6 feet tall. 

Incredibly slow elevator. It is better to just take the stairs.

Upon arrival noticed bathroom door was water damaged at bottom. When taking a shower next morning i knew why. A small half glass door on the tub was the only thing between the water and the door. The rest of bathroom was dinged in spots (so was the closet inside). For the room price I would think they would correct these types of things.

Opened the curtains on arrival to see if there was a view: yep a very large and loud construction site. When inquired at front desk about this they said construction won't start until at least 830am. Sure enough 7am the construction began - no need to set an alarm . That said,  it was a very quiet room through the night. The night ends quickly though at 7am sharp.",4,2014,11,18
144,Very friendly unique boutique hotel!,"Attentive staff, but not OTT. Beautifully clean accommodation, fantastic buffet breakfast, the best we have ever experienced. Perfect location. Near to shopping in St James and Mayfair, a short walk from theatre land and just a stroll across the park to visit the Queen!",5,2014,11,18
144,Excellent hotel,"Very friendly staff, excellent service from check-in to check-out.  Booked a competitive rate (for Mayfair) the room was a bit small but well decorated and outfitted. The art work made me smile (see picture).  Bed a bit of a 'tweener' but mattress and pillows of good quality. I loved the bar in the basement with various 'rooms' that took me right back to business meetings I had in the Peppermill in 'a previous life'.  Only the fire pit was missing.  But serious, very cosy and great for a good chat over drinks.  Will return.",4,2014,11,17
144,Terreble room,"Our room was very small room with paper walls, next to cleaning closet. We heard everything from the corridor and stairs, which wasn't nice at 2 am. Very noisy AC, which wasn't fixed even after complaint. If that was turned off room was like Sauna.I didn't sleep in any three nights properly. My last visit to this hotel, even thought location is great.",1,2014,11,17
144,Great London Hotel In Central Location,We really enjoyed our stay.A great apartment with our own door!This hotel is in a superb location for retail(my wife loves that!) and everything London.The staff are friendly and attentive.We had dinner one night which was superb.Breakfast is quite expensive but enjoyable.Yes there is building construction at the back of the hotel but we stayed at the weekend so did not hear much noise.If you like indian fusion food we recommend the nearby Tamarind.,5,2014,11,16
144,Wonderful,"It is the second time that we stayed at Flemings and certainly not the last.
The location is excellent, the staff is extremely friendly and helpful, the rooms are very clean. The decoration of the hotel is so cosy and classy.
Breakfast is very good. I particularly apreciated the fresh fruit salad and the variety of food.
I will for sure come back!
",5,2014,11,11
144,Perfect location - but watch out!,"This is definitely a SLH standard hotel. Loved every bit of its funky decor, friendly staff, amazing concierge and never ending breakfast buffet. Located in the best area of Mayfair, 1 block away from the park and walking distance from everything you need to see in London (and 1 block away from the subway). HOWEVER - and that's where I think my advice is the most valuable - there's a huge construction going on across the street from the hotel. I mean literally 50m from some of the rooms, an enormous building coming up from its foundations. So make sure you ask for rooms that do not face the construction since banging starts before 8am every day.",4,2014,11,11
144,"Great location, friendly staff but small room (single)","Just a few streets from Green Park the Hotel has east access to the subway, but also a short walk to Buckingham, Westminister etc as well as shopping. For me a typical old english hotel, small narrow corridors and room (stayed in a single room), and lots of steps/stairs-however this us the charm and fits the design and very friendly staff. Even at breakfast the service is extra even though the breakfast itself is ok, not the biggest but exactly what you need before heading out. I Will stat here agai ",5,2014,11,11
144,Great central London Hotel,"Very professional and friendly hotel within walking distance of Park Lane and Shepherds market.
High quality rooms in a boutique style hotel.

144,Wonderful  Boutique Hotel,"The staff at this Hotel are just a delight, From our greeting at the door, The Receptionist through to concierge, Cocktail Bar and Restaurant staff . Everyone was very professional,  but so so friendly.

Our room was both magnificent and spotless and had an appearance to die for.

The decor here is first class throughout the hotel, and a beautiful Cocktail Bar with Wonderful Retro Feel.  We loved all the glassware with the amazing fresh flowers and exotic plants throughout the Hotel

Such a Delight",5,2014,11,08
144,"Pricey, but it's a hidden gem","I recently had the pleasure of a stopover at Flemings in Mayfair, while on business in London. The hotel is fairly small with a quirky but classy aspect. The check-in was effortless, the rooms neat and relatively sumptuous with high quality materials and fittings.

The bar in the basement was pretty uninspiring and hugely expensive but friendly staff (Natalia) made up for the pain of my loss which ensued with each fresh round of G&Ts bought.

Breakfast was a Continental affair but fresh and to be honest infinitely preferable to some of the awful Full English efforts I've been served.

Overall pricey but a hidden gem",4,2014,11,06
144,"A ""decent"" hotel...",You have to keep an open mind as to what one can expect in a London boutique hotel. I think flemings does a great job by making up with service and location what it loses with the dark creaky corridors. Get some light in there guys and it will brighten up the salmon walls. I think the price is reasonable for what you get but not great. I struggled to wonder why I didn't pay 20 pounds a night more and end up in a world renewed chain.,4,2014,11,06
144,I do not recommend this hotel to anyone.,"When I read the other reviews on trip advisor and when I saw the photo's of the hotel I thought it would be a good choice for our citytrip. But we were really disappointed. The staff is friendly, but that is about it, all the rest fails even for that price. You better pay a bit more and get what you are paying for. The rooms are small and the ventilation is bad, it is to warm or to cold. You have to open the bathroom door when you are in bed, otherwise you will not be able to open it and squeeze yourself between the bed and the door. Breakfast is just okay, not more than that and it is in a basement room without windows and again a very bad ventilation. 

I do not recommend this hotel to anyone and we will not return.",1,2014,11,03
144,Very nice boutique hotel in a great Mayfair location,"I have only nice things to say about this boutique hotel in London’s Mayfair district.  It’s in a great location on a quiet street just off Green Park.  Very friendly and accommodating staff.  The physical layout of the hotel shows its age but also adds to its character.  Our executive king room was quite comfortable with a nice view of Half Moon Street below and was very reasonably priced.  Numerous restaurants are a very short and convenient walk away, as is access to the Underground (Green Park).  I would definitely return.",4,2014,11,01
144,Our new go-to hotel when we visit London,"We travel mostly for pleasure. After a thorough look at online reviews, taking out the unreasonable ones, we settled on Flemings Mayfair. We chose it because of the location, amenities (updated accommodations in an older building with charm and history), relative value for money, and because it is located on a street that is the title of a book by a favorite author.

This will be our new go-to hotel when we visit London, and we will recommended it to friends and colleagues. The service was excellent, the check-in and -out were easy, staff was attentive without being overly solicitous, and we were generally made to feel comfortable and very much at home. We were especially impressed to see that management was in the lobby taking a hands-on role in the running of the hotel. We look forward to our next visit.",5,2014,10,31
144,"Small but needs imporvements for  name ""Luxury""","I chose this hotel for its central location and closeness to the Green Park and Picadilly plus the fact that it is listed with The Small Luxury Hotels of the World. As a frequent London visitor I was looking forward to making this my regular hotel of choice.
I booked a standard room knowing that it would be small. But there are small rooms offering good comfort. However in my room the bed took about 75% of the floor space apart from the bathroom which was so small that I could hardly make a turn in it. My room was at the back side of the hotel which was a massive construction site for a new building. They started drilling and banging at  8 a.m. ending at 6p.m. 
The lights in the main elevator were broken so I had to travel almost in darkness. But the worst experience was, that the  air condition in my room did not work guaranteeing a sleepless night in this tiny stuffy room.  Mayfair boasts with many small luxurious  hotels and in order to be worthy of the name ""Luxury"" the Fleming Mayfair definitively requires improvement. I will try to give them another chance as their location is superb.",3,2014,10,29
144,Superb hotel,"We recently stayed at Flemings in October 2014 and thought it was superb. We had made a fairly late booking the week before and were travelling as 2 adults and 3 children. We had booked two connecting executive rooms and were told on our arrival that we were being upgraded to a two bed apartment. The apartment was excellent, lots of space, great décor and still had a real boutique hotel feel.
The hotel staff were welcoming and very friendly, took time to speak to us and the kids and you always felt like they were prepared to go out of their way to help.
We only ate breakfast in the hotel, but that was very good and the kids weren't charged for. 
The hotel itself and the décor and arrangement is fantastic, we couldn't understand how it wasn't 5 star.
The location is good and is minutes away from Green Park tube, bus tours went off over the road from outside The Ritz, centre of London one way and Knightsbridge the other, a few minutes walk to Buckingham Palace, the location was excellent. 
We were on a lower floor and there was a little street noise, but not much. 
Other than that we couldn't fault anything, in our opinion this is a 'special hotel' and this will certainly be where we stay the next time we are in London with or without our kids!",5,2014,10,28
144,Lovely boutique hotel,"Good location near to tube station and public transport but set back from the main road,great decor with individually decorated rooms the staff were friendly and very helpful, great customer service. Only ate breakfast in the Hotel but it was an excellent buffet with a good variety to choose from. Look forward to staying again sometime.",5,2014,10,27
144,Fabulous Beautiful Boutique Hotel Great Service,"My daughter, her husband, my ten year old grand daughter and I stayed at Flemings for four nights. It is a beautiful hotel in a wonderfully convenient location. The staff are all extremely helpful and pleasant, and were throughout our entire visit. They were very accommodating, always looking to see what they could do for us.

We had booked a two bedroom two bathroom apartment.  It was spectacular!!  Beautifully furnished and very spacious.  The beds are devine!!

We arrived very early morning from the US.  My grand daughter was really tired. We had a lovely breakfast but as check out was not until noon our room was not ready. The Director of Guest Services, Ms.  Branca Sabbagh, noticed how tired we all were and gave us a beautiful room where we could relax and sleep and shower until our reserved room was ready.  We didn't ask she just found us and asked if we would like to relax and shower 

Both the concierges with whom I dealt, Paul and Andrew provided expert knowledge and booked everything perfectly.

This is a delightful hotel We will certainly stay there again!",5,2014,10,27
144,"Perfect stay, excellent customer service",My husband and I stayed here for the night when we visited london to see miss Saigon. Perfect location for the theatres with nearby reasonably priced parking. The parking recommended on their website is only £17 for all day Saturday and Sunday. What set this hotel apart from others I have stayed at is the the excellent customer service. They were very friendly and went that extra mile to check that we had everything we needed for our stay. The staff here are a real credit the bussiness. I wouldn't hesiste to stay here again. ,5,2014,10,26
144,Watch out for the loud construction outside your window,"This hotel dosen't really live up to its reputation unfortunately. The service upon arrival was good and friendly but the staff in the breakfast cellar must have missed the same education.
The room was very nice and also the bed but opposite the hotel they have a construction going on and they start very early, even at Saturdays.
If you travel with heavy bags you must be prepared of all the stairs the have between all the floors. 
The location is perfect.",3,2014,10,26
144,Exceptional Guest Service,"A boutique hotel with exceptionally helpful people.  The Guest Services Director, Ms. Branca Sabbagh personally saw to every detail necessary to make our stay perfect and memorable.  The in room staff, concierge and bell staff were friendly, attentive and helpful with everything from cabs to tube locations, from great nearby restaurants to maps and directions.  The restaurant was excellent and gave quality for cost.  This hotel is excellent for London visitors from novice to old timers in a great location for eating, sightseeing and shopping.  And if you need an island in a storm, this is an elegant point, with a bar.",5,2014,10,23
144,Fantastic hotel - good location,"Staff were very attentive and friendly. Room was clean and comfortable except for the fact we overlooked a building site. If we were staying longer, we would have asked for a different room. However, this is not the hotels fault that that have a building site in the next street! This hotel is close to  some major attractions - Buckingham Palace, Piccadilly Circus, Oxford Street. Also, as we came to see a show, only a 20 -30 minute walk to Covent Garden and theatre land.",4,2014,10,23
144,Great Location / Mediocre Experience,"POSITIVES : Located very close to all major attractions - Buckingham Palace , Picadilly Circus , Soho , Hyde Park Corner , Regent Street , etc., etc. Great service from the staff . 

NEGATIVES :The room we had was comfortable except for 3 things - 1..It was on the ground floor so we were not able to open our blinds because of all the people traffic walking by . 2.  There was a huge stain on the carpet , as you enter the room . 3. It did not have the appropriate toiletries for my wife - i.e. cotton balls , etc.  For the price of the room , and the hotels reputation & 4-Star claim ,very disappointing !. Also the bar is in the basement and the décor is way too contemporary for the style of the hotel - terribly uncomfortable .",3,2014,10,20
144,Extremely impressed!,"We arrived around midday and we're attended to by doorman who took our bags and escorted us to reception where we were checked in efficiently and quickly - with a surprise upgrade to the penthouse apartment! Obviously we couldn't check in at that time but we planned to leave the hotel and explore the area- which by the way is fabulous and central!
The young man (forgotten his name- not long started at the hotel) showed us to the Apartment and it's features. We were blown away! It was incredible! Luxurious, spacious, fab decor and elegant! The bed was comfortable, linen and towels were exquisite and the elevator with private access right to our hallway was such a treat!
The room service was quick, breakfast was fabulous and the service attentive. The wifi was terrible, the view outside the back windows was too (building site) but we couldn't hear it - so that was the main thing! We will definitely be back for our next visit to London in November. We work in luxury hospitality sector and were so impressed with the service and attention to detail by the staff at this hotel.

144,Beautiful Apartments and Fantastic Service!,"We were at the Flemings Mayfair with our two grown children.
The two bedroom apartment was perfect! It was beautiful, clean and very comfortable.
The service was beyond our expectations! The entire staff was attentive, warm and friendly.
Special shout out to Katie Avel! She is a rock star!",5,2014,10,17
144,Reliable hotel in the heart of London,"This was my 2nd time in Flemings Mayfair. We asked for an quiet room and got it behind of the building, which was well done. The heating was warm, but it was possible to open the window and we were happy. The room was clean. The house is old, but because of friendly service and having a reletively cheap flight/hotel packet, I give Flemings Mayfair four and not three stars.",4,2014,10,17
144,fleming's mayfair a lousy catch! a -4 stars hotel ...,"After having booked through @londonservicedapartments.co.uk, and after having checked thoroughly whether the windows opened, the room was peaceful, and other amenities one expects from an hotel that claims being worth 4 stars and charge the price of a 4 stars,  I arrived  on October 13th, for 2 nights. Mind you, I had initially booked 3 nights and had been confronted to the ""usual no refund policy one gets on websites"". Anyway, I had asked for a quiet room, well this is not what I got, most likely the noisiest room of Mayfair. To top that, the shower was not only weak, scarce, but also cold, freezing cold, whilst the wifi did not work at all... Not to mention the restaurant which is hardly open, and certainly not when other restaurants in the neighborhood are closed and when you would love a late night whatever to comfort you after an hectic day in London. All of this for 1500 PdSt. So disappointing, don't venture there, you are in for bad surprises.",2,2014,10,15
144,Great location excellent service!,"I stayed four nights with my wife at Flemings Mayfair. From the first moment we stepped in we felt the warm hospitality, the kindlness and the friendliness of its personnel. Superb cleanliness and service and   great location, the best location in London if there on vacation or business. There is no other place for me and my wife whenever we are in London than Flemings Mayfair. And a last word congradulations to the manager and her team for attending in the best quick and efficient way of all concerns and suggestions of their clients. Loucaides

144,Great Hotel,"We stayed for a week and thoroughly enjoyed our time at Flemings Mayfair. The associates were always professional and supported the upscale style of this hotel well. Our room was very clean and well appointed. I've stayed at European hotels in both Dublin and Portugal and have found them to be smaller compared to American rooms; and our room here was on par with that. That being said, it was absolutely fine and larger than some rooms I've stayed in at in hotels like the W in NYC. It's just the way Euro hotels are. The location was great, just a block or two from the Green Park Underground Station on the Piccadilly line. The only con for the hotel is out of their control - there is a bit of construction going on in the area and some daytime noise associated with it, but it didn't impact our comfort. I would stay here again and would absolutely recommend it to those looking for a great and intimate experience in Mayfair.",5,2014,10,13
144,Small room,"We booked our room in this hotel over 3 months ago as we were attending a party at Langans and wanted a room within walking distance. Having paid the extra for an executive room we were a little disappointed on arrival to be told our room was unavailable due to the previous occupants still being in situ due to illness. 

Rather than being upgraded on our room choice we were bumped downwards and offered a double room instead which was a little disappointing, however the hotel offered us champagne in our room or a complimentary dinner in the restaurant as compensation, (both of which we declined as we were going to be out at a champagne reception followed by dinner from 5pm). 
A partial refund was also not offered, even though I enquired, as we had booked out room in advance and therefore had got it at a discounted price which would be less than the price of the double on he day.

As it wasn't the fault of the hotel that the previous occupant was unwell and we couldn't avail ourselves of any of their compensatory offerings (and we needed a room for the night) we took it on the chin and accepted the replacement room

The replacement room was quite small, but beautifully decorated and spotlessly clean so we had no complaints. 

The other disappointment was the view; a complete building site which we hadn't been warned about when booking the room. However, work did stop at about 4pm on Saturday and hadn't resumed by the time we left at 9.30am on Sunday so we got a good nights sleep.

It's a very friendly peaceful hotel and I would have given it a 5 star rating were it not for the two blips mentioned above.",4,2014,10,12
144,Peace and Sophistication just off Piccadilly,"We recently had an excellent 3 course meal at Flemings.    The dining room was cosy and quiet apart from some excellent background music. Service was efficient and friendly without being patronising.   Our seafood starter was delicious, calves liver and seabass main courses well cooked and the American cheesecake and berries and Crème Brulee with little biscuits absolutely gorgeous.    After leaving the busy environs of the West End, it was a little haven of peace and sophistication.",5,2014,10,10
144,Good Mayfair location,"Very good little hotel in the heart of Mayfair, excellent location for shopping, sightseeing, and for being in the nice side of London. It was my second visit for business, but because of its great location, you are also able to enjoy being in London.",4,2014,10,07
144,Great value for the location!,"I've always tried to stay away from really trendy areas in London as they are very expensive. On a search this hotel appeared which was in Mayfair, within my budget, and rooms looked tidy and modern so I gave it a try.

The stay was really good and I do recommend it for travelers looking to explore the West end side of London. A lot of locations are within walking distance (Hyde Park, St James Park, Piccadilly Circus, Chinatown, Covent Garden). It is snuck away just off the main street Piccadilly so it is rather quiet.

The hotel itself was well renovated and kept new. The rooms are a tad small and the walls/doors are not extremely sound proof so if you are a very light sleeper you may want to take into account. The bathroom facilities are complete and relatively roomy. I highly recommend this hotel for its location.",4,2014,10,06
144,Good location with excellent service,The staff went out of their way to be very helpful. The rooms were comfortable and a reasonable size. The hotel is situated in a central part of Mayfair so getting around was easy. We would stay at this hotel again!,4,2014,10,04
144,Very good hotel,"We stayed at the Flemings for a weekend with extended family. The rooms were very good and a reasonable size. We moved to an apartment for the 2nd night however as there were 4 of us in one family room (2 being young children) & the room wasn't quite large enough to sleep both kids but the 1 bed apartment was superb - brand new and a very high spec with everything you could need and very spacious and generous for 4 of us - would highly recommend. The location of the hotel could not be better - it's excellent- 5 mins from Buckingham palace if sightseeing and so close to some fantastic restaurants and shops. Would highly recommend- not stupidly priced as alot of these London hotels are and very nice, modern and tasteful accommodation. The breakfast was very good also and the staff couldn't have been more helpful with our room change and in general. If you have young children- this is a great bet for you - they are very child friendly and even leave the kids their own slippers and there are cookies and milk etc at bedtime. All in all a great stay and would definitely stay again and recommend to anyone no problems ",4,2014,10,01
144,When in Mayfair,"Stayed overnight while meeting friends from Australia. From the moment we arrived  we were greeted by friendly smiling staff, quite an old hotel with winding corridors once you leave the main guest areas everything has been brought up to date, our room was light and comfortable 
Although there was a building site opposite which was noisy in the daytime and quiet at night.
We would stay here again. good location.",4,2014,09,30
144,"Superb boutique hotel, classic British service","Lovely small boutique hotel in the heart of London, walking distance to tube station and Piccadilly. Tasteful furnishings, and a personalised service that makes it feel special.  Rooms are compact, but its a very old building in centre of London, so you have to be realistic.  Also quite expensive, but hey, its London.  Will definitely try to book this again for my next visit!",5,2014,09,29
144,"Great location, great hotel","We stayed for just one night at Flemings for our anniversary. The hotel is a couple of minutes walk to Green Park tube station and is within easy walk of lots of places in Central London, it took 15 minutes to walk to Picadilly. Staff were very nice and welcoming, room was lovely, not very big - we had the standard double but big enough, with TV, mini bar, hairdryer and iron. The bathroom was lovely with bathrobes and White Company toiletries. Only slight downside was the room was very warm and the air con a bit too noisy - then again I could have opened the window.
When I booked I mentioned it was our anniversary and the hotel delivered a free bottle of champagne to our room- very nice touch. Buffet breakfast was extensive and the serving staff were very pleasant. Would definitely book here again",5,2014,09,28
144,"Fantastic hotel, fantastic location, fantastic staff",My husband and I stayed at Flemings last weekend and absolutely loved it.  The reception staff were superb and so friendly and welcoming.  The room was extremely stylish and very comfortable.  I would definitely recommend to anyone looking to stay right at the heart of London.  ,5,2014,09,27
144,"Great location, terrible noise insulation","Flemings is located in the heart of Mayfair close to Green Park, Piccadilly and Brompton Road etc. Rooms are small and some of the furniture is a little worn. The bathrooms are small with a tiny shower which if you are approaching 6 foot cannot be stood directly under because of the ceiling height. The worse part is the awful sound insulation - every cough, sniffle, conversation, bodily function and toilet flushing can be clearly heard from adjacent rooms, whilst the noise from the construction site is very loud. Wifi is frustratingly slow. On the plus side, staff are very professional, friendly and helpful.",3,2014,09,26
144,Nights stay and afternoon tea,"My husband and i stayed here last month. Staff at the hotel were all helpful and polite. Check in was easy, the reception area pleasent. Doorman great and always smiling and ready with an unbrella for the unpredicable weather.
The rooms were small but comfortable. Wifi throughout the hotel too.
Breakfast was okay but the not the best. Things weren't kept that hot and when we ordered fresh toast it arrived right away but was cold - strange! 
Following our night stay we had afternoon tea which was very nice. service again was good and there was plently for the two of us. 
Location wise really great, near tube station and short walk from many bars and resturarants.",4,2014,09,26
144,Room for improvement,"Flemings Mayfair has an excellent location, within walking distance from many parts of Central London, close to the tube and to buses, and next to Shepherd's Market with many places to eat and drink,.Most of thesingle rooms are tiny. This time, I opted for a larger version and paid more. The problem was that the room was on the ground floor, with a window on the street and passers-by just outside. Moreover, across the street construction work provided noise from the early morning. My opinion is that the hotel should have warned me as I checked in during the early evening. Also, the receptiin has a potential for quicker service. The staff should be expanded, or be taught to process matters miore quickly.",4,2014,09,24
144,Quintessential boutique hotel in a fantastic location!,"I had read earlier reviews with slight misgivings as there were both positive and constructive feedback. Nevertheless, I decided to go with my gut and give this hotel a shot. I had done extensive research on all the hotels in Mayfair prior to deciding on Flemings Mayfair.

I was travelling alone and had booked the Executive Room for 2 nights. I arrived at the hotel early at around 11am. Having read previous reviews and knowing the entire hotel was booked out the night before (I did a quick check before arrival), I didn't expect my room to be ready so I was prepared to explore London on foot before checking in. I left my suitcases with concierge who assured me that my room would be ready at around 2pm. The reception also confirmed they had given me an upgrade to the Family Room (Prior to making the reservation, I joined the Small Luxury Hotel club for a complimentary upgrade on my first stay). I returned to the hotel at 6pm and to my very pleasant surprise, they had given me a double upgrade to a 1-bedroom apartment. They needed another 5 minutes to tidy the apartment and I was immediately shown to the drawing room for a drink whilst waiting. When the apartment was ready 5 minutes later, the very friendly porter helped with the suitcases and showed me to my room.

The newly refurbished 1-bedroom apartment was very spacious and well setup in terms of space. When you first enter the apartment, you see a small short corridor which leads to the bedroom/ensuite on the right and the living/dining room and kitchen on the left. At the end of the corridor is a toilet. Both doors to the bedroom/ensuite and living/dining room can be locked. The living/dining room leads to the kitchen which also has a door that can be locked.In the living/dining room, there is a generous sized couch which sleeps one comfortably (doesn't fold out), a square dining table for 4, a couple of armchairs and a LCD SmartTV. The kitchen is of a good size and has a full size fridge, stove and usual appliances. The bedroom extends to a good size dressing area with huge wardrobes which leads to the ensuite bathroom. The bathroom is generously sized with Hans Grohe appliances and Miller Harris toiletries. It has a single sink, bathtub and a separate shower area with rain shower. There is also a LCD SmartTV, armchair and dresser in the bedroom.

I particularly liked the private entrance to the apartments at Clarges Street which gives me very convenient direct access to the street instead of walking through a maze of small corridors to the front of the hotel (at Half Moon Street). The corridors are not wheelchair or luggage friendly however you have the assistance of very helpful and friendly porters. When checking out, instead of requesting help for my suitcases through the narrow corridors again, I simply parked my car at the private entrance at Clarges Street and loaded my suitcases easily. There is also a private lift at the apartment wing and the lift is 10 steps away from the private entrance.

Given that there are only 2 apartments on each floor at the apartment wing, there isn't a common corridor so I didn't experience any disturbances at all. As the hotel isn't directly situated on a busy main street, I didn't experience any traffic noise. The hotel is still undergoing remodelling and there was extensive work carried out on the ground floor of the apartment wing. My apartment was on the third floor and I didn't hear any noise at all. I typically leave my apartment at 9am and return at around 7pm or later.

Being in the heart of Mayfair, the location of the hotel is perfect for exploring the city of London. The hotel is situated at Half Moon Street which is less than a minute from Piccadilly. It is an easy 20+ minute walk to Covent Garden and you get to explore Bond Street (5 minutes), Regent Street (7 minutes), the theatre district (10 minutes) and Leicester Square (10 minutes) along the way. On the way back, you can explore Oxford Street (15 minutes), Chinatown and Park Lane (7 minutes). From the hotel, it is also about a 20-minute walk to Knightsbridge. Green Park (tube) station is a minute away and it serves the Piccadilly, Victoria and Jubilee lines. Buckingham Palace Gardens, Hyde Park and Green Park are all within easy walking distance as well. The location of the hotel doesn't get any better than this.

The service is top notched and staff are always willing to provide assistance whether with luggage, directions or advice. I had a full English breakfast included in my package and the selection of choices was simple but sufficient - all the usual items are on the menu. I have also had dinner in the restaurant and again, the selection was simple but good. I had ordered fish, prawns and soup for 2 and the food quality didn't disappoint.

There wasn't much of a view from my apartment but as I had expected that, it didn't disappoint much. What mattered to me more was the location, room (refurbished, comfort, cleanliness and furnishings) and service and all exceeded expectations.

I would definitely stay at Flemings Mayfair again - wouldn't look anywhere else!",5,2014,09,23
144,Lovely boutique hotel,Really pleased with this contemporary boutique hotel conveniently placed in Mayfair. Our room was a lovely size and decorated to a high standard. The staff were very friendly and welcoming and wouldn't hesitate to stay there again!,5,2014,09,20
144,"Great value, great location","Really cute boutique hotel in a great Mayfair location near the Green Park tube stop.  The people at the hotel were very helpful.  Very good breakfast buffet.  The rooms were of all different grades.  The first few days I stayed I had a double which was quite spacious, had a lovely bathroom, and looked out onto the small side street where the hotel was located.  When coming back through London the same trip I had a really sweet room with a horse theme (I ride, this thrilled me) which was smaller but still very comfortable, with a good bathroom.  The toiletries are good.  The horse room looked out into a very large light well.  My teenage son had a very comfortable room with a nice bathroom that overlooked a construction site across the street.  I did see a minuscule single room that I wouldn't have been happy in, so make sure you ask what type of room you are getting when booking.

Pleasant rooms, nice lobby, good breakfast and helpful staff in Mayfair at a fantastic (for London particularly) price.",5,2014,09,19
144,"Location, location, location!","This is a very good hotel.  As mentioned on the title, if you want to be in Mayfair, this is a great choice.  For the price, service, acommodations, you get mor than you paid for.  The staff is kind and helpful, the room is small, but the location beats it.  You will be located close to restaurants, the Green Park and two blocks from the subway with buses at the corner.  You can cross the park and reach Buckingham Palace, it's super!  The only thing i would mention as negative is the fact that the room hasn't been made up on my departuring day considering that i was charged for a late check-out.  It's ok to charge for a late check-out, i had agreed on it, but the room should be at least tiedied up.  I left for the day and not even the beds were maid.  If one charges for a service one should provide it.  Also the wifi was a bit slow, but it was included.",5,2014,09,19
144,WHAT A GEM!,"I was delighted to find this hotel. I prefer the smaller hotels. The hotel is perfectly located in the West End. The staff were amazing- friendly and efficient. I was talking about an adapter when we checked in... next thing another member of staff handed one over. The rooms are comfortable, looked newly refurbished and well appointed. Although our room was quite small - we have all the comforts that one required. The only thing that let them down was the laundry service. We arrive on a Saturday morning and only got our laundry back on Tuesday evening. A city hotel that could not offer Sunday or bank holiday service? All a bit strange. But that certainly did not spoil a thing!",5,2014,09,18
144,Superb stay,"Flemings is a superb, friendly luxury hotel in a great location in the heart of mayfair, a short walk from Green Park, Staff are very obliging and the breakfasts are a real treat. It is well priced for this part of London.",5,2014,09,17
144,A gem,"Not only is this hotel great for its location - it's a walk to Oxford northwards, to Regent eastwards and to Knightsbridge westwards, and it's off Piccadilly, the staff is always willing to help, and most are friendly and warm. I was a lone traveller but felt safe coming back to this hotel even though it was quiet in the lobby late at night. In the day, good old Brenton would be there out front, ready to greet guests, and have a chat when he's not busy hailing cabs or helping with bags. Breakfast is a simple though ample affair, and coffee is good. Served from 7 onwards, it's ideal for early birds, or those of us still jet lagged. Room was comfortable with interesting decor.",4,2014,09,16
144,Family Weekend at Flemings,"We were travelling from Los Angeles to Johannesburg, via London, and decided to stay 4 nights in London as a stop over. We have 2 children of 4 and 6 and thought it best to break the two eleven hour flights on this basis.

I have only praise and good things to say of the Flemings. Everyone was extremely welcoming, friendly and accommodating, from the Doorman, to the Concierge, to the Reception Staff and Hotel Manager.

The hotel has a lovely classic feel to it but has been modernised making it also quite contemporary.

The location is perfect and should we ever be in London again, the Flemings Mayfair will most definitely be our hotel of choice.",5,2014,09,15
144,First class small mayfair hotel,"This hotel is in the perfect location. Within short walking distance of Buckingham Palace, Westminster, Bond st, Oxford st, Hyde Park and so many great London places to shop or visit. 
It is small, well run with very obliging staff, great breakfasts and its reasonably priced, particularly as it's in the heart of Mayfair. Definitely recommend it.",5,2014,09,14
144,Very good price quality ratio,"I stayed at the Flemings Mayfair last week, and I was very pleased with the price quality ratio. Very centrally located (walking distance from Green Park station, Park Lane, Jermyn Street and all Mayfair) boutique hotel (SLH) the property offers large rooms for London standards at an affordable price. The bar in the basement offers good drinks and service as well. Only minus point worth mentioning is a low ceiling bathroom, i.e. as I am 6'3 - 1.93m I had to duck a bit to fit under the shower head. Overall very good experience and I would recommend it. ",4,2014,09,13
144,"Friendly Staff, Great Service and Location!","The location of the hotel is great, right off the Tube directly from Heathrow (no need to change).  It is about 5 min walk from the Green Park station to the hotel and about 10 min walk from Buckingham Palace.  It is central and good base to major sites.  
I had reserved a single room but was upgraded free of charge to a double room.  The room is spacious and didn't find noise to be an issue.  Breakfast is okay but not great, good enough to start the day.
Staff is very friendly and helpful and went above and beyond to mail the ring that I had left in the hotel to my home.  
Highly recommneded and would return in the future.",5,2014,09,12
144,Fantastic Location in London,"This is an excellent hotel in London. Considering how prices are there, this is actually reasonable. The rooms are comfortable, the breakfast was included and quite good. The location sells it. Quite near many sites as well as the London Underground.",5,2014,09,07
144,Excellent Central London location,"Very good hotel, excellent service from the staff, very friendly on checkin we were upgraded to a one bedroom apartment. Good breakfast, excellent location for Central London. Highly recommended we will use this again when in London.",5,2014,09,07
144,Very nice hotel in an excellent position,"We are returning guests to this hotels, however on this occasion we were accompanied by two friends who were celebrating a special wedding  anniversary so we were keen that everything 
should go well. It did and what made it special was without doubt  was the staff at the hotel who  were charming and helpful. The room allocated to our friends whilst a standard room was light airy and also quite roomy which is not always the case in hotels which are created in old buildings within the Mayfair area. The food restaurant and bar service along with reception staff were first class  Overall we were very pleased with our stay. Certainly we will return to this hotel in the future. One small word of  caution was that we were a little disappointed with our bath room which we felt was a little tired and in need of renovation which was not in keeping with the very good standards represented throughout the remained of the hotel",4,2014,09,04
144,"Excellent location, Friendly staff but pricey","Excellent service and friendly staff. The apartment rooms are well maintained and the hotel's location is perfect - right next to green park. The breakfast is a let down with limited motel style choices. While a good hotel, at GBP 500 a night there are definitely much better options in London for a small family.",4,2014,09,02
144,"Perfectly situated, beautiful hotel","The Flemings Mayfair is a beautiful hotel that is within walking distance to many great shops, Green Park, museums, you name it. I was extremely happy with the location and also thought that the value for the money was extremely good considering what neighborhood it was in for London. I got a good deal through Orbitz, which helped with the price, but even without that deal, this hotel is a very good value for the neighborhood compared to many other similar options. The rooms are admittedly very small, but what can you expect in Central London? At least they have a very modern elevator. I loved staying here, even if it was for a quick two night stay. I would definitely come back! ",5,2014,09,01
144,Great location great service,"We enjoyed our 3 nights in London whilst based at Flemings Mayfair. The subway was within walking distance, as was the bus terminal for our day trips and small convenient stores.

A highlight was how friendship reception staff were. And may I say the lounge looks so beautiful! Always good to return to our 'home' after a freezing day outside with a hot tea and warm welcome at the door to shake off that wintery cold brrrr

Thumbs up, good stay!",5,2014,09,01
144,Wonderful hotel!,"We stayed at the Flemming for a very short time and enjoyed every moment!  The hotel was within easy reach of Gatwick airport, the room was comfortable, the food delicious and,  the location could not have been better.  We were close to all the tourist sites and managed to see quite a few of them.  The perfect touch was the doorman.  He was so pleasant and interesting!",5,2014,09,01
144,Excellent Location,"If you want to stay in an hotel that is close to everything, definitely you have to stay at this hotel. The staff is excellent and very helpful. The food is expensive but is well prepared. Before accepting a room designated for you, please ask the receptionist to take a look at the room. There are some rooms with stairs inside (ground floor) and others that you have to use stairs that are the middle of the corridor.",4,2014,08,25
144,"Decent hotel, excellent location for shopping","This hotel is excellently located for shopping and going out in the centre of London. Picadilly line to Heathrow airport at walking distance. A personal and courteous staff makes you immediately feel at home. The hotel is nicely appointed but the standard rooms are rather small, better take out the extra cost for a larger room. Typically for London, all the corridors are narrow, ceilings are low. The whole appearance makes a luxurieus impression. Airco unit is loud and blows over the bed :-( Bathroom in our room was good with spaciois shower, but other rooms are way smaller.
At our stay, they were just a bit short on breakfast staff.
Would I go there again? Yes
",3,2014,08,24
144,A Gem ......,We have stayed at this hotel  8 or 9 times and always go back! It's a little gem in the middle of Mayfair.  The location is brilliant and only 5 min walk to Green Park.  The rooms are stylish and always very clean.  The staff are knowledgable and always very helpful.  The library - for meeting friends for afternoon tea and/or drinks is inviting.  The few meals I have eaten at the restaurant have been of very good standard.  I would most definitely recommend this hotel!,5,2014,08,22
144,Great Location however do your research on price!,"I stayed here for six nights in August.  I had a single room on Level 1.  I managed to secure an awesome rate through a third party website, well under half of the quoted rack rate of GBP200 per night.  At the price I paid, I was very happy with the hotel.  If I had paid the full rate my rating would be one star less.

The room was very small but adequate.  The service within the hotel is generally ok.  The room service is way over-priced and not up to standard.  Free wi-fi is a good feature.  The one room service meal I had was cold, tasteless and cost a fortune.  Upon reporting this to the reception the guy couldn't have showed less interest which was pretty poor.
So, if you can find a good rate via a third party website I would recommend the hotel.  It is very well located in terms of the major attractions in London.",4,2014,08,22
144,Location is Great,"The hotel is situated in a perfect location, walking distance to the theatres, Westminster, Buckingham Palace, etc.Green Park Underground station is 5 minutes walk, plus numerous bu lines. Hotel is like a English Club, with comfortable lounges. I found the reception staff to be extremely helpful.
The bedrooms are all different, as the building is old , but has been nicely updated.
Unfortunately, during my time there, the building next door was being renovated, so there was a lot of noise from this work. I would strongly suggest calling the hotel ahead of arriving toi request a room away from the construction.Obviously this is short term, and the noise will cease once the building work is completed.
I had a great English Breakfast in the restaurant, again very pleasant staff serving.",4,2014,08,19
144,Excellent - wish I was there for longer!,"Stayed here for business for one night in a small double - immaculate and just the right size. Lovely bathroom down some steps which was cute. Possibly the comfiest hotel bed I've ever slept in. Very pleasant staff, good service and selection for breakfast. And very cool lift decor! 
Will definitely look to book here again next time I need to stay in the area. ",5,2014,08,18
144,"Mayfair prices, Blackpool style in Room 101","Flemings Mayfair is apparently a famous historic hotel in Half Moon Street just down from Green Park, the hotel is well located and reception is efficient however it goes downhill from there. We were allocated Room 101 - with all our worst fears in there . Its a fairly nasty and very small room with a tiny window, possibly the oldest carpet I've seen in a hotel in the last decade and an even nastier bathroom. The bath seal had all gone mouldy across the top and the screen didn't seal across the bath for the shower so the floor ended up covered in water which poured down the screen/bath side. 

The tiling appeared to have been grouted by somebody who was blind and at least five years ago by the look of it with leftovers smeared all round the top of the tiles. 
Meanwhile back in the bedroom, the furniture is old - and shows it, the bed was comfortable enough however who knows how old it was given the other furniture and fittings and all the marks and dents on them. I did suspect this maybe one of those 'emergency rooms' not usually used however this was mid August - by no means high season for London with most hotels offering discounts to try and fill up. And at £200 a night for this fairly shabby room, not cheap either. I'd stay in Hotel Indigo where we were the week before - beautiful, almost new rooms with impeccably helpful service and at half the price. Come on Flemings - you need to up your game otherwise you won't be around much longer as customers won't accept these standards anymore.
Breakfast was acceptable - no more than that.",3,2014,08,17
144,Boutique with Flair,"A theatre weekend away in the lap of luxury. Flemmings Hotel dazzled us. We stayed in one of the next door appartments, which was a real hidden jewel in the crown! Post theatre trip we had cocktails in the hotel's own late night bar. The choice of drinks was fabulous and the staff went out of their way to make it a really super experience - a perfect way to finish the evening..",5,2014,08,15
144,Amazing!,"We stayed here during our visit from Canada last summer.  It was an AMAZING hotel.

The rooms were beautiful, and I loved every single person who worked at the hotel.  They were so kind and always remembered who we were.  I told them that we were celebrating my birthday at the hotel, and they had champagne and cupcakes waiting for us, along with a little note.  I loved that SO much!

The breakfast buffet was delicious, and the location was better than we could have hoped for.  We were able to walk over to Buckingham Palace, and to Piccadilly Circus. It's also very close to a grocery store. 

Although a small detail, I absolutely loved the tea set that was in the room.  They would refill it every day, and it was one of the highlights of my trip.

I would absolutely stay here again!",5,2014,08,12
144,A gem of a hotel,"We have stayed in London a number of times and never come across Flemings until we went to Murano for my wifes birthday and picked Flemings as it's just around the corner. We were in the townhouse it was brilliant great décor and facilities very quiet yet a stones throw from green park and Piccadilly.
Just around the corner is Shepherds Street a (small) maze of little streets with pubs, shops and restaurants well worth a look.
We had a drink in the hotel bar expensive (12.5% surcharge) should have gone to Shepherds Street.
Breakfast was in the main hotel and it was a normal buffet sausages disappointing and the toast had hardly seen a toaster, it was busy so the hotel was pretty full, but in the townhouse (4 rooms) you wouldn't know.",5,2014,08,12
144,Brilliant stay,I decided to book Flemings for a birthday trip to London for my daughter.  We were upgraded to a family twin room and also received cupcakes and a bottle of champagne which was a lovely surprise.  The breakfast was absolutely fabulous - we both had the eggs benedict.  Lovely fresh orange juice which was topped up when we wanted.  Very good service everywhere in the hotel and a nice quiet location.,5,2014,08,10
144,Tired,"Musty smelling, scratched furniture and cracked washbasin - tired room.

Despite asking for a quiet room was given one by the elevator and then overlooking the road so lots off street noise throughout the night - tired customer.

On the positive side, the breakfast was good - about the only other positive thing about the hotel except for the location.

Will not be returning.

144,"Not bad, but overpriced","Unlike our just flat out awful hotel experience in Paris, London was much better. This hotel is definitely cute (although if you can't do stairs, you need to pass, there are stairs *everywhere*), and the staff was truly top notch, helpful, polite, friendly, and really represented the highest expectations you probably have of British culture quite well. It's also true that, like Paris, this is London and you should expect to pay a lot more for things like a hotel ... but frankly, despite the wonderful staff, this hotel is wildly overpriced. The rooms are quaint, but incredibly small (there's no room for two suitcases, period). The bathrooms still have very slick and dangerous tubs (which I'm pretty sure no one has used for a bath since the 1970s, and the shower heads are about 5' 6"" up so if you're 6' 2"" like me, washing your hair is an adventure in ducking). And the only wifi in the hotel was in the lobby and it was a bit sketchy in terms of speed and reliability. Finally, they do have a restaurant and bar in the basement (the bar has to be seen to be believed, think upper class 1970s retro on steroids and you'll start to understand ... if you like velvet, mood lighting, deep colors and funky furniture, you'll be in heaven), but the breakfast prices in particular were just way out of control compared to what you could get MUCH cheaper within blocks of the hotel (and I've noticed that Europeans in general just don't know how to do breakfast at ALL). The bottom line is that, despite the great staff, there are lots of hotels that are nicer, newer, larger and with better facilities that are MUCH cheaper and not that far away. I did enjoy the hotel (which is frankly 100% due again to the truly superior staff), but I doubt I'd stay there again at those prices (literally well more than double another brand new hotel only a couple of miles away).",3,2014,08,07
144,"Top location, small room","Flemings is a very nice and stylish hotel in the heart of London, certainly a great location. The downside in our view was that the room was was small, also when comparing to what you might find in other nice hotels in London. That said, if you just want a nice place to sleep, the location makes Flemings a good option.",4,2014,08,07
144,Fantastic Flemings!,"I have stayed in this hotel three or four times in the past couple years, and each time has been a wonderful experience. The location is amazing - right in the heart of Mayfair, steps away from Green Park and the swirl of activity of Piccadilly. All the staff are lovely and helpful.

The rooms do vary greatly in size and style (on one occasion we practically had to shimmy by the end of the bed in order to reach the bathroom; on another we could have held a dance in the large sitting area - both were the same rate!) but all are immaculately clean and charming. The beds are comfortable, bathrooms are well appointed, there is plenty of closet and wardrobe storage.

The bar is a hidden gem with lovely innovative cocktails, plush seating, a cool hidden television, and attentive staff.",5,2014,08,05
144,Superb hotel.,"Everyone is warm and welcoming here.  Rooms are individual, stylish, spotlessly clean (as is entire hotel) and well equipped.  Bar area is exceptional so long as you remember you will be paying 5 star prices for your drinks.  ",4,2014,08,03
144,Beautiful Hotel in Central London,"My husband booked a weekend break at Flemings Mayfair Hotel for our silver wedding anniversary. The Hotel was easy walking distance from Green Park tube station. On arriving we were greeted by a friendly doorman and checked in swiftly by the helpful receptionist who also upgraded our room. 

The room was elegantly decorated, It had an interactive TV, huge bed, plenty of storage and spacious bathroom with White Company toiletries. The note from Guest Services was a nice personal touch and we loved the complimentary champagne to celebrate our anniversary. The breakfast was excellent each morning, we would definitely recommend it. 

From Flemings Mayfair it was a short walk through Green Park to Buckingham Palace where we watched the Change of the Guards. We also went on the Open Top Bus which is a great way to see London. 

Overall we had a fabulous weekend and look forward to our return!",5,2014,08,02
144,Great value for money - Will be back!,"I had a very enjoyable stay at Flemings Mayfair. The staff were all lovely, very helpful and friendly- from first contact onwards. I found a good rate with them online, but as it was through a 3rd party website I decided to give them a call and see if they could match the rate as I know they get charged a significant fee by those websites. The lady on reservations not only matched it, but also included a complimentary full breakfast as a thank you. In an age where booking online is the norm, it was nice to deal with a real (and friendly) person. 

On arrival I was greeted by a doorman. Check-in was quick and pleasant. I was shown to my room and helped with my bags. The room was a good size, nicely decorated and in good condition. The air con worked well, but had a musty smell so didn't fancy leaving it on long (literally only negative I can think of). I love the iPod dock! I slept well in the comfy bed.

Had a free paper left on my door in the morning. The breakfast was great. The breakfast staff were kept busy, but were very attentive and professional and courteous despite this.

On checkout I requested to leave some luggage so I could explore London before my evening train. This was no problem, and it was reassuring that my luggage was signed in and I was given a receipt. (I have stayed in other hotels where  luggage is just left in a public room with no security other than the reception staff keeping an eye on everybody coming and going!)

So, a big thank you to all of the staff at Flemings Mayfair! I will definitely be returning. Hopefully very soon :-)",5,2014,07,29
144,"An excellent hotel, perfect for your stay in London.","We enjoyed your stay at Flemings in Mayfair very much. Our room was modern, quiet and clean, the staff was very friendly and helpful, and the
rich breakfast buffet was one of our daily highlights.
The rates are rather high, but I suppose that's London.",4,2014,07,29
144,Lovely in Mayfair,"Lovely boutique hotel.  Rooms were very nice, although a bit cramped. Well appointed. Comfortable bed. Very clean. Had wi-fi in room.  Breakfast was very good.  Staff was well trained.  Close to subway and Big Red Bus.",5,2014,07,28
144,Brilliant,"We had part of my Hen Do here on Saturday and we all loved it. The hotel was beautiful, we had our won private room, which was lovely. 
The staff were really courteous and the service was brilliant. The cream teas were absolutely gorgeous, the cakes were divine and the whole experience was just lovely. 

thank you very much!",5,2014,07,28
144,Quiet location in busy Mayfair,"I stayed in this unique hotel with my sister during our spring holiday. The hotel is conveniently located close to the Green Park underground station, and it's a short walk to Piccadilly Circus as well. The location offered good possibilities to explore the city by walking as well as by using the good underground system of London. Despite being located in the heart of Mayfair, we didn't suffer from the sounds of traffic etc.

Upon our early arrival, we were able to leave our luggage in hold, and go explore the surroundings. There are many nice cafes and bars closeby. The staff in the hotel was fantastic and very helpful. They offered us a map and advice on what to see and do, all this even without asking. All our encounters with staff were good. The only downside with staff was that their room (break room or storage, I don't know) was located next to our room, and they used to room quite frequently especially during late evening and early night hours, sometimes talking on phone, sometimes just slamming the doors. The thin walls didn't make all that a pleasurable experience, but I guess it was manageable.

The room was small, but that's normal in London. Room was clean, and it was serviced every day. Also, a newspaper was brought to our door every day, that was a nice extra. Bathroom was surprisingly spacy, and water pressure good. There was enough space in the cabinets to keep clothes, if one wishes. Tv was good quality, and they even had an iPod dock. The wireless Internet didn't work the way they told us at the reception (was supposed to be paid after 24 hours of use, but never paid anything), but it worked anyway (not the most reliable though).

Our room rate included normal breakfast. It was fullfilling, and had enough selection. With extra money, one can also get warm breakfast. We tried this one morning, and I really enjoyed my pancakes with bacon, and my sister enjoyed her English breakfast. Definitely worth trying at least once, but other than that, we found the normal breakfast to be enough.

The hotel also had several social areas, which all had very unique decorations. It was nice to have a place to sit in peace. We also tried the hotel bar one night. It was very quiet and dark place, but enjoyed it very much. Would have spent more time there, but the drinks were totally overpriced (£15).

All in all, a very pleasurable stay, and I would recommend to anyone, who is looking for a convenient stay in the center of London with some uniqueness.",4,2014,07,25
144,Very nice stay!,"I had a very nice stay at Flemings Mayfair! The hotel is close to Green Park station so it was easy to reach the hotel by tube from Heathrow. Staff at reception were friendly and welcoming and I could check in when I arrived to the hotel around 11am (had requested an early check-in). I had also asked for a quiet room and room 402 was very quiet, overloooking a small courtyard. The view was therefore not so interesting and the window quite small, but that didn't bother me. 

The bed was very comfortable. The room was not so big, but nicely decorated and had all amenities that you needed. The morning paper was even delivered to your door in the morning! The only drawback was perhaps that the Air-conditioning was rather loud, so not so nice to keep it on during the night. There was free wifi in the room, although quite slow. However, you could pay for a faster connection. The bathroom was also nicely decorated and quite spacious.

My rate included breakfast and the breakfast was very good, many different things to choose from from the cooked menu and also a continental buffet. The breakfast staff was also very friendly. 

I would definitely recommend this hotel to others. Very good location, a very clean and comfortable room and staff that were friendly and helpful!",4,2014,07,23
144,Perfect stay at apartment,we were there as a family. Large apartment with enought space to store luggage. Perfect situated hotel nearby underground station and close to various food stores and nice coffee bars and restaurants. Buckingham palace (8min) and Oxford street (12min) in walking distance. The staff is very nice and helpful and excellent concierege service. very clean and comfortable moderne rooms. Quiet hotel.,5,2014,07,22
144,Fabulous Flemings,"From the time that we arrived until the time that we departed, this quaint hotel buried amongst the busy Mayfair streets was an oasis of tranquillity.
The staff cannot do enough for you and always look as though they enjoy their work. The hotel is obviously proud of its long history and offers big hotel facilities normally only found in the nearby Ritz and Claridge's.
Great continental breakfast and the afternoon teas and evening dinners looked fantastic !
Would definitely stay again - thank you Flemings.",5,2014,07,21
144,Wonderful stay in the West End,"We stayed in the their newly renovated apartments this past July. The staff is great, the apartment amenities are amazing and the location can't be beat. You are a block from an amazing underground station and the entire city can be easily navigated. The only small drawback is the cost but for us it was well worth it. We will return!",4,2014,07,19
144,Great location,"Lovely hotel in a perfect location. It is 2 min away from Hyde Park and the tube, and the rooms are well equipped (a bit small, but normal for London). We had some issues with the bathroom, as there was no warm water coming to the shower, but it was fixed fairly quickly once we reported it. Staff is friendly, and I'd recommend going for a cocktail  to the bar in the basement - great mixologist/bartender. The only disappointment was that there's no free wi-fi, which nowadays you can expect from every good hotel in London.",4,2014,07,19
144,"staff very keen to please, 10 for location",A very well located hotel which is found the corner if the jubilee line form Green Park Station. Rooms enjoy a modern decor albeit somewhat small but very clean and comfortable. Room service was timely and of good quality. Concierge was accommodating and efficient. Reception well informed and delivered and what they said they would in a timely manner. Most certainly I will return soon.,5,2014,07,16
144,Great location,"This hotel has a perfect location. Super close to the tube and excellent base for an extended weekend in London. Yes the rooms are a bit on the small side (but we're in London!) and we did not have any view. But our room was located at the back so nice and quiet. Plus, you're in London - you'll probably won't spend much time cooked up in your hotel room anyways! 
One point of annoyance was the bath/shower... I never understood those half-glas walls... it doesn't stop the bathroom floor from getting all wet.",4,2014,07,15
144,Great Location,"Best Location! Walking distance to the Palace, Underground, ground transportation, Green Park. Clean rooms, friendly staff. There are a couple of great pubs in walking distance, that the food was excelent at. I would recomend!",4,2014,07,14
144,Wow ,What a lovely room view not great as building work going on but hotel staff lovely also easy to get to and from and was lovely breakfast thanks mayfair we loved it ! Just shows that when looking threw other reviews it was spot on to come my daughter loved the pull out bed and wants one her self lol x x ,5,2014,07,13
144,Very nice boutique hotel perfectly located,"I recently spent three days in London. I found this hotel on the internet and immediately loved the pictures of it. I booked a double room and contacted the hotel directly to kindly ask them to accommodate us in one of the rooms I saw on their internet site (black/grey and white wall paper with trees). Check in was perfect and we were kindly granted the room we asked for (we were actually even upgraded). I was very happy since it was a surprise trip for my daughter. The staff is very polite, kind and smiling. The hotel is very clean and nicely decorated. There is free wifi in the lounge and you can have your own connection in the room (charged). In the room you will also find a docking station for your i-pod/phone. The bed is of very good quality, we slept like logs! I would really recomment this hotel which is ideally located and a delight for your eyes.",5,2014,07,10
144,Small Comforts in Mayfair,"On my second business trip to Mayfair, I decided to give the Flemings Mayfair a try on the recommendation of a friend.  It ended up being a good choice.  It is a great location and a good value given the locale.  The rooms have been updated and are nicely appointed even if they are on the small side.  The room is about average size for this part of London, but diminutive if you are expecting a spacious suite.  

The staff was very welcoming and were happy to answer any questions.  They politely asked if you needed any help every time I departed the hotel.  Also offered some nice recommendations for nearby places to eat, both a quick bite and something a little more up market.",4,2014,07,09
144,great Concierge services,"The good stuff: 
the hotel Concierge(s) , Francisco and Pedro were outstandingly nice and helpful and a real pleasure. The gentlemen that hosted at the door (sorry, do not know your name...) was also top notch and we enjoyed the elegant attire. The location was great as previous reviews have noted. The continental breakfast was very good and the room and hotel  nicely appointed. The bathroom was large and beautiful. Morning paper at door was nice.  Street very nice.
The not good stuff:
we paid $672.00 (dollars) each night- for 4 nights-  for a room for myself and two teen-age sons. It was called a family room- THAT was not accurate. There was a sofa bed wedged in a corner and we could not navigate past the desk and chair to get to it. The other bed was a king size bed split down the middle- this was sold a  room for 3- and thus the price. It was VERY small for the price- and sadly all beds and pillows were hard. The Wi-Fi was weak and to upgrade was additional charge. When we were leaving, we asked an older woman who seemed to be in charge at the desk if we could leave our luggage in room for half hour beyond check out time and were refused and told to put it in storage. Nice send- off. The  room was not ready for us when we arrived, although we did arrive at 11 am so were early.",3,2014,07,08
144,Bit disappointed,"The cons outweighed the pros for me on this hotel,although it is off Piccadilly and opposite Green Park I preferred the location of the Premier inn County Hall,my room was tucked away next to the housekeeping room so night and day there was banging going on next door,when I had a knock on my door I called out for them to wait a minute and they walked straight in and there I was in the loo in full view!! But my biggest gripe is that i needed to make a cpl of local calls from the room and,unfamiliar as I was with the number of digits required in the UK, dialled some incomplete numbers which didn't get connected but I still got charged for 10 tries at the number amounting to £12.55,I won't be recommending this hotel to anyone,there are better ones around.",3,2014,07,08
144,Not what you would expect of a SLH property,"I am a regular customer of the Small Luxury Hotels chain and often pick a hotel because it is a member of that elite group of hotels.

Do not expect this hotel to live up to the standards of the SLH group however.  The rooms were small and tired looking; they certainly did not look like the ones shown in their photos.  We spent GBP300 per night but were dismayed that the rooms were not luxurious in any way.  The mostly Eastern European cleaning staff were rude and knocked on your door ""just to check"" if you do not leave your room early in the morning when they are doing their rounds.  If you do not book your room directly with them or on the SLH website, the front office will not give you any special treatment and will give you the worst rooms available, regardless of how much you actually paid for the room or how long you will stay as all Hotels.com or Booking.com bookings are considered ""discounted"" already so no upgrades, breakfast etc.  

Wifi is really only free at a good speed in the public area.  The one you get in the room is a much slower speed one good enough for emails only, not real surfing; unless you pay more to upgrade to the faster speed.  Disgraceful considering how much they charge you for the room.

The only saving grace was the location of the hotel which was in the nice Mayfair area, 10 minutes walk to Oxford street shopping.  I will not return to this hotel and would certainly be more discerning when evaluating SLH hotels in the future.  One simply cannot rely on the SLH brand name alone.",2,2014,07,07
144,Great Location but Would Not Stay Again,"First, the Pros: amazing location, walkable to most major sites, in a very affluent and nice area near the Green Park tube stop, and the room decor was beautifully done as was the decor in the rest of the hotel.  Rooms are very small (just a few feet around the bed on all sides) but about the size you would expect in London.  
However, we had a few problems with this hotel and expected more in terms of overall service, especially given the rate (about $350 per night). We had requested an early check-in over a month in advance since our overseas flight was scheduled to arrive early that morning.  Our flight was delayed and when we arrived (exhausted) around 2pm our room was not ready and would not be ready for another hour (though we do understand that it is based on availability) - however, the only way to change out of our airplane clothes was to board a very compact elevator and maneuver our luggage through a narrow hallway on a lower level to reach a restroom- awkward to say the least so be aware of this if you may arrive prior to when your room might be ready.  We returned to put our bags in our room later and, upon waking up the next morning, realized that our room, while not on the ground floor of the hotel, adjoined some stone steps outside the hotel so it was effectively at ground (or partially below ground) level with a window towards to top of the room- not ideal in terms of safety.  
Additionally, we returned to our room in the middle of the day to find that the door had been propped open with the deadbolt (presumably for housekeeping) yet there was nobody from housekeeping in our room.",3,2014,07,06
144,"Lovely hotel, great location .. reservations staff need some training","We stayed here at the weekend as a last minute stay in London. We had a great stay and loved the hotel decor and location. All of the staff were externely friendly and very attentive. The one annoying factor was with the reservations staff.

I phoned the hotel on a Friday night and it appears that everyone from the reservations team had left for the day and as such I was asked to phone back the next day. I followed the instruction and finally got connectedto a lady in reservations on the third attempt.

Flemings operate a best rate guarantee on their own website. This being that if you find a rate elsewhere, they will match the rate and discount this by an additional 5%. I had a package in front of me on Secret Escapes website totalling £149. This included breakfast, VAT, unlimited movies etc. I proceeded to tell the reservation agent these details and her reply was ""The best rate I can offer you tonight is £155"". I asked why this was more than the £149 on Secret Escapes, but she could not answer and was not authorised to override the rate and price match.

It's a pet annoyance of mine with the hotel trade in general. Please do not offer best rate guarantee's if you are not going to honour this. Please make sure your staff know the rates available online and are fully equipped to deal with these enquiries. 

Luckily I decided to just book with Secret Escapes and we really enjoyed our stay.

It's a little thing, but can be the difference between a reservation or not.",4,2014,07,01
144,celebration stay at Flemings Mayfair,"I wanted to say a huge thank you to Anna Morton for her help in ensuring our stay this past weekend at Flemings was memorable.

From her response to my barrage of emails to the booking and dealing with my requirements was perfect, nothing was too much to ask.

The upgrade she arranged to the lovely suite and the nice greeting card  was a nice personal touch. We then enjoyed our complimentary champagne and picnic (in our room as the rain had then started)!

We found the hotel , from concierge to reception staff,  were brilliant and very helpful. One lady from concierge even went for a paper for my fiancé on the Sunday morning!

Our room was perfect and ensured we relaxed in between our trips out shopping!

On the downside (and these are very slight)  I was disappointed with our breakfast in The Grill, my eggs benedict was absolutely freezing which put me off a replacement even though this was immediately offered.

The picnic was nice however the best item was omitted – clotted cream for the scones!

All in all the stay was wonderful and Anna's help was very much appreciated. We had a good look around to get some ideas for my engagement ring, enjoyed dinner out to celebrate my birthday and the champagne to toast our engagement.

I would definately stay again",4,2014,07,01
144,Great stay at Flemmings hotel,"Our room was in the building next door, room No 604, a lovely spacious room which was very clean and had everything we could've wanted. We had booked a picnic from the hotel to have in Green Park, however the weather was inclement so the hotel arranged for us to have this in our room (they did also offer the use of the restaurant if we wanted). The staff were excellent throughout our stay, especially Zachary who couldnt have been more helpful during breakfast, so many thanks to him. 

We will definitley be coming back! :-)",5,2014,06,30
144,Another great stay,"As always Flemings exceeded our expectations and we had a great overnight stay.  We use this hotel a few times each year as it is such a great location, staff are always friendly and helpful, rooms are comfortable, the food is good and the bar is a great place to relax and unwind with a group of friends.  The newly refurbished apartment was fantastic and I would loved to have stayed for a week.",5,2014,06,24
144,Not Great…,"My wife and I arrived at 10.30pm on a Friday night for 3 night stay and rang for room service at 10.35pm.   No answer from room service and bounced back to Reception twice.   Told Thai Curry was not available 24 hours as indicated on the room service menu and staff disputed that it was indicated as such on the menu!.  Only Panini's available.   I would expect more from this Hotel with it being a SLH member.   Staff not helpful when I asked for other options for hot food.   Offered Pizza Hut menu that I could call Pizza Hut myself.   Eventually just went out looking for somewhere to eat and found an Indian on the next street.  Paid handsomely for an Executive Room in this Hotel but it was very small with low ceiling and tiny bathroom, not at all like it looked on the website or I expected.    Bed was very good.  Lift not working on saturday afternoon.   Did a lot of research before I booked and was therefore very disappointed overall.   An impersonal experience…..",2,2014,06,18
144,Not value for money,"Stayed for a week and given a room right next to the staircase( outside the door was stair landing with exit door from corridor). Woken up early every morning by people using the stairs.  Small room and not at all what it looked like on the website. Friendly staff but the room was simply not worth the price. Okay if staying for only one or two nights, but not so for a week-long stay. ",3,2014,06,17
144,Disappointment in Mayfair,"Great location and helpful staff but the rooms do not justify the price. I checked in with 2 colleagues and we were all given rooms that would disappoint if you were staying in a Blackpool B&B.  Small, poorly equipped and I had a shower that leaked water all over the bathroom.  If you want a boutique hotel near Green Park stay in Rubens - if you want a well equipped hotel in Mayfair at this price (£225 + £45 VAT) stay in the Park Lane Intercontinental.",2,2014,06,16
144,Fabulous boutique hotel,"First time at this hotel and what a find,  very close to Buckingham Palace where we were going. On arrival we were warmly welcomed by helpful and friendly staff.   Our room 104 although not large, was spotlessly clean and decorated beautifully,  ideal for weekend stay.   Facilities for making tea and coffee in the room, also complimentary bottles of water( replenished every day. )    The breakfast menu was outstanding lovely choice, self service buffet also hot food, cooked and served at your table. We also ate in the Grill which was very good.  Just cannot fault this wonderful hotel, the staff and service was fabulous, will definitely return.",5,2014,06,16
144,First Time to this hotel,"Friendly welcomed.  No complaint.   Told that ""upgraded"" to a better room, though it was ground floor behind reception hall.  Some kind of repair work was going on in the corridor or the room next and the noise was a bit annoying.    Though room was clean, functional, and quite despite the fact that the window is facing the street.   I booked the least expensive room with pre-paid.   Ordered breakfast room service.  Quality of food was excellent.  Again, friendly check out process. Asked my luggage for a few hours.  Door man was kind and friendly to catch me a cab to Paddington station upon departure.    No particular complaint....Good stay.  I may return again.",4,2014,06,15
144,R Lippiett,"Have been meaning to post this review for ages. 

Myself and 11 other ladies visited for afternoon tea as part of a sophisticated hen weekend. We were treated to a dedicated room just for us that was decorated beautifully and perfect for the occassion.The service was fabulous and the endless supply of stunning food, tea and champagne marvelous. We were a large group on quite a busy day but were not rushed or left waiting. It was the highlight of the weekend.  Would definitely come again!",5,2014,06,14
144,Great place,"We came here for drinks a couple of years ago when staying at the Ritz and thought we'd come back and stay. Happy to say that the hotel was great, slick check in, lovely (small but expected) room and still serving great cocktails in the bar. Location is ideal as most places are walkable, just round the corner from Green Park. 
Didn't eat in the grill, but breakfast was good.
Will stay again when next in London",5,2014,06,08
144,"Beautiful, boutique hotel with incredible service","We arrived early in the morning from an overseas flight, we were able to leave our bags as we explored the area. The front desk warmly greeted us. The room was well decorated and had all the amenities-loved the tea kettle. Enjoyed our drinks in the bar, which is well decorated in a funky Art Deco style. Service was great all around. Safe area. Central location and access to tube/bus, etc, was excellent",5,2014,06,07
144,Outstanding,"Our 3rd visit to this hotel and first time not at Christmas. The quality of care the team give guests is second to none; staff are friendly, helpful, efficient, proficient but never obtrusive. Guests are put completely at their ease and any stay feels like a home from home. The Breakfast menu is extensive and sumptuous, while the classic Afternoon Tea  is  a treat not to be missed.",5,2014,06,01
144,Very nice hotel.,"Have stayed here on a couple of occasions. Hotel is great for getting to lots of attractions on foot! Buckingham Palace is a 10 min walk away through Green Park. Turn left out of hotel & left at bottom of road to walk up Picadilly into central London! Lots of places to eat & drink on the way too.
",4,2014,05,30
144,"Great hotel,staff and location","Spent a few days at Flemings,apart from the rain in London the whole hotel, food experience was great, we was looked after really well. The food was really nice and the service even better. Front of house were very helpful, with brolly's at the ready, chatty and very helpful, made us very welcome. The drinks are a little expensive for my liking, but we expected this in Mayfair. The room was first class, clean and the beds are huge and very comfortable. Very close to Green park and Buckingham palace and shepards market just around the corner with a decent pub. Overall i would say, the best hotel we have stayed, but more than that, it was the people who ran the hotel from front of house to the cleaners who deserve the pat on the back. 
I hope to see you again next year",5,2014,05,29
144,Fantastic Hotel,"I spent three days in London at this wonderful boutique hotel.
When I arrived a porter with a top hat helped me inside.  Welcome to London.
Rooms were rather small but adequate.  Staff were very helpful.  The restaurant was a great little surprise and the food was delicious.
I walked to Hyde Park, Buckingham Palace and Oxford Street.
There is an underground station just around the corner.
Cant wait to go back",5,2014,05,27
144,Great Hotel centrally located,"When we arrived we were given a room on the top floor at the rear of the property, the ceiling height was at best 6 & half feet with 2 very small windows on each side of the room, when we complained & said that we will not stay the night staff were unable to assist, so we stayed for the night, at breakfast the next morning we were approached by the hotel manger that apologized & arranged another room upgrade at the front of the property! this was great, it had large windows & a great feel which made the rest of our stay very enjoyable, we would definitely stay there again, as long as we get a similar room, staff were very attentive which made the experience even better.",4,2014,05,27
144,A Lovely Hotel,"I stayed for 5 days with my son and the hotel was wonderful. Great location, helpful and friendly staff, and excellent value. The room was reasonably sized and comfortable. The lobby and common areas were cozy and made a great place to relax. Breakfast was delicious.",5,2014,05,27
144,Great stay and great location,"I stayed here with my partner last month.

It was pretty much a last minute idea to have a night in London and this hotel was perfect for just that.

When arriving at the hotel we tried our luck for any upgraded rooms and they kindly upgraded to the next room category! was more than pleased with the help from the staff and had a great stay.

The only downside was the expensive breakfast! GBP 18.00 for continental breakfast or GBP 24.00 for cooked breakfast - we decided to eat elsewhere! 

other than this it was a great stay and i would definitely recommend!",5,2014,05,27
144,it's a pity,"One of my favorite location in London is Mayfair, the hotel is an hold stylisch block of 5 houses and the forniture inside are amazing. The hall, the rooms are nice and clean. But it's a pity, nobody tels you, neither at the reservation neither at the check in, there are some works for renovation on progress and your room could be very noisy. The real problem I've faced during my stay was a lack in management, coordination and professionality of the staff. We had the first day a request for slippers in the room, they brought in the room but they forgot to service the room. We had dinner at the Grill Restaurant with some menu made by the famous chef Rosemary Shrager, fine for her disches, but dont try to order something like a normal rib eye medium. After 45 min they bring to you a charred thiny beef. I had the impression that the staff is positive but does'nt have a proper management. Its just a matter of focalize the effort with them. On the other side for my wife anniversary they delivered us half bottle of champagne, very nice of them. But no a business card no a greeting from the GM why? It's a pity, and is the perfect example of a not motivated management.",3,2014,05,26
144,"Noisy, expensive hotel","I asked the friendly staff to give me a quiet room, which was promised, just to find myself in a room opposite to a construction plot. Wifi did not function and staff was unable to fix it. For the rest: quiet normal London hotel: small rooms, high prices, everything old and in need of refurbishment. Nice old style: wooden panels, nice decorations.",2,2014,05,24
144,Wonderful stay,"The hotel staff are excellent, service was really very good. We needed to check in early to get changed for an important engagement the hotel were really obliging would highly recommend. The food at lunch and breakfast was tasty and the surroundings really relaxing.",5,2014,05,22
144,Wonderful experience,"I chose this hotel for a week long business stay in London. Very warm welcome, very polite, very professional. Lovely look and feel to the place, very classy. The food was very nice tasting, well presented and Moorish. Breakfast was very nice too. 

The room was cosy but professional, nice place to relax after work. 
the staff were immensely friendly and no request was too much. Service was impeccable and swift.
was made to feel welcome from start to end and would most certainly stay again.

only negatives to feed back were the prices around food and drink. £17.50 for a burger i felt was a little steep.
£5 for a bottle of water...very steep.
Would have been nice to have been told that the water isn't included or free when being offered. This was my only hidden charge that just took the shine off an otherwise perfect stay.

More notice about needing a credit card for deposit on arrival is needed. Not everyone has a spare £120 to lay down upfront. Luckily i was with parents on the first day and they sorted it otherwise it would have been a problem.

very impressed and thanks for the welcoming stay. See you again soon.",4,2014,05,20
144,Wonderful visit,"Booked this hotel after good reviews on the net. Not disappointed, very attentive staff, room a little small but everything needed was there. Did not have an evening meal but the menu looked interesting. However, an excellent breakfast on both mornings. Discounted car park nearby for hotel residents. Can recommend this hotel which is situated just off Piccadilly. Just a short walk to Harrods!",5,2014,05,16
144,Best Service in Mayfair,"Flemings Mayfair was a charming and wonderful experience! Not a complaint to be made. After a short, but wonderful trip to the Caribbean, my husband and I stayed at Flemings for 4 nights in early February to break up our long trip back to Australia. We stayed in a very spacious Junior Suite that was contained in building separate to the main hotel. The room was recently refurbish and presented in a luxurious but tasteful style. However, the real pleasure of our stay was provided by the staff. Each staff member was helpful, well mannered and eager to please; everything you could ask for while staying in Mayfair. I would absolutely recommend this hotel to anyone thinking about staying in Central London.",5,2014,05,13
144,Hidden gem- at top location!,"What a lovely hotel Fleming at Mayfair is! Absolutely great location at Green park and therefore close to everything. You can walk to Piccadilly Circus in ten minutes and catch all buses on Piccadilly Street and the tube from Green park.and even though location is in the middle of everything it is quite . The decor is beautiful and the service is in absolutely top. The staff do make you feel very special and as a guest, not just another customer! We had a tripleroom which was very nice, at the smaller side though, as all hotelrooms in London are. Breakfast is really good and the staff at the restaurant really kones good service ! So does the concierge who was very helpfull . Do not miss  a relaxing moment in the great lounge area or to take a picture of the "" grazy"" elevator. All in all we loved The Fleming! And as very frequent visitors to London, we feel as if we finally has found "" our hotel""!",5,2014,05,13
144,As expected!,"My husband and I spend a week on this Hotel for New Years Eve and it actually had a fair price. The hotel has a great location, near Ritz, New and Old Bond Street, only some blocks away from Covent Garden, Oxford St., Buckingham Palace and the best places in town. In other words, everything could be done by foot. 

We didn't have breakfast at the hotel, neither other meals so I cannot say anything about it. We had some issues though. 

On the day we arrived we couldn't make an early check-in and there was no place for us to change our clothes and refresh besides the gym. There was a plum issue on a Street close to the Hotel so we almost stayed a day without being able to use the bathroom, wash our hands and take a shower (not the Hotel fault). They did offer us to use the bathroom from Hilton (which is across the Street, but certainly not the same thing as using your hotel room bathroom). The room, even though really small, is nicely decorated but the bathroom was the biggest disappointment. The ceiling was too low and my husband couldn't barely stand straight. Also the corridors to the rooms were to old and ""woody"" which certainly didn't match a modern boutique hotel as Flemings.

During our stay the hotel also had an internet issue for a day and on the other days the free Wifi was available only on the common areas. 

The staff was great and friendly and the hotel offered big and nice umbrellas which can be very useful in London. I would certainly come back!",3,2014,05,02
144,Great location,"We booked our stay at the Flemings Mayfair Hotel based on other reviews from the Tripadvisors.  Prior to our arrival, we emailed the hotel requesting a quite room and an early check-in.  The hotel guest service was very accommodating.   Upon arrival, there was a personal note from the guest service in our room...nice touch!!!  The room was clean and quite.  We also had free internet access in our room.    The only downside was that the bathroom did not have an electrical outlet for hair dryer and curling iron.  The only outlet in the bathroom was for shavers only.   

The hotel is in central area accessible to everything.  Friendly and welcoming staff.  I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting London for pleasure and/or for business.",4,2014,05,01
144,"Good location, good service, decent hotel but EXPENSIVE INTERNET","I stay in a lot of hotels, half I don't even bother to review.

I like this hotel, I will probably stay here again, as it is better than The Washington down the road. The front office staff were great, the doormen and concierge were friendly.

My biggest problem was being charged £50 for internet for 4 days. It is ridiculous in this day and age some hotels are still charging for wifi. This is like being charged for aircon, or heating or other utilities. I'd rather you raise the room rate £12.50 so at least I don't feel like i'm being ripped off.

Also try and get a room at the back of the hotel so you're not woken up by the bin men at 5am every morning.

Rooms are quite small, which is typical for London, so I would book an upgrade.

Apart from that... I would recommend.",4,2014,04,25
144,Fabulous Flemings,"Just returned from 3 nights at Flemings. We travelled as 2 adults and one child. The hotel was in a wonderful location, very central. Hotel staff were welcoming and on hand for any queries.  The family room was a good size for central London and extremely clean. As the hotel was so well situated we were able to walk to popular tourist areas such as Parliment Square, the London Eye, Buckingham Palace and good shopping areas.
Easy walk down to Knightsbridge and great walks through Green Park, St James Park.

We did not eat at the hotel so cannot comment on the food. Fab choice of restaurants within walking distance from reasonable to very pricey depending on your budget.

I would not hesitate to stay at this hotel again and would recommend.",5,2014,04,17
144,worth its 4 stars,"i stayed three nights in executive double room 300 and was pleasantly surprised. the room was very spacious and the design looked just as on the pictures. the bed was wonderful and i really enjoyed the bath tub. the service was excellent and always ready to help. i also tried the breakfast which was not included (18 pounds for continental, 24 for british with a choice of different hot meals) and i have to say that it's worth the money. perfect service, fresh ingredients and everything you need for a good start in the day. the only negative thing i noticed was that the restaurant is in the basement and has no windows but very nice decor. 
location is excellent.",4,2014,04,15
144,Lovely stay,"We arrived to friendly staff and told we had been upgraded.
Lovely twin room with queen beds and a nice sitting area. Quality fittings
Very comfortable and clean, great breakfast (love the eggs Benedict) and such lovely staff.
Tried afternoon tea and it was great to see chocolate bread sandwiches (may not be everyone's taste) and beet root bread sandwiches - loved that it was different.  Finally great location just off green park and so close to picaddily and the shops!",5,2014,04,10
144,great little secret escape to town,"This is a great little hotel with very friendly and capable staff. Superb hidden away location, just off of Green Park/Piccadilly. Excellent concierge as well. We used him to obtain some excellent tickets for War Horse.",4,2014,04,02
144,Lovely boutique hotel in Mayfair! Recommend.,We stayed in the recently renovated rooms just along from the main entrance and were very much impressed. I arrived very late but the receptionist walked me over and was very kind. Great service and great location!,5,2014,03,30
144,Nice stay,"Stayed here for my partners Xmas present weekend. Very nice location in London.  Lovely room, well appointed. Had room service, quick and good standard. Reception and housekeeping staff very pleasant. Will definitely return. Thanks julie",4,2014,03,30
144,"Great hotel, unhelpful staff","This hotel is beautiful and it is in a great location. it's very close to train stations, supermarkets and Hyde Park. However don't leave anything behind as once you have checked out the staff are very unhelpful. I left my camera in the hotel room in January 2014 and after several phone calls and emails I am still waiting (it's almost April) for a response from staff.",3,2014,03,25
144,one night stay,"A special night in London for the two of us and we chose flemings - two gargantuan cup cakes topped  with oodles of chocolate icing and a half bottle of champagne awaited us on our arrival - both consumed (cup cakes and my partner does not like sweet things!!) - the champagne, chilled in a bucket of ice was perfect!  For me personally the decor is too OTT but somehow it works even for someone with a minimalist preference of less is more.  Staff courteous, polite and nothing too much trouble, unfortunately the Hilton Hotel opposite offloaded their entire wine stock for the week at 6am in the morning in Half Moon Street which was not the fault of the hotel, so the racket outside our bedroom window meant an early wake up call that was not required.  Breakfast was fabulous, we both had haddock, which was moist, superb flavour and beautifully served.  Cakes and pastries looked delicious (by this stage we were full to capacity) and of course the position could not be better.  A walk in Green Park admiring the early daffodils rounded off a wonderful treat in London.  Could not have asked for more.   Thank you.",4,2014,03,24
144,Nostalgic Splendour,"From the first day to the last day staying here has been an absolute pleasure. For a pleasurable experience the hotel fits this, one thing that is important is the staff, everything else can be the best but with the wrong staff you don't see your patrons return, well my wife an I stayed for 9 days here and the staff were the friendliest and most helpful we have come across, they couldn't do enough to assist which is brilliant, ""well done to the team at the Flemings"". With new decor in a large percentage of the rooms we had the stamp room, a nice size room all the necessary amenities you need along with a great location. The front lounge has plenty of seating and is quirky in design, one can have afternoon tea or a pre meal drink.  A small walk to the local tube (Green Street), this offers you a central location close to parks, shops, attractions and restaurants. Close by to Shepherds street with a wide variety of pubs and eateries that vary in price range, you are in the right area of town.",5,2014,03,22
144,"Good, with a potential","The location is excellent, central and yet quiet. It is within walking distance to all of Central London, In addition, a few minutes away, Green Park tube station offers the intersection of three underground lines to take you anywhere in the Greater London area, also with a direct connection to Heathrow airport. Another advantage is nearby Shepherd's market offering a multitude of different restaurants, some of which are rather good. 
The staff is friendly and fairly efficient. The hotel has distinctive style.

On the downside: most single rooms are tiny, too tiny to turn around. In many cases windows do not open. The AC is noisy and not very effective. The breakfast room is wildly overpriced, so it is advisable to have breakfast outside.",4,2014,03,20
144,"As promised, I returned - and on closer inspection, hmm...","I stayed at, and reviewed, this hotel back in March 2013, a year ago.
I said then that I would certainly return on my next visit to this part of London ... and I did.

The hotel is still as stylish, suave and sophisticated as it was a year ago. The check-in process was smooth, the staff were friendly, and it still held it own in terms of value-for-money in this area of the city.

However...

...this time I needed wi-fi. There is free wi-fi in the public areas, but in-room wi-fi incurs a charge. Fortunately, my room was close enough to a public area to (just about) pick up the free access. I know I shouldn't have done it, but I would have expected free in-room wi-fi for a hotel of this quality (and price).

...and this time I had breakfast, which was very disappointing. It was, quite possibly, the smallest buffet I have EVER seen in a hotel.

The hotel is still ""very good"", but I have stopped short of an ""excellent"" on this occasion, largely because of these two issues. Yes, I'd stay there again, undoubtedly, but I would just check other hotels in the area to see if they've got any special offers for my next trip.",4,2014,03,12
144,Weekend break in London,"This hotel really worked for my wife and I.  Very well located, just a short walk from Green Park underground station.  As the hotel was so well located we didn't use the facilities, hence i can't give it a 5 star review.  Around the corner (1 minute walk) was Shepherds Market, bars and restaurants.  I don't like paying £20 for a breakfast so we got on the underground and went to Borough Market.  Be warned, Mayfair hotels, in fact London hotels have small rooms for the money.  The price for this hotel was fair but will feel a lot for the size you get.  Overall, a good stay with friendly staff and a well run hotel.",4,2014,03,09
144,FABULOUS FLEMINGS!,"We love Flemings and have returned twice in the past year. Centrally located, great area nearby in Shepherds Market and a lovely modern hotel in traditional surroundings. 
The staff are great. The food is great. The accommodation is great.
We will be back again in the future",5,2014,03,05
144,The first hotel in London to serve hot toast!,"The position of this hotel is perfect for shoppers. On their doorstep they have several arcades, Bond Street, Jermyn Street etc. The hotel is a short walk from Green Park tube. I had asked for an early check in if a room was available and they accommodated my wish. The room was welcoming and clean. I also liked the hand written card welcoming me back with a small edible gift. We were in room 226 which over looks Half Moon Street which I particularly like. Breakfast was excellent and Flemings have to be commended on the first hotel in London to serve hot toast! I would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel.",4,2014,03,03
144,Fantastic Hotel,"We recently re-visited the Hotel and had not been for a few years.  The Hotel was good back then, but it is totally superb now.  The Staff could not be any more helpful and friendly, the room was out of this world; so comfortable and with equipped with everything you could need. The breakfast was totally amazing.  Location is ideal, within minutes of Green Park tube and also within walking distance of most of the major stores, theatres and sights.  Would highly recommend and will definitely be returning soon.",5,2014,03,01
144,very convenient,"Great location with excellent service.  Elevator was slow and hallways were narrow, but they just added to the character of the hotel.  The only real issue, all be it minor was the Wi-Fi which was spotty.  They also limit the hotel computer use for printing boarding passes to 15 min with a slow connection.  If it was not for the Wi-Fi and computer I would rate it a 5.  Perfect location, comfortable rooms and great service.",4,2014,02,26
144,Superb customer experience,"We stayed in this hotel for 2 nights in February 2014.  The location is excellent, on a quiet street just off Piccadilly and is within a few minutes walk from Green Park station. The station itself was ideal as it has elevator access to street level and therefore great for us as we were travelling with a small child.

The customer service at the hotel was as good as I have experienced anywhere and every member of staff went out of their way to make our stay comfortable and enjoyable from the moment we arrived. 

I would certainly stay here again.",5,2014,02,25
144,"Great location, great rooms, alright service","This small boutique hotel in Mayfair was perfect for my dad and I to stay at whilst visiting London for a few days. Great location for high-end shops, and shopping in general, as well as being a pretty central spot to restaurants and cafes.

The rooms were a good size (not massive but not claustrophobic-ly small either). Service was a bit iffy with some staff, with a little bit of a communication issue arising sometimes.

We didn't have breakfast or eat at the Hotel's Grill so can't comment on that. We had some drinks/cocktails at the bar and in the lounge, they were great but a bit pricey.

Overall a great stay though, and we would return for sure.",4,2014,02,21
144,US Travelers Beware!!  Horrible experience!,"This was horrible experience! This was second time at this hotel. I stayed at this hotel in September 2013 and it was a great experience and I even gave them an glowing review.   In early February 2014, there has been an inclement weather in the US and my flight was cancelled. I had to take another flight the next day and push my travel back one day.  The hotel would not extend my stay nor would they give me a refund.  After much conversation to offer me a room that was triple in price!  Not only did this hotel not accommodate me; they gave me the dirtiest room with clear mildew in the bathroom.  This was my favorite hotel in  London and now I  will never stay there ever again.  For all US travelers, do not think of coming to this hotel. . they are not understanding to weather concerns.",1,2014,02,19
144,Great location for tourist London,"My husband and I booked 2 rooms (for us and my son/his partner) in June 2013 and then again I did when my sister flew in that fall.  The location is great, with lots of good restaurants nearby, easy Tube access.  The rooms are small, the internet (which one has to pay for is really slow and annoying--better off down the street at the coffee shop).",4,2014,02,18
144,Great location!,"A comfy and cosy hotel. Comfortable beds, clean rooms - and friendly staff. I had a lovely night sleep and the location was fantastic. A short review, but if you want a nice base for a shopping trip and don't want to spend a fortune, you can't really go wrong staying here.",3,2014,02,18
144,Great hotel in good location,"I recently stayed here for three nights and would recommend the hotel. As others have mentioned, the staff are very friendly and professional; the door men in particular were helpful and always friendly and welcoming. The hotel is a true ""boutique"" style hotel and the decor of the public areas was nice. Our room was located downstairs near to the public areas which I initially thought was going to be a problem with noise, but it was not at all. London hotel rooms are always going to be small unless you book a suite, but an executive room here was a very decent size; no falling over suitcases or pole vaulting to get to the bed! 

The location is excellent. On a side street so quiet, yet in the centre of Mayfair and walking distance to Knightsbridge, Leicester Square, Soho and Regent Street. There are plenty of good restaurants in the area. Green Park tube just around the corner which is on a very good tube line.",4,2014,02,13
144,Nice hotel with friendly staff but........,"Nice hotel with friendly staff, however our room was small and dark with no view from the window and very noisy air conditioning which we had to turn off.  The bathroom was old  fashioned with a shower over the bath but all spotlessly clean and comfortable. We booked this hotel through hotel tonight and therefore got a good deal however we would have been disappointed if we had paid the full price. The location is excellent and within easy reach of shops and theatres and we were able to walk back from Soho on the Saturday night. Would we go again.....probably not if we had to pay the full price.",3,2014,02,10
144,Staff took care of everything,I took my wife for a romantic weekend and the staff helped on booking everything we needed. The rooms are lovely and the attention to detail is obvious. It has a very good location and I would definitely go back.,5,2014,02,09
144,"quaint hotel with great location, but some windows are obstructed","My partner and I spent one night at Flemings Hotel Mayfair while we were transiting through London, and overall, I felt that it was a quaint hotel that was different than all the boring corporate hotels that abound in London. We booked this hotel through the app Hotels Tonight, and were able to get the room for about half off. It was a Sunday night, and they said that they were rather full, so they did not upgrade us.

The location is actually very nice, right on Green Park near Buckingham Palace. We mainly stayed at this hotel because it was Chinese New Year that night and we want to be within walking distance of Soho and the Chinatown. The tube station is only two blocks away, so it is very convenient to other sites in London. Also, being in Mayfair for the price we paid was a steal.

The room itself was small, but not minuscule. That's an important distinction to make when discussing London hotels, because I did not felt cramped. Now, I will say that the view from the window was nonexistent and looked out onto a boiler. (I question why they would even have a window in the first place, but I guess not having a window would make you feel like you're on inside stateroom of a cruise.) The bathroom was nice and large, and the shower was powerful. After our long trip, we had a lot of luggage, so the room felt that small, but the room was perfectly adequate for two people staying for a night.

Staff was friendly throughout, and check-in was a breeze. They helped us with our bags, and because we were running late to the airport, we were able to send an Uber to the front door and the valet loaded our bags by the time we arrived from lunch to drive off. Very nice.

Unfortunately, because we were staying just for the night, we were not able to take advantage of their breakfast or eating at the restaurant or bar. It looked intimate and trendy, we just didn't have the time.

Overall, Flemings Hotel Mayfair is not a bad place to stay for a night or two. For the money we paid and the location, I felt it was very good and a value. I enjoyed our stay.",4,2014,02,08
144,one night stand,"nice hotel, extremely attentive, bit old fashioned, rather quirky service. Even for London its expensive at £230 a night no brkst inc. Still if you know where it is and know its got a gym its nice. nice jaguar in the foyer!",4,2014,02,05
144,Such a great hotel!,"We stayed here overnight -as we had theater booked for the matinee & a meal booked with friends, so thought make a weekend of it!
The hotel was superb from start to end - the staff were all fab the room - just a standard was small but perfect, the bed very comfy so a good night sleep was had - and we heard no other guests which was amazing!",5,2014,02,04
144,Good short break,"We stayed 3 nights at Flemings last week during a short break in London. We have stayed before and again we were not disappointed. The room was a reasonable size with a seating area, the bathroom was quite small but manageable for a short break. The Hotel is in a very good location for London attractions many of which you can easily walk to if you wish. The staff are all very helpful and pleasant and nothing is too much trouble. There is a pleasant lounge area for a light lunch/ coffee/ tea and also a downstairs bar as well as the main restaurant.  The food was good.
Our room was on the first floor facing an inner court yard which we found quieter than a room facing the street.
We would definitely return to Flemings.",4,2014,02,02
144,A good hotel in a good location,"We came across this hotel after winning a competition on Twitter. When we arrived the check in was done smoothly and was told that we had been upgraded to an executive room, much to our delight. 
The room was very big and with a big comfy bed which was good after walking round London all day.The room was very clean and the decor was up to date. The only bad point was the view outside our window which was an air conditioning duct/unit thing. 
We didn't Eat at the hotel as it was Chinese new year so we decided to eat in china town instead, but the menu did look good. 
The bar was lovely with a trendy atmosphere.
The staff were friendly and very helpful. All in all a very lovely hotel and would come back in the future.Thank you Flemmings for choosing me as a competition winner. 
All in all we were happy with our stay and would return in the future.",4,2014,02,01
144,Another fantastic stay,"This hotel is one of our favourites in London. Rooms are spacious and immaculate. Food, ambience and service second to none. Location convenient for shepherds market restaurants if you want to try something different. We will be back soon! ",5,2014,01,26
144,Super Hotel,"I stayed in this hotel for one night with my husband and daughter over the Christmas period, as it was a birthday celebration for them both.  On arrival we were greeted by extremley friendly and helpful staff who swiftly checked us in, directed us to the car parking (approx. 5 minute walk away).  We were extremley lucky and had been upgraded to a one bedroom apartment which was fantastic!  The hotel is conveniently situated for shopping and theatres and we were able to walk almost anywhere.  In the evening, before heading out for dinner, the hotel very kindly brought us all a glass of champage to our room as a birthday celebration!  The room was extremley clean and spacious, and was stocked with White Company toiletries, (which are my favourite)  and overall the hotel was very boutique in style and smelt of orange and cinnamon when we arrrived (again I think this could be White Company Winter fragrance).  All in all this hotel and our stay was fantastic and I couldn't recommend it highly enough.  We have told all our friends and definatley plan to stay here again.  Thank you so much to everyone at Flemings who made our stay so memorable!",5,2014,01,21
144,A true boutique hotel,"Personal service, convenient location and subtle elegance describe this hotel. You can walk almost anywhere and the underground and buses are very close. The staff could not have been more helpful and friendly. Our room was very comfortable and there was plenty of space. Breakfast had lots of choices and was very good. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting London.",5,2014,01,16
144,Not sure I would stay here again,"Stayed in Flemings while in London on business. Check in was smooth with an efficient friendly doorman. I asked for a quiet room and was given room 113. Five minutes later I was back in the lobby asking to move. Room 113 overlooks two very noisy air conditioning unit fans. (It is also EXTREMELY small, but so am I so that wouldn't have bothered me, but it is too small for a couple). I was given room 412, quieter but one can still hear the air conditioning fans. I suspect that one cannot escape them. This room was a little bigger with a decent size bathroom , BUT if I had paid for this myself I would be less happy. Neither room 113 or 412 are anything like as glamorous as the photographs on the hotel website. I am spoilt, I travel a lot and am used to 4 and 5* hotels in judging boutique hotels all over the world. Flemings is average in germs of rooms. The saving grace is that the staff are excellent and breakfast in the dining room is excellent. Usually I have room service but even I won't pay the exorbitant cost for a continental breakfast that this hotel charges!",3,2014,01,16
144,Very happy with our stay at Flemings Hotel and Apartments,"This is a hotel that I would highly recommend. The staff, rooms, friendly and sincere service was well and truly above our expectations. From the time we arrived till the time we left it was always exceptional. Whenever we had a question they were very helpful with educated answers. The lounge was a good place to relax after a hard days walking and sight seeing. The rooms were a good size and clean and tidy.
Next time we go to London we will definitely stay there and advise others the same.",5,2014,01,15
144,You honestly can't beat it!,"Just returned from another stay at Flemings with my mother.  This is the friendliest hotel we have stayed in, particularly in a place like London.  The staff do everything possible to ensure your stay is memorable,  Nothing is too much trouble for them.  In fact all the staff appear to be happy in their work which reflects the atmosphere of this wonderful boutique hotel.

It has a beautiful smell as you enter the lobby, the lounge is very warm & comfortable with designer décor as is the dining room.

We had dinner in the hotel which was very good value and absolutely delicious.  Our waiter was really charming & very attentive (I really wanted to mention his name but have returned home & forgotten it, think he was from Columbia!)  Even when we are on a day trip to London we eat in this restaurant.

We had a twin room which was very comfortable with a very smart bathroom & WHITE COMPANY SMELLIES....that's when you know it's a smart place to stay!

Having stayed at the Ritz & The Savoy several times as a special treat by my husband I have to say I have never felt the need to put comments on trip adviser about either because they are as one would expect for the money you pay.  Yes the Ritz is amazing BUT its not as personal & for the money I have to say Flemings is ABSOLUTELY GREAT.

I don't think you'll be disappointed.  I would highly recommend.  Fantastic position for shops, tubes, buses & across the road you can get away from it all & take a short walk across the park to 'the' Palace.  Best of all worlds.

Can't wait to return....thank you all  at Flemings for your hard work.",5,2014,01,12
144,"Good hotel, great location!  Some service hiccups, though...","We stayed for 5 nights over the New Years Day.  Our room size was ok for 3 people, however, a king family room is really best for a couple.  There were no drawers to unpack our clothes and the closet had attached hangers, which is not in line with a luxury hotel. The rooms and common areas were very clean and well maintained.  Regarding the service, it was definitely inconsistent.  Some days our room was cleaned early; other days is was still unmade at 3:30pm.  There was a water main break in which the hotel lost water for a full day.  Guests were offered shower and rest room services at the Hilton across the street, which was an inconvenience, especially in the winter, but we were grateful for this accommodation.  We thought the hotel management should have offered some type of credit, rebate or free drinks, but their gesture was limited to a couple of free bottles of water. The concierge service was lacking in staff who were well informed about tourist attractions.  Yes, the hotel has free wi-fi, but it is limited to the common areas and is very slow.  Paid wi-fi was pricey at GBP15 per day!",4,2014,01,12
144,Luxurious stay in a great location,"My family stayed 2 nights as a new year break and this hotel was in a great location for the many things we wanted to do while in London. These included visits to the Science museum, Knightsbridge generally, a choice of superb restaurants, Tate Britain, two lovely parks and our Theatre outing to see Billy Elliot. The hotel itself and its staff were excellent. The rooms and bathrooms were spotless, quiet and very comfortable, albeit on the small side for a double and a twin. Breakfast was lovely and offered a wide choice with or without the cooked option. Afternoon tea was a real treat too. It was a treat to stay there.",5,2014,01,12
144,great location and nice Hotel but very small rooms,"the Location of Flemings was perfect for us, so it was the main decision to decide on it. the lobby is very nice, check-in was quick and all staff was very friendly and helpful.

The Restaurant were we had breakfast which was included in our Rate was also very nice decorated with comfortable seating. the hot dishes we could choose from the menu were very tasty.

the reason why I will go for another Hotel next time is the size of the rooms. yes, it's not a secret that rooms can be very small in London but actually this was the smallest double room I've ever stayed.

There were no drawers or other possibility to put clothes (except for a closet with hangers) so we lived out of our suitcases. the Bathroom was so small - even for 1 person. the room was well maintained and we liked the decor and did not mind to have no view from the the small window but it was really too small as a ""luxury rated Hotel"" should have adequate rooms sizes even in ""standard rooms""",3,2014,01,12
144,Relaxing atmosphere,"The Grill Bar has some of the most comfortable and colourful sofas in London, puff up the many cushions and you could be forgiven for not wanting to move again.
The champagne coctails and food are delicous. Staff are friendly, all in all a lovely place for an evening out.",5,2014,01,12
144,A disappointment,"A friendly staff who tried their best did not make up for what amounted to a fairly bleak one week stay.  The very expensive hotel wireless service would not communicate either my wife's Apple PC or my Lenovo PC (though it did with our mobiles) so we were forced to go a nearby Starbucks to access the internet. 
There were no drawers or other place in the room to put clothes (except for a closet with hangers) so we had to live out of our suitcases.
The dining room could not on several occasions accommodate us due apparently to staff shortages.
There was considerable noise in the night from the street.
We had one day without water (albeit not the fault of the hotel). 
And so forth.",3,2014,01,11
144,Exceptional Location & Excellent Services.,"Stayed here for 3 nights during a recent visit to London. The hotel is centrally located and close to Green Park Underground Station (less than 5 minute walk) and all other major tourist attractions (Bond Street, Oxford, Leicester Square etc.) as well as the Buckingham Palace and Hyde Park. Staff is very attentive and nice.  The only draw back is that the room that I was in is relatively small. Maybe because I booked a Singel Room. There is not much of a view from the room and it's actually quite small.  However, I think it is still value for money given its relatively affordable rate, especially if you take advantage of their promotions.  I won't have hesitation to stay here again next time!",4,2014,01,08
144,The Flemings Hotel in London,"Great Location for this hotel as is central to everything you would want to see in London.  Stayed here over the new year.  Staff were friendly and helpful.  Breakfast was more than expected, nothing was too much for the staff.  rooms were clean and bathroom lovely, can't wait to stay there again",5,2014,01,08
144,An excellent stay,"I stayed for one night, which included a group dinner in the evening. I reserved the basic single room on line some time in advance and on checking in was upgraded to an executive room. It had no view from the window, but that did not worry me. The room was excellent in every respect, with all the facilities I could possibly require. The group dinner in the restaurant was of good quality, served by charming staff who put us under no pressure to leave, so we stayed chatting until late. The buffet breakfast was comprehensive, my only criticism being that no warm plates were provided for the hot food. Throughout, all staff were helpful and friendly, and the interior was decorated and maintained to a high standard.",5,2014,01,08
144,Ok but a little disappointed,"My wife and I visit London 3-4 times a year to take in a show etc , We have wanted for a little while to stay at Flemings and although it was ok we both came away disappointed apart from the excellent location and staff . We normally stay at the Cavendish or Park Plaza Westminster both of which in our opinion are considereably better although both are larger . 
The room was small and the windows looking to the rear were unable to look out of , not sure why but all they allowed was light , for 1 night ok . The staff were very helpful and our Polish waiter at Dinner was very cheerful .
We booked our trip including Breakfast however we were told at Breakfast that our booking included only continental breakfast not full English although and this would be a £6.00 supplement if required . The continental offered a very small choice compared with others and was disappointing , this should be made clear , surely breakfast should be breakfast , only a small point but if you are going you should check what you are getting .Seems very penny pinching to me .
We would stay again as the location is very good and the staff are very pleasant but for larger rooms , luxury and a proper breakfast try elsewhere .",3,2014,01,06
144,Excellent venue for party. Rooms dissapointing.,"I held a charity event here for 60+ people and the staff! food! atmosphere was amazing in the restaurant. They were accommodating and helpful until we vacated to the bar afterwards.

This is when the guests that had been purchasing drinks all day were told they had to leave the bar area unless they were ordering drinks, very disappointed after such a good day.

I have since returned for dinner with friends in the private room and agin, the food was superb, staff were very helpful and the atmosphere was great, vibrant, buzzy and sexy.

Last year as a Christmas present to each other a friend and I stayed here as a treat so we could shop and relax. The location is perfect and the bar and food was very good but the room we stayed in was shocking. The wallpaper was expensive but peeling, the carpet was dirty, the room was small and not luxurious at all.

I am sure if we had gone for a luxury suite then this would have not been the case but it has left a bad taste in my mouth?

I would definitely recommend for dinner, afternoon tea, drinks in the sexy modern and well decorated bars and outer rooms, I would not stay here again or tell any of my friends to stay here due to this experience.",5,2014,01,04
144,great boutique hotel,first time stay over the Christmas period and it didn't disappoint :-) stayed here a few times and will be back again over the festive period again. Everyone is very friendly and the rooms are decorated to a high standard. The atmosphere is lovely and location doesn't get much better for seeing London. Thank you and look forward to staying again in 2014 x,5,2014,01,02
144,4 star going on 5!! Brand family Cheshire,"We chose this hotel randomly but were absolutely delighted it is well located for central London the service is excellent. Couldn't fault the staff from reception to housekeeping. The ambience is warm and inviting with staff friendly and yet remaining professional. Nothing is too much trouble and as we were there for Christmas it was festive and the lounge area actually felt comfortable enough to mix with other guests. We have stayed in many 5 star hotels that become too large and impersonal this hotel felt very comfortable I thought it was excellent value for money and would definitely stay there again. The attention to detail in the room was fabulous. Plenty of towels, slippers, towelling robes, hair dryer, iron bedding and pillows were excellent for a good night,s sleep",5,2013,12,30
144,Friendly and classy boutique hotel.,"There is a very nice feel about this hotel. The warm welcome from door staff and reception get you off to a good start. We checked in on Christmas Day and booked 2 rooms 110 and 111. Both rooms were spotlessly clean , spacious and very comfortable. Beds were big and lovely cotton sheets, pillows , bathroom had robes and fluffy towels. Tea and coffee making facilities. We booked bed and breakfast breakfast was lovely, good coffee, smoked salmon, ham, cheese, bread , fruit, pastries.ect. For an extra 6£ you could have full cooked breakfast. Flemings is unique, stylish, modern and has a modern stylish decor. There is a great lounge to relax. Yes it was Christmas and everyone seemed happy, there were little treats in the lounge, cakes, mince pies, a nice touch. Boxing Day was the same staff had stayed in the hotel and were all fresh and happy as a result, what sensible management. In summary we loved this little hotel, will be booking again. Thank you.",5,2013,12,30
144,A great little hotel,"I've really grown to love this hotel and have stayed a couple of times recently. Although the rooms are small, they are comfortable and well appointed. The staff is friendly, professional and efficient. The hotel is in great shape and the bathrooms are all great. The location makes this a hidden gem. In my view the deals you can get at this hotel do not do it justice. I will continue to stay here.",5,2013,12,29
144,Traditional English comfort (but rooms differ a lot in size),"As the location of the hotel is extremely convenient, I have been staying there four times already. Every single time my room has looked different. Of course, they have upgraded some of the rooms, but I find that the rooms differ a lot, in décor and in size. During my latest visit, my room was extremely small and my bed was just inches away from the door (there was a lot of noise from the corridor as people were walking by and talking…almost next to my pillow!).  My friends were staying in a much larger room, although we paid the same price for the rooms.  My next door neighbor was clearly from across the Atlantic and not adjusted to London time yet as he stayed up very late and made phone calls throughout the night. The soundproofing is not that great in an old house, but you would expect more from a hotel belonging to the Small Luxury Hotels of the World.  Cannot say that I slept well this time. During another visit, my room was located next to the room where the chambermaids get their linen and I could hear them gossip there. The other times I’ve stayed at the Flemings have been quiet times.
  
But there are other reasons why I have returned to this hotel. The breakfast is good, the service and welcome in the reception rather attentive. The rooms are very stylishly decorated and the bathrooms are nice, especially for a London hotel.  And the location is great when you want to travel by the tube around London and from/to Heathrow on Piccadilly Line. The hotel is located within a walking distance from many museums and theatres. Green Park is a short stroll away as is the Buckingham Palace. There are grocery stores and restaurants nearby and on Half Moon Street there is not that much traffic if you get a room facing the street. 

The hotel advertises its afternoon tea service and as we had a special occasion, we thought that it would be easy to arrange an afternoon tea service during our three night stay at the hotel. Unfortunately, you really have to book in advance even if you are an in-house guest. We were completely flexible regarding the times and day, but they could not fit us in. Oh well, there were plenty of other hotels and department stores close by that do afternoon tea as well.  

My recent experience with the small and noisy room will make me think twice about my hotel choice next time I visit London.",3,2013,12,29
144,our favourite hotel in London,"We stayed at this hotel for the second time, and it was even better than our first staying. We were there just before Christmas holidays and enjoyed fine decoration of the hotel. We were welcome guests and we really felt at home there. We found the staff of the hotel to be wonderful; they are extremely committed to providing a great experience for all their guests. Our room and the bathroom were very nice, and unexpectedly spacious for a hotel in the very center of London. The beds and pillows were very comfortable, so we had a good night's sleep after our busy days out. The concierge service is fantastic there: they do their best, they can answer any question and their recommendations are mega-helpful.  
We were leaving early in the morning and as the result of my morning drowse I forgot my jewelry in the safe box. I realized that only the day after. I can't thank enough the house keeping staff, the front desk young ladies and specially – Sabina, who helped to find and send me back my jewelry in a very short time!
We would stay here again in a heartbeat and do not hesitate to recommend it to everyone as the best place to stay when visiting London (business or pleasure).This hotel has a feeling about it, a warmth and kindness that pervades.
Merry, Merry Christmas and Happy New Year holiday to all of your staff! Let your thoughts and actions return to you as reality and results. Wishing you and your dear ones a wonderful Christmas time! See you in 2014!!!",5,2013,12,25
144,Great hotel with friendly staff,"Just stayed there on dec18/19. Excellent location, and close to all the tourist spots in london. Would recommend the hotel. Gonna stay there next time i visit Londonium, and maybe visit the Queen next door. Ha ha ha

Kurien Thomas",5,2013,12,18
144,Fabulous Location,"The staff were friendly and accommodating. The hotel is ideally located just 5 minutes from Regent Street, 10 Minutes to Oxford Street, 3 minutes to Green Park Station. We had a lovely large room which was very quiet to our surprise given that we were in the heart of Mayfair. Breakfast was a good selection. It is nice to be in smaller hotel in the heart of Mayfair and not a great big unfriendly one. We felt it offered great value for money for a four star hotel in such a great location. Only complaint was we had lunch and the ploughman's was a real let down with nasty cheap ham.",4,2013,12,18
144,A wonderful weekend break at the Flemings Hotel,"My husband and I stayed at the Flemings Hotel on the 7th December for 2 nights , This is a wonderful hotel  and has great reception staff, the hotel is lovely decorated and is in excellent quite location. The breakfast was outstanding , our room was amazing , we will definitely being going back to stay next year .",5,2013,12,18
144,A thoroughly disappointing stay... ,"Myself and my husband stayed at Flemings over the May bank holiday weekend this year (I know this review is a little late but I feel it still has much merit). Unfortunately it was disappointing from start to finish.

When booking, the lady who took my booking took my details down incorrectly. When our stay was approaching and I still hadn't received a booking confirmation, I had to chase them up to find out that my the room had been booked in the wrong name with the wrong email address. But this was nothing in comparison to our stay.

We were allocated a room on the ground floor (room 107) which was dated looking, burgundy and brown - nothing like the pictures on the website. We were staying on a group booking for a friends party nearby, and had quite a late night. We were looking forward to a lie in considering it was a bank holiday Monday and our check out wasn't until 11am. Unfortunately this didn't happen. We were awoken around 8am by drilling, scraping and sweeping in the room above ours. When mentioning this at check out, the receptionist apologised and told us that one of the rooms above ours was being re-furnished and that the workers should not have started until 9am, which I still do not find acceptable on a bank holiday. Why put people in rooms surrounding one being refurbished?! No compensation was offered. 

Other than the above, we found the service in the lounge room incredibly slow, we asked 4/5 times to pay our drinks bill and were told every time that someone would come and serve us - they didn't. Eventually we left our money for our drinks with our friends who were staying longer and left the hotel. 

I put all of this in a letter of complaint to the hotel and asked for a refund or at least some compensation and all I was offered was ANOTHER stay at the reduced price of £90 - why I would want to stay again after all of my complaints is beyond me. 

Very disappointed and definitely will not be returning to Flemings. ",2,2013,12,15
144,Wonderful in every sense,"Echoing everyone's comment, the hotel is definitely another A++ hotel I have ever stayed in Europe from arrival to departure.  Our 8 nights started with an early morning 5 am arrival and obviously my room was not ready when we got to the hotel.  I need to thank Sabina for offering us a single guest room to freshen up after our 12 hour flight and she would have staff member to take all our luggages to our actual room later on in the afternoon.  The room itself is clean and tidy, a bit small but that was expected for London.  Great location near Green Park tube and only a short walk to Picadilly and Regent Street for all the shopping needs. Staffs were polite and friendly which really made you feel welcome. I would definitely stay at Flemings again for my next visit.",5,2013,12,09
144,"Lovely Location, Helpfull Staff","The hotel is very well located and the staff were extremely helpful and couldn't do enough. 

The room we had was extremely small but we paid just over £100 on a Sunday night, so I wasn't expecting a suite. It had all the necessary things you need and it did the job.

The continental breakfast was very nice and included in the room rate.",4,2013,12,04
144,Lovely hotel in a perfect location.,"I have to say that you cant really get a better location than this. Close to the main attractions ,yet  so quiet. The room we got after complaining after our first room was great, with soft beds and nice decoratations. Tea and coffee facilities. Bathroom was beautiful but the downside was that there was no handheld shower and also a very big step to get into the bathtub for my 75 year old mother. There was a handle but in the wrong spot. Breakfast was good, not great. Wonderful staff, so helpful and attentive.",4,2013,12,02
144,We would stay here again,"My adult daughter and I spent 5 days at the Flemings Mayfair for our first visit to London. It is a lovely small boutique hotel in every sense. Location is amazing - on a quiet side street with a low key facade, a short block away from the Green Park tube and across the park from Buckingham Palace. The staff are warm and friendly, the concierge especially helpful. They seem genuinely happy to help with any and all requests. The rooms are lovely, the bed is great and the bathroom updated and very clean. Arriving from North America long before check in time we were provided with a guest suite to freshen up and rest until our room was ready. The only disappointing aspect was that our plan did not include breakfast which looked excellent but was way too pricey to justify. But there are several great breakfast places close by as there are great dinner restaurants. Check out Shepherd's Market down the street for some gems. Overall it was a perfect experience and we see no reason to try anywhere else. ",5,2013,11,29
144,Wonderful customer services,"The wonderfully attentive staff has made me feel very welcome and very much looked after. Could not get a better deal taking into consideration the location, excellent service and nicely decorated and very clean room.  Very good breakfast and drinks in front room.

Special thanks to khurram at reception and Ali in breakfast room for making us feel especially welcome.  The only downside that the sound isolation is not perfect and if some of your neighbors check in very late it could disturb your sleep.  But, to be honest, taking all the pluses, this was very small and insignificant detail which would definitely not stop me from staying there again and again.",5,2013,11,26
144,"Warm, friendly and very serviceminded hotel in a nice area",My second stay at this great little hotel was even better than my first. Friendly and very serviceminded staff. Great location. The only downside is that they don't have free wifi in the rooms only in the lobby.,5,2013,11,26
144,Mayfair on a budget,"Very warm and friendly staff, lovely reception area, we had one of cheapest rooms but very comfortable and nicely finished. All round excellent value given the location and would definitely stay here again.",4,2013,11,24
144,Very comfortable boutique hotel but bedroom tiny,"The lounge off reception is comfortable and relaxing, the restaurant good and the friendliness of service difficult to fault. I was able to get a reasonable choice for lunch, even at three pm and they had an excellent offer for residents.

Downsides are that the wifi is not free in the bedrooms, upstairs can be a bit of a rabbit warren and my room (219) was tiny. ",4,2013,11,23
144,smart hotel in great location,"I booked for 5 nights so was looking forward to arriving, settling in and getting on with business for a week.  Warmly welcomed by lovely staff, smart lobby (which smelt so fresh!), quick/efficient check in. I was upgraded which I was happy about given my length of stay but when I got to my room (room 206) I was disappointed to find it was so small.  I hate to think what size my original room would have been!  It was quiet, well decorated & equipped though. Good hotel info in room. Complimentary biscuits and bottled water would have been nice....rather than the daily paper which i didn't use. Handwritten welcome card and posh magazines in the room were a nice touch. Stacks of plug sockets which was handy, white company smellies=nice, tiny wardrobe hanging space..had to remove ironing board just to make some space.  I was given a dinner deal card offering 2 courses for £22.50 including a glass of wine which seemed great value so I used it but wasn't very impressed with the food or restaurant and I didn't have breakfast but the bar and lounge were great....good atmosphere & service.  location is great! So close to the action but tucked away & quiet.  I would recommend Flemings and I'd stay there again because the staff were so lovely and welcoming and location is tops....but only if I could get a bigger room/bathroom!",4,2013,11,21
144,Should be called Fawlty towers!,"Visited last weekend and what a disaster! 
Be warned..the reception area appears lithe punctures on their website but our room was nothing like the room pictured on their website. Booked a junior suite and was horribly disappointed. Looks sleek online, well the room we got was very dated ( brown and maroon!) with wrinkled up carpet and the bathroom, whilst clean was very poorly finished- someone with a tremor and very fat finger had applied the grout around the bath ! All night there was also a constant engine room noise like the sound in cheap ferries...
Next morning we had breakfast- I honestly thought we were part if Fawlty Towers! We were forewarned it would take 20-30 mins for breakfast, 1 hour later it finally came with ...no bacon . Trivial I know but cooked breakfast without bacon?! They'd run out and the manager who slunk off didn't think to save the restaurant full of bacon starved diners n pop down to Marks for some more!so after many cups of tea we hit out of there. I gave yo say the staff  tried very hard to keep the tension steady....but it seems the hotel manager hides away in crisis or perhaps this us just the way this hotel works cos they seemed pretty good at coping! Poor things!",2,2013,11,21
144,"Very nice hotel, perfect location","I chose Flemings because my meetings were in and around Mayfair, also lots of restaurants and bars around and it was on offer for an acceptable price (for those particular days). Since I booked through SLH website, I even got upgraded at checkin, which was a nice plus ;)
Overall very nice hotel, there is a reason for them to be part of the SLH chain. If anything, soundproofing walls could be just a little bit better ;) and WiFi a bit more reliable. Plus breakfast on Sunday could start just a little bit earlier (or they could have let me in at 7:57 when they opened at 8AM) but these were really minor things. I can definitely recommend this hotel, especially when the price is lower than normal.",4,2013,11,19
144,The Ultimate London Experience,"We had booked a Junior Suite, but were upgraded to one of the Apartments in the back of the building (With a separate entrance from Clarges Street) These apartments are cozy, spacious and welcoming. The decor is a bit old fashioned compared to that of the regular rooms, but still charming and stylish. And perfectly appointed. Each one bears the name of a great British writer (Ours was called Brönte)
The location of Flemings in Half Moon Street next to Piccadilly is simply unbeatable... And the feeling of enjoying your own small apartment in the heart of Mayfair? Beyond this world! You can´t possibly think of a brighter, more enjoyable way of making the most of your visit to London.
Add up the most gracious, dedicated and diligent staff, a beautiful setting, and a great bar... And there you have it: The ultimate London experience!",5,2013,11,18
144,"Location, staff and ambiance - again!","We did come back, as we said we would, and it was another 5* experience.  The staff are just great, everyone.  All that we came across and spoke with were warm and welcoming and you just get the feeling that nothing would be too much trouble for their guests.  We think the staff are quite unique.  We arrived dripping wet and towels were called for so that we could dry off before checking in.  

Our room was perfect, the buffet breakfast plentiful, varied and fresh and so well served. The Hotel furnishings are beautiful and the location couldn't be better.  

This is our second visit.  When turning the corner of the Half Moon Street I felt like I was coming home, which sounds fanciful but it's true.   

All in all Flemings has spoilt us and we really couldn't even consider looking elsewhere.  We love it!",5,2013,11,17
144,Beautiful hotel and great service,"Highly recommend this place. Beautiful interior and service was absolutely fantastic. Great grill and bar downstairs!

It's very close to green park station and all the shops but not too noisy as on a side street. 

A great place to have an intimate drink or two also or for a private party in peace.",4,2013,11,15
144,Beautiful - Friendly Hotel,"It was my second time here. I was on a business trip and they made it so easy for my!
The staff especially at the breakfast and frond desk always helpful and friendly!Very clean room!!!
The location fantastic as well!!! 
If I have to make one suggestion will be that they can offer at least one bottle of water complimentary upon arrival...!
I'll be back here!!!",5,2013,11,12
144,A Beautiful Boutique Experience,"What a lovely stay I had with my wife. Firstly when you arrive the scent of the lobby is just magical. I thought I had arrived at a six senses spa, more than a hotel. The staff were attentive at check in , and thanks to Branca who welcomed me upon arrival. we were given a room on the 2nd floor, and suited us perfectly as the hotel isn't too big, so walking around isn't a problem. 

The rooms are quite Unique, with their iconic wallpaper, I felt like I was in Charlie and chocolate factory's Library it's so nice. The Bed was huge, with all the millions of Cushions, and the TV was in the perfect place for a late night movie. I especially liked this room because it's not too OTT, its Cosy Luxury and has everything is there. The bathtub was great because I'm 6ft 5 and I could actually fit into it, as most other Luxury Boutique hotels don't have the size. 

Worth a stay ??? Most definitely, Great Location, Great staff, Great rooms.",5,2013,11,08
144,Good quality friendly hotel,I've stayed here on a number of occasions through work as it's ideally situated near Green Park.  The staff are always very helpful and friendly. I've even been given an upgrade to a Junior Suite without having to ask. The rooms aren't overly large but well appointed and the beds are very comfortable. I'll continue to stay here  whenever I stay over in London and recommend to anyone looking for a friendly hotel.,4,2013,11,06
144,"Fab location, nice room","We had 2 nights at Flemings just before Christmas and couldn't have been happier with the location for making the most of London at Christmas time.  A great spot to nip in and out to do shopping, grab breakfast down the road at The Wolseley and wander the streets to see the Christmas lights.  Our room was in the upstairs annex and was very nicely appointed with a comfy bed, nice sheets and an airy bathroom.  Could have done with a doorstop as the bathroom door couldn't stay open without having a suitcase propped up against it.  We wanted the natural light in the room and the bathroom was the way to get this!  It was also very warm so we wanted the window to be open to get some air around the room.  We got a good deal which made it a reasonable price for staying so centrally and we didn't need to use public transport so all in all it cut the overall costs.",4,2013,11,05
144,Charming Experience,"Authentic English charm and hospitality. Loved my stay here! The rooms were beautifully appointed as were the common areas. The staff was helpful and friendly. The hotel is well-situated with easy access to shopping, parks, and major attractions. The Flemings takes great pride in providing an exceptional stay for their guests! I will be back =).",5,2013,11,05
144,Amazing service and attention to detail!,"My friend and I visited Flemings with our daughters to celebrate my girl's 9th birthday.   From the moment we arrived we were treated with incredibly personal attention - Branca the Guest Relations Manager struck up a conversation with my daughter abou the reason for our trip and when we returned from an afternoon of shopping there was a delightful  birthday cake, napkins and cutlery, a handwritten note, child's book about Fleming the frog and the offer of hot chocolate and cookies for supper (which was duly delivered later that evening).  Breakfast was included in the price and was delicious.  We had a good chat with the lovely Maria on reception the next morning about where to visit and all the while the other staff were looking after our bags, chatting to the kids and just generally being warm and attentive.  I would recommend this hotel to anyone and it will always be my hotel of choice when visiting London.",5,2013,11,04
144,"Great location,  very friendly staff.","A very warm welcome from attentive and helpful staff. Nice surroundings and situated within walking distance of shopping, restaurants and theatres. A very decent buffet breakfast included in the price. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff. ",4,2013,11,03
144,Wonderful experience,"We had a fantastic time at Flemings during our stay earlier this year. The location is great, very near to Green Park station, and the street the hotel is located on is fairly quiet but easy to find. We booked a Junior Suite and upon our arrival we found a hand written note from the manager wishing us a pleasant stay, which was a very nice touch. The staff were attentive and helpful at all times.

The room itself was a great size (especially by London standards!) and had a desk area for work and comfortable sofa. Everything was beautifully clean and the room felt fresh and like it was well maintained. It's the first time we've stayed in a boutique hotel where we've felt like the quality of the room and service were on par with the luxurious decor. We would stay again and recommend it to others.",5,2013,11,03
144,A Fabulous Old Fashioned Hotel,"The hotel is located very close to Green Park tube so very handy for the shops of Regent Street and Picadilly. I'd stayed here several years ago and after we found ourselves unable to get home because of the bad storm, I booked a twin room at Flemings taking advantage of their Halloween offer.
We were checked in very efficiently and our bags taken to our room immediately. Whilst we were very happy with the room itself, it was located at the front of the building and unfortunately the sash windows did nothing to prevent us hearing all the street noise. The manager, David, showed us another room but then realised that this was located next to the a/c unit. He then showed us one of Flemings two bedroomed apartments which we were more than happy with. We were very impressed by the way David handled the situation. His attitude was fantastic.
All the staff at Flemings are so friendly and always smiling - nothing is too much trouble for them. I'd definitely stay there again and would recommend Flemings to anyone looking for a hotel with English character and charm.",5,2013,11,01
144,Lovely boutique hotel in fantastic location,"Stayed here while on business, staff were really helpful and courteous throughout. The rooms were spacious a place to relax, and really nicely decorated. Room service is expensive but food is of good quality. Beautiful little hotel with nice character. ",4,2013,10,30
144,Lovely Afternoon Tea,"I just wanted to say thank you for the wonderful afternoon tea my husband and I had at Flemings recently. It was a treat for my birthday and we had a thoroughly enjoyable time. We found the staff who served us extremely polite and attentive, plus the food was delicious as well. It was a fantastic escape from real life and we found that we didn't want to leave!",5,2013,10,26
144,Outstanding location with great staff,"Just around the corner from Green park Tube station in a quiet area.Only 200 m from the palace and say 500 m from Piccadilly.

Staff very friendly and they directed us to a great Italian in Shepherds Yard, again very close to the hotel, with reasonable prices as well as being next to a couple of pubs as well .

Only slight down side is that the room could had had more natural light but overall with a fantastic breakfast, great place to stay for a special weekend.

Top breakfast and well worth the overall price for a special weekend",4,2013,10,26
144,Central location,"Having stayed at Flemings on previous occasions, we booked the hotel for its convenient location just off Piccadilly. It is a short walk (under 5 mins) from Green Park tube station.  The hotel is located on a busy one-way street so there is a degree of road noise if you have a room overlooking the street (our room was on the second floor).  We were initially given a very nice, newly refurbished room on the first floor but as soon as we walked in, noticed a very strong smell of drains!  We were quickly moved to a different room within 10 mins of our request.  The classic double room was very pleasant although a few niggles were the lack of drawer space (hanging only available), a hairdryer was provided although the electrical socket was nowhere near a mirror and the room was very warm during the night (controllable air con was in the room but was very noisy so unable to use at the same time as getting a peaceful night's sleep!).  All the staff we met were very friendly and accommodating.  Would happily recommend this hotel and will definitely stay there again.",4,2013,10,24
144,Overpriced for what you get,"Having stayed here once before and liked it we were disappointed with our one night stay this time.  The man at reception, who was of ethnic origin and very difficult to understand, quoted a price in excess of our booking and asked us to pay up front with an extra £25 just in case we used the mini bar!  We baulked  at that and he then said we could pay at the end.    I like staff to be polite but I object to being asked if we had a good trip and where we had come from - it really is none of their business, we just wanted to get to our room!  The very small room was tired with a grubby carpet, small double bed and too hot even with the window open.  I object to the high price we had to pay.  Why change towels twice a day and why use White Company bath products - all adding to the cost.   The only positive thing i will say is that it is in a convenient location.  Next time we wiill  stay somewhere else.",3,2013,10,24
144,Excellent location and value for money,"We spent five nights here and found the location to be ideal, and given the special deal we got by booking early, it was very good value for money. The staff couldn't have been more helpful - eg offering to make calls to book restaurants because my mobile was not working. Room very comfortable.",5,2013,10,23
144,Great Location,"Stayed here recently for 2 nights before going on a cruise.  Our room was on the 1st floor and was very quiet - the view was not great, the room was small and nicely appointed with minibar, coffee/tea, room safe and wardrobe.  The bathroom was a nice size - plenty of room.  The service at the hotel was just great, we were always greeted at the door and someone was always there for questions.  The continental breakfast was included in our room rate - it was very good everything from yogurt, fruit, cereal, bread, ham, rolls, danish, coffee, tea and juice - plenty for us to get the day started.  The best thing about this hotel is the location, it seemed like many of the major sights were just a short walk away, tube station right up the road - and we were able to find pubs and spots to eat with the ""locals"" right around the corner.  Over all we had a great time and I would recommend this hotel to anyone that wants a convenient location.",5,2013,10,21
144,good value in a good location,"We had stayed here once before and this time, for our short stay in London, it was convenient to be in Mayfair. We pre-booked and pre-paid for a classic double room for 2 nights and got a very good rate.  I had specifically requested a quiet room as we had had a pretty noisy room the last time we had stayed.  Our room this time was on the 3rd floor & had just been renovated.  It was quite small but perfectly adequate for a 2 night stay.  One major design flaw was that closing mechanism on the door to our room prevented you properly opening the door to the wardrobe which was tucked behind the door.  A bit annoying but not a major gripe. Bathroom was very compact but it did have a bath and shower.  We had continental breakfast only which was perfectly fine. Coffee was good, croissants were very good.   Service at breakfast was excellent.

We slept very well on both nights and did not hear any street noise or any noise from other guests.  For the money - a pre-paid rate offers you excellent value for money to stay in this part of town.",4,2013,10,21
144,"Not impressed: Nice hotel, but poor building quality","I stayed in the room 119 with my wife on the night of the 12th of October and despite of the high price for an apparently stylish room, we was very surprised by the poor quality of the building in term of insulation to noise as we could hear the next door neighbours snoring, coughing, going to the loos and talking and the same was true for the neighbours in the room upstairs. I do understand that it is an old hotel, but as I mentioned to the receptionist, I was expecting much more than a really cheap quality room for this price. I have traveled extensively in the world and in term of quality/price and sleep quality, this this place is clearly not competing with grand hotels and is worse than 1 star hotel I slept in in Peru for sound proof. London's accommodations are not known for their charms and great comfort I agree, but before investing in for a night there, ask yourself whether you just want to pay for the way it looks or you want to sleep. In the case of the second, this is not your place. 

Breakfast was quite ordinary and I would say you could certainly find better around the corner. I did express my annoyance to the receptionist in the morning and although she did apologise and mentioned that she will make sure to not put us in the same room next time, there was not much done to get a better price except not charging me for mini-bar. For a view on a metal staircase and walls made of paper, you could invest 250£ in a much better way, unless, 250 is the equivalent of 25 for you. I would avoid.",1,2013,10,20
144,Mind the gap!,"I stayed for one night, business trip. Upon arrival I was informed that my room was not available and because it was a busy time in London I would be downgraded but compensated for that. What sort of pricey hotel does overbooking (or inefficient rooms management)? The room I got was ON THE GROUND FLOOR and there are probably 15 to 20 rooms on that floor. Be careful if you go there not to get one of thoses rooms and also check that you don't get the other noisy rooms next to elevator (see other ""terrible"" ratings comments). I am surprised that this hotel gets so many good ratings. Soo maybe, some clients get fabulous rooms and others get whatever is left. And for the price, it is shocking. Oh, just note as well that in the ground floor rooms you can hear the tube passing below every 5-10min. And it's a bit noisyy as well on the corridor as doors are a bit oldish (but when everyone sleeps it is okay... just late evening and early morning, so dont expect to have long nights there). You can find much better quality for this price in the neibourghood, keep searching, forget this one until they renew and restructure the whole hotel or pray to get a good romm (if any).",1,2013,10,17
144,Wonderful Oasis in London's Center,"Stayed two nights at this wonderful address in Mayfair.  Room are smallish, but that is London, and the quality of the room was impeccable.  Excellent and helpful staff.  Location is darn near perfect, with the Parks just outside your door, and all other sites within walking distance---at lease for us.",5,2013,10,14
144,October 2013 5 night stay,"The location of the Flemings is perfect.  This hotel certainly lives up to its 
Small Luxury Hotel designation.  It is such a good value. Concierges (thank you especially  to Pedro) were so helpful. Facilities are very pleasing and service is first class. I would recommend taking the breakfast included option.  Can't wait to go back.",5,2013,10,11
144,Lovely Boutique Hotel,"Stayed earlier this year and was impressed by this boutique hotel in central London location. Rooms were decorated in boutique style and breakfast was a feast. Would stay again and recommend as a great place to stay

144,"Great Hotel, Great Location","Had a great stay here. Even though we were quite early, our room was ready and.The hotel itself is really nice and we had a great room, lovely decor. They went the extra mile as it was my birthday (cupcakes mmm). Thoroughly recommend as the location is also great. 5-10 min walk to Leicester Sq. Only draw back - they closed the bar at 11 on Sunday night.",5,2013,10,08
144,"Good location, small rooms.","First time staying at this hotel. Very good location, staff very friendly and accommodating. Asked to change rooms as the one we were first in was very noisy being right next to the generator. The new room was lovely and quiet and nicely decorated.",4,2013,10,05
144,Tiny comfort in a great location,"We just arrived home from a 4 night stay at the Flemings which bills itself as a ""Small Luxury Hotel.""  The staff was friendly and professional, rooms were very clean and had all the accoutrements.  It is expensive and the room we had was small (and they claimed this was an ""upgrade"") but considering the location just in Mayfair a few steps from ridiculous New Bond Street and its consumer excesses, Fortum, and Piccadilly, and even Soho, I suppose that makes up for it.  There are some great restaurants and pubs within a few minutes walk in Shepherd Market (Da Corradi has great food in another small venue and also several reasonable breakfast places) which is a big plus.  Half Moon Street is relatively quiet.

We had several minor annoyances with the room but when reported to the front desk they were immediately dealt with (tv remote not working, hot water tap in bathroom iffy, and no tissues or face cloths one day).  Internet in the room was expensive, but somehow the free zone worked in our room so we weren't obliged to huddle with everyone else over our computers in the albeit fancy and comfortable lounge.

I only give it 4 stars because the room was very small.  I have stayed in smaller rooms in London but given that this is supposed to be luxury, it was almost laughable.  Luckily we had only small carry on bags.  I cannot imagine two larger people in the room for an extended stay with large suitcases.  It would not work.   You really had to sit on the bed to do everything as the one chair and one stool could barely be pulled away from the wall.  It is quite surprising what the hotel has done with such a tiny space.   The shower was so tight one could barely turn around without hitting the door open.  On the plus side the water was VERY copious and hot.

The view out the window was really dire...air shafts and dirty brick.  I realize that this is central London but...The windows could be opened a crack so there was little or no fresh air and we used the very efficient fan and a/c more than I would like and the air felt quite dry most of the time.  The tea fixings were excellent but crammed into a closet.  There were only two shelves for unpacking clothes so we left most of our things in our suitcases.  Luxury???  Not really my idea of it.

There must be more spacious hotels in central London for the same price but for our visit it did the job and we were satisfied.  Very central location and a walk in the park nearby was very pleasant.

Check-out was smooth and professional and our prepaid room had no extra unexpected charges.",4,2013,10,03
144,Great Location and Comfortable and Clean Hotel,"Flemings is nicely located in Mayfair just around the corner from Sheppard's Market and is close to the Green Park tube station.  The hotel is not large, but is well maintained and the rooms are clean and comfortable.  I have stayed here a few times and note the rooms can vary quite a bit in size.   I really think the location makes this hotel and the price is often quite reasonable for London.  While not opulent the hotel is nicely decorated and appears to be well maintained.",4,2013,10,01
144,Now this is Luxury,"The Fleming Mayfair is amazing. They allowed me to check in early about 8 hour flight from the US which was great.  The hotel is spotless, quiet and perfectly located. Lots of great restaurant and a lot of high end shopping just steps away.  The breakfast buffet was great and was a perfect touch to get you started on your day.  The bed linens are soft you will not want to get out of the bed, best of all the drapes close all the way so you can have total darkness in your room. This is a very special place and will make a great getaway if you want to indulge yourself in luxury.  I had been to London before but never experienced luxury like this . . .this is officially my favorite hotel in London.",5,2013,09,24
144,EXCELLENT LOCATION AND EXCELLENT SERVICE,"We stayed in this hotel some 10 years ago and returned there last week for one night.   The service from the staff was wonderful, the room was comfortable.   Breakfast was very good and it was so nice to be served by waiters who were very attentive.   We shall certainly return to this establishment.",5,2013,09,23
144,Lovely room and a great location,"I stayed for 1 night in February 2013. The room was really lovely - a very good size with a good size bathroom too. I was on business, but thought the room would be pleasant were I travelling with family for a weekend break. I booked the room for a good rate last minute - I might be less pleased had I paid £250+ for the room.

The service was very good. The location is excellent - ideal for tourists or business if in the west of town. Would stay again.",5,2013,09,22
144,Fantastic Hotel!,"After looking at a number of hotels in London I decided to booked Flemings for 3 nights with my girlfriend in March this year. Boy am I glad I did! this Is a fantastic hotel within walking distance to everything we wanted to see and do. the staff went out of there way to help with everything from giving directions, and tips for nice places to eat to posting letters for you. Upon arrival we were presently surprised to find out that the Manager had upgraded us to a Junior suite for our entire stay! And when we opened the door to our Beautiful, good sized Suite there were chocolates and a bottle of champagne on ice waiting for us as a gift from management. Thanks everyone at Flemings for making our stay in London one to remember! Next time i am in London I would not hesitate to stay here again.",5,2013,09,21
144,London Boutique Beauty,"The Fleming is located in the elegant Mayfair section of London. It's a stones throw to Piccadilly, the theaters of the West End, Bond Street shopping and Buckingham Place. The rooms are well appointed, small but more than sufficient. The staff is extremely friendly, knowledgeable, helpful and professional. For those who want an alternative to the giant hotel chains, the Fleming is an excellent alternative. ",4,2013,09,18
144,BEWARE OF CHARGES!!!,"Business or holiday, what you want is to be pampered, not to go back home to deal with incorrect charges, and that's just what happened to me during both of my stays at this hotel.  

Based on location I booked my stay at this apparently pleasant hotel in London, considered to be a Small Luxury Hotel (SLH). I won't even go through describing noisy rooms and maze like corridors to find your room, my problem is with customer care which is probably the worst I've ever come to experience.

If you recall, during every check-in, every single hotel requests for a credit card as a guarantee.  Well, nothing new, they requested for my credit card, but instead of taking it as a guarantee they actually CHARGED me for the first night in that very moment.  Of course, at check-out they charged for the full stay (plus the ""guarantee"" they had already charged), making me pay twice for the first night.  Unfortunately I didn't notice but until I received my credit card balance a few weeks later.

On my second stay I was charged an average of 50 GBP ON TOP of the agreed cost per night.  They couldn't care less and, since this second stay was booked through a travel company I had to pay the full charge and to deal with the travel company directly (My travel company did recognize the mistaken charges and fully reimbursed the extra charges for second stay)

Two months from my original stay the hotel has recognized this abnormal charge twice, has promised twice to call my credit card to reimburse the money... and I'm still waiting to see the money.

My advice: don't even think about going there.  St James hotel is by far a better option (within the same SLH tag).  If you're buying because you found a good deal think twice, they will get your money somehow and as it happened in my case, not in a straight way.",1,2013,09,18
144,very good once again,"3rd time at the flemings, checking seemed to be fine until were given a key for a room they didn't have, so had to go back down to reception to sort it out, room was on the 3rd floor, good size, bathroom was small but everything work fine plenty of hot water, the only point I would mention would getting out of the shower wasn't easy, we were ok but I would imagine that some people would struggle as the bath is high, the bed was large and comfy, towels soft, good tea making fac's, aircon good. Breakfast was excellent, cold buffet selection and choice of hot breakfast to choose from. All the staff were polite and spoke and seemed happy in there job. would return to the hotel again.",4,2013,09,16
144,Chocolate afternoon tea promised so much...,"The thought of a chocolate themed afternoon sounded like the perfect excuse for a girls afternoon catch up with a cousin.  As I'm allergic to strawberries, we pre-warned when booking.

Upon arrival we were directed downstairs to the restaurant and seated next to a couple celebrating their anniversary by having lunch.  Not a problem but strange as we were the only other party in the room.  

Afternoon tea was served on a traditional cake stand with the waiter noting that as I am allergic to strawberries, there was a different cake bite instead do a strawberry dipped in chocolate.  Great news.

The sandwiches were very mediocre and we weren't offered further rounds.  We then proceeded to chocolate scones, thankfully I checked the jam as we were given strawberry jam and no alternative! After attracting the waiter and informed him of the issue an alternative was provided.  Now, back to the chocolate scones - what we anticipated to be lovely fresh scones were all dry and stale with only an average amount of clotted cream provided.

Unfortunately the cakes (sorry, they didn't warrant the description of patisserie) were stodgy and rather unmemorable; by the end, we felt a little 'heavy' in the stomach.

With the exception of 'jam gate' we weren't asked if we were enjoying the tea - the staff contact was minimal.

In summary, the afternoon tea was very disappointing and one we won't repeat.  Sorry.",1,2013,09,15
144,One of the best hotels stay's ever,"My husband and I travel all round the world for work but decided to have sometime out in London we noticed this hotel and decided to give it ago as it looked very like a hotel in New York that we adore 
Well we where not disappointed ! The staff are  friendly and helpful no matter what was asked of them, yes the rooms where small but that to us was not a problem
I would like to bring to the managers attention ""Hannah"" the breakfast server who went out of her way to be friendly and remebering your drinks orders and asking about your day ahead and in general making the stay a great time,  this girl should be giving a gold star 
The only down point was the bar only served bottle beers (hubby was not impressed) but that was solved by just going round he corner to Henry's 
I would recommend this hotel to anyone . And having a family member in the short break hotel package business I have told her to shout about this hotel",5,2013,09,15
144,We were so very well looked after ...,"We stayed overnight at Flemings as part of a wedding party and from the moment that we walked through the door we were so thoroughly well looked after.  The staff were welcoming, helpful and friendly.  We stayed in a very comfortable ground floor room.  Our 6 year old son was with us there was a card, book, soap and children sized slippers and bathrobe just for him!  He was delighted to have a message from Fleming the frog!   The hotel is decorated in a very contemporary manner.  As part of the wedding party, we very much enjoyed canapes and drinks in the 'Front Room'.  There is a fireplace and I imagine it would be very cosy in the winter.  The bar is also a lovely place to sit.  Breakfast was superb and again we experienced excellent service.  The cooked breakfast was delicious.  The hotel is located very conveniently for the centre of London and the hotel arranged discounted parking.  We want an excuse to visit Flemings again!  Thoroughly recommended.",5,2013,09,10
144,Lovely boutique hotel,"Really loved this hotel and the location. Nice street in Mayfair, with a few restaurants within walking distance. Not too noisy or bustly but close enough to all the action. Lovely room, tastefully decorated and each in a different theme. Very comfortable lounge area with fire. Would stay here again.",5,2013,09,09
144,Afternoon Tea,"We went for an afternoon tea at Flemmings as a gift from a friend. Whilst the staff were pleasant enough the tea was awful. It cost £60 (for two) and when asked if we could have sandwiches without butter we were told that this was not possible because it was all pre-made.As such I could only eat cake. That might have been ok except the scones were the worst scones we've ever eaten - tasted as if they had been defrosted in the microwave - rubbery and dry. The 'petit-fours' tasted oily and over sweet with a very manufactured flavour to them and the sponge cake was bland, unimaginative and clearly came from a packet. DO NOT GO HERE, you will only be disappointed. The tea was nice but for £60 for two I would expect better.",1,2013,09,08
144,Small Luxury Boutique Hotel!,"We stayed for one night at the end of July in this adorable smallish hotel in Mayfair. We loved the location, walking through Green Park down to the Palace one evening, and some lovely restaurants within walking distance too.
I saw 2 different rooms, (as they all seem to be decorated in a different way) as my Mum had her own room. Both rooms were a good size, with lovely bathrooms. Bed was extremely comfy.
We had a drink in the hotel bar which was very quiet, no complaints. Decor is pretty funky!
We enjoyed a buffet breakfast which was great. 
All staff extremely friendly and helpful. Would definitely stay there again!",5,2013,09,08
144,Fabulous location - exceptional service,"We stayed with Flemings Mayfair in Aug-Sept 2013. The entire staff, from the front desk, the breakfast room attendants, housekeeping and doormen, was exceptionally friendly and accommodating. The junior suite was spacious, quiet, clean and comfortable.  And the location was outstanding - so close to Green Park tube station and walking distance to fantastic restaurants, shows, shopping and sight-seeing!",5,2013,09,08
144,Quality hotel in a great location,"My husband and I have just enjoyed a very pleasant stay at this hotel whilst we mixed business and leisure respectively.  On arrival, a misunderstanding over our booking (our fault) was rectified swiftly and professionally and we were shown to a small but well appointed room on the 4th floor.  The hotel fulfilled our needs and expectations of a good quality central London hotel and would recommend it to anyone looking for an elegant base, close to Mayfair and Piccadilly alike.",4,2013,09,06
144,Oh Flemings,"The third time I've stayed at Flemings, and as with previous visits there were positives and negatives. The location is, for myself being a bit of a fan of Mayfair, excellent. The lobby and rooms are clean and have an upmarket feel to them. Staff were polite and friendly in the main. My room was less than spacious, having to navigate the bathroom door around the bed a sign that the room or at least its layout was not the best Mayfair has to offer. Having said that it was bearable. Perhaps I'm being pedantic but having a mirror on the wall and the tv at the dressing table/desk I found a little odd. Anyone needing a hair dryer had the usual hotel omission, no plug near a mirror. The room however was fairly well appointed and despite it's size it was comfortable, I was in the room on my own so how comfortable it would have felt being a little on the compact side had I'd been there with the Mrs is another matter.

On a negative side...at 4am the hotel's fire alarm went off. No complaints there and as far as the ability to wake guests during an emergency goes the volume of this alarm would wake the dead. Together with many others we made it down the fire escape and onto Clarges Street, After ten mins or so I heard a member of staff ask us to go to the front of the hotel in Half Moon St. The fire brigade attended and after 45 mins or so the alarm stopped...people re-entered the hotel...then it went off again....15 mins later it stopped...people re-entered the hotel...5 mins later it went off again....after 20 mins or so it stopped. Two or three staff members were walking around with mobile phones, some guests re-entered, some waited in the street in their dressing gowns. Not once did I hear anyone being given any form of information or direction. I went back to find people sitting in the lobby, on seats or on the floor. The alarm had stopped and two of the Fire Engines had left over an hour ago. At 5.30am, when it appeared safe to do so, I decided to go back to my room.....despite several guests, apparently with no instructions or directions, still sitting in the lobby, clad in Fleming's bathrobes. Fortunately the alarm did not reoccur and I managed to catch up on sleep. Later that morning a letter arrived under the door apologising for the inconvenience explaining that an electrical fault in one of the apartments had caused a fire. That's a clever fire that manages to trigger the alarm three times..... 

My travelling companion (Amigolovelyhair) had the experience of housekeeping following this night of broken sleep after several hospital nightshifts. 

We tried the cocktail bar, which I must say is very nice, basement location, very chic. The cost of the cocktails is exorbitant and may explain why I've never seen this part of the hotel busy. What I don't understand is that this bar is extremely smart and cosy and is an asset to the hotel. It SHOULD be packed beyond midnight, prices don't help and at my last visit they ran out of Bailey's...and 24 hours later they failed to replenish the same...despite a Tesco's being 50 yards away and at £6.50+ for a measure they would have made a profit after two orders. ON this occasion I feel I paid the best part of £15 for a glass of crushed ice! 

This hotel is an oxymoron to me. Great location and has an air of luxury about it...but yet again it doesn't deliver in so many ways. To sum it up....on approaching a hotel of such stature, many have a doorman, to welcome you and open the door, regardless of whether the doors are automatic or not. One afternoon the Fleming's doorman was too busy texting to realise we had got to the door and he hastily pushed open the auto door. That wouldn't happen at The Athenaeum Hotel nearby. 

It's unlikely I'll be back at Fleming's, first a ridiculously small room years ago, next a 20min wait for hot water, a long wait for breakfast and a lack of standard bar stock. Now a lack of info and direction, disturbances, bar prices and dare I say it... surely, to keep their guests happy following ""an electrical fault"" a complimentary drink or some gesture would have been suitable. 
 
Fleming's tries to be a classy unique Mayfair hotel, but for the third time it was a disappointing experience. There are better hotels nearby that either demonstrate greater quality or overall general value.",3,2013,09,03
144,Fabulous,"A beautiful hotel that my husband treated me to staying in for 6 days for my 40th birthday last September. The staff were very friendly and helpful, our room was beautiful, we had one meal in the restaurant which we really enjoyed and the cocktail lounge we visited 4 evenings trying a variety of scrumptious cocktails. It is in an ideal location for tube station and visiting the queen.i cannot wait to visit again hopefully soon.",5,2013,09,03
144,Great choice,"Stayed in this area because of business meetings. But we combined it with leisure time and location could have not been better.
Many restaurants around the corner in a nice pedestrian street. Supermarkets and subway are also a short walk. Staff was really nice and helpful. 
the central location makes it perfect for exploring the city by foot.
Room was tiny though but since we did not spend much time there it did not bother us so much. It was quiet and clean. Would definitely stay there again as it's good value for money.",4,2013,09,02
144,Could have been better,"Stayed here for 3 nights,the location is great for Piccadilly ,Green Park and Buckingham Palace.The first night a fire alarm sounded at 4am approx and we had to evacuate the building. We went into the street along with all the other guests but never seen a member of staff offering some form of explanation.After about an hour ,after the fire brigade left we assumed it was ok to re-enter but nobody was there organising or directing or explaining,or at least if they were I didn't see or speak with them. I went back to bed but failed to get back to sleep as I work nightshifts and this was my first night off in a while so my body clock was a bit messed up. Come lunchtime I was very tired so decided to go for a nap,I placed my DO NOT DISTURB sign on the door and went to bed,the corridors are fairly noisy and you can here everything,I heard the maid enter the room opposite and explain to guest that she was leaving some water for them.I seen a note slipped under my door to say 'Housekeeping had called but the Do Not Disturb sign was displayed so should I want the room services then to ring housekeeping' so I nicely fall off to sleep. Next thing I receive a phone call from housekeeping to see if I wanted my room serviced........it's begs belief that such sloppy standards are acceptable.My night of misery in the street topped with an inability to understand the basic concept of DO NOT DISTURB. Management popped a note under the door to apologise for 'an electrical fault' ,but I thought a complimentary drink would have been more acceptable.Had a guest caused the problem then fair enough ,but it was clear the electrical fault was a dodgy alarm as nobody could seem to knock it off and when they did it kept going off again.The rooms are nice ,the beds are comfy,the staff are friendly ,the areas are clean.The beautiful cocktail lounge had nobody in it but that was probably due to the extortionate cost of a cocktail. Maybe some resident incentives to use the place would be helpful.Overall I wouldn't stay here again ,mainly due the the standing in the street at 4am with little way of an apology for what seemed to be a hotel issue.There are better hotels in same area with quieter rooms,staff that pay attention and competitive tariffs.",3,2013,09,01
144,great atmosphere,"i have been here twice now although i only had a meal and used the bar, i must say how nice the staff were.the food was fantastic ,great choice. it is a great location 5 minutes 
walk from piccadilly circus.everything about this hotel is stunning from the outside to the interior.
Great food and bar.",5,2013,09,01
144,Wonderful reception and management!,"We just arrived and I have to compliment the manager Katie. After a long overnight flight she accommodated us by allowing us into a room immediately although check in is typically at 2 pm. Room was large and in the older section, but has been quiet and enjoyable so far. We can only hope this continues to be a lovely stay!",5,2013,08,31
144,Very Small Room but nice,"We had reserved a Junior Suite at this hotel  When we were shown to our room it looked like a normal room not the Junior Suite that was pictured on their web site.  Upon talking to the reservations manager he said the room pictured on the web site was unavailable but we could have a look at other junion suites that MAY be bigger.  At that point, after traveling all night we just decided to stay in the room we were given.

We were in the new section which used to be a townhouse but was converted into a couple of rooms.  It was a quirkily designed building but it worked for us.  It sort of made us feel like we were living there as we had to enter a code to get into the builidng and we never were in the main part of the hotel. 

Room was clean and towles were very fluffy.  Limited staff we did see (through no fault of hotel, it was just because of where our room was) were quite nice.

Location cannot be beat, we walked to Knightsbridge, Covent Gardens and Buckingham Palace with ease.  Green Park Tube station in near by.  

There is a coffee shop 1/2 block away and a small convenience store too.  If the price was right we would definitely stay here again.",4,2013,08,30
144,"Great Hotel, with ideal location","We stayed here on a Saturday night in August. Think we took the last room in the hotel as it was so busy, Room was lovely but extemely small but fine for one night, well decorated and they have tried to make the best of a small space. The hotel also has appartments which are no doubt much bigger. The breakfast at this hotel is the best ever, you are made to feel really special. We had the cooked option and orders we taken at the table from a selection of 6 dishes, we could have sat there all day.
We did not have dinner at the hotel but the menu looked nice and the prices were reasonable given location. 
We found this hotel the best we have stayed in for location, easy walking distance of many attraction and we had a lovely stroll to Buckingham Palace before breakfast.",4,2013,08,30
144,Really nice,"Stayed here for the bank holiday weekend, it was lovely, staff really nice, rooms clean & all that you need in them, bathroom very spacious, modern & towels you want to take home with you. Defiantly stay here again :)",5,2013,08,28
144,"Fantastic service, as always","I've stayed here twice now, and been impressed both times. The rooms are clean, comfortable and well appointed, which makes it perfect for business trips. The service is always great, whether it's the greeting by the receptionist, the concierge or the people serving in the bar (great spot for afternoon tea). On this occasion I order per room service, and was very impressed - a simple chicken burger and fires, but it was moist, delicious and arrived very promptly. One minor grumble - the lift appears to be temperamental (out of action on both stays) - but only a minor one, as the Concierge immediately offered to carry my bag up to my room for me!",5,2013,08,26
144,Girly weekend,"Booked this hotel as it was central to the places we wanted to go.  Being a mother and daughter weekend, we wanted to feel safe in the evening.  The hotel was fabulous and we felt very cared for while we there.  The location was great, the staff very friendly and polite and nothing was too much trouble. Room was spotless, breakfast was good, interior decor fabulous and attention to detail with the little things made us feel very special.  My daughter especially liked the bath robes and our name welcoming us when we turned the TV on!  A very big thank you to the brilliant woman manning the cocktail bar - she made my daughter a special one just for her as unfortunately they had run out of pineapple juice! We will be returning - hopefully soon!",5,2013,08,19
144,"Fantastic service, quality, attentive and excellent stay",We loved our stay for our 10th anniversary at Flemings. Excellent location and staff could not do enough for us. Bottle of champagne in our room for our special occasion and we were met with professional and courteous staff throughout the whole weekend. Thank you for making our stay so special. We will be back! ,5,2013,08,18
144,"Location, staff and ambiance","The staff are great, without exception.  We could name names but would be bound to leave someone out so won't.  Don't walk past the Aussie doorman, he's a mine of every type of information and like everyone else he's great!  The location is perfect, just around the corner is Shepherd's market, couldn't be better. The hotel also has a real ambiance and being an older hotel the walls are sturdy so no noises from the next rooms.  We thoroughly enjoyed it, it was a real 5 star treat for us.   We all say we will return and in this case we will!  Thank you all again for making our visit so enjoyable.",5,2013,08,17
144,Superb location!,"Flemings Hotel has changed greatly since our last visit, twenty eight years ago.  It is now a ""boutique hotel,"" still on Half Moon Street (near Green Park and the Green Park tube station) but now occupying several town houses in addition to the original building.  We stayed in a newly renovated room in one of the townhouses that was large and lovely.  The only negatives were too few electric outlets (for recharging devices) and the fact that the room would not be accessibly to someone who has mobility issues.  The restaurant in the hotel was quite good both for dinner and a fine breakfast.  Next time we are in London, and hopefully it won't be another twenty eight years, we will definitely stay at Flemings Hotel again.",5,2013,08,15
144,"Location, Locaion , Location and superb service","Flemings of Mayfair in Half Moon Street is a great boutique hotel close to a LOT of London´s attractions and shopping.
We had two rooms in the beginning of August and we could not be happier with our stay.
In addition to the location in Mayfair, the crew of flemings is truly the gem here.
Really wonderful and helpful staff. Our room was ready at 10:30 AM even, brilliant.
Breakfast can be a tad bit pricey, but 1 minute away, around the corner, in Shepherds Market, there are plenty of reasonable breakfast places. We had a Executive Double Room and a standard double, both with more than adequate spacey. 
for our youngest, the Hot chocolate & cookies at bed time, Slippers & bathrobe and Fleming Frog book that was there waiting for her was a pleasant surprise and a wonderful little extra thing to do.",5,2013,08,14
144,Great Place to Stay in Central London,"We stayed at the Fleming Mayfair Hotel on Half Moon Street, Mayfair, London. Loved it? Centrally located, easy walk (3 blocks) to the Green Park Underground Station. Good food, drink right nearby. Terrific staff. We got the option including Wi-Fi and continental breakfast which was well worth it. Very enjoyable!",5,2013,08,12
144,Fleming hotel and apartments mayfair UK,"A great boutique hotel close to many London attractions.  Clean modern bathroom, tastefully decorated.  Staff in reception were very helpful as were the housekeeping team.  Would definitely use again on our next UK visit.",5,2013,08,12
144,Almost perfect,"My husband and I stayed for a weekend at Flemings as a belated wedding anniversary treat. Many thanks for the surprise bubbly treat in our room. We were in one of the newly refurbished rooms in the adjoining town house. The room although not huge was decorated and equiped to a very high standard. Lovely bathroom with proper sized towels and great bathrobes and really good attention to detail. It was a little odd not being part of the main hotel (we had a separate entrance so never had any need to go into the hotel at all) we had no contact with any staff unless we went to reception. I think if we stay again I would prefer to be in the hotel. I did have a slight issue with the firmness of the bed, felt like I was sleeping on a board, but I'm sure that's just a personal issue. I did ask at reception if a mattress topper could be put on it, but nothing transpired.

As others have said before the location is spot on for exploring London. Despite being near the main road it was very quiet at night. It's close to many coffee shops and an M&S food store so handy for extra snacks!

Breakfast wasn't part of our deal but we thought we would treat ourselves to a Sunday full works to set us on our way before travelling home. I wish I had realised that there is no hot buffet. Having committed ourselves we decided on the continental as I prefer to chose my selection of hot food than have a fixed plate. It was average at best. Staff very helpful but the concept of toast being more than hot bread needed some explaining! For some very odd reason we were presented with the bill to sign half way through our meal, I'm not sure if they thought we were going to do a runner!

The limited amount of contact we did have with the staff  (only reception) was very good. Very efficient and polite. We did enjoy our stay and would recommend this hotel.",4,2013,08,12
144,"Great location, great staff, great rooms","We stayed in Flemings for A week, in July. The location is superb! Close to the subway and very central, the Hotel is very quiet and comfortable. We were 2 adults and a teen, so we booked a Junior suite. When we arrived we were given a very small Junior so we asked to change. The staff was realy helpful and nice. We ended up in a very spacious and quiet Junior, on the ground floor, with a nice decor. 
We dined at the Hotel and... What a wonderful dinner it was! The food is absolutely delicious. Breakfast however, could improve. We booked the English breakfast! Where we are able order hot dishes and to choose from the buffet. The hot dishes are very good but we found the buffet very limited. One type of yougurt, one type of cheese, small choice of cereals and pastries.
The staff is incredibly friendly and helpful, both at the restaurant and at the Reception. The maid was wonderful and attentive.
Overall, we had an excellent stay and hope to return soon.",5,2013,08,11
144,Nice Surprise,Found this hotel at the last minute.  A total gem and you won't be disappointed.  New clean modern bathrooms and rooms.  Centrally located close to everything that you need for either business or pleasure in London.  A slow elevator didn't detract from an all around great boutique hotel.,5,2013,08,09
144,Wedding vow renewal,"What can I say...... fantastic place, fantastic people, fantastic location. decor is amazing, so much to explore in the hotel, definitely not the normal boring mainstream . We visited with our dog for our 1920s style informal wedding vow renewal, our room was excellent, very very clean, excellent room service.  We had a private dining room which was set as we wanted it with a personal waiter, flowers we ordered and cupcakes,everything perfect. Special thanks to Moses (head of food and beverage) and Katie (guest services manager) attention to detail on everything , ticks all the boxes, but the whole family at the hotel made our stay very very special. Pat on the back to Brenton on front of house, always smiling and happy to help with an excellent knowledge of the area . Food is amazing, thanks to the chef who even stayed over to cook for us such was the attention to detail. if you want a place to stay in Mayfair, this is it, we have travelled extensively but have found a gem here, well done to all",5,2013,08,07
144,Fabulous Flemings,"- Unbeatable location. 5 minutes walk through Green Park to Buckingham Palace (same with Green Park Tube station). 10 minutes to Old Bond St. and to Piccadilly Circus.
 - Excellently appointed rooms. Tasteful interiors and plush pillows
 - My Kenzo Tiger sweatshirt was already waiting in my room when I checked-in because I phoned the concierge to secure it in my behalf.
 - Staff were extra friendly and helpful with inquiries.",4,2013,08,05
144,Fantastic Flemings!,"We have just returned from a fantastic stay at Flemings. Fabulous location near Green Park and superb accommodation. The staff were friendly and polite at all times. We arrived to find we had been upgraded to a 2 bedroom apartment which was wonderful and allowed us the freedom and convenience of a small kitchen. On return from a night at the theatre we found our apartment had flooded due to a heavy thunderstorm! The wonderful reception desk staff handled everything calmly and efficiently, even to the point of helping us pack up all our belongings in the dark (the lights had fused due to the water coming in) and then, helping us even more by offering a nights stay in the penthouse suite to make up for all the inconvenience! Wonderful weekend away. Thank you Flemings!",5,2013,07,29
144,Great hotel and location!,"Great hotel to stay in- we got a great price with expedia otherwise it is perhaps a little expensive. Location is great, right next to Green Park tube station which includes a ""hop on hop off"" bus stop which we used. 5 min walk to buckingham palace was great- straight through Green Park. Location was excellent as mentioned, we walked everywhere when not on the tour bus- to Oxford st, Piccadilly Circus, Soho etc. The service was lovely and the room also great. Free wifi in the public areas are a bonus. The room was nice and clean, only thing was that a light in the bathroom didn't work and kept flickering- didn't find a need to report it though. Overall would recommend this hotel! ",5,2013,07,28
144,Flemings,"We have just returned from a great weekend in London,were we stayed at Flemings hotel in green park,first class hotel,first class staff,hotel is Art Deco wonderful hotel perfect for a quite break in London it's in a great place 10 mins walk from Buckingham palace, 5 mins from Hyde park,20 mins walk to Harrods.Great breakfast,very good for shepards market with its good pubs and shops only 5 minute walk,will be going back.",5,2013,07,24
144,Great Boutique Hotel,"Hotel staff is wonderful, as is the lobby library area.  Library is the theme of this hotel, ideally located in Mayfair,just 2 blocks from the underground(Green Park).  Rooms are  nicely decorated, but could use more shelves or a dresser.  Walking distance to Buckingham Palace and Trafalgar Square. Right off Piccadilly across from Green Park. Lift a tad slow though.",4,2013,07,20
144,Best find in London,This was my second visit to Flemings and will definitely not be my last. I stayed with my friend as we were taking part in the London 10k - it was a perfect location and the staff were just fantastic nothing was too much trouble and we were able to have showers after our run and they did not mind us having our room for an extra hour at no extra cost. My husband and I visited one of the same chain in Brugges and it was just the same fantastic standard - we will be back that is for sure,5,2013,07,19
144,Superb location; excellent staff,"The two best features of this hotel are location and staff. 

Located in a small side street off busy Piccadilly, the hotel is within a few minutes walk of Green Park, Hyde Park, Buckingham Palace, Trafalgar Square, Regent Street, St. James etc. Being several doors down from Piccadilly, Flemings avoids the noise and bustle of the main thoroughfare, although loud tradespeople making deliveries may provide an annoyance early in the mornings. 

The staff here are superlative, especially Paul and his crew in the Concierge's department. Within reason, they will do anything you ask them to do for you. Staff in the restaurant are also good, but it is rather an expensive place (especially for breakfast).

On my first stay at Flemings last year, I started out in a desperately confined single room, later getting upgraded (for a price, of course) to a double. That was a big, very comfortable room and this time when I booked a double I expected something similar. No such luck. Our room was adequate, but somewhat cramped and not a place you would want to dawdle overly long. However, it is amply equipped with necessary items like TV, hairdryer, iron and ironing board etc.

Since my last review one of two complaints has been attended to; one has not. They now supply an goodly number of umbrellas for guests to borrow when setting forth on less than sunny days. The lobby computer is still a pain in the neck (literally). The monitor is high up  on the wall, while the keyboard is at waist level. Worse, no chair was provided and you can only use it for 15 minutes at a time. Surely, they could make this more user-friendly without too much effort or expense.

Flemings is expensive, but this is London and it is the West End where nothing good come cheap. Five nights cost in the region of 1,400 pounds (about $2,300). Most hotels in the immediate area are more expensive, some of them ridiculously so.

Despite a few failings, Flemings remains choice because of an almost perfect location--and in London that is more than half the battle.",4,2013,07,17
144,Like going home .....,"Just spent an excellent weekend with my daughter at Flemings (again).  Lovely friendly hotel, centrally located for just about everything, somewhere I would be happy to stay on my own as they make you feel very much at home. 

Concierge recommended Sheppard's Market - that was great and so close.

Daniella helped me to organise just the weekend I wanted for us both and Monica helped us and a pal try some exciting bar cocktails until the early morning!  Thanks Flemings.  Suzi",5,2013,07,16
144,What a great find,"We have just stayed here with friends this weekend.  We wanted somewhere to stay near Claridges as we were going there for afternoon tea at 5.30pm so decided to stay overnight.
I found this wonderful hotel just by browsing through websites looking for a hotel in the area..... Mayfair.  I got a good deal online when I booked which included breakfast.
We arrived on a very hot sunday in july..... it was wonderfully cool in the foyer.... we were welcomed by the reception staff, who were jolly and friendly.  Our rooms were not ready which we fully expected as the time was a long way before book in time of 2pm.  We left our luggage with them and went down into the bar area.... a lovely little dark area off the dining room.  Must have recently been refurbished as the décor was fantastic. The barman though did have to have a little help in understanding what a lager shandy consisted off and a lime and soda, but fun was had in explaining to him.
when our rooms were ready we were not disappointed.  the rooms were fairly spacious... with air condiditoning.... the bathrooms were very well equipped as well.  in the morning the breakfast was taken in the dining room in the basement... again delux décor down there. A full English was enjoyed by us all.... with various different items on a menu should you require them.
Our friends and I had a great stay... only wish it was for longer... but a great find and we will certainly go back again.",5,2013,07,15
144,Fab - service & location,"We were upgraded to a two bedroom suite with courtyard.  Great service, in-keeping style for Mayfair.  It was a very good overnight stay for business.  Our suite was very big, we arrived late in the evening and the choice of food was very limited, we left early in the AM so cannot comment on breakfast or other facilities.",5,2013,07,14
144,CELEBRATION WEEKEND!,"For my 60th birthday I decided to revisit a hotel I had stayed at 50 years ago with my parents. Flemings had always been in my memory ever since and I wanted to go back.
Was it going to be the same??
Of course not but obviously the exterior had not changed. 
Parking on a late Friday afternoon was easy outside the hotel.
Reception -.a breath of modernism. Service courteous.
Room - just a tad disappointed. Even more so when realised it was an internal room directly beside the main extraction system which ran noisily day in day out. The double glazing helped dull the noise but the necessary air conditioning countered that advantage out.
The bathroom was exceptionally large but felt it was designed for disabled guests. I'm not that old!!
Ate in the restuarant Friday night. Fine but nothing exceptional.
Went to Shepherds market around the corner every day for breakfast and found some lovely small cafes.
Didn't take advantage of the bar, afternoon tea or gym.
Did sit in the reception area lounge and had drink and snackj with our daughter who visited. Good waiter service.
Overall I wasn't disappointed but the room let us down slightly.
The three nights for two deal seemed to work out well. The parking outside all weekend and at a close garage was exceptional...and cheap. Free most days (was there on Bank holiday Monday).
Totally not the fault of Flemings but the derelict building at the end of the road does not lend to Mayfair living. Hope it gets developed soon. The Tesco express at the other end of the road certainly helps for everyday supplies and a bottle of wine!!
Well done Flemings. I will always remember you!",5,2013,07,11
144,What a fabulous stay!,"I stayed at this hotel for my boyfriends 20th birthday. We were greeted so well like we were old friends at the reception and was immediately impressed with the friendly service that we received.The When entering our room although it was slightly small the decoration was really nice and impressive. The beds were extremely comfy with crisp white clean bed linen. I was also impressed with the delicious cupcakes we received on arrival plus a glass of champagne. 
The breakfast was also nicely done and the service was perfect.
A fantastic stay and we will definitely be back.
Thank you so much Flemmings",5,2013,07,01
144,I Could Stay There Forever!!,"Everything was excellent.  From the cleanliness, cheerful helpful staff, food and convenient location.  Also, had the true British feel.  My only regret is we didn't do our afternoon tea there and the room could have been a little bigger.",5,2013,06,29
144,Great stay in London,"My 9 year old daughter and I spent a week in an ""Executive Twin""  room. While initially not thrilled about the ground floor location, I found it very convenient and the hotel a comfortable, homey and simultaneously stylish place. Our room was not particularly small for London and our bath a normal city hotel size. We loved the lobby sitting room and enjoyed a nice, but not great, dinner at the restaurant. The staff was very welcoming and very, very helpful. Each staff member seemed to wear more than one hat and we always felt they treated us like old friends. We will definitely return to Flemings. It's not super formal but a comfortable and updated place to hang your hat in a very convenient location. ",5,2013,06,24
144,Not as good as I remembered,"After our one night stay in January, I thought this was a top Hotel. Spent seven days there this time and will not return. Breakfast was less than average and expensive, expensive wifi so had to either sit in the lounge and get average reception, boring, or go up the street to the local cafe and get a coffee and use their free wifi and stay as long as we liked. Food extremely over priced and not good.. One dining room staff member was extremely rude, sad to say she was Australian! The rest were one short of useless. Quite a dark hotel and the wallpapers and dressings didn't help. Sadly had items of clothing removed from our suitcase and still don't think Management believes us. Could happen anywhere but just left a bad taste.",3,2013,06,24
144,Nice hotel but tiny rooms,"Great location, nice breakfast but tiny, tiny rooms.  Close by to everywhere. Green park station right across the street., lots of buses on Piccadilly.  Walking distance to west end theatre.  But the rooms were extremely small. Tiny elevator.",3,2013,06,23
144,Excellent hotel in prime Mayfair location,"Once again, our stay at Flemings Mayfair enhanced our visit to London. The quality and location of the hotel are perfect and we look forward to our next visit. The only minor complaint I had was with respect to the quality of the wifi service, however I believe the problems I encountered we're temporary and should be resolved soon.",5,2013,06,23
144,"Great location in Mayfair, London","We have just stayed at the Flemings in Mayfair, London, and were very pleased with the hotel which was renovated tastefully since I last stayed there. Its location cannot be beat for access to Mayfair and other points of interests.  While  the rooms are a bit small, after all one is in London,  they are very well appointed with all the modern conveniences, and the staff is friendly. Afternoon tea was good although the setting could be better.  We would certainly stay there again for its convenience and accessibility.",5,2013,06,23
144,Fabulous Afternoon Tea,4 of us went to Flemings for their Chocoholic Afternoon Tea and it was excellent. We had vouchers from Travelzoo but you would never have suspected we weren't paying the full price as the service from all members of staff was 5 star plus.  They made us feel truly special and helped to make it a great experience.  Flemings is a boutique hotel in a great location close to Green Park Station. The decor is spot on - English charm with a twist and the ambience is intimate and inviting.  We completed our trip by moving from the restaurant to the bar and we could have happily stayed there all evening.  I hadn't heard of Flemings before but we will definitely return.,5,2013,06,18
144,Regal Stay in Prime Location,"Flemings Mayfair is a beautiful boutique hotel in one of the best locations in London. The rooms are small, but very nicely appointed. The beds were extremely comfortable and the rooms were very quiet. Excellent in room amenities including soft bath linens, large flat screen tv, thick drapes and a small sitting area and desk. The front desk and concierge were most helpful and made our stay that much better. The sitting room off of the lobby is cozy and nicely appointed with a fireplace and comfortable seating. Wifi in the common area was spotty, but there is one guest computer that can be accessed. No free wifi in the rooms, but not an issue. The hotel has charm and character and is quintessentially British. Less than 10 minute walk to Fortnum and Mason, Green Park, Hyde Park, Buckingham Palace. Perfect hotel in the heart of Mayfair. A must for a getaway in London.",5,2013,06,11
144,great deal in Mayfair,"I have to preface this review by stating that I was able to get a small single room for $120/night.  For that price, this was an outstanding value and an outstanding hotel.  Small and intimate, the hotel exudes all the charm of a larger London hotel but at a more personal level.  From the door man to the front desk clerk to the maids, the service is very personal. 

My room was small and looked out onto the adjacent roof, it was comfortably appointed.  The shower was a good size, the toiletries from The White Company, and the linens very comfortable.  Even though I was in the heart of London, it was very quiet.

Location was excellent just a couple of blocks from the Green Park tube stop, the wonderful Shepard's Market around the corner and Piccadilly Circus, Buckingham Castle and Knightsbridge within 20 minutes walk.  I really enjoyed this hotel but am afraid I won't find another bargain like I did this time.",4,2013,06,10
144,London charm in Mayfair!,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Flemings hotel. The staff were super courteous, the public areas very warm and inviting, and the size of the hotel is ""right up our alley"" (very intimate with a large home feel). The location is unmatched with Green Park tube right around the corner and Shepherds Market as well, with great restaurants and pubs.  We would stay there again on our next return to London. The room rates are very reasonable; however, we did not eat breakfast in the hotel since it was too pricey (would have preferred a less costly continental breakfast).  Our room was small but in line with the price and typical size for a European/English hotel.",5,2013,06,09
144,Great Stay!!,"I could not be more happy with my choice of Flemings. The location is excellent, just a minute's walk from the Green park tube station, walking distance to Piccadilly  circus, Westminster and Buckingham Palace. Great Great Great Location. 
The staff was super friendly and helpful. We arrived late at night and they absolutely did everything in order to welcome us and even upgraded our room to a better one than reserved. 
The first room was nice and clean and modern with big bath room but the room itself was small. After the upgrade, we got a very nice sized room, with sitting area, huge bed. Very comfortable room!
In short - we had a wonderful stay in Flemings Mayfair and I would definitely check it our again for our next visit to London.",5,2013,06,09
144,A disappointing end to a great day out,"I recently visited Flemings Hotel for afternoon tea after a wonderful day out at the Chelsea Flower Show with a friend.  We went with high expectations having had tea at Flemings once before.  Sad to say this visit was not as successful.  Sandwiches were lovely, but portion rather niggardly at only 5 small pieces each.  Scones were rock hard and dry and there was not really sufficient jam to go with them.  Other cakes were similarly dry.  But the most disappointing aspect of our visit was the service.  We had to try very hard to attract anyone's attention to order champagne; we were not offered more tea/coffee and to be honest we could have walked out without paying as we simply couldn't find anyone to give us the bill!  It's back to the Ritz for us in future.",2,2013,06,05
144,Too hot by half!,"We stayed in an executive twin, which we got at a discounted rate through a website. Thank goodness we hadn't paid the rack rate! The corridors were winding and cramped, although i suppose for some that could add to the charm. The room itself wasn't terrible although not that roomy.. The TV system was truly dire, clunky in the extreme, and very unresponsive, although the tea making facility was excellent, actually probably the best thing about the whole room!  The room was terribly stuffy, really overwhelming, so we put on the air conditioning unit. It sounded like a large lorry had come into the room, unbearably noisy, so the choice was not a good one - heat or noise. In the event we took the heat and opened a window, which had a fan unit outside! None of this is what you would or should expect in a hotel purporting to be luxury and charging as such.  To me £21 for breakfast is positively indecent.",3,2013,06,04
144,Good old English Hotel,"I love this charming little hotel. It's you quintessential understated English hotel with all the essential comforts that one would want in a luxury hotel. Good service, decent size rooms, bathrooms with a stand alone shower and a WINDOW! How wonderful is that! Fleming's location is unbeatable, in the middle of Mayfair and walking distance to Bond Street and St. James's. ",5,2013,06,03
144,Too expensive for what it is,"At first I thought it was a rather small but good quality hotel; I was wrong: the rooms are extremely small, the public areas too, the wifi is expensive, you can hear noises from other rooms (even light noises), etc. In summary, it's not worth the money, in fact, it's far from being worth. ",2,2013,06,02
144,excellent experience in general,"stopped at Flemings over half term, myself and partner. the hotel is spotless and staff pleasent however numerous which can be over bearing but come to that later.
Greeted by doorman, who during visit was to be honest  disinterested but pleasent enough, check in was swift and executed very professionally by John, and luggage taken and shown room by another member of staff. Room was without few but was more than large enough for two, with very comfortable beds, tea/iron mini fridge and usual tv etc..ideally located for sight seeing which was the purpose of our visit two minutes from tube, and 5 minute stroll through green park to Buckingham palace. 
had night cap in bar on evening and breakfast following day. the bar does look like somthing from clock work organge and Marie the night manager again not very welcoming but warming once you got talking to her, drinks not cheap but where in London are they...breakfast was lovely with selection of continental and full English etc, £22 for full English plus helping to continental though does seem ridiculous. there were 7 staff present at one time which actual out numbered guests and found this very over bearing as had no soon finished and was jumped on for clearing whilst my partner who had watered mush for porriage playing with it to make the most couldn't be seen too?.

Over I would say pleasent experience if not tad on expensive side, but understandable. However the staff need training, more well trained staff vs numerous plankton perhaps 
",4,2013,06,01
144,Superb.,"An all round great visit.  Check-in and check-out were fast, efficient and friendly.  Staff were excellent.  Room was small-ish but clean and well appointed.  Bathroom was small, as others have described.  Don't try to share the shower!
Funky bar downstairs with a great bartender for a night-cap if you wanted it.  Breakfast (not included in my reservation) was buffet or a la carte and reasonably priced for Central London and of good quality.
The location is superb - minutes walk from Mr and Mrs Windsor's place, and likewise many of the London sights.  Some great pubs and restaurants nearby.  Green Park tube is minutes away.  Coming in from the Heathrow Express terminus at Paddington is about 15 pounds.
Expensive?  Yes, it is a four star boutique hotel in Mayfair, not a B&B in Brixton.
Good value? Yes as well.  I am sure i will stay here again.",5,2013,06,01
144,"Great staff, small bathroom and noisy","Staff were unfailingly helpful & friendly.
Great location
Bathroom was unbearably small - I'm not enormous myself but was it really was an elbows-tucked-in job.
Noise from air-conditioning/other equipment outside - needs double-glazing
Noisy door-slamming inside - it's not hard to add mechanisms to make them close quietly.",3,2013,05,28
144,Good Location,"Excellent location in middle of Mayfair, very near to Green Park Tube and a little bit further to Hyde Park Corner Tube.  Old style hotel 4 star, lot of staff hanging around Reception.  When we checked in we had bought a celebration package - had to go back to Reception afterwards as we couldn't remember what this included - felt that Reception should have told us when we checked in - it included 2 glasses of Champagne and Breakfast.  Glad it did include Breakfast as a continental Breakfast was £16 and a full English £22.  Thought the prices in the mini bar were very expensive - £2.50 for a KitKat - needless to say didn't use it.  Also the bar prices were very expensive - a bottle of Peroni and a small Tia Maria - £13 which included a 12.5% tip.  Only used the bar once - service was not brilliant.  The room was okay but very dark had to have the lights on in the daytime.  Spacious bathroom and room service was okay - twice a day if you wanted it.
Breakfast was fine - good selection but felt hurried - as soon as you had appeared to finish the plates were cleared.  A comfortable hotel but West End prices.",4,2013,05,27
144,Nice Hotel,"This is a very nice hotel spent the day there 08-05-13 for my daughters birthday. Nice staff, hotel is pretty and clean what more can I say having only spent one day there. The hotel is tucked away on a back street which was quite off putting until you get to the hotel itself. Its minutes away from Green Park underground station. Theres a lovely park across the road and lots to do.",4,2013,05,26
144,This hotel is a find!,"I just returned from London. I stayed at Flemings Mayfair for a week. The entire staff contributed to a wonderful experience. A quiet street just a 1/2 block from Picadilly. My friend and I walked to Green Park Station Underground nearly every day for another lovely excursion. In most cases we planned the day with one of the experienced and caring people at the concierge desk. Their knowledge and contacts were invaluable. ""Tea"" at the last minute on a Sunday afternoon? No problem - Fortnum & Mason can accommodate you"". ""Someplace charming for dinner in walking distance? Try Shepherd's Market just around the corner with about 20 different choices"".  ""Having trouble with your IPhone? We can help you with that.""  I wouldn't think of staying anywhere else in London.",5,2013,05,25
144,Flemings Mayfair a gem of a hotel in the heart of London,"If I've never raved about a hotel before, it's because I hadn't discovered Flemings Mayfair yet. Established in 1851, this boutique hotel, tucked in a quiet street in the heart of London, just steps away from Green Park and Piccadilly, oozes charm and grace, with Georgian elegance to spare. Upon arrival, my friend and I were welcomed at the curb by Branca, a warm and elegant staffer from the hotel's Concierge team, who insisted we not lift a finger to haul our luggage. A smartly clad male staffer promptly appeared to swoop them to the lobby. Check-in was quick, courteous and efficient, and service was impeccable (this staff knows what 'customer-focused' really means). The room was a tad small, as most boutique hotel rooms are, but comfortable and tastefully decorated. The tree mural which serves as wallpaper gave it an expansive feel. The lobby-adjacent Looking Glass Room, while stylishly appointed with contemporary furniture and decor, was like entering another world. One could almost hear Georgian-era gentry converse over tea within its book-lined walls. This lounge was so comfortable, I sat in one of the plush chairs to do a remote job interview via Skype (there's free wi-fi in the lobby and the lounge area). About the only thing that marred the experience, if I can quibble, was the lack of follow-up from a member of the concierge team on a couple of requests. Otherwise, Flemings Mayfair is a GEM of a hotel and I'd highly recommend it to family and friends visiting London.",5,2013,05,23
144,Visit to flemings,"We stayed at Flemings for the first time as it was my husband's 70th birthday, all the hotel staff are absouloutly fantastic our waiter at breakfast Amir was a delight and all the front desk were extremely helpful, we will definatley be back",5,2013,05,23
144,Great location in London!,"My family stayed in the apartments at Flemings for 5 nights. This is an excellent location, walking distance to Oxford, Bond, Buckingham Palace, and lots more. 
The hotel is very English. Exceptionally small bathrooms (no counter space AT ALL), double beds and no drawers. If you can get past that there is a fully stocked kitchen, washer/dryer, TVs in every room and accessibility to everything.
The staff are very friendly and helpful. This is actually our 2nd time there- the first time out kids were 7 & 9 and felt welcome.
The downside- they are renovating above & below so the noise & dust is unbearable if you're trying to have a sleep in. Lots of workman in the halls, pounding on walls, and loud feet. My husband was quite ill and had a very hard time resting.
Can't say enough about the location and there's a great restaurant for lunch around the corner called Burger & Lobster. Get there by noon or you'll be waiting!",4,2013,05,19
144,Great Place,"Firstly, I searched out a smaller hotel in London to give it a try, Flemington's was great, from the moment I arrived they were friendly and efficient.
I was checked in in 5 mins and shown to my room, the room was small but more than adequate, London does not do large rooms, if you want that your going to be upset, the room its self was just lovely, the decor was beautiful and the skilful use of mirrors gave an impression it was large.
It was a very clean and comfortable room and a lot better than the chains.

The staff were awesome, without exception every one was friendly polite and on the ball. a credit to the hotel.

The location could'nt be anymore perfect for me anyway, a short wall to Oxford street and bond street for the shopping, and I also walked up to knightsbridge which only took 15 mins...

The tube is 2 mins away, I would so recommend this hotel it was great...im just worried the secret gets out and the price goes up...

I will be making a booking for later in the year real soon, I will try the 2 bed apartment that they have so I can bring the family.

Thank you Flemington's you guys are great.",5,2013,05,16
144,All very nice but a bit pricey!!,"Upgraded to twin having booked a single. I enjoyed my stay here as the staff were very helpful and friendly; the room was larger than average; everything was clean and working well; the bed was also very comfortable and got a great night's sleep. Location is very good too with easy access to the tube and many nearby restaurants etc.
However, for nearly 200GB£ there was no breakfast; the small flat screen TV set was precariously mounted on an extending arm that allowed only one of the occupants to view from their bed. 
OK, this is Mayfair, London so one expects to pay more but they could have included breakfast.",4,2013,05,13
144,"Lovely hotel, great location, very considerate and helpful staff","I picked this hotel as they had an amazing offer on ebookers and the good reviews on trip advisor.  I was a bit nervous about staying at a new place, not knowing what to expect.  On my arrival, they told me my room wasn't ready, they escorted me to the beautiful lobby and offered me a free welcome drink.  When I got to my room, I was pleasantly surprised as they upgraded me to a single executive room as I was staying for 10 days, they wanted to be sure I was comfortable!  I love that they would give us a free newspaper each morning and there were 2 housekeeping sessions where the second one was to remove the decorative pillows etc from the bed, just so I could get straight into bed without having to do that myself!  I had asked for bathroom slippers and they would keep a new pair each day.  The staff were so helpful.  I loved my room and was quite sad to leave it which is very unusual for me and esp with hotels in London!  The location is super convenient with the Green park tube station literally 3 minutes away.  Will definitely stay here again!!  Thank you Flemings for keeping me comfortable and happy while I was at your hotel.",5,2013,05,12
144,Third Time back,"Third time back to this hotel. Service excellent, staff very approachable and an excellent location.... walk to end of the street and no matter which way you turn you will come onto some of the main attractions - if you turn right you will come to Hard rock cafe within 5mins.... walk straight from there for about 15/20mins and  you will come to Harrods....from this hotel if you walk to end of the street and cross over the road you will be in Green Park... walk through Green Park within mins you will be at Buckingham Palace.....again coming out of the hotel to the end of the street turn left and you walking pass The Ritz and a long to Piccadilly Circus.....
Can be pricey in main sesons we went at Easter and got a really good deal......",4,2013,05,11
144,Really wonderful caring hospitality,"Staff couldn't be more helpful; genuine sense of personal touch hospitality and caring. 
Hotel is lovely and charming. Great location for tourists, close to tube and nearby West End and London's parks.
No business centre as of May 2013, which is a downside for the business traveler.
I stay in leading hotels in London weekly, and despite the fact that Flemings is an inconvenient distance from my main business activities and does not have a business centre yet, its staff and attention to personalised service would tip the balance in the favour of my returning here next trip.",5,2013,05,10
144,Great hotel for walkers in London,"My wife and I are American retirees 68 years old, but we like to walk as many places as we can when we travel.  The Flemings Mayfair Hotel (as it is generally known) is ideal for that.  It is close to Hyde Park, to Green Park, and to the beautiful St. Johns Park with its long lake and many species of birds.  It is a leisurely 20-minute stroll through the parks to Buckingham Palace, the Churchill War Rooms (really worth visiting) and Westminster Abbey (often way too crowded to enjoy).  Another 10 or 15 minutes and you are looking at Big Ben and Parlaiment or across the river at the ""London Eye,"" aka the ferris wheel.  The hotel is also in an area of many traditional English pubs, some with an international flair (Italian, Iranian, and even ""Polish-Mexican"").
    The Flemings' own restaurant was delightful and reasonably priced for being in a relatively  expensive hotel (for us). Rooms were 176 British Pounds per night.  The Flemings staff, from the front desk to the maids to the awesome concierges, were uniformly terrific.  They really made us feel at home and we will certainly go back again.",5,2013,05,09
144,Couldn't be more helpful,"So, ok, we were a large party - 5 rooms one night and 7 the next - but the accomodation and ambience of the hotel was lovely.

This was the occasion of my daughter's 21st birthday and so I'd organised for 2 nights accommodation in a good quality hotel, including breakfast and dinner.

The hotel location is really good - 5 minutes stroll through Green Park and you're outside the front of Buckingham Palace and also right by Green Park tube station.

The standard of accommodation is excellent - the rooms and public areas are beautifully furnished and the beds are equally comfortable. 

Food?  Very well presented and, although not the widest menu, the food was well prepared and cooked and thoroughly enjoyed by all.  Compliments to the chef!

People?  Very keen to please - pleasant, not stuffy, professional, friendly, courteous and helpful.

Overall, we'd absolutely stay here again and look forward to doing so. This could be my new base when I'm staying in London...!!",5,2013,05,09
144,Great staff in a nice quirky hotel,"The staff at this hotel are great, professional, friendly and efficient. The decor is great really stylish & quirky and a nice change from bland hotel chains. The only down sides were the small room and bathroom. Glad we only stayed one night as felt claustrophobic in the room. Also found the hotel noisy so had a poor nights sleep. On a more positive note the location is great close to shopping, restaurants and the tube.",3,2013,05,07
144,Bad Start,"Booked room by telephone for stay on same night only to be called back 10 minutes later that they had made a mistake ! Luckily I am nice sort of person so did not go mad.  10 minutes later told they did indeed have a room !
On check in I was offered a drink in the bar as a sorry.
Nice room and bed but the smallest shower I have ever had and at 6 ft 1 could only just fit in. Bar was closed earlier than advertised so just misses out on full marks.",4,2013,05,07
144,Disappointing,"We stayed for 2 nights in March 2013. Our double room was furnished and decorated nicely but it was very small. Since the bathroom lacked an extractor fan the steam and humidity from a shower permeated the room. Although Flemings describes itself as a small luxury hotel what we saw of it was turned out well but not luxurious. The businesses on Half Moon Street put out refuse which was collected around 5:00am. Since our room was on the street side of the hotel we were awakened by cascades of bottles and trash crashing around. It isn't the hotel's fault but you are paying a premium for the Mayfair location. This part of it comes with the noise. An improperly washed glass in the bathroom was a small thing but very off putting. The wall mounted aircon unit was above one side of the bed where the air flow was directed at our heads. The lift was out of service when we checked out. We had to wrestle our luggage through the narrow halls and down the stairs. Breakfast was not included in our $300/night room rate.

In the hotel's favour the staff were polite and friendly.

You can do better for the money in central London.",2,2013,05,03
144,Fabulous Hotel in a Fabulous Location,"After reading a few of the previous reviews we were a little uncertain of what to expect upon arrival to this hotel. Thankfully we were pleasantly surprised. 
Firstly, the hotel is in a superb location, it really is a convenient spot for shopping, restaurants & bars, along with Green Park Tube station.
The hotel itself was welcoming and the staff were professional & helpful, ensuring check in & out was quick & easy. 
Our room was a standard twin room & despite many reviews complaining the rooms were small I'm not sure what they were expecting? Our room was a decent size for two ladies with huge suitcases & countless shopping bags after a hard day at the shops. The bathroom was also a fair size with a super powerful shower & plenty of toiletries.
Breakfast wasn't included in our room rate, this didn't bother us too much as there are literally cafes on every street corner offering breakfast options, however, if you are looking for a full English, you'll be better to opt for the breakfast at the hotel.
As for noise & tubes travelling underneath the hotel? We had no experience of this? We were on the third floor & heard nothing apart from light morning traffic from around 6:30am. The beds were comfortable & we slept just fine.
I noticed on a number of reviews lots of people have stayed at this hotel for business. This is understandable, however, for an ex-Londoner returning to visit friends & play the tourist I would highly recommend this hotel It's not the typical stuffy corporate style you may expect, you have that across the road at the Hilton, which is exactly opposite. This hotel feels like it embraces the area a little more & so I would highly recommend it.",5,2013,05,02
144,Staff make this hotel special,"We enjoyed our stay, I could be very picky and list a number of little things that could be improved, but nothing was bad enough to spoil our stay. The staff were lovely and so helpful and friendly and this made all the difference. Please remember these are old buildings thus rooms may be odd sizes and bathrooms can be small, but this all adds to the character. Would definitely return.",4,2013,04,28
144,Great hotel,"The Flemings hotel is a perfect hotel for business: good location, near the tube, very nice staff en the room was excellent. Breakfast was very good too and all services are available. The bed was a bit hard, but that is really the only thing I would improve.

And the prices are ok for this part of the city, but try to catch a promo for a really good value.",4,2013,04,27
144,Good hotel,"Good location, nice staff and clean bedrooms. 3 blocks away from Green Park tube station. Breakfast is very good as well in case you have it included. Hotel belongs to the Small Boutique Hotels of the World quality chain",4,2013,04,26
144,Hidden Gem,"Stayed here with colleagues for a function at the Grovesnor on Park Lane.

Fantastic boutique style hotel - rooms not large but it is in the middle of Mayfair - great location and in walking distance to Shepherd Market and other Mayfair haunts.

Good breakfast included - only criticism was the bar early evening - had to walk though area where afternoon tea had obviously been served and dirty cluttered table left - surprising!",5,2013,04,26
144,"It could be fantastic but really isn't.  Poor food, poor nights sleep.","I was looking forward to some good food and a good night’s sleep but didn't get either.

The hotel upgraded me to a suite, which I assumed had something to do with the hotel being fully booked rather than anything else. The size of the suite was impressive, the bedroom was good quality and comfortable but the rooms desperately need updating. The taps and shower control were so worn that you couldn't make out which was hot or cold. The bedside lampshade, shower head and sink were all broken. The kitchen area was worse than some student houses I’ve seen and the bathroom fan was loud but managed to get ever louder when left on for over a minute or so.

The restaurant was disappointing, more staff than customers meant constant and pointless interruptions. The quality of the food was poor and the produce didn't seem fresh. The house wine was like paint stripper and a shocking 12.5% tip was automatically added to the bill for two people. A two course meal and one glass of the wholesaler’s cheapest vin de box wine each, came to £90 including the tip.

After travelling all day and the disappointing meal, I was looking forward to a good night’s sleep but it didn't happen. You could hear and feel the tube trains as they passed underneath, any noise from the street was crystal clear, and both the lift and staff entrance also generated a lot of noise which also disrupted sleep. The morning came and at 08:00 the builders started work and decided to have a loud conversation right outside the door, never again.",2,2013,04,26
144,"Lovely Hotel, great location...!","My elderly mother and I just enjoyed a lovely stay at this charming and centrally located hotel. We had a bright and beautifully appointed front facing room with a large and tastefully decorated bathroom. The common spaces throughout the hotel were beautiful and we enjoyed sitting by the fire most evenings for a nightcap after our theatre performance. The concierge team was particularly outstanding! They secured theatre tickets for us as we requested prior to our departure from Canada, which we paid for in advance and gratefully collected upon our arrival in London. The front desk was very accommodating and available whenever we had a request. A thoroughly enjoyable stay...we would return in a heartbeat!",5,2013,04,23
144,expected better,"Three of us stayed here for 2 nights to celebrate our 40th Birthdays. We had booked 3 single executive rooms but had been upgraded to 3 double standard, which was great as they were bigger rooms. The decoration was ok and the rooms were clean. My room overlooked the back street, which was ok for the room as there were nets and curtains. The bathroom however had no curtain. It did have frosted glass, but it was still unnerving when you could see people walking past, especially at night when you had the light on -didn't like it at all! My friends were on internal corridors and were roasting, there was air conditioning but this was noisy! The first night we stayed was very noisy with people walking past my room at all hours.You could also hear the tube going underground every couple of minutes -this did stop around midnight though. The second night was better but my friends were disturbed by housekeeping talking on the corridor outside their rooms at 8am. Breakfast was ok, average selection of fruits and meats. the cooked breakfast was ok, with a good selection of cooked options. The staff were very helpful and friendly. The location was excellent, only a 5 minute walk from the tube station, the ritz and various shops. Won't stay here again and won't recommend it either, purely based on the noise at night, if you can sleep through anything you will be fine!",3,2013,04,20
144,Great Hotel in perfect position,"This hotel is in an excellent position, virtually across the road from Green Park, and a 3 minute walk to Green Park underground station.
Reasonably comfortable KS bed, but rather a hard mattress.  Feather Pillows which are always problematic, but these were changed upon request.
Nice room, Junior Suite has 2 sofas in lounge area, and a second TV.
The staff member who showed us to our room proudly showed us the Krupp Pod Coffee Maker in the cabinet in the room.  Great, BUT there was no power point into which it could  be plugged.  This necessitated us removing the coffee machine from it's housing, and kneeling on the floor to make the coffee!!!  Not ideal obviously!
There was a hair dryer in the bathroom, but again, no power point into which it could be plugged.
The heated towel rail in the bathroom was of such a design that towels could not actually be hung on it - what were they thinking?  Possibly it was for room heating only!
Wifi was very expensive and connection was somewhat problematic.
Local telephone calls were charged at 90p for the first 75 seconds!!!!
Staff were always very helpful, and abundant.",5,2013,04,20
144,Poshing it up Mayfair Style.,"The best hotel I have stayed in. 
Fantastic service, all staff very helpful without being in your face. 
Cute little cupcakes waiting for us in our rooms. 
Comfortable beds. 
Hot Shower
No Noise
Very centrally located. 
Breakfast amazing and cooked to order.",5,2013,04,15
144,Capital Class,"One night stay, Sunday and could have stayed a month. Everything you would expect from a top class hotel in the posh part of London. Room superb, staff as friendly as your best mate. Breakfast was great, should be for £25 quid but that's Mayfair! Can't recommend highly enough and can't wait to go back.",5,2013,04,14
144,The epitomy of elegance and friendliness.,"I stayed for just one night in Flemings, but what a night! The room was stunning, really one of the prettiest hotel rooms I've ever seen. The bed was extremely comfortable, the bathroom was spacious, the whole room was very intelligently laid out. The staff were so friendly, I really couldn't have asked for any more from this place. Pure perfection.",5,2013,04,12
144,Amazing hotel!,"Stayed here at the weekend with my boyfriend. Absolutely loved it here, stunning hotel and the rooms are lovely. The food was lovely too, and the hotel is just beautiful. The location is perfect and staff can't help you enough. Should be a five star. Can't wait to go back.",5,2013,04,10
144,Excellent location - great service,"So happy we chose this hotel!  1) The location is excellent.  1/2 block off Piccadilly and only 2 very short blocks from Green Park Tube.  Best - it is a straight shot to Heathrow Airport on the tube.  Only 5 pounds to Heathrow!  2) Excellent breakfast buffet.  Only thing missing was eggs.   3) Excellent service.  Everyone including front desk, restaurant staff, and housekeeping were kind and endearing.   4) Great room - small by American standards - but more ""cozy"" than cramped.  Excellent mattresses and pillows, linens, etc.  Very modern bathroom with good toiletries (shampoo/conditioner, bath gel, lotion, soap) provided.  Good TV.  Bathrobes and slippers provided.  5) There is a grocery around the back street corner where you can purchase cokes, bottled water, toiletries, snacks, etc.  Very convenient.  6) good restaurants in close walking distance.   7) Convenient for all attractions - Buckingham is literally less than 1/3 mile walk. Many attractions within comfortable walking distance (Big Ben, Westminster Abbey, Piccadilly Circus, Ritz Hotel for tea, etc.).  Or, you can take the very convenient tube from Green Park.  Taxies are never hard to find on Piccadilly if you prefer.  We will definitely stay here next time!",5,2013,04,08
144,Excellent,"Booked a room as we were seeing a show on Friday night and shopping on Saturday.
We had booked a celebratory lunch on a special deal in their restaurant on Friday...and subsequently booked the room. 
Really good food and service at lunch.....our room was then ready and they had given us a suite, with complimentary bottle of champagne for our stay. The front desk staff were excellent. We will definitely be staying here when we need to stay in town in future.",5,2013,04,08
144,Pleasant Experience will Not Regret,"Great Location, Great customer service, Accommodating, Clean and comfortable, Concierge available at all times to help with any questions you may have. Stayed in a few great hotels in London and by far this has been my favorite. I would definetely recommend this hotel!",4,2013,04,07
144,Afternoon tea was stunning,"I came here for afternoon tea on a Saturday afternoon and was not disappointed. Excellent choice of teas, scones are beautiful, stand out Victoria sponge and the macaroons are delicious too. 
Only negative is that the tea room is under street level so no windows but other than that fantastic.",4,2013,04,07
144,Lovely place,"Beautiful hotel with lovely comfortable rooms.  In great location, which still feels quiet and a little off the major thoroughfares and most touristy areas.  Great welcome on checkin and attentive service.  The restaurant and bar look great, although the bar was very quiet on one night we tried it, but plenty of places in the vicinity.",5,2013,04,06
144,Charming hotel in a great location,"Flemings Mayfair was a terrific choice for a recent visit to London.  We flew into Heathrow and took the Piccadilly tube directly from the airport to the Greenpark tube stop.  It is less than a 5 minute walk from the tube (and there are elevators at the Greenpark stop if you're carrying luggage).  The lobby is small but elegant.  We arrived midmorning and we were able to check in early.  The staff was professional and helpful in all respects, particularly walking directions to various sites.  We had high tea in the afternoon.  It was fine, but not the elegance of someplace like the Ritz (but not the price, either).  We will definitely return.",5,2013,04,05
144,Always a good choice,"Centrally located in Mayfair, always welcoming, friendly, comfortable and quiet.  Generous breakfast.  Have stayed several times and will again.  Bathrooms with baths, tea and coffee making in the rooms.  Oasis in a busy city.",4,2013,04,05
144,Seems to be a theme !,"Flemings web site is very attractive and boutique hotel in mayfair sounds all very good ! But beware , the usual , play button at reception will inform you ! . You have been upgraded to an executive room ! Wow we thought , will come here again ! . But !! What they don,t tell you is you are by the very noisy lift ! And being london it is in use all night .
Room was very nice , bed very comfortable , bathroom small but clean and well laid out . 
Location is very good , staff friendly and polite .",2,2013,04,03
144,Overnight theatre trip to London,"This hotel is the epitome of boutique hotels! Full of character just like the staff, decor was funky and fun, food cooked and served to very high standard. Comfortable beds, fluffy towels and robes in bedroom fitted with everything one would need. This will be my first choice for all return trips to London. Would love to have stayed longer. The location is perfect for sightseeing, shopping or just people watching in nearby Green and James' Parks.",5,2013,04,02
144,"2nd Time, Same as last time","Receptionist informed me we had been upgraded on arrival to executive room, it was the smallest room I have ever stayed in, I must have been in their suite last time. 
The positives:
Again location is great, Bed was very comfy, room service was quick and was actually great for late night food. 
The bad:
Expensive, room was tiny, shower problem still there, its just not made for tall men.

If you can get a deal then the location is great, I would prefer St. Ermin though (reviewed previously) as the walk through the St. James park is not that long and worth it.",3,2013,03,29
144,"High Class hotel in center city, close to everything","Have just spend 4 nights in this hotel, partially for family trip and partially for business purposes.
Great location, from which it is easy to reach main points of London.
As hotel was recently refurbished, rooms and hotel interior is perfect, a mix of classic old style with modern touches.
Staff service is excellent, efficient and quick, as the ratio of staff/guests is very high.
Continental breakfast buffet with option to select from a menu different hot breakfast options.
Didn't have the opportunity to use the restaurant, but it seemed to me the restaurant menu offered nothing really special as dishes..... but then I'm really fussy when I dine somewhere, so it's a personal opinion.

Only small negative point : the shower took a long time to produce warm water, although it eventually got to the right temperature. Perhaps that was just my room.

This will certainly be a hotel I'll go back to, if I need to stay in the Mayfair area.",4,2013,03,28
144,Vegan Afternoon Tea,My boyfriend looked for a hotel that can prepare a vegan afternoon tea and he found this place. Their vegan afternoon tea was amazing with proper scones and pastries. It's very difficult to find a hotel who can prepare a proper vegan afternoon tea as most of the hotels will just give me fruit salad. I was really impressed with their vegan afternoon tea! It's a shame that the restaurant is on the basement level and there is no sunlight.,4,2013,03,27
144,"good location, disappointing","I was expecting a great Boutique hotel, very disappointing, the rooms are very small, bathrooms ancient, you have to pay for an internet service that does not work...the restaurant is on the basement, not very exciting, and the staff not very helpful.",3,2013,03,25
144,Brilliant Hotel,"From the moment I walked up to the hotel in this brilliant location, the service was outstanding, I was immediately given an upgrade to a double from a single.The reception staff were so helpfull.  I was attending a reunion that night close by and they showed me exactly where to go. I was staying on my own but felt totally at ease in this beautiful hotel.  My room was very comfortable, and all the little extra's like the hand written welcome card are a really nice touch. I will definately be going back to this wonderful hotel.",5,2013,03,23
144,Pretty average,"Stayed for three days in March.  The hotel is ok, found the service average but my bathroom was very small.  The room size was decent.

Looking at the reviews it looks like your experience is going to be very dependant on the room you get.

Its a great location but overall I would say its pretty average.",3,2013,03,23
144,"Great location, nice hotel","I give it a very good because it was a fraction above average, and there is not an option for simply good. Rooms are small but clean, I got a courtyard room which was quiet. The rooms are too hot, and even switching the radiators off, it took hOurs to cool down. Bathroom was tight but clean and functional, a bit dated. Staff are very well trained and helpful. Dining room and bar a bit pokey in the cellar. Room service breakfast was distinctly unremarkable. I had an excellent late deal, £100 for a double room in Mayfair in a 4 star hotel is pretty good, and on that basis it was extremely good value for money, I would have been disappointed if I had to pay the full list price.",4,2013,03,20
144,WOW ! THANK YOU,"I sent my wife and my 8 year old daughter to the hotel for a night away for a Mother’s Day present. To say they came back buzzing would be an understatement. They loved it. Everything, the décor, the service, the staff, the location, the atmosphere….i could go on and on. Highly recommended. I had a very happy wife and daughter.",5,2013,03,18
144,Happy accident!,"I left it until the very last minute to find a hotel for an evening in London and when I couldn't get in to my usual hotel I stumbled across Flemings.  Ideal location, excellent staff and great rooms.  Best value for a London hotel ever (and I've stayed in A LOT).",5,2013,03,18
144,Disappointing,"I was looking forward to this visit - I am a member of the SLH Club and was upgraded to a 'double room' - I would not have liked to see a single.  My room on the 4th floor was pokey - very little room to move around and actually quite difficult to get into and out of the shower as the roof eaves sloped in at the edges of the room.  The public areas are lovely - well appointed and quite luxurious - the staff were all very helpful.  Internet is charged at £15 per night which is always a complete rip-off in any hotel.  We ate in the restaurant which was Ok but I thought a bit pricey and the drinks in the bar were exhorbitant - £14 for a glass of wine!  If you stay there Shepherd's Market offers plenty of food options at a better price.  Overall, this place did not live up to my expectations.",3,2013,03,18
144,A wonderful Surprise,"We usually stay in the the Connaught in London and are always impressed with their service and quality, but this time we thought we'd try somewhere a little less expensive.
The Flemings Hotel is tucked away in a quiet street PERFECTLY situated in London best area. The staff were without exception fantastic. We arrived with no parking booked... no problem. We arrived early and wanted a room.... no problem. The room was really clean, very comfy King bed and quite trendy decor.
Only criticism is that the a/c is a bit old fashioned though it works well, and the bathroom is a bit small and steams up very quickly!
So, in summary, really nice, welcoming, high quality hotel where the staff were as good as any hotel i've stayed in. All for £200 per one night stay LESS than the Connaught or the Mandarin Oriental.
We will definitely be back.",5,2013,03,16
144,Good One night stay .,"The welcome to Flemings was very good.  Exceptionally pleasant and helpful doormen.  Quick check in , although our room wasn't ready, left bags with no problem.
Quite a large room for London !  Very clean, modern, not wow , but perfectly adequate.  Small bathroom but very clean with fluffy towels , robes and toiletries..  Tea and coffee facilities.
Renovation work going on, with very slight disruption, didn't bother us .
I liked the quirky colourful decor though we didn't have time to try any facilities. 
Two cupcakes with a candle for my husband's birthday.  Good touch.
I would return if the price was right.  Fab location.",4,2013,03,15
144,Three and a half stars,"Location, location, location.  If this hotel was rated exclusively on its location it would get five stars every time.  May not be a more perfect location in central London.  Close to everything and virtually next to the Green Park tube station which connects quickly to anywhere you need or want to go.  My room was large and well appointed -- more like an American hotel room in size than the other places I've stayed in London.  Staff is extremely friendly and anxious to please.  Very attentive.  Maid service is prompt with morning cleaning and evening turndown service.  The only complaints are about comfort and value.  It was the coldest March in 40 years and my room was COLD.  I tried to turn up the heat, but only got air conditioning.  Maybe it wasn't heated?  The restaurant has a limited menu and is not a good value.  £22 for a hot breakfast that is quite unremarkable was not appreciated.  (There are coffee shops near by where you can get a good inexpensive breakfast). And I know that some hotels still charge for Internet, but £15 per day is the highest I've paid except in a really posh resort somewhere. I really wanted to like this hotel, and it has so many winning points, I wish I could give it a higher recommendation.",4,2013,03,14
144,Stylish hotel with great location,"Stayed at Flemings for one night with my husband and the service was fantastic from start to finish. Great location and just a couple of minutes walk from Green Park Tube with Hyde Park just at the end of the street. Stylish room, cool bar, great atmosphere, will definitely stay again.",5,2013,03,13
144,Exceptional hotel - first class,"Arriving at the hotel just before 5pm ... and then watching the lobby lights dim automatically on the hour mark - that just about set the scene for this stylish hotel. Everything from the smooth check-in process, the friendly staff throughout, the impressively furnished rooms (even if it did contain quite possibly the world's smallest teacup as part of the complimentary tea/coffee tray!) and the quirky bar/restaurant underground. And not overly expensive either - have stayed in a number of hotels in the Mayfair/Park Lane area, and this goes straight in at number one. Will certainly be returning on my next visit.",5,2013,03,12
144,The best hotel in London,"Flemmings is a gem.  Stunning decor, convenient yet quiet location, the friendliest welcome and most delicious breakfast.  Why would you want to stay anywhere else?  We stayed for my daughter's birthday treat and they simply could not have done more for us.",5,2013,03,12
144,Jewel of a find,Beautiful quirky hotel with excellent service ...something often missing in Mayfair hotels. Super breakfast menu and beautiful interior. Excellent bar. Will definitely return and suitable for both business and pleasure.,5,2013,03,07
144,"Fantastic find, by far the best place I've stayed in london","Stayed here 1 night on a girlie break with teenage daughter. Exceptional welicome and service and excellent location minutes from green park tube but on a quiet side street. Safe area. Having got a deal on trivago thought we might get a duff room but no. also got robes, slippers and white company toiletries and a turndown service and a handwritten welcome card. Will definitely try and stay here again when down on business. I've paid that price to stay in a grotty comfory inn or days inn. No contest!",5,2013,03,05
144,Afternoon Tea at the Grill....Wow,"Had a fantastic girly afternoon tea,the amazing knowledge of the staff tea selection superb....cakes scrummy and fizz delicious .
Atmosphere relaxing,everything was effortless and calm.
Definitely returning.",5,2013,03,05
144,All Around Great Little Hotel!,"There aren't enough nice things to say about this hotel. I stayed here years ago and forgot how terrific it was until last week's stay. First, it is a straight shot on the London Tube from Heathrow to Green Park and then a 2 block walk to the hotel. The location is very central to anything you might want to do in London....walking distance to the theatres, major museums and sightseeing, shopping, etc. Loads of little coffee shops, restaurants, etc within walking distance.
My room was great--spacious enough for me...though none of the rooms in London are large by American standards...it was sparkling clean, quiet and comfy.
The staff is great. I believe that the manager reads these reviews so I particularly want to compliment Valentina at the front desk who was so considerate in helping me resolve a problem regarding my room (MY problem--not the hotel's...the room was great). She was so caring.
Branca was most helpful and Paul, the concierge was so enthusiastic when give me advice on a particular area I wanted to see,.
I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel or to stay here again. I booked directly on their website and got what I thought was a reasonable rate. If you're looking for a terrific London hotel, this is it!!",5,2013,03,04
144,"Great Comfort, Service and Location in London","Converted townhouse near Buckingham Palace and Mayfair.  Wonderful boutique spot just off Green Park in London.  Impeccable service, ideal location and top notch comfort.  The bar and lounge are cool, the workout facilities are ample for the space and the lounge is warm and cozy.",5,2013,03,01
144,Great spot for few days in London,"Went with my husband for a 4 days trip to London. Hotel is great, located near Green Park, so there is an easy walk to many London attractions or shopping but it is in a quiet district. Very nice rooms, nicely decorated, staff very helpful. It belongs to SLH so if you are a member you may get an upgrade. We paid for standard room and got upgraded to a beatiful apartament with 2 bedrooms which was a nice surprise and value for money. Definately will come back.",5,2013,03,01
144,Fabulous property at Mayfair,"It is a bit pricy of its room size and amenities. However, the service at the hotel is amazing. Also its at a very central location great for first-time tourists, great restaurants located within steps from the hotel. And if you don't feel like splurge on a Michelin star one night, piccadilly square, Oxford street, Knights Bridge, bond street is all 10 minutes walk. 5 min to Buckingham palace and steps away the Tube station. You could visit most of landmarks and shopping districts on foot.
If i have to complain, is when i stayed in Jan 2013, the elevators were out of service.",4,2013,02,25
144,nothing too much trouble,"Having stayed here previously I confidently booked a theatre  trip for myself and my husband.Unfortunately my husbands health has deteriorated in recent weeks and he has begun to struggle with stairs.I had omitted to contact the hotel but on arrival they went out of their way to help.We were given a ground floor room and we were shown great kindness by every member of staff.What could have been a difficult trip for us was made perfect,",5,2013,02,25
144,Fab location,"We were upgraded on arrival from 2 double rooms to a 2 bed apartment suite. 

The room offered everything we wanted as a family. 

Couple of things they could improve. 1) tv remote in rooms were temperamental...

Shower in the 2nd bedroom gets the floor really wet so we had to mop it with towels every time we have had a shower to prevent us from slipping over. 

Great location, min walk from supermarket and green park tube station. 

Service was great, small wait at check in otherwise we had a great time.",5,2013,02,25
144,I don't usually write reviews but...,"We stayed at Flemings for 2 nights at a heavily reduced rate so shouldn't really complain! but I found myself thinking...would I complain about these things if this was a 2 star hotel?! And yes...I probably would have so here goes...when we arrived we checked in and were told we had a double room. I had requested a twin room on booking so I mentioned this and they acknowledged that this was the case. We were directed to wait in the lounge until they found a solution (more like deposited in the lounge) 30 minutes later they came to tell us we could have a double room with 2 beds that they would separate for us later in the evening. We agreed. ( I don't understand why a hotel would offer a twin room at the time of booking but not actually give us one, anyway...) We went to the theatre. Came back. No separated beds. We were too tired to mention it so fell asleep on our double bed with pillows separating us. The next day we were awoken by loud talking at 7am. Our room was next to a staff cupboard and was rather noisy. We tried not to let this dampen our spirits and got ready to face the day. We wandered out into the corridor and were greeted by several cleaning buckets lining the corridor. When we arrived back at the hotel at 11pm that night they were still there. Once we manoeuvred our way around them we approached our room.....would we have twin beds tonight? Sadly not. No explanation or apology. Another night sleeping in a double separated by pillows. Why didn't we complain? We had paid a discounted rate and...in my opinion...were made to feel that way the moment we checked in. It's quite sad really as we usually pay more to stay in London and were trying Flemings to see whether we could add it to our London  list. Sadly, we'll stick to our firm favourite hotels next time. Sorry Flemings, it's a no from us.  ",3,2013,02,23
144,Very good service,Just had our first stay here very welcoming and excellent staff plus got the best deal we have ever had hope to go back soon as our trip was spoiled only by me being ill so thank goodness the staff were all so welcoming a real ray of sunshine when you are not feeling oneself,5,2013,02,19
144,Delicious afternoon tea,"I had received a voucher for afternoon tea as a birthday treat which my boyfriend and I enjoyed on Saturday afternoon. The hotel is lovely, very modern decor. The waiting staff were helpful without being over the top and the food and tea was delicious! They even opened the bar downstairs for us early so we could order a cocktail before leaving. Great experience, I would highly recommend.",5,2013,02,18
144,London Luxury - Amazing Value,"Enjoyed my stay immensely.  The service was great and the location also.  Walking distance to restaurants and everything you need.  Decor great - trendy upscale but comfortable. Room was small but I had a single and didn't mind at all.  It was quiet.  Most impressive aspect was the service. It was amazing. I have stayed in many hotels in London in all price ranges, and this is the one I'll return to.",5,2013,02,15
144,Charming hotel with downsides,"Can confirm all the good things you find in the other reviews.
Very friendly and helpfull staff, fine and comfortable rooms serviced twice a day, great location just across from Green Park, overall value for money.

The small gym has new state of the art technogym equipment.

Sound proofing of the rooms could be better.

They do have a technical issue with the ""broadband"" internet: hardly broadband and often not functioning at all. At £ 15 for 24 hour not a reasonable price. Upon complaining I didn't have to pay for it, but as it is essential for my work very inconvenient.

Currently they are refurbushing rooms, but it wasn't mentioned at time of booking nor at check-in.
So a strong smell of paint in the evening and a lot of noise in the morning as they start before 8am on the wall in the room next to me.

Difficult to understand for an otherwise well run hotel. So check before you book.",3,2013,02,13
144,"Great Stay, Great Mayfair Location","Our king room was spacious with a nice sitting area. Plenty of room to store our bags without them in the way all the time. Very comfortable bedding.  The hotel staff was universally friendly and helpful and they made us feel very much at home. The hotel's restaurant was great for the (included) breakfast and both cooked-to-order and buffet items were top-rate.

The Mayfair location is great, a short walk from the Piccadilly Line (Green Park station) so it was an easy and comparatively inexpensive trip from Heathrow terminal 4 with our Oyster cards.  Buckingham Palace is just on the other side of the park and we could easily walk to Piccadilly Circus, Leicester Square and even Covent Garden. Langham's Brasserie is a few streets over, which was good for a Saturday pre-theater dinner.  The neighborhood accessible from the other end of Half Moon St. looked like someplace that we would like to live and it had pubs and restaurants frequented by locals.

There were a few minor downsides: baths are small and the piece of glass that substitutes for a shower enclosure is entirely too small to prevent floods from splashing water unless one stands absolutely still under the shower. The public areas are so-so in terms of layout and there isn't much in the way of people watching in the lobby. The bar is downstairs and could be rearranged into a friendlier layout.

We arranged our trip through Jetsetter and were pleased with the results. We will happily repeat our stay and Fleming's will be on our list for our next trip to London.",4,2013,02,12
144,Good stay,"We stayed one night at Flemings, on a brilliant deal through Trivago. We had a small room facing over a roof/service area, but the room was fine and very comfortable. The service at the reception desk was very friendly and helpful and the public areas of the hotel very smart and pleasant. It doesn't get five stars because we enjoy having a late drink in the bar and we felt that the wine served was pretty poor, considering they charge £12.50 a glass. We don't mind paying those prices for a decent wine, but we both felt that the offer at Flemings was far worse than we've had elsewhere.

Breakfast was fine - I think £16 for continental buffet and another £6 for a cooked option as well as the buffet. Very good service and a pleasant dining room.",4,2013,02,10
144,Fantastic Location - Great Fitness Centre,"I stayed at Flemings in January this year.  I was a female travelling alone so the location was very important to me, and from the minute I arrived I felt entirely safe in the area on my own, even at night.  I have not stayed in a more ideal location in London.  Located on a quiet side street just across from Green Park, the hotel is far enough away from the hustle and bustle of the main tourist areas, yet a comfortable walking distance to Buckingham Palace, Hyde Park, Piccadily Circus and the main shopping areas on Oxford Street, Bond Street and Regent Street.  For anything not within walking distance (or if you're feeling lazy) the Green Park Tube Station is literally a 3 minute walk away.

My room was an ideal size for me on my own.  Probably would have been a bit squashy if I was with my partner but I'm sure we would have managed.  The staff were friendly and welcoming and for the price I paid I would say it was great value for money.

The Fitness centre was a deal breaker in my selection of many hotels on my holiday, and despite being disappointed by the token treadmill in the corner at numerous hotels I stayed at, Flemings definately did not disappoint.  The fitness centre is well appointed with a range of cardio equipment and weights and ideal for maintaining at least some level of fitness regardless of various holiday indulgences!

The only negative is that I would say that the rooms could probably do with a bit better sound proofing!!!",5,2013,02,08
144,Lovely,"My husband and I stayed here overnight for our anniversary and was pleasantly surprised with the whole hotel decor was lovely everywhere was clean and staff were great and very helpful,we will definitely be staying there again many thanks for everything.",5,2013,02,06
144,The Half Moon Rising- Flemings Hotel,"Just came back from 4 nights at Flemings absolutely perfect. Arrived early in the morning and John at the front desk was very accommodating and made a room available. Had an emergency on the last day that didn't allow me to check out until almost 3pm and John again helped to reduce the stress and made it easy. He is a real asset. Great staff, great location and I will be back.",5,2013,02,06
144,One of Londons best,"For me this hotel is in the perfect location, a short walk from Green Park tube station, opposite Green Park, this hotel provides luxurious rooms to match many of its more expensive competitors, whilst being small enough to feel unique. Buckingham Palace and Piccadilly are a short stroll away if you are sightseeing, whilst the Victoria Line at Green Park provides instant access to more of the city for business travellers. Nearby there are bars like Novokov and the Mayfair, restaurants like Burger & Lobster are also close.Highly recommended.",5,2013,02,04
144,Superb food.Poor service.,"Looking at the other reviews I am wondering if I went to the same place.
We went on a Saturday night with a voucher for a reduced price deal.
When we entered the restaurant we were asked what we wanted which I thought was an unusual greeting.We were ushered into a side room and ordered drinks.25 minutes later they still had not arrived.The adjoining party had waited 30 minutes for two bottles of beer which had not arrived with the first order and they were still waiting for the correct drinks when we went to the restaurant.
Our drinks arrived and we found the other members of our party who had been ushered elsewhere.The cream sherry which my wife had ordered came and was found to be a dry sherry.They do not sell Harveys Bristol Cream according to the waiter.The champagne arrived without the canopies.After a request the canopies arrived.50 minutes later the starters arrived My wife had said no green garnish,it arrived with a green garnish.;We had ordered a bottle of white wine.Three attempts later none of the wine was chilled.
We asked for red as they were unable to supply a chilled bottle of wine.Waiting for our starter we were offered one small piece of bread..50 minutes later the main course arrived.No broccoli as advertised.The next table ordered roasted winter vegetables and got a small pot of broccoli.
We were now worried about getting home as the food had taken so long to come.
After the numerous complaints the dessert and cheese and port arrived quickly.

The staff did not appear to have a sense of direction,very poor coordination.
In order to placate us they did not charge us for the drinks.The damage however had been done as we had a very stressful evening.
On the way out I asked to speak to the manager.It was no surprise to find that he was not there and would be back on Sunday.
Why offer reduced price meals if they cannot cope with the service..
We got the last train back to our station.",2,2013,02,03
144,My favorite hotel in London,"This is where I usually stay when I visit London.

Reasons:
1.They run great winter prices.
2. The location is superb. The convenience includes proximity to the Green Park station, and to the Shepherd's Market mini-neighborhood with its restaurants.
3. It's a heritage building. It's off Piccadilly St. and yet far enough away that it's very quiet.
4. They arrange reliable taxi services to the airport. If you're departing very early, they can get you coffee and tea.
5. They keep making improvements to the place. The lounge bar, near the lobby, is modern and very tastefully decorated. Even if the wireless connection around the lobby is rather slow, it's useful for quickly checking e-mail, etc.
6. Their staff are a good indication of how cosmopolitan London is.

Minor Cons:
The lift not working - I'm sure that will be fixed soon - is a bit of an inconvenience.",5,2013,01,27
144,Outstanding service and prefect location!,"I have been some lovely 5 star hotels around the world, but this has to top it when it comes to service. 
There is a reason why it's in slh (small luxury hotel) - we were a group of 4 girls celebrating a special birthday and from the moment we walked in, the staff smiled and made us feel welcome and took a genuine interest in our plans for the weekend. 
We were offered a complimentary upgrade to a 2 bedroom penthouse suite, which had its own kitchen/lift and a private outdoor area for some drinks. (which would be great in the summer). They even baked a birthday cake for us, that just added to the great service already received ... 
After checking in, it was lovely to just chill out in the living room and have tea & cake before we went out for a spot of shopping.
When we checked out, again the reception managers & staff were so lovely, and you really felt like they are enjoying their job! 
The manager who showed us to our room was also lovely and offered to spilt the beds into 2 twins as we requested twin beds.. Or offered us other options ie separate duvets etc ...How nice is that even after they have offered us an upgrade :-) it was like nothing was too much trouble for them.
When we checked out the guest manager paid us a visit to see if we had a lovely time, which was just lovely and felt very personal.
I think some of the big chain hotels yes I mean 5 star hotels could learn allot from the service from this hotel!

location - all the reviews will tell you how perfect it is, Piccadilly and Oxford/regent street is all walking distance, knightsbrige is a short bus/taxi ride or 1 tube stop. There are some lovely restaurants within 5 mins walk ie hakkasan / tamarind and the choice of restaurants  is great for all budgets. We had a meal at hakkasan and that was fantastic.
Green park station is 5mins walk, and there is a very small tesco metro 30seconds walk from the hotel if you want to buy anything ie snacks/drinks.

Would we book again - yes we decided we would come again even though we only live in west London! It's a great location for a night out and to stop over for a weekend, even with children!

I read allot of trip advisor reviews, but never posted one myself - the service in the hotel and the upgrade this weekend was worth the effort ....",5,2013,01,27
144,Amazing place to stay,Only spent one night before leaving for home - but an exceptional hotel.  The staff were exceptionally friendly and courteous. Held our luggage for the day whilst we shopped and nothing was a problem. Definitely would stay there again.,5,2013,01,27
144,Wonderful,"Wasn't sure what to expect as the reviews were varied and we got an EXTREMELY reasonable price online. But the hotel was wonderful. The location is unbeatable. IN the middle of Mayfair which is quiet but full of restaurants and in front of hte park. Buckingham Palace is literally a five minute walk. The staff is very, very accommodating, gracious and helpful. You feel immediately at home. We had two rooms. One was very spacious, the other not so, so we asked for a room change and were fortunate enough to get it. The property is quaint and it is old, so every room is different and not all are created equal. But as far as I could tell, they all have renovated, comfortable bathrooms and are lovely, clean and the decoration is tasteful and cozy.  If size is a concern, book a double room. I will definitely return. My one suggestion is INternet should be free in the rooms. This is a hotel with personality. If you're looking for the uniformity of a Marriot, it may not be for you.",5,2013,01,16
144,"Luxury, cozy, and personal",Stayed here in October 2012.  The room was very clean and warm.  Bathroom was spacious.  Luxury amenities. The staff was professional. The location of the hotel in Mayfair was quiet and safe. I am a single female traveler. I will stay here again on my return to London.,5,2013,01,12
144,The most memorable lift in any hotel in the world - but small rooms..,"I really enjoy The Flemings in Mayfair where I have stayed a couple of times when in London. 
It has a great atmosphere and a good location for exploring London so despite the small rooms I find it a very good stay and I can truly recommend it.

And it may have the most memorable lift in any hotel in the world ;-)",4,2013,01,10
144,Just like home....,"Visited Fleming's again 2 weeks ago for an 8 night stay. This was our 10th visit and we will be back again. From the moment you enter you feel welcome and cared for. The rooms, although a little on the small side by N.A. standards are cozy,comfortable and well appointed. The location can't be beat as a five minute walk takes you to Old Bond, Green Park Tube, Piccadilly Circus and much more. I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to any of my family and friends. My only beef is that they still charge for WIFI in the rooms....public areas have free wifi????? Anyway I am sure this will change in the future and i look forward to returning in June.",5,2013,01,09
144,Excellent stay,"Excellent stay - We booked two executive rooms at the hotel for Friday 4th January for my fathers birthday and from the website it looked like a very nice boutique hotel- We were not disappointed. 
The staff from the moment we arrived to the moment we left were excellent, they couldn’t do enough for you and were incredibly polite and obliging. I would certianly praise them all from the concierge, bar staff and breakfast staff. The rooms themselves (Executive Double) were a good size for a central London hotel and were tastefuly decorated. The beds themselves were huge.

We didn’t eat in the hotel but we did have a few cocktails which were well recommended by the bar staff and the bar area is a great place to sit and enjoy a few cocktails. As someone who lives in London and enjoys many a cocktail I would even come back here just for cocktails even if I wasnt staying here. 

The only downside was the breakfast which was disappointing  It was included in our room price but the English breakfast looked and tasted particularly unappetizing and I sent my eggs benedict back as they were hard boiled even though I specifically asked for runny eggs and there was a very watery non existent hollandaise. It was a saturday morning but here seemed to be too many guests compared to the members of staff and as hard as the staff tried they weren’t able to keep up with demand. One would have expected better levels at breakfast for what otherwise was a super hotel. We will certainly stay here again and recommend it. It would have been 5 green spots not 4 if the breakfast was better.",4,2013,01,09
144,Great location in central London - choose room carefully,"My wife and I stayed for a joint birthday weekend and to attend two functions in town. We had booked a ""three nights for two"" deal and a Junior Suite. We lasted one night in that (see tip on choosing a room below), then moved to the townhouse next door, to a much better room, even if it was smaller. What pleased us most was the way that the hotel dealt with our unhappiness. From Sabina who took our booking and checked us in, Pedro and Toy on the Concierge desk, and Daniel from Guest Services who met us and offered us the alternative rooms, all were all professional, friendly and helpful. The breakfast 'Grill' area lacks daylight but is well laid out, the WiFi is not good unless you pay for it (something the hotel should reconsider), but overall if you are careful with your booking, this hotel offers an excellent base when visiting Mayfair.",4,2013,01,09
144,GOOD VALUE IN MAYFAIR,"The hotel has been upgraded since I last stayed there and is better than ever with the property still having the same great location as it has enjoyed for a couple of centuries or more. Its right by St James Park. Decor is plush but intimate, the staff very helpful and cheering despite terrible weather, housekeeping is excellent and all in all its a great choice and if you shop around either thru SLH,the hotel itself, or some of the regular travel sites you should get an excellent rate. Combine this with a great choice of restaurants  on its doorstep in Shepherds Market and you have the perfect base for a great central location with excellent service that will make you feel really at home in this sprawling city. Langans and Le Boudin Blanc  are just two of the great dinner options close at hand....oh and the in room coffee service was much appreciated",4,2013,01,07
144,Very enjoyable,Recently enjoyed a weekend break in London. The hotel was recommended by friends .it was in a fantastic position .Staff very friendly nothing was too much trouble . The rooms  very well appointed everything we needed bed was comfortable . Breakfast was excellent very pleasant waiting on staff . All in all a lovely weekend we will hopefully return,5,2013,01,07
144,Pretty Darned Good,"Ideally situated, staff efficient and helpful. Room - perfectly adequate.
Restaurant - evening meal very good indeed - much better than far more expensive offerings I have experienced, breakfast first class.
Any criticism is nit-picking. Twist my arm and I would mention that the restaurant last orders are 10.30pm which is a tad early for post theatre but not at all unusual.
I thoroughly recommend Flemings.",5,2013,01,03
144,"Lovely, well located, but no elevator for the next month or so","Came over the new year holiday with a group of older travelers (Road Scholar, aka Elderhostel).  The room is small but lovely, the bathroom great, the beds, sheets, towels, amenities all good.  The buffet breakfast quite satisfactory.  BUT on New Year's day we received a notice that the elevator (yes, only one for the whole hotel, and no service elevator either) which was insufficient as it was for the numbers of people here, would go out of service on January 2 at 11 AM for weeks while a new elevator is installed.  Those on higher floors were offered a lower floor.  We are in a very quiet room facing an interior courtyard (thanks to prior reviews and a request) and chose to stay where we are, but that means climbing 4 flights of stairs from the lobby (and an additional flight from the restaurant which is below ground level) each time we needed to go to our room.  The organizers of our trip say they never would have booked the hotel if they had been told that we would spend a couple of days here with no elevator, but they were as surprised as we were.  As it was, the hotel needed more than one elevator.  Functioning with no elevator is unacceptable for some of our fellow travelers.",4,2013,01,03
144,Noisiest room ever.,"A one night stay was one night too many.    The room was small and the bathroom was tiny, this I could live with as it was for only one night.    Our room was next to the elevator which all night long continued to make a loud squeak and bang noise every couple of minutes, as the doors opened and closed.  To add to this every noise from the bath room above could be heard from the bath running, to the toilet flushing.  By the early hours I was packed and ready to leave the hotel as quickly as possible.  I would not have stayed in that room another night.  The reception staff apologised and promised me a better room next time!   Unfortunately I thought when booking this hotel a good room would be standard, obviously we were mislead.   A huge disappointment  and the worst night sleep we have ever experienced in a hotel.",1,2012,12,29
144,Anniversary Treat,"I spent a lot of time researching hotels in and around Mayfair for an anniversary treat and am so pleased we booked to stay at Flemings. The hotel staff were really welcoming and helpful. As SLH members we were given a complimentary room upgrade and the room was lovely and spacious. The breakfast was fantastic and set us up for the day. The location of the hotel was ideal for us - we went to see Wicked in Victoria, Winter Wonderland in Hyde Park and shopping on Regent Street. Although the tube is close to the hotel, we mostly went by foot. We will definitely be returning!",5,2012,12,29
144,Wonderful Christmas stay at Flemings,"This was our third or fourth stay at Flemings, and we were welcomed back like long-lost friends.  Stayed three nights before Christmas at a very special rate which included breakfast. Then, after a short visit to friends, we returned to Flemings for three days over Christmas.  The rate was even better!  Standard rooms are smallish, but beautifully appointed. Breakfast was excellent, and we were glad it was included because our usual breakfast places in Shepherd Market were closed for the holiday. Staff are always friendly and professional, and we will definitely return whenever we come to London.  Prices can shoot up in high season, but Christmas is an excellent time to enjoy all that Flemings has to offer.  It's like having our own home in Mayfair, and the location is superb.",5,2012,12,27
144,Fantastic xmas stay at Flemings!,"We have just returned from a one night stay at Flemings and had a great stay. The location is perfect - a 2 minute walk from Green Park Tube Station, a 5 minute walk from the Winter Wonderland at Hyde Park and a 10 minute walk from Oxford Street. We stayed to do a bit of Christmas shopping and to go to the Winter Wonderland which is a must at Christmas time! 

The room - we upgraded to a junior suite and it was well worth it! The room was spacious and the decor was quite modern which is the kind of thing that we like. We stayed in room 206 and it was really quiet.

Hotel and staff - The staff were very good; we dined in the restaurant for breakfast and the staff were very attentive. 

We thoroughly enjoyed our stay in London and will be staying at Flemings more often, I would recommend this hotel to everybody.",5,2012,12,23
144,comfort and location and value,"Not only is Flemings perfectly located for shopping & site seeing, the employees really do care that you have an exceptional stay there. This was my first taste of London, I arrived one day earlier than expected. The nice young man at the front desk and his supervisor arranged to change the booking for two nights and I was able to up-grade our room to a suite. The next day when my husband arrived, we were most confortable. There was free wi-fi in the Front Room off of the lobby, and the Concierges were very helpful with showing us how to connect. They also loaned us an electrical outlet adapters, gave me a personal lesson on working the TV remote, and ensured there was plenty of Krupps coffee! Every thing was first class and beautiful.",5,2012,12,22
144,"Excellant stay at Flemings, great atmosphere.","Our stay at Flemings was lovely, it was a last minute plan to go to London and so glad we did.  Staff where friendly and helpful the atmosphere of Flemings is very inviting and warm. The christmas decorations where lovely the decor of Flemings is impressive. Room was clean and comfortable. Lovely touch left for our 7 year old, little book and frog bubble bath and a note welcoming him to the hotel, also his own slippers and dressing gown which he loved. Great location we where able to walk everywhere. Can not wait to visit again.",5,2012,12,12
144,Good  but bad communication.,"We stayed at the Flemings Hotel for the night after my son's wedding. We were upgraded to an apartment as our rooms were not ready. The apartment was spacious and very nice, but the bedrooms themselves quite small, and there was no tea or coffee to be had. The hotel overall is nice but restaurant was small. There was a muck up with the breakfast arrangements as we were not told that our stay was only with buffet food and we ordered cooked food which we had to pay for. The staff were lovely and very helpful. Although I like the hotel I do think it is over priced.",4,2012,12,02
144,A Jewel in the Crown,"Situated in the heart of Mayfair the hotel is in prime position for tourism in and around Westminster and the City of London.  We had a fourth floor room overloking Half Moon Street, which can at times be rather busy with traffic, so being higher up kept the noise at an acceptable level.  The rooms are well equipped with all the items one expects at a four star hotel and the twin beds are of a generous size, providing an excellent nights sleep.
The min-bar prices are akin with most hotels, rather expensive and offer a very limited choice, and consequently I choose not to use them.  There's a Tesco Express nearby that offers a good range of beers and wine at sensible prices, no prizes for guessing where our drinks came from!
The hotel staff are charming and make you feel welcome and at ease, and there is no doubt we would look forward to our next visit to Fleming's and Mayfair.",5,2012,12,02
144,Lovely hotel in an excellent location,"My stay at the Flemings Mayfair Hotel in London was a pleasure. The double twin room was a good size, the amenities were very nice, the service was extremely friendly, and the location was spectacular.

Two slight glitches prevented this from being rated a 5 out of 5. First, I tried to edit my reservation on agoda.com (which I would NOT recommend) and the hotel declined to accommodate though it was not negatively impacting their revenues. Second, we tried to dine in the restaurant after drinks in the (very cool) bar, and were informed that they weren't seating any more diners b/c they were out of so many food items. (It was 8pm on a Monday night.)

Otherwise, it was stellar.",4,2012,11,24
144,Little Gem.,"We had the pleasure of staying at The Flemings Hotel for two nights.  The staff were very professional and so pleasant and polite.  Asking us how our stay was, and what we'd been up to.  We loved the eclectic decor, very glamorous and atmospheric.  Loved the black and white photographs in the hallways.  Our room was decorated in a similar style, which we liked.  The bathroom needed a fresh update, but didn't spoil our stay.  The bed was huge and comfortable.  The location of the Flemings is superb, very close to Mayfair village and round the corner from Green Park.  We will definitely return to this little gem.",5,2012,11,22
144,nice stay and excellent service at the Flemings Hotel,"Just came back from 5 days, 4 nights at the Flemings. The hotel was recommended to me by a friend and they treated us very well there. The concierge(s) helped set us up with restaurant reservations and airport transfers  as well as general advice.      

The room was very nice, although a bit small. Very relaxing environment and convenient location to Green Park and the tube. The staff was very friendly and welcoming.  

We didnt eat at the restaurant so cant share anything about their grill .The bar seemed to have fun drinks, although the decor was not really to my taste so we didnt spend much time there ..   

I would definitely come back for the service, and the nice room - and good value ( compared to other boutique hotels in the area.",4,2012,11,20
144,Great hotel due to the excellent staff!,"I spent two nights here and as a SLH member was upgraded to a really nice room despite belng a sole traveler. The staff, particularly Katie and John were attentive and charming and made me feel very welcome. I thought house keeping were a bit sloppy which was a shame as the furnishings in the room were of good quality. Breakfast was good  and the service though not as charming as reception staff was fine. Would absolutely recommend and look forward to returning. It is in a fabulous location! ",5,2012,11,19
144,What a rare experience ... the staff couldn't do enough for us!,"As an SLH member, I booked two twin rooms in Flemings for a ""girls' weekend"" with three girlfriends.  The aim of the weekend was simple: boutique hotel, shopping, cocktails, dinner & dancing.  Sadly the dinner & dancing didn't quite match up to the rest (see Kensington Rooftop Garden review!). Luckily though, Flemings ticked every box hoped for and then some!  From the moment we arrived on Saturday morning to our departure on Sunday afternoon, we were treated beautifully.  The staff is friendly and efficient and actually want to help you!! Upon arrival, we were offered an upgrade for the SLH membership.  The level of upgrade was a super surprise - we were given a beautiful two-bedroom apartment so that all four of us could stay together.  Before accepting the offer Katie, the lovely person who welcomed us, showed us around.  Then once check in was complete, we had another lovely gesture - a bottle of sparkling wine would be waiting for us in our apartment upon our return from shopping!!

The apartment was absolutely lovely and well-appointed.  Both bedrooms had their own bathroom & television and the kitchenette was well-equipped - including the extra milk requested by one of the girls!  The beds were very comfortable and the duvets luxurious.  I would suggest though that heavier curtains are hung in the bedrooms as we were woken at daylight because the blinds are too light.  Also, a shelf for your own products and another towel rail would be useful in the bathroom… little things though given the otherwise perfection of our stay.

Everyone we met was lovely but special mention absolutely has to go to Katie.  Thanks to her our weekend was even better!! Thanks Katie:-))

Definitely a hotel I intend to return to with either friends or family and a hotel I can only highly recommend!",5,2012,11,19
144,Smart Boutique hotel,"A small and slightly quirky Mayfair hotel - well situated, nicely appointed and decorated throughout.   A small room (standard double) with what felt like a really small double bed, but very well equipped with everything you could need for a couple of nights' stay.  Surprisingly quiet too  for a central London hotel but it was so incredibly hot in the room even with the windows open.  Good breakfast selection with an extensive choice on the buffet table.  Certainly a hotel to remember for another occasion and to recommend to others.",4,2012,11,18
144,Another great SLH property!,"We stayed at Flemings for a couple nights at the beginning of a trip across the UK.  Its in a fantastic location for seeing all of the sites.  A quaint little hotel, with a lot of style.  Staff was superb.  At first our AC didn't work and the management sent someone in with in minutes and fixed it.  I always look for SLH (Small Luxury Hotels) properties when traveling and Flemings didn't disappoint.",5,2012,11,16
144,Great Location,"Have stayed here before and it was great to be back. The service from all staff was excellent and welcoming. The rooms, although small, were well appointed. We did not eat in the hotel but it is in a great location in Mayfair and handy for shops and other attractions. Would definitely return since it is very good value for money.",4,2012,11,16
144,Mayfair Comfort and Convenience,There are london hotels and then there are good London hotels and for my money this is one of the best.Situated just round the corner from the tube station serving Heathrow it is convenient and close to all the inner london Galleries and theatres.Have stayed here many times on business and always found the service good and breakfasts good,4,2012,11,14
144,Location,"We chose the hotel primarily on price and location and were very happy with the result. The quarters were somewhat cramped, but, after all, it is the second oldest hotel in London and that is an expected part of the charm. I'd visit again.",4,2012,11,13
144,Disappointed,"Our room was not up to the standard of the public areas ,it was very old an dreary not the image I was sold and shown on there website.the reastarant was not very nice for a five stare hotel.the staff where nice but had to much to do and the food looked better than it tasted.i was very disappointed as i had asked for a nice table as it was my partners birthday they tryed to put us on a table squeesed in between two other couples  it was like sitting at at mc donalds so we ended up in the middle of the restaurant which was not much better. The only good thing was the bed it was very comfortable and we slept well.",3,2012,11,12
144,A special trip to London and a wonderful hotel!,"Our trip to London this last week was particularly special as it was to attend an Investiture at Buckingham Palace.  I had picked this hotel on the recommendation of a London cabbie during an earlier visit and he was bang on.  From my first contact with Flemings the service was outstanding and this did not diminish at any point. On arrival we found check-in swift and easy and were delighted to receive an upgrade to an apartment. The hotel consists of six former Georgian houses so it might appear a bit of trek through the hallways but this is part of the charm. Our apartment was terrific and very spacious. The furnishing and decor were great and the huge bed with its quality sheets and superb pillows a delight to sleep in. 
The location on Half Moon Street is perfect; not too busy but just steps away from the main road of Piccadilly. In the other direction is Curzon Street and the delightful Shepherds Market with its choice of restaurants and great pubs; the sort of place tourists seem to miss, fortunately. For gentlemen seeking that extra special attention G F Trumpers on Curzon Street is the place for a shave! The hotel has an arrangement with a car park on South Audley Street, just a short distance away, for a 50% reduction on costs (£20 per 24 hours rather than £40).
For those staying in an apartment there is a separate entrance from Clarges Street which is very convenient. All the staff we encountered were terrific and made an extra special effort to ensure we enjoyed our stay. They provided a package of fun items for our 10 year old daughter and hot chocolate and shortbread for her in the evening. You have our grateful thanks for making our stay so memorable
There are a host of places to stay in London; one has to decide on location and then pick the best one can afford. Mayfair is a great place, steeped with history and style and Flemings offers real value. It is highly recommended.",5,2012,11,10
144,Can not recommend this hotel,"I am staying in London on a regular base, the stay in Flemings has been for the first and last time.
The check in was already very slow and when I came to my room, I was very disappointed, especially when you relate the standard of the room to the price paid per night (400 Pound per night with breakfast!) The room was located just behind the reception area on the hallway to the restaurant which is used as breakfast room, very noisy and no view.",3,2012,11,09
144,Coming Home!,"I have stayed at Flemings many times over the last years - and I did again in October.   I arrived late in the evening, received a great room and help on setting up internet connection.   I could not have felt more at home!   And besides the location is perfect!",5,2012,11,08
144,weekend in london,"we booked through""secret hotels"" and we were highly delighted with our hotel allocation.I was aliitle concerned with some of the reviews and a telephone call and an e mail ressured me that we had got a great deal.On arrival we were delighted with the location in central Mayfair the staff the decor. the quirkiness of the hotel includes some stairs which we could easily manage but it may be best to check.The weather was great the room was very comfortable although the""classic"" double was quite small ,however we had a great stay",5,2012,11,07
144,week end break,well worth the effort and cost - attention to detail - staff could not do enough - all you would expect at a mayfair establishment ------- just be aware that the bar costs are really well above average,5,2012,11,06
144,A tale of two halves,"Whether we caught the hotel at a bad time, I'm not sure as it didn't live up to the reviews on here. We had researched many 4 and 5 start hotels and was looking forward to our stay.
I will list the good points first.
1. Good location, literally minutes from everything central in London.
2. Stunning decor.
3. The Grill was great, we had a lovely waiter care for us.
4. The room was clean.
Okay, now for the less hot parts.
1. On arrival, the manager was dealing with a family unhappy with their booking right in the entrance, it was getting a little heated and made us feel uncomfortable; I would have thought it better to do this aside from receprion.
2. Our room was down the road in a separate part to the hotel, hence we really did not feel part of the hotel. It was also up several flights of stairs...we are able and fit, but if disabled, would have proved tricky with no acces to a lift.
3. The front door to our block was a security keypad. They changed the number without telling us so had to ask for assistance. Then it broke down, we had to ask then each time to be let in.
4. We had no heating. The bathroom was freezing. We asked twice during the 3 days and was advised maintenance would see to it, then that they had left. With marble surrounds and floors, it was very chilly.
5. The hospitality tray consisted of a jar of instant nescafe sachets, breakfast tea sachets, green tea and sugar sachets. This is the worst tray I have found in all my travels. The mini bar was extortionate...AVOID.
6. The classic rooms are small. We heard everyone's business, our neighbour vomiting and the couple below.....
7. Some staff could not understand our requests due to poor command of English, hence we had wrong drinks, mix ups at breakfast.
8. The music throughout is quite loud and not peaceful, this probaly didn't help communications.
9. Breakfast is expensive, £16 for continental. I ordered coffee, after 15 mins, I had to remind them; my porridge was cold and it was self serve, no different to a standard chain hotel.
10. Our friend departed from the hotel having dined with us and presented reception with a ticket for his jacket as all the staff had left the restaurant. The reception asked if he was collecting laundry and had no idea of where his coat was.
All in all, if you stay here, the Grill is great for an evening meal, otherwise, eat at Shepherds Market a few paces up the road where there is a plethara of little bistro's, cafes, indians etc; avoid the overpriced and tasteless breakfst, upgrade to a bigger room, ask if you are in the separate building if you have mobility difficulties, and finally, try and get it on a deal.
We will not return, having stayed in better 4 stars.",3,2012,11,04
144,"Bang in the middle of it all. Smart, comfortable place to stop in London.","Walk out of the front door and start sightseeing.
Tube and most other facilities close at hand.
Great place to come back to.
Only negatives were; a bit of early morning street noise (which a country boy like myself isn't used to), and a very expensive breakfast (so i chose instead to walk 50m to an excellent early morning cafe for a less expensive repast).",4,2012,11,02
144,Lovely welcome.,"This is not the first time we visited The Flemings, and it was very nice to be remembered by the Concierge staff. They made us feel at home. I love the decor and ambiance of this Hotel, it feels warm; and it is very nice to see such a well kept Hotel. Our room was a bit small, which in London is not something out of the common, but this is compensated by the rest of the experience.
Another thing I love about The Flemings is its location. If you go out walking you can find cafés, restaurants, or just a beautiful place to have a nice and relaxing walk.
We would go back whenever we can.",5,2012,10,30
144,Charming hotel in Mayfair,"First ever stay at Flemings and was more than pleased with the hotel. Large room with lounge and very large comfortable bed. Check in was swift and efficient with a brief tour of the facilities and then shown to room. Large bed and excellent bathroom with all mod-cons. The Hotel is in a terrific location with Green Park and Underground Station just around the corner. Also around the corner we found some great places to eat and checked out Shepherds Market just off Curzon Street. The area is busy, but very quiet at night and you are just a short walk to Piccadilly and the West End, but with the Tube just around the corner you are never far from anywhere.
The lounge at the hotel is like an oasis in the heart of London. Would certainly return to this great hotel.",5,2012,10,30
144,Avoid at all costs,"We stayed here for 8 nights and have had one of the worst experiences at a hotel anywhere. We are seasoned travellers and stay in a range of hotels. 
We expected a luxury room as advertised on their website but you need to be aware that there are grades of rooms within this category and this is not clear. Imagine two women checking in that have booked a double room and the male staff member then insists that you have a twin room-this happened at least twice and this is the only place this has occurred for a long time.
Imagine a small box that has a double bed and the room is so small that only one of you can move between the end of the bed and the television. The airconditioner is on in the room when we enter and we wonder why. The room is next to the lift which when the door opens and closes there is about a 30 second long noise each time the door opens which sounds like something coming through the wall at you. At 4am I could no longer take this and asked for another room. We packed up and went out for the day. We go to reception and are told again you need a twin room which we decline. 
We are then allocated a disabled room, close to the lift again, much larger and very dark (I do have photos of this and the view). In fact you need the lights on all the time because of course there is a large machine that hums continually day and night outside the window (which is able to be opened) but the noise is unbearable. In this room you require the air-conditioner on at 19 degrees because it is so hot and you sleep on top of the bed because you cannot bear the noise of the air-conditioner on at night.
When then gave up on changing rooms as it was obvious nothing would be done apart from an apology. When I did discuss our issues with the room with reception staff they apologised and apologised but did nothing. They are obviously trained to listen and then just apologise.
The door staff were very friendly. The location of the hotel is great but there is a good selection of hotels in the area that offer better value and service. The money has has gone into making the ground floor look fabulous and not into guest services. The lift is old and the carpets very tired. We had breakfast on our last day and the service was very good. Because our experience was so terrible with the room we did not want to spend any money in this hotel s o we ate at Shepherds Market and several other places. We were disapointed about this but could not enjoy ourselves due to our disapointing experience.
Overall we would not recommend this hotel or stay there again.",1,2012,10,29
144,Outstanding return visit,"We spent three nights at the hotel in a lovely suite/apt 701 a bedroom large L shaped lounge with dining area and eat in kitchen. This was a return trip to celebrate my daughters ninth birthday and yet again this hotel lived up to our expectations from the thoughtful surprise birthday cupcake s that were ready and waiting in our suite to a the hotel arranginging a midnight night dash to an all night pharmacy when my daughter was sick  to pick up medicine. As before I noticed the way the staff remembered preferences and acted they know I drink tea with lemon and it automatically arrives without prompts , the doormen  greet by name , and the reception staff are marvellous. The location of the hotel is excellent especially for a single mum young daughter combo, it's a stones throw to green park, the quaint shepherds market is around the corner and the area is well lit and feels very safe. Thanks for a wonderful stay and for making my daughters birthday treat a memorable and lasting impression.",5,2012,10,26
144,Jewel in Mayfair,"Friendly staff welcomed us and showed us our room to make sure we liked it. Classic double is not very big but big enough for couple of nights. This hotel looks as if it has been recently refurbished but still retains the character of times gone by. All very modern bedrooms and bathrooms and Internet connection - free in public areas. It is absolutely great for location - less than 5 minutes walk from underground, Green Park and Picadilly.",5,2012,10,25
144,RESTAURANT REVIEW,"Just a few minutes away from the hustle and bustle of Leicester square/ Picadilly circus is Fleming's subterreanean bar/grill; an oasis of calm. My daughter and i dined at Fleming's restaurant on a TravelZoo deal of £55 for 5 course dinner and champagne cocktails for 2. A seriously excellent VFM deal - i would have happily paid the full menu price for this quality of food and service and for London prices was very reasonable. Food was delicious in every aspect and there were no restriction to the menu choices with the offer. Service was polite, friendly and efficient. The bar and restaurant decor and furnishings were crisp, classy with a hint of understated opulence. My only niggle was that there wasn't much fizziness in our cocktails and i wondered how long the bottle had been open for. Apart from that a truly lovely dining experience and i shall certainly return next time in London.",5,2012,10,24
144,Afternoon tea at Flemings Hotel,"We recently went to Flemings Hotel for afternoon tea for my sister’s birthday and just wanted to say what a lovely experience we had. The dining room itself is warm and very cosy, perfect for this time of year.  I’ve been for quite a few afternoon teas over the years, but this was by far the best. The staff were very attentive and even brought out a surprise birthday cupcake and sang happy birthday with us! Overall I would highly recommend it and would definitely go there again for another special occasion.",5,2012,10,24
144,OUR NEW FIND IN MAYFAIR,Our first stay at this gem of a hotel.  From arriving until we left everyone we came in contact with was so friendly and helpful.  Feel as if we know them all now! Our room was very clean and extremely comfortable. The variety of choice for breakfast was more than adquate and very nicely cooked and presented.  There were some lovely personal touches for a celebration we had whilst there which was appreciated. To sum up already planning our visit for next year!,5,2012,10,18
144,A Mayfair Find!,We were looking for a hotel at a sensible price and came across Flemings via a search engine. The price was very reasonable so we booked for a Friday night. The welcome was warm and the room - on the ground floor -was clean and tidy with all you would expect in a 5* hotel. A really comfortable bed completed the package. The staff were friendly and helpful and we will definitely return.,5,2012,10,17
144,Nice Hotel needs a little more attention to detail,"For the Price you are paying it is a fantastic location, easy for taxi's to the theatre.  This hotel is very stylish and I have to say the best pillows could not fault the bed,  But did not like the hairs we found on the duvet.  But worse was to come,  when I went into the bathroom,  i found a big clumb of black hair on the floor not talking one or two strands, Picked up with tissue and asked them to please clean the bathroom as it was not done properly the first time round.  

I have stayed all over the world and in some beautiful hotels and have got to say, please can we have a better selection of Tea.  

Would stay here again,  but dont select the special offers as they seem to give you the double rooms on the ground floor with no window out only into a shaft with extractor tubes in it.",3,2012,10,08
144,Very good experience,"I stayed two nights in business and everything was very good. Nicely decorated, very nice bar (even in the cellar), friendly staff and great location. Less than few minutes from Green Park station, Piccadilly and Hyde Park around the corner. Only two small things were bothering: aircon device was very loud (luckily no need for that) and windows facing the Half Moon street let all the noise though (I think this is more to do with English standard of construction). Fortunately there was not much traffic during the night. I will come back.",4,2012,10,08
144,Better than Average London Hotel,I have stayed at Flemings a number of times over the last year and would always stay here out of choice. The staff are all always friendly and helpful and the hotel has a nice atmosphere and feel to it. Some of the rooms can be a bit small and as it is in a street backing on to other buildings dont expect any views ! The rooms at the front can be a bit noisy on days when rubbish is collected early in the mornings,4,2012,10,08
144,"Great hotel, lovely stay!","Just returned from a girlie night away at the Flemings Hotel and Apartments.  Great place to stop, staff were very attentive, friendly and listened to our needs.  On arrival, we were upgraded to a 3 bedroom apartment which was excellent, plenty of space, very clean, everything we needed.  One small downside was the traffic noise in the front bedrooms, could do with some sound-proofing.
Overall a really nice place to stay with friends, family or as a couple.",5,2012,10,08
144,Lovely little find.,"We have just returned from a one night stay in London staying at the Flemings.  We only needed a quick overnight stay as we were meeting friends and didn't intend to spend much time in our hotel. We chose Flemings through a quick internet search because it was conveniently located and was less money than quite a lot of other Hotels in the area.  We were so pleasantly surprised. It's a lovely little hotel. A real gem of a find.  All of the staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful.  The room, although small, was beautifully furnished and spotlessly clean. We didn't eat in the hotel but the restaurant looked lovely, all sparkly glass and mirrors.  The bar was gorgeous - dark, glamorous and slightly gothic with a lovely list of cocktails - violet moon (vodka, champagne, violet liquor and fresh raspberries) was particularly delicious.  A really pleasant stay and we will definately be returning whenever we need a London hotel. Might even find an excuse just to stay here.",5,2012,10,08
144,"Cool, stylish, compact","I rarely stay in hotels in London, but this place feels like a bit of an exception.  It is stylish, friendly and cool all at the same time.  Can't put my finger on why it is better than bigger hotels; but the place has a cheeky, youthful buzz that the chains cannot really match.",5,2012,10,03
144,Anniversary Celebration,"Cannot fault our stay at Flemings for the first but not the last time. Highly recommend this hotel for its comfort, service and location.  The staff are extremely helpful and friendly and the food is excellent.",5,2012,10,03
144,Service is impecable and rooms are small,"Service is impeccable and rooms are small
We stayed at the Flemming’s hotel over one weekend in September 2012. We had three rooms in the hotel, two on the second floor and one on the forth. 
The rooms were very small with barley room to turn around the bed, in comparison, the bathroom was really big. This observation is applicable to all three rooms. 
The bedding was great and we slept very well, the blinds do not obscure the light but if you are lucky to have curtains you should be fine. Be sure to ask for a room with curtains as there are rooms without. 
The location of this hotel is everything. You are very close to everything, ranging from the Mall to pubs and restaurant. I would greatly recommend this place as we were treated with great care and nice people.",4,2012,10,01
144,Brilliant find,"My wife and I have stayed in many London Hotels but never in this area. Spent two nights here and loved it. Wonderful quiet road with no noise at night, even with the windows open. The staff were superb, extremely helpful and friendly. We had a room on the top floor which was smaller than some we've had but still very well appointed and decorated. Only minor quibble from me that at 6'2"" the shower head was much to low for me! My 5'0"" wife did not have an issue though! 
Wonderful breakfast, staff here again quite exemplary.
After dinner out in London with our two grown up sons we all decamped back to the bar here for cocktails. Superb evening in an astonishing setting, brilliant cocktails to boot.
From a touristy angle, a quick walk across Green Park brings you out at Buckingham Palace, probably only a 10 minute walk away. Fortum and Mason just down the road if you're feeling particularly flush! Great hotel.",5,2012,09,30
144,Business meeting,I stumbled across this boutique hotel after visiting the Hilton hotel opposite. I was looking for somewhere to hold a canapes and drinks reception and as soon as i entered this hotel and saw 'The Front Room' i knew this was the place. Very friendly and helpful staff from the concierge right through to receptionist and servers. They have great boardroom style meeting rooms too with natural daylight which seems somewhat limited in most places I visited. Thanks to Colin Exton and his team!,5,2012,09,27
144,Perfect birthday weekend!,I took my partner to the Flemings as part of his 40th birthday celebrations and had a fantastic stay. Every little detail was taken care of without having to ask and the staff could not do enough for us. The room was lovely and the bed was so comfortable. Cocktails in the bar were exquisite and a great breakfast in the morning. I would thoroughly recomend this hotel and will certainly be looking for any excuse to stay there again soon!,5,2012,09,24
144,Lovely London Visit,"Found this hotel on the internet as wanted a Mayfair hotel. After having found it got the best price through Superbreak. On arrival, everyone very polite and extremely happy to help. Room had everything you would need, but of a size you would expect. Very well appointed and comfy beds with lovely linen. Very handy for Buckingham Palace visit, Bond Street and Fortnum and Mason. Full breakfast included, great food and service.Would definitely stay again  and no hesitation in recommending it to anyone. Only downside - no free wi-fi, that's all.",5,2012,09,23
144,Outstanding stay,"I discovered Flemings Mayfair through the Small Luxury Hotels of the World web site and stayed there with my mother while on holiday in London for a week in September. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The Flemings is in an excellent neighborhood and convenient to numerous restaurants, Green and Hyde Parks, and the Green Park Underground. The staff at Flemings was very helpful and friendly, especially the concierge members. Our room was comfortable, clean, and remarkably quiet. I will definitely stay there again when I am next in London.",5,2012,09,21
144,a fabulous lunch and a great deal,"booked a special lunch deal ,and it was fantastic.lovely dining area very plush,a warm welcome and attentive staff.not a great choice but what we had was well cooked and very tasty,canapes,followed by salmon,then steak and lemon posset,and a glass of wine all for under 25.00 per person.well worth it.",5,2012,09,21
144,Beyond Excellence,"I have stayed in many hotels BUT I stay regularly at Flemings in Mayfair. Why? There are plenty of hotels in the area but my office is close by and the service is beyond special. I am treated as a member of their team, nothing is too much. Comfortable, home comforts, excellent food particularly the breakfasts and the service is exceptional. The customer service team goes beyond expectations. Even if I have had minor problems they have rectified them immediately. Stay and experience it for yourself, you won't be disappointed.",5,2012,09,19
144,Stunningly Glamorous,"Having frequented Flemings on several occasions, I decided to hold my wedding reception there on September 4th 2012. From the word go, the attention to detail was outstanding. The whole day from start to finish was utter decadence, from the Bridal suite to beautiful flowers, amazing wines, champers, food and a wedding cupcake tower to die for.The staff were incredible, especially Colin, who made everything effortless and a pure joy for me, the groom and all the guests. I always wanted a sophisticated wedding, but never in my wildest dreams did I imagine such elegance and style. Thank you Flemings",5,2012,09,17
144,It never fails to impress,"I stayed at Flemings for 3 nights the end of May.This was a return visit for me after having an enjoyable stay in 2009.First of all nothing changes here ,the staff are so accomodating and seem to enjoy helping you in whatever your needs are.I have yet to meet a grumpy employee and thats important .They were having a heat wave in the UK in May, temperatures in the mid 80's high humidity ,so it was so nice to find our room airconditioned ,this is very unique for the UK, in the two weeks in the UK I did not stay at any place that had AC.The room was outstanding, spacious ,well appointed and a real bathroom with a tub ,nothing like a soak after trudging around for hours .One thing I have noted about bath tubs in England ,they are narrow and deep  ,not being a mountain goat I had great difficulty getting out ,this was prevelant all over the UK.I wonder if there might be some money to be made selling the Brits American style tubs ,probably not, the English are very set in their ways and are not much into change.
Breakfast here is amazing ,the best breakfast we had in 2 weeks ,I loved the artisan breads that were so delicious ,the juices, all the different style eggs you could order and meats, I give Flemings an A+ for breakfasts ,we also had dinner once which was quite good .We found a nice Italian restaurant just around the corner called Tempo ,that was an outstanding meal , different for what we call Italian at home ,just loved it.
When we got ready to leave Fleminds, the staff had transportation waiting to take us to Heathrow .I must say whoever manages this hotel really know their stuff ,everything is just so ,and you leave very satisfied with everything .I never saw my bill since my daughter a travel agent had treated us to this hotel ,so I can't comment ,but I bet it wasn't cheap .Again the location is so central ,Green Park across the street ,the subway ,Buckinham Palace ,we really enjoyed our stay.",5,2012,09,16
144,What an amazing hidden gem in the heart of Mayfair!,"I searched for weeks for a reasonably priced hotel in Mayfair for my sisters 50th birthday, so hard to find in the heart of Mayfair.  This lovely boutique hotel was amazing from the minute I booked, until we walked out of the door the next day.  I e mailed the hotel to say we would be arriving early and could we store our lugguage until our room was available, and I requested a room on the 3rd/4th floor after reading previous reviews. They replied immediately, and when we arrived at 12 o,clock they had our room ready for us.  I had booked an executive twin room, and we were on the 3rd floor room 327 as requested, and it didn't disappoint. The room was very spacious, 2 queen size beds with 4 lovely pillows each, and oh such a comfortable bed.  It was a lovely quiet room too.  Bathroom was lovely too.  A lovely little touch in our room was a plate with Happy Birthday piped in chocolate and 2 amazing cupcakes!  I booked a package, Saturday night in an executive room with full English breakfast, a 3 course meal and a bottle of wine £279, what great value!  The staff were friendly and helpful from start to finish, not pretentious.  I could not fault this hotel in any way.  I know this is a long review, but I'm very fussy and felt that this hotel deserved the praise due.  Had an amazing weekend and cannot wait to go back to this lovely hotel.",5,2012,09,16
144,Great Hotel!,"I stayed in this hotel with my mom for my graduation trip. It was so nice! The staff were so helpful and the location was amazing! We were close to the London Underground and within walking distance of Buckingham Palace. Our room was very spacious. Which I was surprised by, because I had been told the rooms  in most London hotels tend to be small. We had a king size bed and a large sitting are in our room. I have nothing but good things to say about this hotel! Hoping to get to go back again and stay a little bit longer this time. (P.S. It says that I traveled in October 2011.. but I traveled in July 2011 it just won't let me select it.)",5,2012,09,14
144,good hotel with friendly staff,"We spent few days in this nice hotel in the heart of London. Great and nicely designed rooms, super friendly staff, the always smiling girl at the reception tried her best to accomodate our needs, i would suggest the hotel to friends.",4,2012,09,13
144,Excellent all round service,"Location: My girlfriend and I were visiting London for a one night stay to watch a West End show. The hotel is conveniently located, within short walking distance to the easily accessible Green Park tube station.  An afternoon in Knightsbridge and Harrods was a breeze being just two tube stops away. An evening in Covent Garden and at the Lyceum was just as simple, being two tube stops the other way. We were also able to walk to New Bond Street and along Regent Street and Savile Row the following morning to visit the plethora of shops.  The Halycon Gallery, with its Warhol displays, comes highly recommended.

Hotel: The hotel and its excellent staff were faultless. We arrived prior to the 2pm check-in time but were able to go to our room immediately. The concierge had taken our bags before we even entered the building. Having booked a Junior Suite, we were upgraded to the Dickens Apartment on arrival, which was not requested but was a very generous offer.

The concierge showed us to our room, stopping to point out the bar and how to access the private entrance to the apartment block. The attention to detail was excellent.

The apartment itself was stunning.  A convenient kitchen, which we did not use but was generously stocked and would be ideal for anyone not planning on eating out. A beautiful lounge with glass dining table, double sofa, swivel chair, writing desk, fire place and a widescreen TV.  There was a good selection of magazines and the chandelier is a very nice feature. The main bathroom is decorated to a good standard, with an excellent shower. The smaller bathroom is just an added bonus! The bedroom boasts a second wall-mounted TV and a very comfortable King sized bed. My girlfriend was particularly impressed with the added space with very roomy wardrobes and a dressing table. Although we didn't use them, the apartment also had a trouser press, iron, bath robes, slippers, a hair dryer, a safe, etc. Basically, everything you can imagine!

We checked out at 11am and were able to leave our bags in the hotel free of charge until mid-afternoon to allow us to shop hands free and catch a later train.

The staff are highly attentive and it is clear that no request would be too much for them to meet.

Certainly the best hotel I have stayed at in London.",5,2012,09,11
144,"Cosy hotel, great staff, great location, child friendly","The room was decorated modernly and with good taste, confortable and had a very good size to acommodate our son in a sofa bed. The staff is very nice and the whole hotel dedicates attention to children (we loved the detail of milk and cookies delivered in the room at bed time, as well as the story book and all the other amenities). The breakfast was very good, with pancakes and scrambled eggs cooked at the moment. The location is excellente though quite (few meters from Picadilly Street and the GreenPark subway station - almost in front of Ritz hotel). 
Overall a very good experience that we would recomend to our friends.",5,2012,09,11
144,Go for a bigger room,"We were looking for a hotel that was walking distance from The Criterion Theatre and Quaglinos and Flemings is definitely it. A very good conversion of a terrace of houses (Georgian?) and the service is really excellent. They couldn't do too much for us. Our one complaint was that the double room we had was too small. We were offered alternatives and I'm sure they would have been more to our liking, but we'd unpacked and were half way through a bottle of champagne and were only there one night anyway, so decided to stay where we were....
Very good room rates, particularly bearing in mind the location, and the inclusive breakfast sets you up well for a day of walking (we did the National Gallery, London Eye and Festival Hall on the day after the theatre).
When you're next in London, give Flemings a go. you won't regret it.",4,2012,09,11
144,Bah. A bit of a nightmare.,"Moved to this hotel from the Metropolitan to save some money.  My PA booked me in a Single room.  What a nightmare.  It was like staying in a closet.  The room is reasonably well appointed, apart for the fact that it's tiny and the shower splashes water all over the floor.  Wifi is free but is ridiculously slow.  All in all, a pretty crappy experience for me.  I think the price paid was more or less reasonable all things considered, but its still a pretty crummy, cheesy hotel.  Staff is pretty nice though, so there's a plus.  You can hear every word being said in the hallways and the rooms are right on the street, too.  Not very private.",2,2012,09,10
144,Just had the pleasure of another stay at Flemings.,"This was the second visit that we've had to Flemings and were yet again amazed by almost every aspect of this hotel. From the greeting at the front door to the decor of the rooms, the quality of this place is second to none. The location is fantastic, so after a lovely stroll round some of London's finest landmarks we retreated back to an absolutely faultless evening meal. The food was delightful and the staff extremely knowledgable and professional. Already planning our next trip.",5,2012,09,02
144,Excellent Return to This Fine Property With Great Staff,"Although every aspect of my 2-night stay was pleasant, as it has been consistently over the past 10 years or so that this hotel has been my home away from home in London, it is particularly the staff and their can-do, friendly style I appreciate.  Smaller hotels of this range and excellence do not grow on trees.  Constant reinvestment in the property is one feature of its formula for success, but the other is hiring the right people who enjoy working there and looking after guests.  Bravo!",5,2012,09,01
144,Do not accept a ground floor room.,"I booked an Executive room but was told I was to be upgraded to a junior suite. This was on the ground floor, had no window or natural light and was dark. I refused the room but was told there were no Executive rooms available. I was shown two other suites on the ground floor and reluctantly accepted one. I later realised the underground ran underneath. The next day I complained and was given a suite in the adjoining town house which was excellent.",4,2012,08,30
144,Still the best in Mayfair,"Back again in Flemings for our forth visit & we are still as keen as ever on this hotel. We enjoy the exceptional staff who are so welcoming and attentive, the situation; across the road to Green Park & St James's Park, left up Picaddilly Road to Regent Street, Oxford Street & theatre land and  right to Hyde Park, Museums & Harrods   All walkable. 
Didn't eat a main meal ths time in Flemings but our breakfast was excellent, served once again with great service & presentation   
Thanks Flemings, look forward to my return.",5,2012,08,28
144,9 days of excellence,After much research chose this hotel.  We traveled with our 13 year old grandson so things were a little tight but compared to other rooms in London it was more than adequate. The entire staff was most courteous and helpful. Location is perfect! I hope not too many people had the same experience or else we won't be able to get a room!!,5,2012,08,26
144,An excellent holet,"My wife and I stayed at Flemings for two nights August 16 & 17, 2012 (room 203). We have previously stayed at this hotel in room 207 which was large with a large bathroom. But there was a bit of traffic noise from the street. This time we were given room 203 which was smaller but faced inwards but was very quiet . . . . . a bonus for a London hotel !

We found the hotel to be an excellent choice, in a good location. It is located in a quiet side street close to Green Park tube station, over the road from Green Park (a short walk through the park to Buckingham Palace), West End in fact very central for everything.

ALL the staff we caame into contact with were extremely pleasent and helpful, the food was excellent. The breakfast selection was good and was plated nicely, rather than simply being plonked on the plate as usual breakfasts are!

These two nights were to celebrate our 43rd wedding anniversary - so thank you Branca Sabbagh for making it a bit special!

We would definately stay here again, without a doubt.",5,2012,08,24
144,Another excellent stay at Flemings,"I've come to this charming, boutique hotel multiple times and have always had an excellent experience. The location is perfect - just off Green Park at Picadilly, walking distance to the major attractions, Shepherd Market just around the corner. The staff are always helpful, and the public areas have been refreshed since our last visit. Highly recommended.",5,2012,08,23
144,Great London Hotel,"This was our last hotel on our holiday and we were not let down.
Serivce from start to finish was great from the porter to housemade to the reception staff.
The bed was nearly as nice as my new king size bed at home. It was a great nights sleep. Bathroom was great with a great shower.
Food was nice but a little over priced.
Room service food needs alot of work.
Great stay thank you.

144,Lovely updated hotel in great location,"My husband and I first stayed here a few times almost 20 years ago. Liked it then for the location--in fabulous Mayfair, just off Piccadilly and 3 blocks from the Green Street Metro station. It was nice then, and even better now (we stayed there in late May). The updated decor was bright and beautiful. We love the meandering hallways and tiny nooks that give the hotel such a comfortable flair. The staff--from the front desk to housekeeping--was highly professional and welcoming. We had a large lovely room with comfortable furniture. I could have slept in that bed forever. The only quibble we had was the room was in back so that while it was lovely, it got no real light or view through the pretty stained glass window. But since we spent little time there during the day, this wasn't a bother. It might be for those planning to spend more time during the day so check this out. We will definitely go back.",5,2012,08,20
144,Couldn't ask for any more,"Stayed here for one night for my birthday.  On reflection - not long enough !!  On arrival, the staff were welcoming and helpful and this continued throughout, nothing was too much trouble.  The hotel is clean and has all amenities needed.  The location is perfect to explore, shop and relax - everything is accessible.  Well done to 'the team' of staff at the hotel.  I'm already planning another trip for Autumn for my partner's birthday !!",5,2012,08,20
144,A Real Gem in the Heart of London,"This place is just off Piccadilly: fantastic central location. Although the rooms rates are advertised as starting at GBP 245, you can get one for 150. Perfect for a business trip, or a quiet romantic weekend. The rooms are clean, the staff polite and helpful, the beds extremely comfortable. What more could you want?",4,2012,08,18
144,comfort in LONDON,i stayed with my wife at Flemings. This was my wife's first trip to London. The staff was so helpful to guide us on every aspect be it .. food or touring ..they were absolutely fabulous. The decor/location of hotel is very convenient. In just 3 days we felt part of the hotel..that speaks a lot in itself.,4,2012,07,30
144,Fabulous Hotel made us feel very welcome and special,"2 close friends and 1 went to the Fleming Hotel just for an overnight stay as part of our friends 40th birthday celebrations - the hotel is beautiful the decor in the public rooms is stunning. The breakfast was very good and most importantly the staff were excellent. Extremely helpful both with regards to the hotel and local knowledge.

We shared a room the beds were very comfortable, very long bath so great for anyone who is over 6ft tall! Lovely power shower too.

We were delighted to discover a bottle of wine and cup cakes to celebrate my friends 40th.

Very helpful with looking after our luggage as we arrived early in the day and then they also looked after it once we had checked out.

5mins walk across the park to Buckingham Palace! Great location.

Would defo recommend this hotel to friends - especially as a lovely treat.",5,2012,07,29
144,Great,Many compliments for Flemings Hotel located in a great location in front of Green Park 5 minutes to walk to the Metro. Equipped with a good service in the complex it offers magnificent rooms with a luxurious interior spaces and an excellent bar service. The staff is always at your disposals and very competent. Arrived two friday ago in the late night we were greeted by a young girl smiling that made us feel right at home.,5,2012,07,23
144,'Fabulous' Flemings,"I stayed at Flemings Hotel for 1 night (saturday till sunday) with my niece. All I can say is what an amazing experience we had. The hotel is more than I would normally look at paying but on refection now, I would be happy to stay again. Everything is clean and immaculate, with well thoughtout decor. The bed was very comfortable and we heard no noise from within or outside the hotel. It wasn't the biggest of hotel rooms but had eveything we needed and was spotlessly clean which is my main concern. There are plenty of plug sockets and mirrors in the room, so 2 people getting ready isn't a problem. The corridors are narrow but are well lit and yes the lift is slow but if this is your only criticism then you should be a happy guest. The food was excellent and the service outstanding. The staff are friendly and happy to help with anything you need, recommending places and things to do. With Green park tube a couple of streets away and walk through the park to Buckingham palace, getting around is easy and convenient.",5,2012,07,23
144,AMAZING TOWNHOUSE!,"I had the privelege of sharing the entire Town House amongst my friends and family recently for one night. I had an amazing time, the Town House is beautifully decorated with a great deal of thought gone into the small details. The staff are amazing, very helpful, friendly and with a 'nothing is too much' attitude which made our visit enjoyable.
The location is brilliant, right in the heard of Mayfair, I was spoilt by the location, now I know how the rich live :)
I also ate in the restaurant and had a good old English breakfast the next morning. Everything about Flemings is triple A star rating!
I can't wait to go back again...",5,2012,07,20
144,"Superb staff, nice and simple","I only stayed overnight and work had got an excellent tariff on the room; if I had paid full rate for the room, I might have been a bit disappointed. Great location, a few hundred yards from Green Park tube station and The Ritz. The staff, as mentioned, were outstanding; nice building, comfortable bed, powerful shower. I enjoyed my stay overall, and there was even a health benefit; I had intended to stay up for a late beer at the hotel bar, but when I learned a bottle of Budvar was £5.60, I went to bed early instead.",4,2012,07,15
144,Claustrophobic Risk,"Flemings has great location, I have lived in the hotel room as well as the the one bed apartment.
Hotel rooms are quite small but that is what you expect of central London, the apartment is large and if you are a family travelling it gives you a feeling of a second home in London with own entrance from the back. 
The staff are all very professional and friendly, Pedro and John were 5 star! The staff at the bar and restaurant are also to be commended ( forgot their names)
The small corridors and labyrinths to get to the hotel rooms give claustrophobic feeling! The elevator to the apartments is taken from a horror movie, extremely small and slow. 
The restaurant and the bar have amazing design, I could spend every evening their and enjoy every drink! The hotel rooms are clean and have nice layout and design. Apartments are a bit worn, you expect more from a 5 star place in regards to kitchen and showers. The water pump and heater makes noise and disturbs other family members if you are using the bathroom at night in the apartment. 
Except the narrow corridors which I don't understand why they have not renovated??? The rest of the hotel is great. 
When you book a room make sure you ensure to have a window overlooking the street to get some natural light in. And reduce the claustrophobic feeling after the corridor or elevator walk or ride.",4,2012,07,13
144,Great staff - otherwise hmm,"Hotel has great location very close to Green park and Mayfair. It's a boutique hotel with nice atmosphere. The staff is exceptionally polite and the small lobby is always well-appointed by staff members. Both check-in and -out were done efficiently.

Being SLH club member I was told to be upgraded in the check-in but still the room was extremely tiny (but that's typical in London). The room had a very lovely and large balcony (almost the size of the room) in which you could not enter for security reasons. In the room rate a free bottle of red wine was included - it was not however delivered in my room at all. Also turndown service lacked the first night but was done properly the second night. The bathroom's table was extremely dirty.

All in all I found that there were too many inconsistences in the hotel for the price they charge (200 £ plus). Next time I will choose Hilton Green Park (see my other review) which is just on the opposite side of the Half Moon St.",3,2012,07,11
144,"Great location, quality of stay depends on the room you get","I would give this hotel 3.5 stars if I could.  The quality of the rooms vary significantly, which really affects the review.  There is a new section of the hotel (you actually have to go outside to enter it), and those rooms are great.  Brand new, really nice fixtures, very comfortable.  We spent 2 nights in an older room, and 1 night in a newer room.  If I was writing this review of only the older room, it would receive 3 stars at best.  The older rooms feel rather dark, and the air conditioning barely worked.  It was only about 65 degrees in London when we were there, and yet the room would never get below 78 degrees.  Once someone took a shower, the room was unbearably hot and stuffy.  The hotel itself is in a great location. The staff is kind and means well, but there always seemed to be a bit of confusion with any requests.  (a good example is that the night we checked in, they were trying to show us to our room and they couldn't find the room!)  The common areas are nice and well maintained.  Overall I would stay here again, only if I was in the section with the recently renovated rooms.",4,2012,07,10
144,Great Location and Staff,"I loved the location of this hotel, a short walk to the tube and many attractions. The staff were attentive and polite and the hotel decor was lovely. The only complaint I have is that the bathroom was very small and the shower door did not adjust properly, thus there was a lot of water on the floor post shower.",4,2012,07,09
144,"Perfect Location, very nice staff, great for a short London stay","I stayed here for business last week, it was the 6th or 7th time and as usual the staff and facility were spot on. Also very clean.",5,2012,07,09
144,Great location front rooms a little noisy,Stayed here in a front first floor room and found it very good but a little noisy in the mornings if you are trying to sleep in. The windows are not double glazed so the traffic noise can wake you. The rooms are fine and a reasonable size for London. Bathroom was a little tired looking but was clean. Breakfast was good with good service from the staff. Fantastic location as you can walk to everything. ,4,2012,07,06
144,superb boutique hotel,"I stayed at Flemings Hotel and i would just like to say what an absolute pleasure it was. The staff were polite and attentive. The room was fabulous, decorated to a high standard with everything one could need.
The facilities, the cocktail bar, library, restaurant etc were all perfect, very cool yet still not too overstated.
The Hotel itself is in a fantastic position in the heart of mayfair close to piccadilly, the west end etc and all it has to offer. I will definetly be back",5,2012,07,06
144,Fabulous,"I stayed at Flemings Hotel Mayfair for the first itme this week and was most impressed the friendlinesss, courtesy and general effeicience of all staff members I spoke with for the duration fo my staff.  The hotel is a real gem in the middle of Mayfair and is ideally situated for lots of local amenities, sightseeing, retail therapy(!) and the theatres.  The hotel is spotlessly clean and I had a very well equiped and comfortable room.  I will definitely be staying here again when business and or social occasions necessitate an over-night stay in a convenient, discreet, central London location.",5,2012,07,05
144,Wonderful staff and friendly atmosphere,"Just stayed overnight at this hotel,and the staff could not have been more helpful,lovely hotel,nice room but a bit of traffic
Noise.great breakfast freshly cooked",4,2012,07,01
144,Great location but psychedelic decor not great and extremely small room was a disappointment.,Stayed on business having heard good things about the hotel. Room was tiny and the decor throughout the hotel necessitates sunglasses. The additional charge for Wifi seemed a little OTT given the room rate!,3,2012,07,01
144,Better after refurb,"I had stayed several times at Flemings over the years and had always found it rather shabby so last week when I was booked into it by a client I was pleased to see that it had had a major makeover. The common areas and rooms are now fine but for £382 it is expensive despite its Mayfair location. I had a room on the fourth floor at the back and it was quiet and comfortable. However the hotel is a bit of a poky warren of corridors and steps and staircases as it is several townhouses knocked together. It is definitely unsuitable for anyone with disabilities.
Two other minor gripes. 
Efficient early check in by competent receptionist but he also seemed to be the only one answering the phone and did so four or five times during the check in process. He was answering queries, putting calls through to rooms and generally offering a very efficient service to the callers whilst I waited and listened in. It wasn't a big issue but there were three doorman stood beside us joking amongst themselves with nothing to do and one guy at the desk madly multi-tasking which was a bit bizarre.
I asked if the hotel had wifi and was told yes it does but that there was a charge. i said in that case I will walk down the road to Starbucks to get my mail for free because despite the fact that I was not paying the bill I am not - out of principle - going to pay for wifi when I am paying £382 for one night without breakfast! I told the receptionist this and that I was going to make this point on Trip Advisor and he rather sheepishly said he agreed but that this was 'hotel policy'. To his credit he then did give me a code for free but it really is a nonsense in this day and age that some hotels are STILL trying to stiff their guests for a few extra quid for this. It creates such a negative impression for such a tiny cost.
For a more modern and equally stylish/comfortable hotel in the same area that is considerably cheaper I would try the Cavendish just down the road.",3,2012,06,25
144,Totally superb boutique hotel,"I was surprised to see that flemings was a 4 star, I rate it 5 star, I have stayed at the hotel twice this year, once in the apartment, and I am booked to stay for four nights shortly, I wouldn't stay any where else, I love the glamour of the hotel, the decor is beautiful and I can't say enough about the staff! Fantastic! They can't do enough for you. Always with a smile and so polite. Location is also excellent for getting around.  My only gripe is the wifi charge. Other than that Flemings is a fabulous hotel. ",5,2012,06,20
144,Room was a bit shabby,"Myself and husband stayed he for one night 2 Weeks ago. 
The room was ok, but the furniture was very scratched and the valance sheet on the bed had a huge stain on it. Our room was at the front of the hotel, which is very noisy from 5am with deliverys. Room service is a let down, they only have sandwiches on the 24hr menu and they were pretty poor.
We have stayed in a few SLH and this was the worst one.",3,2012,06,20
144,Bedroom disappointing,"We chose the hotel because of the location, close to Dover Street where we were celebrating our son's 18th birthday.  The public areas have been recently refurbished and they have been done beautifully, very stylish and greatly enhanced by the owner's stunning glass collection.  For afternoon tea or for cocktails this is a great place to go.  The service was good although the breakfast staff tried a little too hard (I'm not keen on too much early morning small talk!).  The disappointment for us was the bedroom which was very small (not much space to get round the bed) and the outlook from the window was really awful (see photo).  With the busy wallpaper and dark furniture the room felt quite claustrophobic.  A previous guest had switched off the aircon machine (wall mounted) and the room smelt very musty when we arrived.  If we went back we would need to consider upgrading to a larger room.",3,2012,06,18
144,"Friendly staff, noisy location","Arrived on an overnight flight from Toronto into Heathrow.  It was quite painless to take the Picadilly line into Green Park station and walk to the hotel, maybe a 50 min. journey.  It wasn't rush hour so we didn't seem to inconvenience any of the locals.

Being at the hotel before noon, we asked about the possibility of an early check-in.  When the friendly woman behind the desk went to look into it, she at first said she was unable to find our reservation and offered us a seat and a coffee in the lounge while she looked into it.  We were about to worry but she returned not five minutes later to check us in, early check-in and all.

We enjoyed our stay overall.  Being fairly independent, we didn't take advantage of concierge services at all nor did we dine in their restaurants.  We were happy with staff though, with rooms cleaned regularly and staff always opening doors and saying hello and goodbye as we returned and when we left.

We're accustomed to city noise so were we able to put up with the noise outside on the street - others may not.  Drivers can be aggressive in London and seem to enjoy racing down side streets.  The Hilton also has a bar/restaurant across the street and with all bars in London, somehow the clientele always spill outside.

We found the location somewhat convenient but unless your the type to frequent Brown's, Claridges, The Ritz, or the Wolseley, there are probably better locations.  Starbuck's, Pret a Manger, M+S, and a Caffe Nero were all close by.  There seemed to be few accessible, good, regular restaurants in the area.  We found ourselves walking to Soho or Picadilly Circus for those.

Many tourist sites are well within walking distance, I assume the reason most would enjoy this location.  Easy to get to Green Park, St. Jame's Park, Buckingham Palace, Westminster & Big Ben, Trafalgar Square, Picadilly Circus, Bond and Regent St., Soho, and Oxfrod Circus. Hyde Park and Harrod's are also close.  Everything else is only a few tube stops away.

Our only gripe with our stay was the excessive charge for wifi.  We abstained as we didn't need access enough to pay 5 pounds for 90 mins.  There were 1 day and 7 day options as well.  I would prefer free at the room rates we paid.

And on a really minor note, there didn't seem to be anywhere to hang your towel in the bathroom or maybe I just don't understand how those heated towel rack are to be used.",4,2012,06,08
144,Very good,"Wonderful location, had a lovely walk in Green Park before breakfast. Hotel feels very decadent with expensively furnished communal areas. The staff were friendly and very attentive. The room was well furnished, but very warm to the extent that I didn't sleep well even with the window open. There was nothing in particular to fault this hotel on, but it was pricey, and there are better options in London (though maybe not Mayfair) for less.",4,2012,06,06
144,Overrated,"Eh...stayed here for four nights last week...the staff are pleasant, and the location is convenient, and it's clean...beyond that, i can't recommend it: decor in rooms is a bit garish and the lobby is understaffed (concierge desk often vacant, and i couldn't find security once when i needed them)...it wasn't bad, but i doubt i'll ever stay here again...",3,2012,06,05
144,Best of Mayfair. Amazing location and 5* staff,"I had the pleasure of staying at this Mayfair gem on Sat evening. I was in the West End for a birthday party, which started with a drinks reception in the chic hotel bar downstairs. The staff at Flemings are incredibly friendly, effective and charming - from John at the Front Desk to Bravo and colleagues in the bar and restaurant.

Colin Exton, one of the managers is arguably the best GM in town! Colin is a master of customer service and made the booking of our stay very straightforward.

We had the delight of staying in the new 'Townhouse' wing. The room was beautifully decorated, with every small detail accounted for.

I could not recommend this hotel enough.

A central London gem, amazing staff, astute management - creating a fantastically enjoyable stay!

144,Superb location,"A great hotel just off Piccadilly. 

Superb service from the moment we arrived to the moment we left.

Perfect place to stay for shopping in the afternoon and a night out. 

Definitely recommend.",4,2012,05,18
144,"Flemings Hotel.  Amazing hotel, Great location & fantastic staff","I had an oppurtunity to stay a few nights at this hotel May 2012.  The location is  perfect  (Mayfair) Short walking distance from many London attraction, the tube and shopping area.  The food and service at Flemings Grill  was great. English afternoon tea was decadent.  You must try the macaroons.  The room was excellent and they truly have an amazing staff working there.  Very friendly and helpful.  Thank you so much Colin Exton and all the hotel staff for a fantastic experience.  Can't wait to go back!",5,2012,05,17
144,Really nice hotel and great staff,"Visited the hotel in May 2012 for 5 nights and had a really nice experience there. The hotel is nice, very comfortable, but the best of all is the hotel staff, always smiling and willing to make your stay the best experience.
We travelled with our 4 yo daughter, so we asked for a larger room. Our room was a little bit too small, but enought for the 3 of us. They had to arrange the room every day to accomodate the convertible sofa-bed for our daughter.
Apart from that they had really nice details with our daughter (some personalized presents), that really made the difference.",4,2012,05,16
144,"Modern and decadent at the same time, it merges a traditional British atmosphere with a modern eclectic style","Flemings is a great small hotel.  Everything deserves a mention. First of all the location, as it is very conveniently located in Half Moon Street, Mayfair, very close to Piccadilly, St James’s Street and Green Park.  The hotel is really very special. Modern and decadent at the same time, it merges a traditional British atmosphere with a modern eclectic style and furniture. In certain cases it even turns glamorous and eccentric, as for the very specially decorated Front Room, a small but stylish bar with a fireplace.  It has also a very spacious hall.  Rooms are very modern and comfortable with spacious and well equipped bathrooms. Everything is a combination of style, comfort and discrete glamour. Service is excellent and staff is very helpful and kind: they make you feel special since the very moment you step into the hotel.  The entire hotel has free Wi-Fi for guests. Also to be mentioned the nice breakfast. Flemings is really special, and staying there is a sort of experience. Strongly recommended to the travelers that want to have a pleasant staying in central London in full comfort.",5,2012,05,09
144,The Flemings Hotel,"Of all the hotels we've stayed at throughout the UK, I would rate this hotel as the tops. The location is excellent, with tube stops and supping  minutes away. The hotel is very comfortable, laid back, and the staff is there to take care of the guests. The room was excellent, and my wife said, as we were packing to leave,""can't we stay another week?"" If you're looking for a great hotel in a great location this is the one to choose. We will certainly stay there the next time we visit London.",5,2012,05,01
144,Wonderful stay at Flemings Mayfair!,"We stayed at the Flemings Mayfair April 13-21, 2012 & loved it!  We are from Ontario, Canada & came to London to visit our daughter.  The location just off of Piccadilly is perfect with a 4 minute walk to the Green Park tube station, 3 minute walk to Green Park which takes you to Buckingham Palace & after the palace you enter James Park which you can walk right to Westminster.  The staff couldn't do enough for us & were always pleasant & most helpful.  The continental breakfast was included in our rate & was plentiful plus you could also have hard/soft boiled eggs, toast or porridge.  Our room was very nice & quiet.  We had a wonderful time in London spending time with our daughter & staying at a great hotel made our stay even more special!  Thanks to all the staff at Flemings Mayfair!

144,I'm a bit late on this hotel,"I'm a bit late in my review on this one having stayed here in May 2009 .So why now ? I don't write a review about all the places I stay ,but missing out on Flemings was sheer negligence .Again so why now ? because I will be staying at Flemings again the end of May.First of all I have stayed numerous times around Marble Arch until my daughter a travel agent booked me here .The location is fantastic ,on a side street 2 mins from Green Park ,shopping and the underground. Walk through the park brings you to Buckingham Palace & St James Park .The hotel accomodations are lovely ,we had a medium size room with a full bathroom and finally a bath tub ,so nice to soak in after a day walking around. The breakfasts are very good ,as  you would expect from a fine hotel ,also we ate dinner here too ,which was quite good .Last but not least the staff were outstanding, friendly and very imformative and took care of all my needs .We couldn't have been happier .So we are very happy we are again staying here ,and I should mention if you like to take a hop on hop off bus , a few minutes from this hotel.Everything is here.",5,2012,04,28
144,Great Location - perfect place for a London trip,"Stayed here for three nights recently. Aside from the complimentary upgrade I received I was massively impressed by the place. All of the staff were very helpful and courteous. The room I got was very well appointed with probably the most comfortable bed I've ever slept in. 

I ate in the restaurant on one of the evenings and I have to say, the food was pretty good but the service was perfect - very helpful but not annoying.

The location is a really great base from which to explore London also. Looking forward to staying here again.",5,2012,04,27
144,Nice and friendly,This hotel is in excellent location and the staff is great - very professional and polite but still warm and friendly. The room was nice as well. Spotless and cozy.,4,2012,04,27
144,Lovely weekend away with friends,Excellent hotel in great location. Staff extremely friendly and very helpful..,5,2012,04,24
144,Quick trip to London,"This is a very nice hotel in an amazing location.   The staff were excellent and couldn't do enough for you.  The rooms were comfortable, tastefully decorated and just the right size for two people. I loved the breakfast.  The staff was attentive and there was a great variety to choose from both from the buffet or the menu.  For a small hotel they make the most of the space and the decor is funky but not over the top.  The best thing about the hotel is the location. It's right across the street from Green Park and the Green Park tube station.  And it is on the Picadilly line so you can take the tube right from Heathrow.  It's the perfect place for a weekend in London!",4,2012,04,22
144,Beautiful Hotel but was not impressed by Champagne and Cupcakes,"I want to start by saying the Fleming Hotel is beautiful and excellently located. So my low rating has nothing to do with either of those points.
We booked Champagne and cupcakes whilst we were visiting london we thought it would be perfect as were spending time in Mayfair so it was nice and local. 
The restaurant itself is lovely with lots of different rooms and is beautifully decorated. I booked the champagne and cupcakes rather than standard afternoon tea as i not a massive fan of scones and fancy cakes. I was massively disappointed when the cupcakes ended up being fruit cake. You would think that cupcakes should be either sponge or chocolate, unfortunately not. We were the only people in the whole restaurant so it also lacked any kind of atmostphere. When we arrived the staff were having some sort of meeting and so we stood there for a couple of minutes without even being acknowledged. My other complaint was that the when i researched the Fleming the champagne and cupcakes were being offered for £12 per person. On the day I was charged over £30 for 2 people. When i got home and noticed I emailed the Fleming but never recieved a response...disappointing to say the least.",2,2012,04,14
144,Classy little hotel in the heart of Mayfair,"This is a lovely little hotel, very conveniently placed for visiting the art galleries and great shopping nearby.  It is reasonably priced, very helpful service and a funky little bar and restaurant downstairs.  It must have been recently re-furbished and up-dated in slightly unusual, but fun taste.  Walk into the lift and it becomes a library as it is lined in leather backed books - very 'novel' I said!  The bedroom, although small has everything you need including a trouser press, tea and coffee, TV etc. and en suite.  All immaculate with comfortable beds and pillows.  No traffic noise either, so a peaceful night's sleep. Minor gripe - bar service was very slow.  We waited 15 minutes for a rather expensive gin and tonic although the bar was almost empty.  If you want internet be aware that you get 90 consecutive minutes for £5, so, if you go on line for 10 minutes and then switch off for 80 minutes you lose the rest of the session and have to pay another £5 to get online again.  All in all, this hotel made our 2 night stay in London thoroughly enjoyable and I would definitely stay there again.",5,2012,04,13
144,nice in many ways,"The downstairs was lovely and the staff could not have been nicer, but something was a bit shabby about the rooms. They are tiny and there's no way to unpack since there was not a drawer in the room to put clothes in. The wardrobe was tiny. The wallpaper was torn, the doors were in need of refinishing and the bathroom had cracked tiles. The bed was wonderful and the hotel is very quiet. The elevator is extremely slow and has a cracked mirror in the interior. I have mixed feelings about this hotel. It's comfortable and the location is terrific, but something about it feels a bit strange. The cocktail bar is overpriced with two not very good drinks costing almost forty pounds. I doubt I would stay there again since there's nothing memorable about the hotel. I think it may have seen better days. However, I didn't hate it except I did begin to hate the busy flowered wallpaper with its torn edges.",3,2012,04,11
144,Fabulous hotel,"Last week we had a five night break in London and chose Flemings Hotel in Mayfair. The hotel is very near theatreland and is close to all the major attractions - we could walk almost everywhere we wanted. The staff were very friendly and helpful. Our room was quiet, on the third floor and was spotless and comfortable and twice we had little treats left for us to eat. We enjoyed the breakfasts enormously. There was a generous buffet and a choice of cooked food. In fact, the breakfasts kept us going until well into the afternoon. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants a relaxing haven after the sights of a busy London. As I said, the staff were superb, and I would definately return.",5,2012,04,10
144,"My ""pied à terre"" in london","The hotel is very nice, great location, cozy and we can feel ourselves  at a great friend’s home. The staff members are  very professional they provide all information one can need . They are always attentive  and at the slightest singn of trouble they came up with the best solution for the guest.
In the reception  and  in the concierge everybody is special. Holly, Leandro, Alberto, Daniel, Joan, Ricardo, Katherine and Kate they are  a little bit more.
The restaurant is very good, the breakfast is really nice and the croissants are delicious, people like Mira, Simona, Valentina and Joanna receive us every day with  a big smile and all their eficiency.
People like the Mayfairs Flemings staff make the difference in your stay  in London.
I  strongly recommend this place and  it'll be my new; ""pied à terre in london.""

144,Deeutd,Stayed at Flemings hotel for two nights last week. This is a great Hotel with the most delightful and helpful staff. Bedroom small but very clean and well equiped. Lovely breakfast and great location. Cant wait to go back.,5,2012,04,08
144,"Great location, noisy and dark room, great staff! Internet are EXTRA!","Nice location, nice staff (but thats expected) booked and recomended by AMEX Plantinum Express card in Stockholm. I am surprised that they recommend this hotell.

My wife and I should have a short and nice stay i London - at Flemings. We got a very small room ( 238 pound a night! - overpriced) -  behind the reception desk - a small dark room and with a window to the road outside an no chance to open the window. And WORSE it was noisy as the tube/underground sounded all the time (every minute) as into the room. When I told the reception they told me that they wrote that into the system so we should get a better room next time we come by!!!

Breakfast, bar and restaurant downstairs as in any cheap touristhotell in London. But again with a very nice staff.

Internet are extra at high cost.

A member of the Small Luxery hotel chain they write - I would say without Luxery. Certainly this is not a four stars hotel nor a slh.

 There will not be a next time. Sorry. But still a perfect location!  My advice - check the room first IF you want to stay at Flemings. There are more hotels to choice from in London.

And  I am still surprised that AMEX recommended this to us.",3,2012,04,08
144,Fabulous in every way!,"My husband and stayed here for 4 nights and were wo every aspect of this first-class boutique hotel, including:

* Location -- 2 blocks from Green Park station, on a relatively quiet road. Named Half Moon Street.

* Hospitlity --we arrived at the hotel after an overnight flight, fully expecting that we would check our bags and wok orotund Mayfair until the official hek-in time that afternoon. We were warmly welcomed by Katie, who I believe is the manager, who offered to check us in Immediately and gave us our choice of rooms, plus free Internet. 

The was at least one doorman on call at all times we entered or left, and every one was most. Routes and helpful. The concierge staff was great.

*Our double room was somewhat large, well appointed, with a nice view of the older building across the way.

* We ate one lunch and two dinners at the in-house restaurant and were very pleased with the food, service and atmosphere. 

We will definitely be back.",5,2012,04,07
144,"Good location, small room, maze like corridor's","Stayed here recently on business trip, rooms are small, shower not built to accommodate a tall man. Depending on your room you could have a bit of a left/right/up/down walk, bit annoying really. Just one lift which is a bit worn looking with fake book shelves, needs overhaul in all aspects. All in all you are probably over paying for location here.",3,2012,04,06
144,"Outstanding staff, location, and ambiance","Our six-night stay at Flemings was enhanced by thoroughly professional staff at every level (and Katie, guest services coordinator, is a treasure!). We  were made to feel welcome and treated like guests, not statistics. Very attractive rooms (when a glitch occurred it was resolved with dispatch, generousity, and grace) -- enjoyable Continental breakfast -- perfect location for all the things we planned to do: handy for buses, tubes, and peaceful Green Park. With a Pret on one nearby corner and a small Tesco's on another and the varied restaurants in Shepard Market 2 blocks away, we could dine inexpensively when we wished.We highly recommend Flemings and hope to return before we get too much older!",5,2012,04,04
144,Very Nice Hotel,"Just returned from our 3rd stay at this hotel. Can thoroughly recommend it, good location, comfortable rooms, especially those to the Clarges Street side which is quieter. Efficiently room by friendly, courteous and helpful staff.  Only gripe is lack of free WIFI.  Would definitley return.",5,2012,04,02
144,Watch out for the eyeing concierge and the phone charges.,"I had stayed at Flemings Mayfair for a week, in honor on my very first Spring Break about a month after the Royal Wedding. The room was tiny, even when compared to Japan's standards, but it was clean and quite comfortable due to its great proximity to Piccadilly. The breakfast buffet left me quite hungry for tea at Fortnum and Mason, but I was able to discover a great breakfast place just around the corner called Safra. However, I found the staff to be quite intriguing. They were cold, and each day whenever I would go past the lobby one of the attendants at the front desk always would demand to know when I would be leaving, which is quite questionable. And the other part of my stay which I found rather annoying was the ability to make and take phone calls from my room. Anytime my family tried to call me from the US, the hotel will absolutely NOT connect the call, forcing me to call out of my room, and for a very high price which was reflected in my 600+ pound phone charges. Also, I had separately purchased the wifi pass from the hotel (they don't offer free wifi), and that also did not work, so basically I wasted my money. Also, my gentlemen friend, a London resident and a high ranking officer in the Royal Navy, with whom I occasionally went to dinner or a play, would complain that when he was waiting for me in the lobby, the concierge was always giving him dirty looks, and making him feel very uneasy and unwelcome. I do not believe that I will ever opt for staying in this hotel again, however, it did not ruin my stay and my appreciation of London.",2,2012,04,01
144,Lovely stay at Flemings,"I loved Flemings - great location, central London in Mayfair, tube stop 2 blocks away, many attractions and best shopping within walking distance; the room was clean, comfortable and reasonably sized for London; after I found a fantastic winter sale on Travelocity for a small room, the hotel offered a 15 GBP upgrade (a GREAT value); most important, the staff couldn't have been more efficient and helpful. Each one went out of his/her way to take care of me, always with kindness and a smile. Thank you in particular to Gonzague, John, Pedro, Holly, Katie, and Hannah. I look forward to staying at Flemings on my next trip to London - don't think I'd stay anywhere else again!
(Tip: the breakfast is pricy as is the Wi-Fi fee - kill two birds by going a block away to Pret a Manger - good Starbucks-type place with free wi-fi after registration)",5,2012,03,29
144,"Fabulous location, cozy hotel a bit overpriced","This was my second stay at the Flemmings in the past  two months. The Hotel is in the heart of Mayfair, close to Sheperds Market,Piccadilly and New Bond Street, 2 minutes walk from Green Park Tube Station, a fabulous location. The Hotel in itself is small, but has very attentive service at concierge and reception and excellent dining facilities. The rooms are also a bit small, especially the bathrooms, but very confortable and well appointed. The room price is a bit too high  considering the amenities and space and does not include breakfast which is an extra £16 and really nothing special. But there are plenty of breakfast eateries around the block includong Nero , Pret a Manger and Starbucks. The room price reflects the location of the hotel.",4,2012,03,29
144,Poor value for money and very dated,"First time I have stayed in this hotel even though I have worked next door to it for 13 years. Very disappointing. Booked a double room but was fobbed off with an apartment which sounded good. In fact you have to negotiate a maze to find it in the building. Decor very dated and bathroom fitments decidedly worn. Bed was uncomfortable - nasty gap in the middle - one side soft, the other hard. Enormous pillows that your head kept slipping off. Was woken at 11.30pm by room service even though we hadn't ordered anything. Most annoying of all they charge guests for wifi access! Even a 2* hotel in Ukraine offers free wifi to guests. For that reason alone I would never stay in this hotel again.",3,2012,03,29
144,Very nice hotel in the centre of London,"We really loved this hotel! It is very clean, the staff was really helpful, it looks good and it is right in the centre of London. The underground was also really close (Green Park) which made it really easy to travel to anywhere in London. There were supermarkets and restaurants just a few steps away from the hotel. The room was quite big and the beds were comfortable. I can recommend this hotel to everyone!",5,2012,03,22
144,Perfect boutique hotel in Mayfair close to many attractions.,"This was our third stay in this super hotel, 
The hotel has been renovated this past few years  & the bedrooms are much more luxurious than they were when we first stayed. Breakfast is still excellent with service to match. We have stayed in the Mayfair hotel nearby several times but for comfort,service and value  this had the edge. Perfect for visiting theatre land, Harrods, Buckingham Palace etc all very walkable. ",5,2012,03,21
144,Wow nice place,"We booked Flemings hotel based on the location. Five minutes away from green park tube station. It was my 50th birthday and booked afternoon tea at the ritz which was just over the road,couldn't get any closer.Our room was 219 it was a little small but cosy and warm The hotel is modern with black and white 60s pictures in the halls. All the staff made you feel welcome and they couldn't do enough for you. The man on the desk when we got there asked if we wanted to see any shows or if we were interested in seeing anything in London they could help. We didn't pay for breakfast when booking the hotel but decided to eat there I must recommend the porridge with berries and the boiled eggs nice and soft everything was tidy and clean. at night you must try the chill out bar I loved the decor it was a stunning hotel.A big thank you to katie Avel guest services manager who made my birthday special in the hotel. We would use this hotel againp",5,2012,03,20
144,An absolute gem of a Hotel,"Staying in London can be a very daunting experience. Flemings has the unique quality of first class service, exceptional food in restaurant (fantastic pre-theatre menu) and  truly lovely surroundings, both inside and out.
The staff are a lovely team of happy enthusiatic people who make you feel most welcome.
We had a lovely room, spotlessly clean and lovely decor.
As for location..... what more could you want, Green Park tube and only a £10.00 taxi fare from Kings Cross.
You simply must go to Shepherds Market, lovely small shops and fab eaterys.",5,2012,03,19
144,Great Location,"This hotel is well placed, close to the tube and walkable to lots of great places such as The Royal Acadamy, Fortnum & Masons and Green Park.  The room, whilst not particularly large, was well furnished and laid out.  We opted for a twim as it was a girls weekend and they were like two mini double beds.  The hotel is beautifully designed but it did feel quiet.  We went to the bar when we returned on Saturday night about 11 ish and there were only 2 people in there!!  We didn't have breakfast - it wasn't very clear that this wasn't included but at £21 a head we decided to stroll to Shepherd Market and had a great breakfast in the sunshine for £7 each.  The service really made this hotel.  Check in was delightful and the lady on reception was so friendly and genuine.  They gave us our room 2 hours early and let us have a complimentary late check out.  On every exit and entrance we were greeted with smiles and it was a lovely touch. We paid £150 and I would go again.",4,2012,03,13
144,Very Nice Stay!,"Fantastic location! Amazing Staff! Very nice hotel property! I will definitely stay at Flemings Hotel the next time I'm in London. Seriously, this hotel has an exceptional location...Green Park tube stop is very close to this hotel, and the hotel is within walking distance of Piccadilly Circus, Trafalgar Square, Big Ben, Buckingham Palace...the list goes on. True the rooms are small, but that's typical of the UK and Europe in general. Even so, my hotel room was very quiet, nicely decorated and extremely clean. I only had one issue during my stay: It cost me 43 pounds to make 3 short ""local"" phone calls from my room. I thought the price was a bit over the top. This was a problem to me because I called down to the front desk to ask about costs before I made the calls. I was told that there would be charges, but nothing exorbitant. Well, $70 bucks to make 3 local calls that lasted about 15 minutes each, seemed a bit exorbitant to me. If not for this one issue, my stay at Flemings would have been damn near perfect! I definitely would recommend this hotel to anyone!",4,2012,03,12
144,What a fantastic experience at the Grill Restaurant,"Words fail me with this review...

Our overall experience of the standards of food & service at this restaurant were faultless.  From walking down the stairs to the restaurant and being greated by a professional member of staff to putting on our coats at the end of our lunch and leaving the restaurant.

The high quality of food & service really puts other establishments to shame and the price paid for such excellence is definitely nothing to complain about.  My fiance took me here for lunch in Dec11 and we will definitely be returning again.  The menu selection was ample, the food service was as you would have expected and the friendly but professional staff were always on hand for your every need.  The restaurant has a lovely relaxing & tranquil atsmosphere with comfortable and welcoming seats.  

A very well done to all staff & Management, please do keep up the good work and we look forward to visiting you again in the not to distant future.",5,2012,03,09
144,Well run hotel - but some tiny (and noisy) rooms,"This is a well maintained hotel with super helpful and (occasionally too!) cheerful staff. The rooms and bathrooms are immaculate. The situation in Half Moon Street is calm for central London and the street noise minimal. Room service was of good quality and arrived very quickly.

Two drawbacks: My room was very, very small. For GBP 195 (our corporate rate) you can get a much more spacious room elsewhere in a decent hotel. Maybe they have larger rooms, but everytime I have stayed here I have been surprised by just how small a hotel room can be!

The rooms are well proteceted from street noise but the internal noise from the coridoor is high. The room doors are on an automatic shutting mechanism which causes them to slam loudly. Don't count on too much of a late sleep-in!

Still, you could do a lot worse.",3,2012,03,07
144,Fantastic Flemings,"My wife and I booked our stay at Flemings for a special anniversary treat to London to see a couple of West End Shows. A fantastic Hotel with fantastic employees. Every employee we encountered on our two night stay couldn't have been more helpful and polite. The Hotel is perfectly situated for a London stay, Green Park tube station a couple of minutes away and just a few stops to the heart of the City. Ideal for all the main tourist attractions. The hotel has character and was perfect for our stay. We cannot speak highly enough of the service we received. From check in to check out it exceeded our requirements, great reception team and concierge. Thoroughly enjoyed the breakfast and the attentive staff. It was lovely sitting relaxing with cocktails in the bar in the evening. Without a doubt we will return and use it as our base again in the future. we will also recommend to all our friends and family.",5,2012,03,01
144,Quite simply blown away! Great Hotel!,"Wow! What a hotel! Sure, there are cheaper places to stay out there, but pound for pound, you'd struggle to find anything better. If Flemings were a football club, it'd be top of the Premier League by a country mile. The staff are just about the nicest & most polite bunch of people you could ever wish to meet.......they have an uncanny ability of ensuring you don't have to lift a finger, without smothering. Quite simply, nothing is too much trouble for them and they go about their duties with pride and attention to detail. Well presented, well spoken, knowledgeable about the area and genuinely passionate about their hotel and the facilities on offer - to the extent that you feel like Royalty when you stay there (funny that, because Buckingham Palace is a quick 4-5 minute walk from this hotel). Whilst we're talking location, Green Park tube is a 2 minute walk, and rather handily there is a HSBC bank very close (with a couple of cash points), for free cash withdrawals. Food was outstanding (we recommend the chocolate soup for dessert by the way), and breakfast could not be faulted in the slightest. Rooms exceptional - attention to detail and cleanliness of the highest order. Honestly, the only negative we could find was that we couldn't stay longer. But we'll be back. Thanks to the team there - a wonderful experience! Oh, and how about this for a nice touch and an example of the customer service? On checking out, and requesting 'luggage storage' so that we could spend the afternoon seeing the sights, the staff explained that we could leave the luggage securely for free, collect it at any time, and they even offered us access to our room again (effectively 'late-checkout') so that we could 'freshen-up' after our afternoon of exploring London! Not sure if this service comes as standard, but what a superb touch. Thanks again. Hope to go back very soon.",5,2012,03,01
144,Highest standard,"We stayed here for one night in February to celebrate my husband's birthday. From the moment we walked in the door we were overwhelmed by the well trained staff who were exceptional throughout our stay. Asked by a friendly receptionist the reason for our stay, we were astounded to be given a large upgraded room on the 4th floor which was beautiful. Shortly afterwards a complimentary plate of beautiful cakes was delivered to our room with a birthday card for my husband. This was exceptional and very much appreciated. All the public rooms and our bedroom were furnished to the highest standard possible, and our breakfast and the breakfast team were again wonderfully efficient with the buffet breakfast excellent. Our luggage was stored for our final day while we shopped, and a taxi found for us instantly as we left. We would recommend this hotel as an ideal stopover for a stay in London with a location second to none in this quiet street of Mayfair. Management should be proud of such a well trained and interested staff. A real delight, and we cannot wait to return.",5,2012,03,01
144,1st Class,"Great hotel made wonderful by such great staff, helpful from the second we stepped in the door. Always on hand when we needed and we were very impressed by the way they hailed a taxi for us outside, it looked risky but I guess they do it all the time! Can't wait to come back again in the future and have told all our friends how great it is",5,2012,02,28
144,Almost perfect..,"Location is perfect, 2 minutes from Green Park tube station and you
can take the tube to Heathrow without changing line.

Breakfast was great,  (especially the yoghurt and jam!) good service as well .

Our only disappointment was the Afternoon Tea, scones were hard
and Victoria Sponge dry, but when we got new scones they were lovely.

Also about cleaning the rooms, I would have appreciated if they had done the 
room a bit earlier than 4 - 5 o´clock in the afternoon, you might need your room
by yourself to relax before going out at night.

We will most likely come back to Flemings!",4,2012,02,28
144,Prefection!,"My girlfriend and I visited Flemings Bar and Grill for dinner at the beginning of February and the experience was nothing short of perfect. The hotel itself was beautiful and finished to a very high standard but it was the service which really captured our attention. The staff were incredibly attentive and couldn’t do enough to make our visit a memorable one. As for the food, it was faultless and we’re already thinking of another excuse to go back!! I genuinely cannot praise this hotel highly enough, I’m incredibly picky when it comes to dining out but this exceeded our every expectation.",5,2012,02,27
144,Perfect,"A faultless hotel is hard to find, but after staying here for two nights, I cannot say a bad word about Flemings. 

The staff were plentiful and attentive, really made us feel special. We were staying for a special occasion and were offered a room upgrade to a fantastic one bedroom suite. The room was stunning and was everything we hoped it would be. 

The location is perfect, a minute from Buckingham palace, a minute from the tube, a minute from Shepherds Market which houses multiple pubs and restaurants. Even a Tesco around the corner. We didn't need a taxi once.

If you have a tight budget (don't go to London!) the hotel probably isn't for you, but for a classy escape riddled with luxury,  then this ticks all the boxes. ",5,2012,02,26
144,"Excellent location, attentive staff, will stay again.","We have stayed at a number of hotels in Mayfair, but our stay at Flemings was amongst the best. Apartment very well appointed and nothing was too much trouble. Being located just off Picadilly you are in the heart of it all, without the noise of traffic rushing past.",5,2012,02,26
144,Really lovely hotel. Perfect location,"Had a great stay, all staff were very efficient. Had a continental breakfast, lots of choice and variety. Enjoyed a delicious yet pricey lunch.
Only a short walk through Green Park to Buckingham Palace and two minutes from Green Park tube station makes this the best hotel for location that I've stayed in in London. 
Perfect for a luxury stay in London for a special occasion.
Only negative is that our room smelt of smoke, however we didn't tell the staff about this, if we had I am sure they would have done something about it as every member of staff was excellent.",5,2012,02,22
144,it could be...lovely,"we were very well welcomed, and the first impression was good,quiet street near Green Park,in the very middle of the city...BUT what a very bad idea to consider a room in the middle of the lobby,near the concierge and the staircase to the restaurant!!!!The room was lovely and good equipment, but no rest if you want to...so NEVER accept this kind of room, number 76 and 77,
the breakfast was good and the service very polite and efficient,",3,2012,02,20
144,No value for the money.,The location of the hotel is excellent. Everything else was below average. The room was tiny. The bathroom was tiny. The room was noisy. The Internet did not work (spent hours trying to get it to work...thought something was wrong with my computer....but it wasn't my computer which is fairly new..the Internet doesn't work). The breakfast was non-descript. The staff were unhelpful. Really poor experience. Will never return.,1,2012,02,18
144,"Great location, friendly and tranquil","Only living an hour from London we normally go for day trips. But having tickets to a concert and Valentines weekend, decided to stay over. Mayfair area of London is the best place to stay, really close to the West End, the parks and sights. The Fleming is on a quiet street, called Half Moon Street, two minutes to the tube, to Green Park and 5 minutes to the big lights of Piccadilly.

The welcome was really personal, polite and efficient, the hotel warm and welcoming. Our room 110 was on the 1st floor and was all the things you want: clean, welcoming, modern yet homely.

The only complaint would be we had a huge bed, but found out in the middle of the night, it was two singles put together, a little naff.

But that meant we slept on one half of the bed, which had its advantages.

The hotel bar was great and a real find after a long day taking in the sights.

This was a lovely hotel and would recommend this to anyone coming to London.",5,2012,02,17
144,Not reflecting expectations..,"Greatly located 5 star botique hotel with very friendly staff and service.. But that is also where the positive remarks about this hotels ends.. As a member the SLH list we wonder about their criteria for membership as it certainly did not come across as a luxury hotel, small YES! The site of the Flemings hotel does not reflect the standard of the rooms.. The sumpteous and soultry decorated rooms where nowhere to be found, what we did find was wallviews from our window and boring and rundown small rooms. As a minor detail, when checking in asked for newspaper preference be prepared to find the charge for it on your bill.",2,2012,02,13
144,Loved Flemings!,"We had a brilliant stay at Flemings. The staff couldn't have been more helpful, the room was brilliant and the location was perfect for us. The decor made it feel special. It was great value for central London let alone Mayfair. Would definitely stay again!",5,2012,02,10
144,Its English and Nice,"Its a hotel put into several old buildings, the corridors might be difficult to navigate. There is a front door and a back door. Some of the rooms seems to be small, others seems to be very close to a (not very buissy) street . The breakfast and restaurant is in the cellar. 

There are rooms which are, by London standards, of very reasonable size and which are as quiet as you can wish. Its English and its nice, service is polite and (fairly) efficient.",4,2012,02,09
144,Wonderful Stay,"This hotel was very retro, & nice. We got the breakfast down stairs every morning , very good. Walking distance to pubs & resturants and green park. Price was good. Enjoyed our stay very much. rooms were cozy and bathrooms had towel warmers.",5,2012,02,06
144,Lovely boutique hotel,"Our two night stay at Flemings Hotel, Mayfair was excellent. Lovely decor, friendly and helpful staff. Rooms are not huge but are cosy and relaxing - perfect after spending a day in the capital. The choice at Breakfast was excellent. The hotel is in such a good location - relatively quiet street opposite a Hilton Hotel and just round the corner from the tube station. Easy to walk to Piccadily, Bond Street and Regent Street. We have no hesitation in recommending this small individual hotel. As a fellow diner at Breakfast said ""you would not know other people were staying here"". We would definitely stay there again.",4,2012,02,05
144,"Perfect central location, welcoming staff, hotel with individual character","We stayed at this hotel for one night as we had a function to attend at The Grosvenor.  5 minutes walk from Green Park station, 10 minutes walk from Park Lane and Piccadilly.  Relatively quite side street.  Charming facade, hotel with character, I believe that all rooms have a unique design. Beware that rooms and bathrooms are small.  It did not bother us for one night but it would have done if we had had to stay for a few nights.  As we checked in, we asked for a quiet room and the staff changed our allocated room to another one.  We were pleased with it in that it was at the end of a corridor on the First floor and the windows overlooked another side street which was very quiet. The room was a bit dark because it had wooden blinds as it overlooked an office block.  Without them you could wave at the employees from your bedroom window....The hotel is in an old building and therefore the floorboards creak. The staff are very friendly and welcoming.  The bathroom was tiny and you cannot have more than one person in it at a time.  The TV was not easy to operate, at one point we lost connection altogether but someone came to reset it straight away and showed us what to do if it happened again. The room was cold but I noticed that the radiators were turned off so I switched them back on and it was cosy very quickly.  Small room but perfectly formed and suitable for a one-night stay.  I would definitely recommend this hotel. I have stayed at The Hilton Green Park across the road and Flemings is a much nicer hotel.  I have also stayed at The Hilton Park Lane and although the room and bathroom were large, it lacked character.  The staff at Flemings and the quirkiness of the place give it its this special je ne sais quoi.  We did not have breakfast at the hotel so I cannot make any comments regarding the food as we strolled down to Henry's round the corner where you can have a fantastic full english breakfast at the fraction of the cost.  The only thing I would have liked to see in the room upon arrival was a complementary bottle of mineral water. Although there is a bar in the room, it is always a nice touch.",4,2012,02,04
144,Restaurant needs some thought,"Arriving thirsty I wanted a beer.... an Enlish beer and despite having some good ones on the menu like Timothy Taylor all they could offer was foreign Lager so I had a ""signature"" Martini which was pretty good I have to say.

Service was pretty good, but the portions were diabolical...a sliver of Mackrel as a starter which was no larger than a pencil was £10. The beef (Bavette) or flank to you and as used by MacDonald in its burgers was pretty good but barely warm....and no veg !! The cheese board at an extra of £4 over the normal desert price of £7.50 was dissapointing. My partner ate different things but joked that we might get a MacDonalds on the way home ( well yes it was a joke, but you take the point)

Coffee was excellent, but no chockies. 

When dining in Mairfair I expect something very special, but I'm afraid this was all too modest...and the diners next to us wore jeans and trainers. Whatever next!!",2,2012,02,03
144,Excellent central hotel,"This hotel is in an excellent central location just off Picadilly which suited well the places we wanted to visit on this trip. The staff we met were very pleasant and helpful.
The original room we were allocated was on the ground floor and while it was a good size with good size bathroom we found it noisy. We asked to be relocated and this was sorted for us by reception staff with no problems. The next room was much better.
We did not dine in the hotel in the evenings but breakfast and afternoon tea were very good.
We would recommend this hotel.",4,2012,01,31
144,O-o-ops... Something broken again...,"It's a really nice and quiet place not far from the parks, Mayfair attractions, Piccadilly Circus and Soho, shopping at Regent street and so on and so forth. Nice and welcoming staff. But try to avoid ground floor rooms. It's suitable just in one case when you are going to spent a whole day outside the hotel from the very early morning up to late at night. Because the ground floor room's level is absolutely the same as the level of a pavement beneath your room's window. And as the result you can easy exchange glances with a pedestrians in front of your window.
Everything here are definitely traditional and looks rather old. And most of things still working well, but...
I happened to move from a ground floor level to the penthouse appartment at the sixth floor. Really nice flat. Big bedroom, huge master bedroom, big and useful sitting room combined with a dinning room, fully furnished kitchen with everything you may need to cook a meal for regular family and even a big terrace on the roof ready for BBQ. But...
First of all there was terribly cold and we have to open hot water taps in both bathrooms and ask for extra electric heater to make this big appartment ready for normal life. And towel dryers weren't work at all till the end of our staying there. And day by day and every day something has been breaking. Some lamps in the bathrooms were gone one by one. The TV-set in the master badroom suddenly has lost his voice entirely. And last but not least was stopping of the lift. At all. For the last three days of our staying. You know 6 floor is high enough especially when you are climbing by narrow staircase at late friday's night after several pints of good London Pride trying to keep it inside.
And all welcoming and friendly personnel had done nothing with any of listed above problems.
But really nice place and surrounding area. Good luck to all travellers!",4,2012,01,31
144,"Good value Hotel, but hot and noisy bedroom","We do have some good things to say about this Hotel, but have to be honest and call it as we see it.

First of all, this is a very good ""value for money"" Hotel in a perfect location, and the staff we met - especially on the front desk and concierge area - could not have been more helpful. 

And while there is nothing wrong with the overall appearance and ""feel"" of the Hotel, the basic infrastructure (old London town houses joined together) does create some constraints which some travellers may not like. 

The Bedrooms are fine and ours was of a reasonable size.  But it was unpleasantly hot (why are so many London Hotels like this?) and the Air-Conditioning unit was obtrusive in the room , very noisy, and pumped out tepid air, which made little difference to what was a bad nights sleep.   There was also  some intrusive noise from the corridor outside and adjoining rooms.  This is probably all connected with the basic building constraints. 

The bar and dining areas are dark (no natural light) and somewhat ""in you face"" in terms of decor - some may feel that it is very modern and swanky, but we didn't really feel comfortable.   Breakfast was very slow and of average to good quality.  Bar staff were somewhat disinterested.

The Location however is excellent, the front-desk  staff were superbly helpful, and there are many worse hotels for the money in far worse areas of London. 

Perhaps we were unlucky with our room, but it would put us off returning.",3,2012,01,27
144,Great service compensates for small rooms,"Checking in was a pleasure, making me fell welcome without giving the feel of affected kindness you often get from hotel staff. I stayed only for one night which made the stay acceptable. The reason was, the room was quite small making me feel somewhat cooped up. Compared to other London hotels this wasn't too bad but should I have spent more nights there, I would have preferred more space and most importantly a larger desk allowing me to do some work in the evenings. The TV is located so if you leave it drawn out of the closet - you risk banging your head into it when getting up from the bed in the morning. I here speak from experience.

By some reason the temperature in the room was somewhat high, even when staying in January, so the A/C needed to be left on during the night. Not very loud, but some might get annoyed by the constant fan noise.

But why should you spend time in your room when you have a well assorted hotel bar downstairs, serving some of the better cocktails I've tasted so far. This is definitely, in addition to the great and personal service provided by the hotel staff, gives some plus points.",3,2012,01,27
144,Misses top rating by ignoring the little things which make all the difference.,"This small hotel is wonderfully located. 30 seconds walk from Piccadilly, 1 minute from Green Park, 5 minutes from Hyde Park, 2 minutes from the marvelous Shepherd's Market. It is nicely tucked away in a street which is almost secluded when you consider that thousands of cars per day roar up and down the main thoroughfare just yards away, yet you are hardly aware of them. The staff here are of a very high order --especially the concierges--and are the hotel's greatest asset. If you make reservations through websites like LondonTown be aware that the lowest rate they quote for Flemings will give you a tiny, oppressive room that will only serve if you are there for one night or if you are despreate to save every penny. I had one of these rooms on my first night and it was a tiny, terrible, L-shaped cell in which you could hardly turn around without knocking into something. I upgraded to a larger room for the rest of my stay, but at an extra cost of 30 pounds per night. My only beef with any member of staff was that I was told at the desk that my rate did not include breakfast so on four mornings I went out and paid for it elsewhere, only to learn at check-out time that the meal was included after all. I went out in the mornings because the cost of a hot breakfast at Flemings is 22 pounds which (by London standards) is not so bad if you want juice, fruit, cereal and a plate of  cooked food, but if you only need two poached eggs on toast it is still 22 pounds! The food is fairly good, but on the two occasions I breakfasted there, the coffee was not hot. Apart from a superb staff, what makes the difference between a goodish hotel and a really good hotel are the little things which are convenient and make you feel special--like a 7 day a week laundry and pressing service, a clothes brush, an umbrella, pens to write with, a shoe horn, a user-friendly computer in the hall, proper coat hangers (with actual hooks), a hot/cold water system which is easy to use, etc none of which are offered at Flemings. Worse still the heating system is separate from the air conditioning and neither is easy to figure out and control and until you do, you are either too hot or too cold. So, while I like the hotel and could not in fairness describe it as ""average"", I cannot say it is excellent because in light of its failings it is not particularly good value for money.",4,2012,01,14
144,"Good value, nice, clean, updated, and good location","My  mother stayed here a few weeks ago, while My husband and I stayed at a different hotel down the street.  My husband and I and used rewards points to pay for our hotel, but it was too pricey otherwise, so my mom chose this hotel.  The hotel is a great value!  A lot cheaper than other hotels in the area.  It is centrally located, near a Tube stop.  I would personally stay here again.  The staff was very friendly and helpful.  The hotel looked like it was recently renovated.  The decor was nice.  Rooms and hotel was clean.  My mother got a single room, it was cozy.  Two people could have stayed in it, but it would have been somewhat tight.  The room was a bit small, but great for one person and nicely decorated.",5,2012,01,13
144,"Clean, easy access, safe and secure.","My two teen daughters and I stayed here 3 nights after Christmas.  We had plenty of space for the three of us - top floor (used the stairs - elevator is tiny and slow).  Service and cleanliness were very good.  We did run the A/C as the room was warm.  We didn't use the restaurant - had breakfast at Cafe Nero at the end of the street each morning (free wi-fi there - not at the hotel).  Easy walk to the tube (Green Park), just off of Piccadilly.  We also walked around Hyde Park to Harrods, down to Piccadilly Circus and Trafalgar, through Soho, up and down Regent Street and Oxford street.  Easy walk to Buckingham Palace too.",4,2012,01,05
144,"Great Hotel, Great Staff","Still a great place in the perfect location.  Staff is great, and must mention Sabina who went out of her way to make us feel at home the entire time.",5,2012,01,04
144,Great hotel great location,Stayed at the Flemings hotel new years eve for the night. This is the third time we have stayed here as the location is excellent for central London.  The hotel itself its very cosy and clean and the staff very helpfull and friendly.  We have stayed in several hotels in London but Flemings is bar far our favourite.  Would highly reccommend this hotel.,5,2012,01,02
144,A small luxury hotel at a great location,"This hotel is worthwhile staying in. Very quick check in. Clean english comfortable room, although the bathroom misses some flair! 
The hotel is located near hyde park and new bond. 
The only thing to be careful of is the noice of neighboring rooms.",4,2011,12,25
144,"Great location, awesome rates and such comfortable beds!","After trying to find a decent rate for a room in London for 3 people we found this little gem. 
Great rates, great room (although a little too hot at times but we had the a/c to put on which seemed really wrong in the middle of a British winter!), very comfortable beds and pillows and piping hot shower. The rooms are very clean and comfortable. 
The bar area is really funky with wonderfully designed high-backed chairs, lots of mirrors everywhere and a really nice house wine - always a bonus! Can be a little tricky to get the attention of the staff for another round sometimes, but in such nice surroundings you don't mind waiting.
The restaurant was only a little disappointing due to the fact the soup wasn't seasoned enough, but everyone has a bad day. 
The staff at the hotel, from the bar to the reception to the guy in his top hat and tails are awesome. They go out of their way to make your stay as comfortable as possible. 
Highly recommended",5,2011,12,23
144,Cosy Chic,"Our 3rd time in the Flemings apartments, enjoyed it throughly!! Lovely rooms, pretty chintz, very comfortable bed, truly well designed apartments, cosy  and very elegant. The kitchen is a good size and has all the appliances. Drawing room with a lovely sofa, a small dining table, and a very pretty, writing desk.the coffee table with a good number of the latest magazines, very thoughtful!! Lovely big bathroom. well lit too always a plus point with me! lots of closet space too. The location is excellent ,
, 5 min walking distance to green park station,many good restaurants around the hotel,everything one might need is  just minutes away. Laundry, tesco, hair salon, chemist. Definitely one of our favourite places to stay in London.",4,2011,12,23
144,A fine hotel in a wonderful location,"Flemings ranks as one of my favorite places to stay in London. The location is really excellent for those who enjoy exploring the capital. Green and Hyde Parks are close by as is Oxford Street, Regents Street and Piccadilly Circus. The Underground stop is about a four minute walk. The rooms are small but very comfortable and the breakfast is a wonderful way to start a London morning. Highly recommended!",4,2011,12,22
144,Quaint Contradiction,"We stayed here in November. Though we have visited the area many times and are familiar with a number of good hotels, we felt like trying something different this trip. Thus we selected Flemings Mayfair which is associated with “Small & Elegant Hotels, International.”  While the hotel is nice in many ways we felt at over US$ 380 a night for a small room (breakfast not included), better values are to be found elsewhere in the Mayfair/Knightsbridge/South Kensington corridor. The highlights- an outstanding location with friendly staff, a clean room adequately furnished and in good repair with good linens and robes, lots of electric outlets and good temperature control. Front desk and concierge services were excellent.  The not so good- our room was very tiny even by London standards with creaky floors and a creaky bed, no place with both an outlet and a mirror to dry your hair, a small desk-table squeezed into a dark alcove with no lighting and while the closet was roomy, there were no shelves or drawers to be found. The bathroom layout was poor having to almost straddle the commode to use the sink and the shower enclosure was useless. “Quaint” refers to the fact the hotel has been assembled over the years from a collection of adjoining buildings with different levels and floors and its purported upscale, traditional and elegant English style. The “Contradiction” is our tiny room was neither upscale nor elegant.",3,2011,12,22
144,excellent,"we could not fault our stay at this hotel, the staff were very friendly and helpfull, rooms very good. Allround a great hotel.",5,2011,12,18
144,Expensive,"Stayed 3 nights at Flemings.
Excellent location. Friendly staff. 
Small bedrooms for a 4 stars hotel.",4,2011,12,16
144,Good value for the area,"Stayed here one night for a meeting the following day.  We chose the hotel for having a reasonably priced meeting room and (of course) its position.  The classic bedroom was a good size for one person and looked recently decorated.  When I arrived the desk lamp didn't work but it was quickly repaired.  The room wasn't noisy as others have experienced but it was on the 3rd. floor.  Front desk staff were very polite and helpful. 
Dinner in the restaurant was excellent though service, both at dinner and breakfast, could have been faster.
My three overseas colleagues were also enthusiastic so we'll probably return.",5,2011,12,16
144,Second stay here was as great as the first!,"Stayed here April 2011, and most recently during the first week of December 2011.   The location is perfect -  right off Piccadilly in the heart of Mayfair.  Green Park tube is just a short 3 blocks away and you can get anywhere in London from here with just a short tube ride. Green Park itself is right across the street, with a Starbucks, Pret, and Marks and Spencer 2 blocks away.  There is a great area situated at the opposite end of Half Moon St called Shepards Market.  It is so quaint with little alleys and nooks and crannies, full of all types of wonderful restaurants- it's like a hidden treasure.  To the left on Piccadilly is The Ritz and Fortnum & Mason. (don't miss it!)  To the right is Hard Rock Cafe.   I felt very, very safe walking around this area, even after dark.

Now for specifics about Flemings itself.  There is a small lobby, which was tastefully decorated with 2 Christmas trees. There aren't too many places to sit in the lobby.  While waiting for a ride, I had to sit on a rather uncomfortable upright chair.  I would suggest they add some more comfortable seating areas and a few tables to the lobby, as it is rather sparse. There is always a doorman, complete with a top hat and tails to open the door for you!  All of the staff here is extremely professional. polite and friendly and always willing to assist you in any way possible.  The lift that takes you to your room is a fun surprise, upon opening, it looks like it is a library, lined with books!   I requested the same room I had in April, Room 303, which is an Executive Single for 1 with a double bed.  It was great having the same room, I really felt at home.  The room is typical for London, a little small.  If you are looking for an American-style hotel room, this isn't it - there's no view and it's smaller than what we're used to, but that's not a bad thing- just different.  The room is so cosy and comfortable and there's window in the bedroom and one in the bathroom, as well.  Most importantly, the room and bathroom are spotless!  The bed has a duvet ( so much better than a bedpread!) and four comfy pillows.  The bed is incredibly comfortable.  The bathroom is spacious with a marble floor and vanity.  There's plenty of counter space for all your toiletries.  There's a heated towel rack, which is such a luxury on those cold winter mornings.  The room has a desk, flat screen TV and 2 mirrored armoires.  One is for storing clothes, the other has tea/coffee maker, mini fridge, and a safe.  The prices for Flemings can be quite variable.  If you really look hard, you can get a good price.  Both times I stayed here I was able to get a good deal after searching the web.  Cons: no free wifi or breakfast.  I thought maybe since I was a returning guest they'd throw in one or the other for free, but no.  I just bring cereal bars and make tea in my room for breakfast, as the hotel breakfast is quite expensive and I generally only eat a light breakfast anyway. I did have dinner at The Grill downstairs one night.  The dining room, bar and tea rooms downstairs are decorated so beautifully!  The service was impeccable, the food was so, so with small portions, typical of nouveau-cuisine.  I had wanted to try the afternoon tea here, but didn't have time this stay, but hope to do so next time because the rooms down here are so gorgeous I really want to spend more time down there!",5,2011,12,16
144,"Almost best location and service possible, but...","With the underground next door, a few minutes walk to all major attractions, the location of this hotel is outstanding. Same is valid for the service, extremly friendly staff. Breakfast is ok, again friendly staff.

Fitness is 5 min walk away with very good equipment.

Rooms are clean

However I will most probably not return to this place because: 

- The standard single is simply a joke. With dark coulours in the room and the extremly limited size you really dont feel like spending time in your Small Luxury Hotel room. I did not pay attention on their website, but the single room is 8m2. How can this be possible as part of a luxury chain??? If this were a real small luxury hotel they would avoid giving this kind of rooms away and upgrade without asking for GBP 30 / 60. 

- I find a 15 GBP charge for Internet far too expensive.",3,2011,12,16
144,"Nice location, poorly maintained rooms and bathrooms","We just spent four nights at this hotel. Excellent location and friendly staff at the front desk and dining room. The common areas have been renovated, but not the bedrooms and bathrooms, small, old and poorly maintained. Of the four rooms we had, two were acceptable in size and two unnacceptable for a four stars hotel. They were very small, noisy ( you could here everything going on on street, corridor and neighboring rooms), smelly, with no curtains, only blinds and tiny bathrooms ( 3 sqm!!).
Certainly this is not a four stars hotel nor a slh.",3,2011,12,13

144,Christmas lunch at Flemings Hotel,"Visited the hotel for a group lunch on 02.12.11.  Arrived late (rail problems), but this was not a problem.  My meal was delicious and the service was excellent.  It was mentioned that we should return next year.  Thank you to all the staff who were so helpful.",5,2011,12,04
144,Wonderful Lunch,Visited the hotel for lunch on 03/12 /2011 . From the moment we were greeted at the restaurant we had a lovley experiance. Food and service was excellant great value for money and will be visiting again in the future. Young waitress who served us was very attentive and a credit to the hotel . Food was impeccable fine dining at its very best . The price well I thought it was the bargain of the century. Many thanks for a very pleasurable time .,5,2011,12,03
144,Excellent Service and Location!,"The staff at this hotel are amazing! Very accommodating with early check in at the front desk, extremely friendly.  The bellman and concierge were very helpful at all times.  My aunt and I stayed here for two nights before joining the Queen Mary 2 out of Southampton.  The rooms were very clean and updated.  I have to agree with the the review that said choose the locations of your room wisely, we were beside a housekeeping closet and there was some noise early every morning.  The service and quality of the hotel more than made up for it, but if you can ask for a quiet location.

Breakfast was included in our room rate, it was a nice spread in the hotel restaurant on the lower level, the restaurant was very nice, very funky and  contemporary decor, the same goes for the drawing room off the lobby.

Location, location, location! Less than a ten minute walk from Buckingham Palace, two minutes to the Green Park tube station, 15 minutes from Piccadilly Circus.

I highly recommend this hotel!",5,2011,12,02

144,Very nice indeed!,"We stayed here last weekend and we were very impressed by the whole experience. The staff were very helpful and polite, the decor of the public rooms is spot-on and the breakfast was very good indeed.

144,Excellent Accomodations,Stayed over three nights during November 2011. The staff was welcoming and helpful during the entire stay. The room was comfortable and quiet with a spacious bathroom.

144,would love to keep this one a secret but its too good!!!,"my husband and i stayed at Flemings with our 8yr old daughter for a birthday celebrations weekend. We had very yummy cup cakes and champagne in the afternoon and cannot fault the service. Very attentive but not overpowering. The Room was spacious, clean and very relaxing! Little cakes and a teddy went down a treat with our daughter. Breakfast was great and again the waiting staff could not do enough for us! Will be staying again in the future... well done Flemings.",5,2011,11,21
144,Sublime afternoon tea,"We had afternoon tea at the hotel on the 18th Nov and it could not be faulted - we did have a great offer with afternoontea.co.uk, which meant two afternoon teas for £30 - a real bargain

Fantastic surroundings, great service and wonderful food - the freshest bread I have ever tasted, delicious cake and scones, then sublime pastries and wonderful home-made truffles. Our tea pots were replenished several times - overall a 5* experience! Thank you so much",5,2011,11,19
144,Hidden gem of a hotel,"The location is, indeed, terrific: on a quiet, attractive street, close to the business district, tourist attractions and shopping. There's even a cluster of good bistro-style restaurants and pubs just around the corner, in Shepherd's Market. We were particularly happy with our room and the common areas of the hotel, which have been decorated with an eccentric flair that is a refreshing change from big hotel blandness. The front desk staff were pleasant and helpful, service was somewhat poor at breakfast in the dining room, but the food was quite good. We felt as though we had stumbled upon a real 'find' and will definitely return on future visits.",4,2011,11,18
144,"Cozy, great location","We only stayed in this hotel for two nights but it was very lovely and close to all the attractions such as Buckingham Palace, Westminster Abbey, Trafalgar Square , shopping and parks.",4,2011,11,14
144,"Great location, nice decor, horrific service","The hotel is in a brilliant location, about 4 minutes walk from Buckingham Palace.  The rooms were small, but very nice although some might find the decor a little bit gordy and even tacky. I understand you are paying for the location, however for the price you would expect the service to be excellent. Unfortunately the bar/breakfast staff were exceptionally slow & incompetent. A room service cup of tea took 30 minutes to arrive (by which point we had cancelled it). Three bar staff took almost 15 minutes to make three gin & tonics when there were no other customers, but were perfectly happy to charge £10 per drink. Finally at breakfast I was asked to repeat my order 3 times, as we're other members of my party. My porridge took almost 40 minutes to arrive, and one member of the party didn't end up eating despite requesting eggs benefit numerous times. Finally by the time the staff brought milk around the tea had gone cold. The hotel really needs to work on its service! ",3,2011,11,13
144,Location,"My wife and I stayed for two nights over a weekend, we were lucky enough to be upgraded on check in to an apartment.
The apartment was lovely, spacious, clean and with lots of extras, however it was on the ground floor, this proved to be a small issue when we tried to sleep and were kept awake by the rumbling underground trains.
I have to say though the Hotel were superb and changed our apartment without issue to one on a higher floor which again was superb.

The staff at the Hotel were excellent and the service outstanding. The Hotel is a townhouse though with narrow corridors and creaking floor boards.

Overall a great base for central London, perfectly placed for everything.",4,2011,11,09
144,Ideal Location,"This must be the single best location for a London visit.  Flemings Mayfair is half a block from Piccadilly, just across Green Park from Buckingham Palace, and a couple of short blocks from the Green Park tube station, which has three different lines.  I walked to Piccadilly Circus or the theatres every day.  I wish I could say I loved everything about the hotel.  Everything was immaculate, and the tiny bathroom had great facilities.  The room was very small, as I expected, but I found the decor to be really unattractive, and I didn't really enjoy spending time in the room.  I didn't enjoy the public areas either, as a rule.  Some of the hotel staff members were just perfect, and others were just mean -- especially to each other.",4,2011,11,07
144,Just wonderful,"I have just returned from a 3-night stay at Flemings hotel in London and I am NOT looking forward to my own bed, for a change! I experienced the most restful nights in the lovely, perfectly spotless room (classic double). This relatively small hotel is wonderful even before getting to it: the location (a couple of minutes' walk from Green Park and then on a short delightful stroll - or jog - to Buckingham Palace, underground station, buses, the Royal Academy of Arts, then the iconic Piccadilly Circus), the quiet, totally safe, elegant street, the refined exterior. Once past the door, you're greeted by always smiling, efficient, helpful, yet discreet and unintimidating staff. The room I stayed in was surprisingly spacious for London standards (undoubtedly, our American friends will find it quite small, but I will repeat ""for London standards""; I stayed in a couple of otherwise excellent and more expensive hotels in central London, and the difference in size is impressive!). Immaculate, quiet, no view to speak of, as I was at the back and could mainly see some air-conditioning boxes and walls, but one assumes that being in London you want to look at the view once outside!), everything in perfect working order, excellent plumbing and water pressure (another possible issue in London hotels...). A small extra point - it was a pleasure to walk down the corridor to my room with lovely classic film stars tasteful black and white photos on the walls;  to sneak a secret smile and wink to Gregory Peck each morning and evening was a treat!!",5,2011,11,06
144,traditional boutique hotel,"location is very good ( very close to piccadilly )for this small boutique hotel with a good value for money. Decor is nice and classic, and everything is clean and quite new and rooms are well manteined. Room size is quite small for 2 people, but it's ok.24 h. Room service is quick and not too expensive if compared with room service price menu of most hotels. Everybody make you feel very welcome and almost at home. Service is quite efficient. There is just one elevator  and sometimes you have to wait for a while.I'll come back again for sure!",4,2011,11,06
144,Good Value for Top Location,"Flemings is in the heart of Mayfair, but because it's on a side street, the sleep quality is good. The hotel is super conveniently located: walking distance to many of the top attractions in London and the Green Park station is literally a couple of blocks away. 

The rooms are nicely appointed and the beds are comfy, but the rooms are quite small and can feel stuffy. The bathrooms have been updated and are generally quite clean, but I still get frustrated when I see mold in the corners of the bathtub (London or not). They include 30 minutes of free computer time in the lobby, otherwise there is a charge for WiFi.

The staff were friendly and helpful and make this hotel feel a bit more personal than some of the larger chains. They even sent a hand-written note thanking a member of our family who mailed them a forgotten room key! Totally unnecessary, but nice touch. I found the rates to be very competitive for this area of London.",4,2011,10,30
144,Great Location,"The staff are all very friendly, pleasant and helpful. The hotel is clean, cosy and well maintained.  It is in an excellent location with Regent Street, Piccadilly etc within easy walking distance. The only negative is that the bedrooms are very small and my room had a steep sloping roof which made me feel a bit claustrophobic.",4,2011,10,27
144,"Best Staff, Best Location, Best Value","We have stayed at the Flemings Mayfair twice in a two-year period, both times for at least four days.  While the cost is often diffcult for us given our middle-class income and the fact that we must travel from Los Angeles to enjoy their hosptality, the hotel is definitely the cornerstone of our enjoyment of our trips to London.  The rooms are spacious even by U.S. standards, always spotlessly clean, with good climate controls for any season. The beds are firm but not overly so, and while I am most definitely a difficult person to please in this category, I have often slept better there than when at home in Southern California, something which has never happened anywhere else.  The restaurant is small but comfortable, with a wonderful menu, highly recommended if you have a little extra for a truly fine dining experience.  But the primary thing that sets the Flemings-Mayfair apart is the staff.  I have absolutely never been treated with such a combination of respect and kindness before.  The staff truly cared if we enjoyed every day of our vacations, going out of their way repeatedly to save us money, find us theatre seats, help us plan our tours of the city, etc. etc. etc.  With absolutely no exaggeration, they feel like family to us, and we are always sorry to leave.  Yes, it costs more than some bed and breakfast, but trust me, you will know where your money went when you stay there; the comfort of the room alone is more than worth the difference.  Finally, the hotel is only about 300 yards (280 metres) from Buckingham Palace, directly next to Piccadilly Street and Green Park Station for the Underground, and there are many very affordable and wonderful ethnic restaurants within two minutes walking distance.  We love the Flemings-Mayfair and would not stay anywhere else in London.",5,2011,10,19
144,Fantastic one night city stay,"This was our first stay at Flemings, and won't be our last. Great location, which meant that we could cram lots in even though we only stayed for one night. Had a late evening dinner at the restaurant and the food was fantastic, as were all of the staff who couldn't do enough to accomodate us during our stay. Would highly recommend this hotel.",5,2011,10,03
144,"Very good,no faults,would stay again","Just returned from a one night stay, we stayed in the apartments which were brilliant, very large clean and well kept, we couldn't ask for more, breakfast good as you would have expect, location perfect for us, staff were helpfully, pleasent and looked like they enjoyed there job, would stay here again,",4,2011,09,30
144,"Great Service,Great Location,Great
Break","This was our second visit to Flemings.
Whilst we enjoyed our stay 2
years ago the improvement in
service and quality of dining
was very noticeable.
The location is great for the
Parks,Buckingham Palace and
the Thames.
Theatreland is a short taxi or

There are many back street walks

144,relaxing charming hotel,"My wife and I stayed here for 1 night while passing through london in one of there apartments. It was a very luxurious location with everything you could hope for and lovely little touches. I think its more for people who will be in London for longer stays, maybe on business but I heartly recommend it.",5,2011,09,29
144,Little gem in the heart of london.,"Wonderful boutique hotel in the heart of central London. Off a main street so no noise issues. The staff were very friendly and accommodating. The breakfast was excellent, the rooms great value and the location perfect. Very good value.",5,2011,09,25
144,Large room for London!,"Stayed at Flemings at the end of my trip to Cornwall and London.  They upgraded our room to one just behind reception (which they showed us first incase we did not like it).  I thought the size was fab given that West End hotels rooms are normally very small.  The room was quite dark as the only window overlooked a very small enclosed area which other rooms backed onto so the blinds had to be almost closed.  Saying that, I loved the location as it was 2 mins from Shepherds Market and Bond Street - I would highly recommend this hotel.",5,2011,09,22
144,Nice hotel in a Great Central Location,"Stayed here a while back on a package through Virgin Vacations.  It was a little bit higher in price than their cheapest options, but was worth every penny.  The staff were very friendly and accomodating whenever we needed something.  The location was great, on a quiet side street just off of Green Park, and only two blocks from the Green Park tube station.  You're less than 5 minutes from Buckingham Palace and 5 minutes from Hyde Park.  Great location in central Mayfair, which is a really nice part of London.  Was kind of surprised to see Ferrari's and Rolls Royce's parked on the street nearby.  Shepherds Market is only about a block away and is a small neighborhood area filled with restaurants and pubs that can keep you taken care of for dinner.  The rooms were smallish, but nicely furnished and clean.  Air conditioning was adequate, but not great.  The downstairs breakfast area had attentive staff and a nice selection to get you going for the day.  Would definitely stay here again just based on location alone.",4,2011,09,18
144,"Nice location, otherwise a bit disappointing for the price","This is London. Anything without fleas and bed bugs will cost you, especially if it's high season.  I've been to London 6 times this year, and this time finally decided to stay here because I've visited friends who have stayed here. Would I recommend it? Only for its location.  Though this price is almost the minimum for a decent stay in Mayfair/dead central London, there are other places at a similar price (£245+20% VAT) that more adequately correspond to their class.
  
What I liked:  the rooms themselves, though a bit small are nice.  Mine was wall-papered with a monochromatic floral motif with silver flowers. The headboard and desk were made of skate shagreen (like RY Augousti).  The layout was cozy.  The ceilings are quite low, and for this reason, the room can seem darker and smaller than it really is, but is well lit with lamps and recessed lighting.  It is 5 minutes walk from Green Park, 10 minutes to Mount Street, 15 minutes to Bond Street, 20 minutes to Oxford Street. 

What I didn't like:  there was a welcome card in the room with the wrong name on it.  They put one with the correct name on it later, but never took the old one away.  There was a complimentary bottle of water which they removed after the first night.  Not sure why...? Maybe they refrigerated it? Who knows, it just wasn't on my desk anymore.  

The hotel clearly opted to skip the bathrooms during the refurb of the rooms. They are sooooo 20th century, and not in a good way.  The caulking around the tub in my room was coming away from the wall and the cleaning staff obviously couldn't be bothered to clean well on a regular basis, so there is visible mildew build up in pockets where the wall meets the tub.  The shower head, which is large overhead and fixed, was encrusted with mineral deposits, so there was just a brown crust on it all over.  The toilet seat was very loose. I asked for it to be fixed, and it was not. The bathroom was tiny-- the door opened into it, and the available floor space was exactly the length of the door. You had to basically sit on the toilet to close it.  Honestly, I was turned off by the appearance that the bathrooms didn't seem to be consistently well-cleaned, hence leading to the pockets of filth.

The mattress was pretty poor quality-- I took two nurofen the first night to compensate.

The hotel is creaky, and very loud with a zillion little stairs (2 or 3) every 3-4 meters, and fire doors. I heard the neighbors walking in the room above me, and outside in the hall way, as well as the fire doors opening and closing continuously. The gap under the room door was so high that even with lights out there was a glaring hallway light that came through underneath, and I had no eye-mask to compensate.

During the day, there was a vacuum stored in the hallway outside my room.

144,Wonderful experience at the Flemings,"We stayed for 7 nights at the Flemings for our first time in London and found it to be as perfect a stay as we could have ever had.  The staff was so wonderful (wearing tails even) to us, even greeting us every time we got back from someplace they very likely could have recommended, they were very good at that too,  our room was very comfortable and a good size, every need was attended to quickly and with a nice smile and kind words.  I would never stay anyplace else if we ever got back to London.  The location was another plus, 2 minutes to Pickadilly St. and across the street from Buckingham palace thru Green Park, which was beautiful.  The breakfast room was elegant and the staff there very very accommodating.  I can't say enough about this beautiful little hotel and the staff.",5,2011,09,14
144,The not so clean Flemings....,"On checking in to the Flemings in Mayfair,we were positively surprised. The athmosphere and staff were very nice. The hotel seemed to be newly refurbised and neat. On entering the room, it smelled a bit iffy, but otherwise everything seemed fine. After 2 nights I noticed a rash on my torso and this got worse during our 4-day stay there - spreading to the back in a nice line pattern and on the upper thighs. Not connecting this to bed-bug bites (never been bitten before), I only realised on getting home and presenting the rash to my GP that this was a rash caused by bed bugs. On contacting the hotel, they deny having bed bugs and ensure me that they will remove any mentioning of this from the web. The hotel has hopefully dealt with the matter in a proper way (although not committing to the problem). To be on the safe side, please check for traces under the bedsheets.",1,2011,09,14
144,Good mid-range hotel in central London,"We stayed at the Flemigs Hotel on Half Moon Street in July 2011 for 2 nights. We signed up for the special weekend package which included breakfast and a glass of champagne and a cup cake (!). The breakfast options are good and service was with a smile and great enthusiasm. Our check-in was also efficient and friendly. The location is superb with easy access to Green Park, Hyde Park and Green Park station. The lobby etc is not much to write about but then again that is typical of a mid-range hotel in central london. The room we chose was adequately sized with a small bathroom. Clean and did the job for us in a reasonable price range.",4,2011,09,13
144,Will definitely be back,"Love the styling in this townhouse hotel - and the location for touring was amazing. All staff were very friendly and accomodating, some of the previous complaints on this site have me scratching my head.

Our ground floor room was immaculate and of sufficient size. It faced out on Clarges Street and was very quiet. Our breakfasts were very good as well. 

The hop-on hop-off bus tour stop was directly across the street at Green Park, and Buckingham Palace was a 5-minute walk away. We visited the state rooms and saw the wedding dress and the lovely Faberge exhibit. Loved it!  For dinners we enjoyed The Punch Bowl, a pub owned by Guy Ritchie a few blocks away and The Wolseley on Piccadilly. I'm still dreaming about that yorkshire pudding and lemon meringue dessert. We wanted more time to explore Shepherd's market that is just around the corner. 

The hotel lost a star solely because of the air conditioning system in our room was not working properly, and they seemed to be unsure on how to go about fixing it...

I would love to return to this hotel, and will definitely be recommending to friends and family.",4,2011,09,09
144,An outstanding hotel,"Returning to Flemings, which I am not able to do often enough, is always a great pleasure.  Other guests clearly feel likewise.  The staff are invariably friendly and helpful, the rooms well designed, and the location exceptional both for tourism and business.  I walk to most of my appointments.  The hotel is small enough that one receives personalized attention, but all services one would expect in a larger establishment are on offer.  The interior has been renovated over recent years, with flair, and the fine hotel team can rightly take great pride in their hotel.   Bravo!",5,2011,09,05
144,A Gem in Mayfair,"This was a family vacation with our 12 year-old son.  The apartments are connected to the Flemings Mayfair Hotel, but with a separarte street entrance on Clarges Street.  The location is ideal for exploring central London: a 30-second walk to the bus stop or a 2-minute walk to Green Park underground station which connects everywhere!  There are a dozen or more restaurants and pubs within a 5-minue walk.  The neighborhood is safe, clean, and full of shops for all your basic needs.

We stayed in the 2-BR penthouse flat. Everything about this property exceded my expectations.  Each room had a king bed (one with a fold-out sofa, as well) and adjoining full bath.  The apartment offered all the comforts of home for our weeks' stay.  The kitchen was fully equipped, including washer/dryer, dishwasher and all the usual appliances.  Even the 'fridge was partially stocked with the basics. A small terrace was available, but the courtyard view was not spectacular. 

We felt really special with a private elevator (with security key access) directly into our aprtment, welcome gifts upon arrival, daily newspaper, turn down service daily, concierge suggestions, and more.   

We would definitely return!",5,2011,09,01
144,Excellant Location and we'll be back!,"Service Excellent
Accommadation  Excellent 
Location Excellent Close To All Amenities Very Central.",5,2011,08,25
144,Really enjoyable and will definitely be back!,"We stayed here for 3 nights and had a really good time.  The hotel is lovely, within easy walking distance of Buckingham Palace and Piccadilly Circus, and everything was modern, clean and smart.  We don't understand previous bad reviews for breakfast because there was plenty of choice, everything was tasty, well-cooked and beautifully presented.  All the staff we spoke to during our stay, without exception, were friendly and helpful which helped make our stay so pleasant.  Particular mention goes to Hannah who was bright, cheerful and helpful at breakfast every day - and well done to all the staff who were a pleasure to talk to.  We would definitely stay here again when we come back to London.",4,2011,08,25
144,DISAPPOINTING,"My husband and I stayed here recently for my birthday weekend. Visually, the place looks great - but from their point of view, you cant just rely on the visual aspect.

I agree with other reviews; the breakfast is possibly the worst we have come across. Staff also are just not nice at breakfast. A course in Customer Service would not go amiss!!!

When we arrived (late afternoon) we just wanted something to nibble on until our evening meal. This proved rather difficult! Firstly we were told that we could eat in the downstairs bar, but were then told that because we wanted a cupcake (after some food) we would have to go upstairs to the lounge, but that in the lounge we could not have food, only cupcakes. I am really not sure what that was about, other than that someone couldnt be bothered serving us.

We then found another waiter who said that this was rubbish and we could have what we want where we want. Thank goodness for someone who sees the potential of making money!!! :0) He was excellent and we ended up with nibbles and cupcakes. All very nice indeed!  Maybe he should be promoted to the manager :0)

The rooms were more than adequate and the reception staff were very friendly.

Would we go again? Probably not. Would we recommend it? Possibly not - but it certainly wasnt the worst place we have stayed.",3,2011,08,23
144,"Nice Hotel, some drawbacks....","At the end of our fly and drive tour of England we stayed two nights in London. The check-in was ok and the rooms were already ready at 11am. We were three so we had a single and a double rooms. The first singled room (a double for single use) was in a noisy location but the hotel with no problems changed us to another more quite room. The location of the hotel is simply fantastic: very close to many attractions of London on foot. I have to stay the staff is very friendly and helpful: to organize a transfer to the airport, to suggest a restaurant, etc. The single room was fine, small but for a single room it is what you should expect. The double room was in my opinion too small for a Small Luxury Hotel. The room was overall ok, the only negative thing was a noise for the whole night (and day) coming, I suppose, from a ventilation system or something like that. The bathroom again is too small for a Small Luxury Hotel. In the room you will find very good Gilchrist and Soames amenities. The second night at 6.15 am the fire alarm rang for two or three times, for a few seconds only but was enough to wake me up and to trouble my sleep. The breakfast is fine, maybe for a four stars hotel member of the Small Luxury Hotel chain the choice of food could be improved especially for guests having the continental breakfast. Overall a nice stay at Flemings but will think carefully again if return to this hotel or to another (the hotel is not very cheap)!!",3,2011,08,23
144,Highly recommended,"Very pleased with the overall experience. Very warm and friendly welcome, with sumptuous and immaculate reception and public rooms. The restaurant was particularly warm and relaxing.

Perhaps the room was slightly less 'SLH' than I'm used to in other properties of a similar standard, there were one or two oddities in the room. There wasn't a clock or any means of setting an alarm of telling the time, which seemed a bit odd. The flat-screen TV was of poor quality soundwise (very 'boomy') and the picture was generally a tad blurry, but I wasn't staying at the property to watch television. 

The one odd thing I did notice was the shower. The bathroom ceiling was extremely low, and by the time one had stepped into the bath, the shower head itself ended up at shoulder level, which meant having to 'duck under'  and do things in stages, which wasn't the normal way of  'soaking away the stress' under a shower.

I'll certainly be back there again though, and would recommend it to anyone looking for solid quality and ambience.",5,2011,08,22
144,absolutely lovely hotel!,"i stayed there with a friend of mine for 9 nights, we were quite iffy about it since we've never heard of it but we definitely loved it! the staff was unbelievably friendly and helpful, we requested a room change since we were next to the housekeeping closet so we heard all the noise coming in and out of the closet, but the staff was very helpful showing us all other rooms suitable and made us choose. the rooms are quite small but so are all other rooms in london, the bed is veeery comfortable, A/C is available, the design of the lobby  and front room is modern and elegant. i enjoyed having Tesco around one corner and green park station around the other corner which made it easier for me to get around .its not cheap but i definitely enjoyed my stay and will be back again",5,2011,08,16
144,A really nice hotel,"My gf and I stayed here for 8 nites while on holiday.  We both are v particular abt hotel accommodation and we did some research before selecting Flemmings.  It was a new place for us (we are more familiar with the usual Hilton, Marriott etc) but we were not disappointed.  Altho the room is not v big, we loved its cleanliness, cosiness and location.  As mentioned by others, it's near to Green Park and station, and not far from good eating places.  We didn't chose the hotel bf but we ate every morning at a little alley 5 mins away which contained 2 cafes, subway, lola's cupcakes, starbucks.
And for me, the clincher was the ensuite bathroom.  I am v particular abt this and this one was roomy and spotlessly clean, one of the best I've seen so far.",5,2011,08,15
144,Feels like home - i love it!,"I have stayed in Flemings on business too many times to remember and it now feels like a second home.  The staff are lovely and the hotel in fantastic.  In the heart of Mayfair making it the ideal location for exploring, a walk across Green Park takes you straight to Buckingham Palace and you are so close to all the shops.  The food at Flemings is equally good, the breakfasts delicious and if you can afford i,t a suite is beautiful. 100% recommended",5,2011,08,13
144,Flemings made our break extra special..... we'll DEFINITELY return,"From the opening of the door on arrival to our departure, the service from all staff was courteous, friendly and seemed motivated by a genuine desire to help/please.  Our room combined comfort, warmth and elegance, the food was good and it is well worth dining in the evening (we had an excellent pre-theatre, early evening meal) -  don't forget to try the cocktails......

The location was excellent with easy access to the West End and shows, for walking to see the sites and with parks close by for your early morning fitness walk/run.  Green Park underground is a minute away.....

I wish we could have stayed longer.... and we certainly won't be looking to stay anywhere else when we next visit London....",5,2011,08,13
144,Fabulous stay at Flemings Hotel,"My husband and I stayed 3 nights here with 2 other couples.  Arrival was very smooth, our rooms were very small but the beds were comfy.  The entire staff at Flemings were friendly, helpful, and always willing to make your stay stress free.  The cocktail bar is a great place to relax.  If you didn't pre book your tickets for events, get them at the concierge desk.",4,2011,08,12
144,Very elegant with good service.  Great location,"We went for a family trip with an extended group and found the Flemings to be well situated, close to the underground, great breakfast, quiet and very clean and comfortable.  I would definitely recommend it!",4,2011,08,12
144,Great little hotel,"This was my first time in recent years staying at Flemings, I did stay a couple of times 15 to 20 years ago when I was a child - my Dad still tells the story of how impressed I was that there was a man to open the door for me! I returned for a long weekend with my parents as it's one of their favourite hotels in London. The staff are fantastic, friendly and efficient. The public areas are stunning - although the mirrored dining room can be a bit too much to face first thing in the morning! We had rooms on the ground floor, they were nice if a little small (but not bad for London!) and to be honest are a bit too traditional for my tastes but my parents really like them. The continental breakfast is pretty good - I would have liked to see a bread basket to accompany the cheese rather than just croissants but the muesli was excellent, as was the cooked breakfast. Overall a great little hotel in a fantastic location.",4,2011,08,11
144,fourth time,"We have stayed in this hotel for 4 times, last time last May, we love this hotel, its near the undergroud, Green Park, you can walk to all nice places (shops, parks, Buckingham Palace etc.), The hotel is very nice, nice rooms, we book it with breakfast which is very good, staff very friendly, when we go to London again we will certainly stay here again, even if we want to go with our children.",5,2011,08,07
144,Boutique in the heart of London,I have stayed at Flemings once or twice a year now for 10 years.. It is perfectly situated in the heart of London (Mayfair) and is a little gem.Recently they have done some renovations which give it a bit of a style edge which other hotels in the area do not have. I have also several times stayed in the apartments which are traditionally decorated in keeping with the area and offer a great amount of space. Perfect for a family visit to London. I would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel to anyone. Branca and the staff will make everyone feel like it is their home away from home.,5,2011,08,03
144,A lovely hotel in a wonderful location,"My wife and I stayed in London to celebrate our wedding anniverary at the end of July.  We were looking for a hotel in Mayfair close to some of the major attractions and within easy walking distance of the royal parks.  Flemings Mayfair is a member of Small Luxury Hotels of the World, and as you would expect, it is a hotel of good quality.  It's located only a short walk from Green Park tube station, just off Park Lane.  Buckingham Palace, Hyde Park, Clarence House, Piccadilly and Bond Street are all nearby.  The hotel is quietly positional along Half Moon Street and we were greeted very warmly by the doorman and the receptionist.  We were given a lovely upgrade into a Junior Suite which had a four-poster bed and was very charming and spacious.  The public areas of the hotel have been refurbished and this has extended to some of the guest rooms - it looks like they're updating the hotel quite considerably and in a more contemporary style.  Our room was classically English and I hope they retain some of this style during the refurbishment.  As we were only staying for a night at the hotel, we didn't make the most of all the facilities on offer, but the restaurant and drawing room looked most attractive.  Flemings Mayfair was well priced and perfectly positioned.  We were extremely comfortable and will definitely stay at the hotel again when we're next in London.",5,2011,08,02
144,Lovely hotel and absolutely wonderful staff!,"My niece and I stayed 5 nights at the Flemings and had a wonderful stay.  The restaurant was so good we ended up eating most of our dinners there.  The chefs served up a flavorful and tasty menu for their diners.  The entire staff from front desk, waiters, Concierge (thanks Paul for all your help), and housekeeping were friendly and took care of all our needs. I think the Flemings has the most unique and charming elevator I have ever seen...  I am sure there is a secret passage hidden within all of the books. Location is everything and they were just a few steps from Green Park station and the heart of Piccadilly.  It is a hidden gem in the heart of London.",5,2011,08,01
144,"Great location, great room!","We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights in July, and were very happy with it.
As mentioned, the location is great - safe, quiet, but in easy walking distance to all the attractions.  Our room was a junior suite, and although it was on the ground floor (or slightly lower actually), there was a big window in the bedroom, and a door out to a window-well type outdoor area, which allowed plenty of light in.  We also found it to be roomy, and very quiet and private, and the decor in the room was very well done.
We found the service quite good over all - check in and check out were pleasant and efficient, and the concierge and doormen were very helpful and friendly. 
The only issue we found was in the breakfast room...on our first morning there, we arrived late (about 20 minutes before it closed), and asked if we could still come in and the lady was very welcoming and said absolutely.  But once we were seated, no one wanted to serve us....we actually heard 2 wait staff near us saying ""you serve them"" ""no, you serve them"" (very unprofessional!!!)....and neither one did!  We think they didn't want to get stuck working any longer than necessary!  Finally, the lady who appeared to run the breakfast room came and asked us if we had ordered since the kitchen was about to close, and we said we've been trying hard!....so she took our order, and everything was fine after that.  The next couple of mornings were much better.  The food was pretty good.
We had also arranged airport pickup by car through the hotel, and after a long and tiring flight were very glad we had done so....a bit expensive but well worth it.  The driver was also great!
So, overall, we enjoyed our time in London, and staying at this hotel added to our experience.  I would recommend it.",5,2011,07,28
144,amazing afternoon tea,"went to flemings mayfair for afternoon tea with a friend. the outside looks impressive yet its far more impressive on the inside. 
excellent interior, really beautiful and feels really grand. 
the drawing room looks lovely but we were downstairs in the grill/resturant/cocktail bar. this was equally amazing. lovely colours and decor. 

staff were friendly and attentive and we asked to be moved (away from a large, loud group) and that was totally fine and they did everything to accomodate us. 

Food was delicious and the tea was lovely too. loads to teas to choose from. lovely sandwiches, scones and victoria sponge (my favourite) lovely little cakes etc on the top layer. the mini cupcake was actually my least favourite(a lbit dry) surprising seeing as they advertise it as one of the highlights as they are from the primrose bakery. even so lovely food. 
felt really pampered. will def go back! thankyou",5,2011,07,23
144,Nice Location,"The location is close to Buckingham palace and within a decent walk of parliament, Big Ben, Westminster Abbey and Trafalgar Square. Staff were pretty professional.",3,2011,07,20
144,"Not bad at all, and with a certain old-school charm","As the hotel is made of several old buildings, the corridors are narrow and winding, with unusual changes in level, however this adds to the charm. I have stayed more than once and have been happy with the rooms, which although very small, were clean, stylishly fitted out, and very comfortable. The location is excellent, and the staff are helpful. My only complaint is the very expensive breakfast, but as there are plenty of cafes nearby, this is not a real problem. The hotel seems to regularly offer special rates, which makes a big difference, as without them it is pretty pricey (although this is partly explained by the exclusive location).",4,2011,07,20
144,Beautiful,"We stayed in this hotel for a short break.

The room was beautiful, the bathroom was small considering the size of the room but adequate. Beds were comfortable.

The hotel is in a quiet street, a 15 minute walk from Picadilly Circus, good links to the tube (Green Park) and within walking distance of Buckingham Palace. Overall a nice, quiet location.

The biggest disappointment was by far the breakfast. The service was poor, having to ask several times for the most basic of things, this really let the hotel down and considering the price we paid, was not acceptable. However, the food was fresh and there was plenty of choice available.

Overall if the problems with the service at breakfast are rectified this is a lovely, central hotel which is well worth the money.",4,2011,07,17
144,"Good location and nice rooms, not sure about the service","The location of the hotel is excellent - there is a walking distance to anywhere in central London. Hotel in itself is pretty (though too much bling bling to my 13 year daughters taste). Our twin room 111 with a sofa bed area was spacious enough and missed only a view of some sort.

The biggest problem was the breakfast. We had buffet breakfast included. The selection was very poor - I myself wouldn't call that small table 'a buffet'. The restaurant where it was served felt more like a night club than a breakfast restaurant. The service left much to wish for - there was one morning when the whole staff seemed to be in a bad mood and it took ages get even a cup of coffee.

There were also some other problems with the service - concierge was helpful enough but gave us wrong directions, our daughters blanket was taken away and not replaced, a light bulb taken away and not replaced.",3,2011,07,14
144,Great hotel in great location,"Excellent staff especially concierge, they we helpful at all times and very professional and very smartly dressed. The hotel was very smart and immaculately clean, really comfy beds and plenty of pillows. Only downside was rooms were smallish, and we had a room next to lift which made a annoying noise. Continental breakfast was really excellent the best museli and yoghurt I have ever tasted.",4,2011,07,12
144,A way to end our vacation,"I had let my cousin (lives in London) choose where my wife and I would spend our last two nights in London.  It was just great!  Exactly what we were looking for....quiet, personal, intimate, friendly and helpful staff and clean.   Our room was very comfortable.
If there is one negative, it is the fact that, at the price they charge for a night's stay they could have included internet connection.  It is like the airlines today where they nickel and dime you for everything!    
What was key for us was location...close to the tube, which got us to our shopping and site seeing destinations in minutes.  Also many of the spots we wanted to go to were within walking distance.  What really ended it was walking through Green Park to Buckingham Palace the day we were leaving.  It was a wonderful way to end our vacation!",5,2011,07,07
144,Good hotel in handy location,"Nothing special about the hotel, it is a good standard and at the right price is in a very good location within walking distance of most attractions and Green Park tube very close by. Some rooms can be noisy as both sides are near a street. Ask for a high room and should not be a problem.",4,2011,07,02
144,Tour group stayed at the Flemings,"Our tour group stayed at the Flemings. Wonderful service and staff. No request too large or  too small. The rooms are small by American standards, but very nice. Bed incredibly comfortable. No sleeping tablets needed! We all appreciated the coffee/tea in the room. The restaurant served great breakfasts and many from the group had at least lunch or dinner there. The bar drinks were expensive. Our welcome tea and farewell dinner were excellent. Best location - could not have asked for better!  I look forward to staying at The Flemings again.",5,2011,06,30
144,"Stunning, modern hotel in a great location...capturing all the flair of Mayfair, without the attitude!","My husband and I loved this hotel and could not say enough good things about the staff, location and enchanting decor!  Originally a cupcake and champagne promotion captured my attention, but then the hotel turned out to be in a great location and wonderful experience!! I was hesitant to book a hotel in the, sometimes thought to be, pretentious Mayfair neighborhood, but the staff at the Flemings hotel were incredibly hospitable and friendly.  I think 2-3 staff greeted us every time we came through the doors!! Also, all the rooms and decor in the hotel were so unique that I would definitely recommend checking out them out for an afternoon tea, cupcake, or dining event! The rooms were clean, beds were comfortable and we didn’t have any issues with street noise.  That said, we would happily stay at this hotel again and recommend it to anybody that is looking for a memorable hotel experience!",5,2011,06,23
144,"Good Location, Decent Accomodations","Stayed here for six nights. The central location is perfect, and the room is not any smaller than one would find in a boutique hotel in New York City. Fine for sleeping and showering. The halls are a tad narrow and labyrinthine, with many little steps up and down. I had asked for a room away from foot traffic, and they put me at the end of a hallway, so it was nice and quiet (alas, this meant I forfeited any kind of view).

The front desk staff was courteous but also somewhat indifferent. However, the concierge was fantastic! He spent no small amount of time trying to find an open spa for my friend and I so we could soak our aching feet--all that walking! Failing that, he found some people who came to our room to do it for us instead. Hooray!

I didn't eat in the restaurant, but I did order a very late room service one night, and the food was fair. (Keep in mind, this was 1 a.m. besides.)

I did find a couple oddities on my final bill, but they removed them without fuss.

Overall, I'd certainly consider staying again.",4,2011,06,17
144,Superb service and location,"Flemings Mayfair Hotel exceeded my expectations.  The hotel I usually stay at was full, so I tried Fleming's based on reviews and location--and was certainly glad I did.  We stayed in one of the upgraded rooms with two beds.  The room was spacious, clean, and comfortable.  The service was attentive and comprehensive, and the location could not be beat.  What's more, since this was a small boutique hotel on a residential street, it was away from noise and heavy traffic, but very close to the tube station and bus lines. The hotel does not have large meeting rooms, but does have a restaurant, bar, and a lovely lounge where they serve afternoon tea.  This was such a pleasant surprise, that I intend to stay here again on my return to London.",4,2011,06,14
144,Perfect Location,"My husband and I stayed at Flemings for 5 nights recently.  The location could not be better due the convenience of the Green Park Underground Station and a good quick breakfast place around the corner. (Pret a Manger)  We also enjoyed walking in the area in the evening.  The outside of the hotel is nice, the lobby and public areas are well decorated and very modern.  The room itself is average but in good order, clean and decorated in good taste.  I did not find it too small.  We were on the side of the hotel facing Half Moon Street and we did hear either a delivery truck or gargage truck several mornings early. (I just expect that in a large city)  I never heard any noise from any of the other rooms or from the hallway.  The staff was pleasant and helpful.  I would have liked to have had free internet with our room so I could check my email on my iphone but did not want to pay the extra amount for just a few minutes each day that I would need it.  I would stay here again and would recommend it to my friends.  I think the price we paid was a good value for the nice area.  Mayfair is a wonderful neighborhood to stay in!",4,2011,06,13
144,"Would certainly return, but hope for improvement on breakfast","Maybe a somewhat belated review – I visited this hotel in the summer of 2010 -, but all reviews may be helpful. Let me start with saying that I would certainly return to Flemish Mayfair.

Having read all the reviews before booking I grew somewhat anxious about some rooms suffering from outside noise. Mainly from ventilation shafts in the inner court if I am not mistaken. This made me contact Branca Sabbagh, the guest relations manager, to ask for quiet room. Just to avoid disappointment upon arrival. She responded within 1 day with the information that she had already reserved a room on the ground floor on a quiet street ( I wish I took a note of  the room number). This was a great relief and made me look forward even more to my stay.

Expectations were very high after reading all the excellent reviews on TripAdvisor. This made me expect a top class five star hotel (*****). Well, this wasn’t to be true, but I admit my expectations had grown unreasonable high. Having said this, the hotel is good. Small room, but clean and quiet. Good bathroom and room. I liked the free newspaper every morning.

Reception friendly and especially the porter very friendly. Clean entrance hall, but somewhat cold looking. I would have loved more wood and less marble.

Location great. Not far from the underground, but why should this be important with a location like this? I walked every morning in 20 minutes to Picadilly Circus and Trafalgar Square. London is a big and busy city, but a morning walk is a good way to be part of it. Anyway, I enjoyed walking and see the city being alive at 8.30 – 9.00.

I haven’t used the restaurant, so can’t comment on it. Breakfast remains the weak point of the hotel. Being Dutch, I am used to a simple continental breakfast: that’s not the problem for me. Service could at times be much better. I had to ask for butter. A waitress taking orders with folded arms. Returning three times with the same question to a guest. Remember this was in 2010, service may have improved as it should.

To summarize. 
Would I return: yes!
 Weak point: breakfast.

144,Great in parts but disappointingly average with breakfast service,"We normally come down to London twice a year to see a show, shop, eat out and soak up the atmosphere of our capital city. Our favourite hotel (the nearby Cavendish in Jermyn Street) was pretty fully booked and the only rooms left there were on a very high tariff. But the reservations lady at the Cavendish was gracious enough to direct us to Flemings as a suitable alternative.

Booking was easy and pleasant, the staff were very friendly on the phone. The best room price available at time of booking, though cheaper than the Cavendish, was still quite expensive at £250 per room inclusive of breakfast.

Location was a bit further west from the theatre district so walking to and from the hotel meant we had to allow an extra ten minutes. Not a problem, but we prefer the convenience of being nearer Piccadilly Circus.

The staff on arrival were brilliant, friendly and helpful. The lady on reception gave us free internet access which was a lovely touch. The rooms were a tad on the small side (we had rooms 415 and 416), but were clean and more than adequate. Comfortable beds too, but not as comfortable as the amazing beds at the Cavendish, which we would rate as the best hotel beds we have ever slept in. Quiet rooms, undisturbed apart from the normal background city hum.

Breakfast was where the hotel really slipped back, demonstrating that any hotel's reputation is made up of a house of cards, built by the quality of its staff. One unsteady card can bring the rest crashing down, leaving the guest feeling short-changed.

I ordered a cooked breakfast. After 20 minutes, nothing (apart from a rack of cold toast) had arrived. After asking twice, it finally arrived, almost 40 minutes after ordering. It was, I have to say, very good when it finally appeared but I couldn't understand why there had been a problem, the restaurant wasn't especially busy and I regret to say that the staff just didn't seem at their best. Not rude as such, just a bit distracted and off hand. This was unexpected as all other hotel staff had exceeded our expectations.

The checkout was painless and our bags were well looked after until we left for Kings Cross at 1.30pm. The porter found us a taxi very quickly and waved us off.

So, to summarize: Very good in most areas. Has Flemings Hotel done enough to knock The Cavendish from top place? No. But would I be happy to return to Flemings if rooms at the Cavendish were not available at our preferred tariff? Yes.",4,2011,05,30
144,Perfect !,"We stayed here on the 21st May for my partners 50th birthday, and brought along our two Westies.
The service and welcome we received was first class. Before we arrived we had a call from the hotel to see what we would like getting ready for our two little westies.
On arrival we were given a wonderful welcome like we had stayed many times. The gentleman on the door said hello and welcome and even knew our dogs names. Although we had arrived early our room was ready. Our room was on the ground floor and was very tasteful wooden floor and two baskets ready for the dogs. We were even asked if we needed food getting for them. Of course they had matching dishes with fresh water.
As for us it was very clean comfortable and luxurious it had everything we needed. The room was hot but the aircon worked fine and was not too noisey. A maid brought us some delicious cookies in made a fuss of the dogs and even offered to walk them for us after she had finished. 
The location is excellent even more so if you have a dog, green park is just across the road. I believe guest services even arranged squirrel s for the dogs to chase. It was doggy heaven for Max and Tottie they did not want to get out of their baskets to leave. As for us we thoroughly enjoyed it. This is a brilliant hotel it was a special treat and more than what we can usually afford but it was worth every penny. We will be checking their website to check for offers so we can return. Next time we would love to try their afternoon tea.",4,2011,05,27
144,Totally cool and unique.,"The hotel is completely unexpected.  On a quiet side street off Piccadilly St, the entrance looks classic with white columns.  The minute you walk in you feel like you are somewhere else.  The staff is friendly and always helpful.. The  bar, the dinning room and even the elevators are interestingly and beautifully done.  Our room was a bit small, but had everything we needed. The bed was very comfortable with great pillows.  I loved the dinning room.  It was beautifully decorated and the food was excellent, particularly their steak and duck.  The mixed drink however, was not that impressive (small and pricey). They had the same menu the entire week, so you may want to try a few local places.  We found Harry's Bar and Grill around the corner 1 block up on Piccadilly st. was great! There is also a little hidden restaurant row; ask the hotel for directions ( its up the street, left hand turn into a hidden side street) away from Piccadilly st . Had a great time. Would definitely return.",4,2011,05,21
144,What great location!,"Great location is the absolute upside of this hotel. It is nice & clean.
Rooms are a bit small but hey, if you're going to this side of London, you're not going to spent a lot of time indoors :-)
It might look pricy, but all hotels in this area are.
Friendly and helpfull staff. No bad remarks actually.",4,2011,05,19
144,Wonderful stay,"My sister and I stayed At Flemings in Mayfair in mid-April, 2011.  We had an upgrade room:  executive room with 2 singles.  The room decorations were very pleasing:  wooden panels, beveled mirrors, plaids.  Even though we were on the street level we did not hear the outside noise.  The bathroom was sparkling and updated.  The halls leading to our room were narrow and labyrinth-y.  Evidently, in a prior life, it was the location of 2 inns that are now combined.  In general, the hotel had the old club elegant feel with modern updates accented with colorful modern decorations.   A staffer wearing a top and tails opened the door for guests.  
We loved our stay.  The personal attention of the staff was excellent.  They were very helpful with directions, restaurant advice, and travel tips.  They were friendly and pleasant.
We did not eat in the hotel as there were plenty of other options around the hotel.  We were one block from the Green Park tube station.  (Note to travelers with luggage:  Green Park does not have escalators, just plenty of steps.)
Sightseeing wise, we were walking distance to St. James Park and Buckingham Palace.
We enjoyed our stay very much and recommend wholeheartedly to others.",4,2011,05,13
144,Very Poor,"I arrived at the hotel at 8.10 at night.  My room was not yet available despite the receptionist telling me that it should have been available at 2.00pm.  I was offered free internet as a result.  Only after stating this was far from acceptable was I offered a drink whilst I waited for the room to be available, I was then given a complementary breakfast - usual cost £22.00

No complaints with the room although very expensive.

Breakfast was (for those paying) extremely expensive - simply ridiculous.

A bottle of lager in the bar was £5.60, need I say more.

I will not stay again as I know there are better places to stay for half the money.",3,2011,05,11
144,"Highly recommended, good value for luxury in London","I'm surprised that Flemings isn't more highly rated on Tripadvisor. We stayed there for a long weekend a few weeks ago and I was quite impressed. The room was really lovely, we had booked a weekend package directly with them and I think they may have upgraded us, I was very pleased as we had far more space than I expected.

The room was comfortable and modern and I loved the colorful, glamourous public spaces in the hotel. The front desk staff were friendly and professional. I'm fond of the location because it's so easy to take the Jubilee line in from Heathrow, which is an easy and cheap way to get into Mayfair without the fuss of going through Paddington.

Our package included dinner and a bottle of wine in the restaurant ,and my expectations were low. In fact i began to feel bad about not having the opportunity to try somewhere outside the hotel that particular night. Well what a surprise, the meal was excellent. Really interesting, flavorful modern British cuisine, well done to the chef. We liked every dish.

The weekend package was good value and I highly recommend it. I think it was 190 pounds per night , including one dinner and breakfast every day. Last time we stayed in Mayfair we stayed at the Chesterfield just around the corner which is much more highly rated on Tripadvisor. I have to say, having visited both, I would pick Flemings over the Chesterfield on almost every account. It was better value, I preferred the more modern decor and found the whole place much ""fresher"" and more stylish. The restaurant was far superior. 

However, the only area in which the Fleming lost the comparison was at breakfast, the buffet at the Chesterfield was superior and I do think Flemings could jazz theirs up a little. It wasn't that the breakfast was bad just that they seemed rather inflexible. We had a full English included but couldn't substitute for Eggs Benedict which was cheaper, at the Chesterfield you could order what you liked if the full breakfast was included. At Flemings they unfortunately brought tea in a ready made coffee pot that tasted of coffee and wasn't hot enough, more  what I would expect in the US or on the Continent, rather than in a good British hotel. When you asked they were happy to bring you an individual fresh pot, but this shouldn't be necessary in a place that has such high standards otherwise.

Overall we were very happy with our stay and I highly recommend the hotel for style, service, value and location. Our quibbles are small and we look forward to returning the next time we're in London.",5,2011,05,04
144,"It's all about location, location, location...","I stayed at the Flemings Mayfair from April 15-19. The hotel is located in the Mayfair district of London, the most upscale and expensive area. The best part of the hotel is its location. The Green Park tube stop is around the corner, making it very convenient to get around London. The Underground system is very easy to understand and follow. I would recommend getting the unlimited day pass for ease reasons. Now back to the hotel. The staff is very helpful and courteous, but for me a bit too in-your-face-right-there helpful. The hotel is small and has an odd layout. We asked for a quiet room and was given room #30. It is quiet for the most part but be forewarned it is right next to housekeeping closet. As you probably know, the hotel rooms in Europe are much smaller than US standards. So knowing this before hand, I was aware and prepared for the tight quarters. I was happy with room, beds and bathroom. No complaints. The one thing I thing I didn't like much about the hotel was their breakfast. The buffet breakfast was included in room rate.  The breakfast consisted of light breads, meats and cereal which is a typical European breakfast. I didn't feel at ease while eating breakfast. It's much more prim and proper than i want to be at 8am. The buffet is $16 (i'm using the $ because I can't find the pound symbol on keyboard) which is about $30 USD. If the breakfast isn't included in room rate, skip it and go to the cafes around the corner. Starbucks is 2 minutes away.
     Here are some other random thoughts/suggestions about London:
  --take the Big Bus Tour, the stop is next to the Green Park tube station, the tour is a great introduction to London and River Thames cruise is included
  --The London Eye is very crowded and pricey...St. Paul's Cathedral provides a great city view
  --The Tower of London is cool....the line to the see the Crown Jewels is very long
  --Look up New Europe walking tour....it's free and fun...great guides and a another great way to see the city on foot...we did two..the London city tour and the Grim Reaper tour
  --The British Museum is amazing and the British Library is one tube stop further
  ***MY BEST SUGGESTION IS GO TO THE CAMDEN MARKETS***it is two stops from the British Museum...a huge outdoor clothes, food and people bonanza....A MUST GO!!!!",4,2011,05,04
144,"Lovely hotel, sparkling clean, great location... I highly recommend it!","I stayed here for 4 nights from 6 April to 10 April.  I am a solo traveler and booked an executive double for 1 person.  It was a lovely cozy room, extremely clean, which to me is of the utmost importance.  The room seemed a bit small, (it is my understanding that is is quite common for London, so I was expecting this, and it was not at all a problem that would ever prevent me from staying here again.) but was quite adequate for my needs.  It had a very, very comfortable bed and was very, very quiet.  I was in room 303 which overlooked a quiet courtyard.  I never heard a sound the entire time that I was there, and I am an extremely light sleeper.  It is in an excellent location, being only a 2 block walk to Green Park tube with access to both the Piccadilly and Jubilee lines.  There is a Pret a Manger and a Starbucks about a block away and Hard Rock Cafe is about a 5 minute walk.  Also, at the other end of the street is a lovely area called Shepards Market.  I did not eat at the hotel, as I was in London visiting a friend who owns a restaurant where I took most of my meals.  All of the hotel staff that I dealt with were lovely.  The concierge was kind enough to assist me with locating a nearby hair salon and was happy to assist me with printing my boarding pass for my flight.  As a single female traveler, I felt very safe and comfortable staying at flemings, and will do so again on my next trip to London!",5,2011,04,11
144,All show,"The main rooms of the hotel were beautiful but did notice that when we had coffee and cake at 12.30 pm in the bar the carpet could do with a good hoover. The bedroom was satisfactory but the corridors themselves needed a good clean and also our bathroom had water drips and smudges of toothpast on the sink surround. Also the brass in the lift was covered in fingerprints and couldn't have been cleaned for days. Putting this aside the staff were wonderful, from the receptionists to the night porter (who prepared a lovely snack after we returned from the theatre at 11.15.pm) and the breakfast was very nice as were the waiters.The position of the hotel is brilliant.",3,2011,04,05
144,A beautiful hotel!,"My husband and i, frequent this hotel maybe once a year as it's our little treat to one another and every stay is better than the last time. Overall, we have stayed here around 6 times.

The hotel itself is stunning, the staff are so welcoming and it trully is a lovely romantic stay for us both.

Nestled inside of busy london, it is near most fab bars and restaurants.

The food here is delicious too, breakfast is devine.

We hope you have as much as a luxurious stay as we do when we go !",5,2011,04,05
144,disco Vendome derails all details,"We checked into The Flemings Mayfair for a four night stay and were given a room in the back with a window to the next street, Clarges. Unbeknownst to us at the time, the night club Vendome is half a block down Clarges at the corner with Picadilly. Needless to say, from 12:30 am - 2:30 am all sleep is abandoned due to the loud behavior of boorish youth. From loud motorcycles, fights, breaking bottles, racing of engines to loud drunken voices we endured it all. Finally the clamour ended and we slept in late the next morning. 
We didn't say anything at the desk because we just assumed all the noise was a one night episode due to a party and did not even imagine a night club would even be in this respectable neighborhood. The following night brought the reality of the situation with even more noise and made us investigate. After discovering the nightclub, we voiced our problem to the front desk. 
""Let talk to my manager about this"" said the clerk.
The solution to the problem was to move us to a room opening on Half Moon Street. Happiness not to endure the night club was dashed that night as Half Moon Street proved to be a popular road from the major artery of Picadilly into the neighborhood of Mayfair. Private vehicles raced, London's taxis rattled and delivery trucks resounded at all hours down this road and thus deprived us of any rest.
Cleanliness, location, service, all other attributes are meaningless if you can not provide your guests with a good night's sleep. We presented our problem to the hotel and their solution was to shuffle the problem along, not provide us with a room in which to get rest.",1,2011,03,27
144,One night only..,"I stayed just one night - arrivíng late and leaving early - a quick trip to London for a business meeting (and an eqaully quick impression of the hotel, mind you. But first impressíon counts for something too..).

Overall I found that the hotel was nice yet, as the case often is in London, the single room was very small, albeit nicely decorated and clean. The bar and restaurant is equally attractive in design and the staff friendly enough. 
To the price Ok, but just to expectation though,  therefore within 5-star hotels in London I have other personal favorites that I will prefer to go back to for that extra something.",4,2011,03,26
144,Flemings - Hidden Jewel in Mayfair,"What can be said about this perfect little jewel of a hotel? It must be a well kept secret. I've lived and stayed in hotels in W1 for years but only stumbled across Flemings when The Fox Club on Clarges St was full, luckily they have a convenient arrangement with Flemings who immediately found me a room and honored the reciprocal room rate for Fox Club members.  
The staff were friendly and welcoming, very efficient and if aesthetics are important to you then Flemings will not disappoint. Great care has gone into the interior design and it is modern and sophisticated.  I believe this hotel is popular with minor celebs who can hide in the subterranean bar which is a cave of velor, mirrors and contemporary furniture. But the most outstanding quality of Flemings has to be the restaurant, which is absolutely excellent (if only the Fox Club had such a good chef!) Seriously good food, small but great wine list and with a lunch menu that at £10 cannot be beaten by anywhere I know of in W1!   I'm very happy to recommend this hotel, the classic rooms are small but have the usual facilities+nice toiletries, good quality linen, flatscreen tv, and, most importantly, are clean and quiet.  Ideal for business or vacationers with Green Park tube just round the corner – ditto the park, the palace, shops and galleries of Piccadilly and if you can tear yourself away from eating in the hotel then Shephards Market is right next door too.",4,2011,03,26
144,A great relaxing night,"I was a female staying in London alone on business, the hotel is warm and friendly.  The staff made me feel instandly welcome and showed me to my room.  I was shown where to find everything to make my stay as pleasurable as possible. 
The room was cosy and comforable and had everything you could need for an evenings stay. 
I ordered room services which arrived quickly and hot.  Breaksfast in the restaurant was great and a lovely relaxed way to start the day. 
I would stay there again anytime!",5,2011,03,24
144,The best hotel in London,"A superb boutique hotel well positioned opposite Green Park in Mayfair, indeed its location just off Piccadilly on Half Moon Street is ideal for the London holidaymaker or business traveller (my wife and I were both on this occasion). We stayed in the beautiful Aria Suite Apartment with its own separate access, which made it feel as though we were staying at our own plush London home. I was in London attending a business dinner however my wife ate at Flemings Grill on her own and had a superb meal. The accommodation was first rate and the staff extremely attentive. Breakfast was also good and I regret that we didn’t have time to stay for afternoon tea. 
We intend to go back soon and cannot recommend this hotel highly enough.",5,2011,03,14
144,Mixed feelings on Flemings,"I have just returned from a 2 night stay at Flemings Mayfair.
I booked the trip as a birthday present for my mum and so we spent a girlie weekend sightseeing and shopping.
I chose Flemings as we both love Mayfair and I had arranged to go to Gordon Ramsay at Claridges on Saturday evening and wanted a hotel that was situated quite close.
The hotel decor is fabulous and very much the style we like. On arrival the room was not ready so we had coffee in the Lounge and it was so glamorous!
The room we were then given was small to say the least and very awkward to get around with only a slim  wardrobe for clothes and you had to stand on the bed to use the top shelf. It was nicely furnished and the bathroom was quite spacious but the view was of a brick wall. The air con was a box on the wall and the controls hidden behind a very tall lamp.The room seemed very stuffy and even though we could open the window slightly you really needed the aircon and it was really noisy.
When we came to get ready on the first night, to go out for the evening, I went to have a bath and could not stop the water from running out of the plughole. It was too late to call for housekeeping/maintenance so had showers instead but after having walked for miles we were really looking forward to soaks in the bath. We did report it and a new plughole was fitted the next day but I can't believe it was not noticed before.
Our other issue was that our booking voucher said  breakfast was included.
When we went to have breakfast on the first day we were given a menu  for Continental at £16.95 or Full breakfast at £22. To have a cooked breakfast it had to be ordered whilst the Continental was laid out in an adjoining room. People seemed confused as to what they had to do and when we had been taken to our table we weren't asked for our room number which then normally leads to you being told what breakfast you are entitled to. I decided to go and ask and was told only Continental. I challenged this as I would have expected Continental to have been specifically stated on the voucher but I was sternly rebuked as only being entitled to Continental.
I have to say the choice was very limited and poor value for money. It consisted of cereal, croissants, fruit salad,yoghurt, smoked mackerel and slices of beef. £16.95 was way off the mark for the limited choice.
I would stay at the hotel again as the location is great and its lovely being in a smaller boutique hotel but I would upgrade the room as it was disappointing.",4,2011,03,14
144,An Excellent Experience All Round,"From the moment of arrival the staff were excellent and helpful at all times. 
The room was fantastic - and the welcoming note and home made biscuits a lovely touch
Having stayed before on a few occasions I was very impressed by the refurbishment that had occured since my last visit - the ambience in the bar and resatuarant area is superb 
A brilliant hotel in a fantastic location - ideal for anyone wishing to stay in London
Cannot wait to visit again",5,2011,03,14
144,One of the best places to stay in London,"I am just settling back into normal life after my stay at Flemings Hotel and Apartments.  It was 3 days of sheer bliss.  

I stayed in one of the apartments and words really are not enough to describe my stay.  The apartment was incredibly spacious with my own sitting room where I could work, huge bedroom, one main bathroom, separate WC and a kitchen!!!  It was pure bliss for the relaxation that I needed.  The food in the restaurant is superb and so well priced. I especially love the cocktails at the bar!

The staff at Flemings are wonderful.  From the moment you walk through the door you feel as if you are part of a very exclusive club  Everyone greets you with a warm welcome and smile.  Nothing is ever a problem and if you need anything at all while you are staying in London or want a recommendation on where to go, their Concierge team are superb.

I really cannot recommend Flemings Hotel and Apartments highly enough.",5,2011,03,07
144,Close to the city but away from the hustle and bustle,"My husband and I just returned from a four day stay at the Flemings to celebrate our 30th anniversary.  The location is perfect to get around the city.  We were a bit disappointed in the size of the room and the view outside the window was of the heating unit.  Although we were at the end of the hallway, there seemed to be alot of foot traffic.  The bed was comfortable,the shower pressure was great and the heated towel rack was a nice touch.  The staff were very pleasant and attentive to any requests.  Thanks to Toy for helping with reservations at Bentley's for our 30th anniversary.",4,2011,03,06
144,"A charming, English boutique hotel in Mayfair","After my last visit to London in 2007 where I stayed in one of the well-known chain hotels, I wanted to experience a more ""English"" styled boutique hotel, and found Flemings on the Trip Advisor website. The internet reviews were generally good, as was the ranking and price range, so I booked a 4-night stay, from Friday - Tuesday in late February.
Apparently, Flemings is the 2nd oldest hotel in London, and is within a row of  old townhouses built in ? Victorian style ?. The interior has been very nicely renovated and modernized. The location of the hotel on a side street off Park Lane was very good; walking 10-15 minutes in one direction led to Knightsbridge and Harrods; the other direction led to Picadilly Circus, the West End and Regent Street, and across was Hyde Park and Buckingham Palace. Green Park tube station was only 5 minutes away, and well-connected to the Picadilly line and Jubilee line.
The standard room that we originally booked was rather small, with the airconditioner directly over the head of the bed, barely enough space for two large suitcases, and rather dark. The bathroom however, was a decent size, very clean and bright, with bath and rain-shower, with good water pressure and lots of hot water, and heated towel rack. The other good thing was that the room faced an inner courtyard, so was very quiet.
After the first night, we managed to upgrade to a slightly more expensive ""executive"" room, which had more space, enough for a writing desk and a sitting area, with sofa, coffee table and armchair. This room was much brighter, with lovely pastel green patterned wallpaper, nice furniture, bed, carpet and windows overlooking Half-Moon Street. Although there was some street noise, it was minimal and did not significantly disturb our sleep. The queen-sized bed was very comfortable, warm and cosy especially when it was 1C outside ! 
Hotel staff were courteous, friendly and very helpful, especially the bell-boys and the concierge team (whom I must commend for helping me get tickets to a sell-out event !). They remembered our names and treated us like valued guests, in a genuine and warm manner. Although we did not try the restaurant, the menu looked excellent. There is a large front room adjacent to the reception area, where afternoon tea can be served or evening cocktails - the decor was absolutely lovely.
I will be back in London in September this year, and will definitely stay at the Flemings again !",4,2011,03,04
144,An outstanding gem of a hotel,"I have stayed at Flemings for many years, for business and pleasure - and it just keeps getting better!  I've recommended a number of colleagues and friends to stay at the hotel, and they have never been disappointed and, like myself, often return. 

Travelling around the world on business and pleasure, I have stayed in some great hotels, but the service from all the team here stands out from the rest - it is exceptional.  Everyone makes you feel very welcome,  nothing is too much trouble, and requests are always dealt with efficiently.  The little personal touches make all the difference, so returning to 'my second London home' is always a pleasure.

The decor is superb throughout - a very luxurious boutique hotel.  The rooms vary in size, but are all equally pristine, as are the library, bar and restaurant.  The attention to detail is second to none. 

The location is excellent - great to walk to the bars and restaurants of Shepherds Market, shopping in Bond Street or Oxford Street is in walking distance too.  If you want to venture further afield, then Green Park underground is just around the corner.

Go on, make a reservation - you deserve it ;-D",5,2011,02,17
144,AN OASIS IN THE DESSERT!,"I stayed here with my Mum who treated me as a present & it was absolutely fantastic.   The room was very warm & cosy.  

The hotel is in a great position for walking into town.

We had a delicious meal in the restaurant served by Mateus who was very efficient and couldn't do enough for us.

Straight away you know this hotel is a bit more unique than most.  It has the feel that the staff really do care.  Something that you rarely get now adays.  This is a special hotel which gives the personal touch which large chains fail on.

The decor is stunning.  Contemporary mixed with old & it works brilliantly. 

We would definately stay again.",5,2011,02,12
144,A very personal hotel experience while on business,"The Flemings Hotel in Mayfair is a wonderful gem - very stylish, great personal service and good value for its central Mayfair location!

The service from management and staff is extremely personal and they make you feel very at home. I spend around 3-4 nights a week here on business, and it's the personal touches that makes it a hotel I visit again and again.

The reception, front room,bar and restaurant are decorated in a wonderfully decadent style - it's perfect for an after work business drink, or social dinner with friends.

The rooms are spacious and are also decorated in a very luxurious way. Being locaed between Picadilly and Curzon Street, the heart of Mayfair, make it very easy to visit the beautiful restaurants and shops around Berkeley Square and Bond Street.

Definitley a hotel I would recommend to friends for both business and pleasure!",5,2011,02,09
144,Small rooms but good hotel,The hotel gets plus marks and I would recommend it. It is handy for anything in that part of London and access to the tube. The hotel rooms are smallish but reasonably well decorated. Comfortable is how I would describe it. Food was good and service the same. Bigger rooms would give it a better rating but the small rooms are probably down to it being an old hotel. Remember where your room was when you leave it as it is a bit of a warren!,4,2011,02,04
144,Perfect Stay,"Over the past few years I have stayed at numerous hotels which have all been average. Nothing excited enough to write a review until last week. 

Last week I stayed at an exceptional hotel, Flemings. I worked hard to find a complaint during my stay, and was frustrated that the only very minor things annoyed me (see below) 

I stayed in a twin room (423) facing Half Moon Street. The room was large for London, enough room for 2 people to share easily. There was a nice size closet, partially taken up by the mini-bar (which had room for my purchases as well as their selection) the tea/coffee tray and hair drier.  The room also contained a sofa, desk and small table.  The décor was pleasing with a fish motif, the beds were very comfortable with many pillows and all the furniture was in good condition. 

The bath was large and well lit, with a huge amount of counter-space for our toiletries. The water pressure was nice and strong and the towels fluffy and (after using the towel warmer) warm. 

The television was large; the selection of channels was very good, although I did not look for any language other than English. There were a number of magazines in the room that were interesting. 

The lobby and public rooms were decorated in an interesting manner that I found exciting. This was not standard hotel bland, but rather an exciting, yet pleasing modern design. Since the hotel is housed in a series of old townhouses, it incorporated the classic elements of the buildings with modern flairs. I was very impressed. I loved the library in the lift. This being a hotel built around older buildings, the hallways are a bit twisty with some steps. 

The breakfast was very nice – a continental spread of juices, breads, meats and cheeses, danish, cereals, yoghurts and fresh fruit. An a-la-carte menu offered omelets, traditional British breakfast (very nice) and other dishes. 

We also had tea one afternoon – it was extremely good and great value. 

The staff were very friendly and professional. I had some personal problems with my luggage and they were handled swiftly by the concierge and staff. I was impressed that since Half Moon Street is not a major route, the doorman would sprint down to Piccadilly to get a taxi for the guests. 

The location is wonderful. It is a 2 minute walk to Green Park Station on the Underground, around the corner of Shepherd Market (fun to walk around, shop and eat) with every amenity possible within walking distance. 

Now for the bad stuff: They had Pepsi in the mini-bar. The scrambled eggs I ordered withy English Breakfast were a bit loose. I really could not find anything else to fault the hotel. 

I would like to thank Michael the handyman for a job well done taking care of that dastardly lock on my suitcase and Mrs. Branca Sabbagh for taking the time to talk to us on our last evening at the hotel. Mrs. Sabbagh is the Guest Services Director and is extremely passionate about the hotel, and kudos to her and the rest of the team who have created a wonderful place to stay in London. 

We will be back.",5,2011,01,22
144,Love the service,"The concierge and front desk receptionists are have great customer service.  The concierge helped us make a reservation at a restaurant (originally asked for our credit card info when we tried to do it ourselves) without any problem (no credit card info needed). He confirmed our reservation. The doorman always said ""good day. hello"" to us when we passed him. 

Room size are small but doable (bigger than NYC). The location is AWESOME!!! Near Buckingham Palace, the New Year's parade entry, and Winter Wonderland. The tube is near by and easy to use. Near restaurants and market for small items (i.e water bottles, milk). 

Con: the bathroom door keeps hitting the bed when you open it. Have to pay for internet. 

I would stay there again next time.",4,2011,01,19
144,A weekend stay at Flemings Hotel Mayfair - I could not wish for a better and happier start to 2011,"The purpose of our visit to Flemings was to celebrate two birthdays and what a surprise we found when we were escorted to the beautifully appointed Penthouse Apartment.  I might have let the purpose of our visit slip when I booked, but that was as long ago as last August, so I was tremendously impressed that the reservation team had noted this fact and clearly recorded the information in the guest history and laid on such a super upgrade. The accommodation was truly comfortable and the attention to detail superb.  The staff, as I have always experienced, were genuinely welcoming and kind and nothing was 'too much trouble'. The refurbishment of the all the public areas has now been completed and every room you walk into has the WOW factor.  We drove to London and were delighted to learn that Flemings has negotiated a special parking fee for its guests with the garage just off Curzon Street, so that immediately  removed the concern we had about the safety of our car.  I cannot wait to return to Flemings and enjoy once more such a fabulous stay in such a fabulously well located and well appointed hotel.",5,2011,01,14
144,"Very happy, courteous staff who anticipated our needs even before we knew we had any.","Most attractive accommodation,  a lovely , warm and very comfortable, spacious apartment.  Excellent  fitted kitchen which is well stocked.  We had everything we needed.  The staff were amazingly thoughtful, cheerful and yet professional and were always anticipating our requirements.  

It is the perfect location for visiting many of the popular, quality establishments in London.  We had a fantastic break. Thank you Flemings and well done.",5,2011,01,12
144,"Great Central London Hotel - Individual, Great Service, Highly Recommended","First time stayed at Flemings and will definately stay there again,

Hospitable service, great bar.  Rooms good and well decorated.  The bathroom could have been a bit more modern and maybe jazzed up a little to match the decor in the rest of the hotel.

A great central London base, i would definately come here again.",4,2011,01,10
144,"faultless,flawless, perfect, pristine....memorable","Leaving the horrendous weather on the doorstep, on stepping onto threshhold of Flemings we recieved the warmest of greetings, & from then on the hospitality, ambeince & service just got...better.
The room was everything one could wish for, with everything for our comfort.
Dinner was par excellence, ambeince, cuisine, service...perfect.
Mateus in perticular went that one step furtther in making us feel valued.
All the staff very attentive, & the only downside was that we couldn't stay longer.",5,2011,01,09
144,A Christmas Treat in London,"We spent a wonderful two days at Flemings visiting the theatre, shops for the sales and entertaining American cousins for lunch.  The hotel is in a perfect location for everything - we were able to park  outside the hotel free over the Christmas Season and we were able to walk to the theatre and shops as well as seeing all the Christmas Lights.
We had a superb dinner on Boxing Day and lunch for the American family with two little girls was so easy.  Flemings Mayfair Hotel for a Christmas Treat is not to be missed.
The Christmas Cup Cakes were absolutely delicious.",5,2011,01,01
144,Good location - Service above average - Boutique Hotel,"Finding a ""good"" hotel in London is not the easy if money does matter. I am not talking about YMCIA style hotels but a decent Hotel, centrally located. I thought the Flemings is one of them to come back. First of all it is a rather small Hotel (Boutique Style), friendly Doorman, Bell Boy, simply Front Desk with a warm reception. Tube station around the corner and/ or walking distance to Picadilly Circus along Picadilly Street (passing the Ritz, Fortnum & Mason, etc.). Cool, uptodate Bar downstairs, nice Breakfast area. To talk about the room in London is not that easy, the usual floor carpeting, low ceiling. However a good size double room for London, clean, Bathroom is also good. If you get a decent rate, stay there.",4,2010,12,15
144,a fantastic hotel,"this is the third time my self and my wife have  stayed in the flemings hotel for a long weekend what a fantastic hotel, the staff  were great very helpful the hotel has just been refurbished and looks amazing i cant praise the place enough i would recomend this hotel to anyone who wants to stay in a hotel in mayfair and be treated like royalty thank you to everyone who works there
realy close to the shops and realy quiet at night just a stones throw from bearkley sq and oxford st",5,2010,12,13
144,"Unique property, excellent location, wonderful staff","A very unique property in a terrific location.  The room was small, but functional and the pull out sofa bed was plenty suitable for our young daughter.  The Thanksgiving Dinner in the hotel restaurant was excellent and the concierge staff were particularly helpful and friendly during our stay.  The reservations desk maintained good communication prior to our arrival and were kindly accommodating of our request for an early check-in.  Although I feel television and internet access should be complementary in a hotel of this caliber, we were too preoccupied with sight-seeing to really miss either.  The champagne/designer cupcakes in the lobby-lounge was a special treat to cap off our busy days.",5,2010,12,01
144,"Nice find, not perfect but great location.","My colleague and I stayed here for two night at the beginning of the month. It was recommended to us by another colleague. It is in a great location - an easy walk to dozens of restaurants and shopping. The rooms are quite small - we each had a single- but the bed was extremely comfortable. We got their internet rate so the price was reasonable for this part of London. Despite the fact that we had e-mailed ahead and said we would be arriving early, our rooms were not ready. We went off for a few hours and still one of our rooms was still not ready. They did give us drinks and provided free internet access. The concierge staff was particularly helpful. I'd go back.",4,2010,11,21
144,"Elegant, discreet hotel with outstanding service in great location","Have stayed at Flemings for both business and pleasure. Outstanding location in quiet street in Mayfair off Piccadilly, very close to Green Park tube and the park itself, with St James, Bond Street, the Royal Academy all just a short walk away.  Shepherd Market also very close by and a great area to eat and drink relatively unknown to visitors. Rooms are elegant and very comfortable indeed, with lots of nice touches and luxurious bathrooms. Outstanding is the courtesy of the staff; nothing is too much trouble.",5,2010,11,17
144,The only place to stay for Luxury Mayfair treat,"We stayed at Flemmings as part of a weekend away for a 40th birthday treat for my wife. The moment we arrived we know that we had chossen a very special hotel, a recomendation from a friend. The staff couldn't have been more helpful, even lettngs use a room after we had checked out to change once we had done some sightseeing. The decor and quality of the furninshings are all first rate. The bedroom was spacious and the biggest bed I had ever seen. 
Frequent guests seemed to referred to by name and as soon as you walk through the door the staff are all willing to wish you a friendly welcome and chat. This isn't a big chain  hotel but if you are looking for chic small butique type hotel then this is for you.
Only two minutes from Buckingham palace and the ritz. 
Would recomend this hotel to anyone.",5,2010,11,09
144,"Outstanding hotel, great location.",This is a lovely boutique hotel in a great location.  We had no complaints at all.,5,2010,11,09
144,Lovely location for our 1st Anniversary,"This hotel is a little gem, tucked away down one of Mayfair's backstreets. We took advantage of the hotel's offer of champagne and a cupcake as well as full English breakfast all included in the standard one night room rate. That saved us about £35-40 per person.  Superb value and a genuine ""offer"" very rare in hotels in London. Our room was lovely. Nicely decorated and clean. The bed was great. The only grumble was that the TV was rather quiet and try as we might we couldn't get the volume up. It wasn't a worry though as we didn't really watch the TV very much and I have no doubt it could have been sorted if we'd asked reception. The service was amazing. The concierge was amazingly helpful. Nothing was too much trouble. The bar in the hotel was great. A really modern feel and very welcoming.  When we came to claim our champagne and cupcake we were told that unfortunately they had run out of cupcakes and there wouldn't be any available until the morning. However as an alternative they offered us slices of any one of their cakes. These were lovely and equally as good as having cupcakes. All in all we had a great stay made all the better by the amazing service we received from all the staff we came accross. The only people we didn't like were the loud rude americans making the waiting staff's lives very difficult at the delicious breakfast...",5,2010,11,07
144,"staff,service,room,location=lovely","What a wonderful place to stay, greeted on saturday by really friendly staff, my teenage daughter swears the beds are the most confortable she has ever slept in. We managed to fit in shopping, theatre, museums and china town, in an ovenight stay. Great location easy to use the buses and an easy walk through to oxford street regent street. We felt very spoilt, all the staff were very friendly and we were able to leave bags during the last day and return to collect them later.",5,2010,10,31
144,Great Service & Value,"I booked this hotel for our 5th wedding anniversary and a getaway for the night for the first time, since the birth of our first baby (without him).

The deal was great value for money and included champagne and cup cakes during the afternoon and a full English breakfast in the morning and overall this deal itself was £40 cheaper than the best room only rate. The two extras also added up to about £80 if purchased separately so was an excellent deal

The service is wonderful and everything you would expect from a 5 star hotel, from the moment you walk through the door you are greeted and looked after.

The decor, restaurants and bar areas are extremely well presented and furnished and the service in these areas was exemplary.

The location is also great and a lot of attractions and shopping are all within walking distance of the hotel, including Green Park tube which has great connections.

The only downside was the standard of the rooms, which unfortunately let the hotels 5 star rating down. We had room 122 and there was a patch of wallpaper off the wall above the TV and on the bed there was a bloodstain and rip on the covers. This is not what you would expect in a 5 star establishment. The bathroom was also mediocre, with a shower above the bath (not my idea of 5 star) dirty blinds and poor tiling throughout. The biggest downside though has to be the lack of double glazing which means the constant sound of traffic being heard most the night. This was very disappointing.

Overall, the hotel was great value for money, the service is excellent but unfortunately a few finer details lets the hotel down. Maybe it is me being picky but these are the things that make the difference between 4 and 5 star hotels for me.

I would recommend this hotel to anyone though and make sure you book through there own website to get the best deals.",4,2010,10,31
144,Great location and great boutique hotel,"I didn't want to stay in a big hotel so Flemings was a great choice. Location is excellent, close to the tube, easy walking distance to Bond St, Buckingham Palace and Hyde Park. Close to the original Hard Rock Cafe.

We stayed in a standard room. The room was modern but tiny (as is standard in Europe, I hear).

The staff are friendly. We had an early morning flight fron Sydney, and unfortunately our room wasn't ready (as was expected) but they were happy to take our bags and we went out exploring.

We booked under a weekend special package. I think the price is well worth it!",4,2010,10,21
144,Good if it is where you want to be,"This luxury hotel shows its luxury from the moment that you enter the foyer, but there developed some details in my stay that took the edge off perfection.  The lift is decorated as a library with false book spines - that seems really daft.  My room on the top floor was accessed by a tortured narrow corridor with steps up and down.  Outside on the table was a used tray of dirty plates and glasses; it was still there next day.   The room was a bit cramped and noisy with air an conditioning vent outside the window.   The TV was locked up and greeted someone else,   It took ages for hot water to come from the bath and washbasin taps.  The dining room and food were excellent.

Maybe I am picky, and these details are not really important.  But the hotel is not inexpensive and I expected perfection, so I was let down by a number of flaws.  I might go again however, because the location is great.",4,2010,10,11
144,A hidden treasure to escape from it all,"I had visited the Hotel before for Cocktails and I had been very impressed. I was even more so when I was delighted to be treated to an overnight stay at the Hotel. The Staff were very welcoming, efficient and the ambience perfect! My daughter had oraganised Champagne and Cup cakes for my Birthday Surprise and we enjoyed the suroundings of the Front Room for this. We had booked an evening meal with friendsoutside the Hotel, but we couldn't resist a final drink in the downstairs bar. Comfortable, stylish and fun!! After a very good nights sleep in the oversized heavenly bed, we struggled to make a choice from the extensive breakfast menu! My daughter enjoyed the pancakes with maple syrup and bacon, my husband the egges benedict and I , the boiled eggs with soldiers!! Lured by local shopping we left our bags with the friendly Concierge for a few hours and reluctantly collected them, with a promise to return soon. Go on treat yourself!!",5,2010,10,06
144,Could be so much better!,"The Classic Single room on the third floor in which I stayed look nothing like the photos on tripadvisor.com.  The room looks out to the gutter of a building.  As my view is of the dark building wall, I could not see the sky at all and thus could not tell what the weather is like.  

The overall quality of the hotel is poor in relation to the price it charges (GBP 230 per night), based on the following impression:
1. the towels are yellowish and well used, not ""white fluffy"" as mentioned by another reviewer.
2. I asked for extra towels and the housekeeping manager (a woman in blue suit) who brought them to me was not pleased at the request.  I asked her if the deadbolt lock on the door was broken, as I couldn't turn the lock.  She gave me an annoying look and said tersely ""I don't know, go ask the concierge!""
3. the curtain was so dusty that I got allergy from standing too close to it.  Housekeeping should vaccum clean the curtain!
4. The only floor space I could put my suitcase is near the curtain (and that's why I had to stand close to that dusty curtain).

While I understand this is not a purpose-built hotel, they could have better designed the room to make space.  The large double bed could have been replaced by a smaller single to create more floor space.  I had to squeeze myself between the 6-feet heater board and the wall, in order to access the items inside.  I am also disppointed that the bathroom was not refitted/redesigned during the last renovation.  Owner/Management of this hotel should visit base2stay and Number Sixteen in Kensington to learn something about space design and utilization.  As it stands now, the Flemings Maybe is just as tacky as the lobby lounge decor.  If not for its location, I would not stay here again unless they charge a more reasonable price.",3,2010,09,28
144,A wonderful week in London at a hotel whose staff is superior and takes the extra step to please guests.,"From the first moment we arrived at Flemings Mayfair, we were impressed by the quality of the staff.  Guest Services had gone out of their way on a Sunday to provide a last-minute request from the US for a birthday bouquet of two dozen roses for me, as well as my favorite UK Scotch.   Our room was superior, spacious, elegant, and most comfortable.  The location was perfect for us; my friend and I walked everywhere that we wanted to go.  My friend had stayed there four years ago, and remembered the ambience, especially the book-lined elevator.  Being at Flemings Mayfair made our visit one we will never forget !",5,2010,09,20
144,Welcoming glamorous hideaway for a Christmas treat,"For a 40th Birthday present my husband and I and our 2 boys (5 and 9) were spoilt with a weekend stay at Flemings Hotel. Great spot in a quite street opposite Green Park,  off Piccadilly.  When we came into the smart lobby and reception, we were a little nervous but happily were greeted with courtesy and friendliness, which is not always the case when you have 2 lively boys and they responded accordingly.  We were amazed when our room turned out to be the Penthouse suite which has its own private lift entrance much to the joy of my children. As we popped out of our lift, the decorated Christmas tree, cosy classic English furnishings,  fresh fruit and flowers and a personal note from the General Manager made us feel like very special guests. We had planned the trip around visits to the Christmas lights (just round the corner) and ice skating at the natural History Museum (a short bus ride away) which we enjoyed but found ourselves most wanting to be back in our Mayfair home! As a family we appreciated the space, with a living room, a kitchen, a roof terrace and  2 large 4 poster bedrooms with bathrooms we really felt we were living the Mayfair highlife. Breakfast was a splendid affair in the plush restaurant downstairs which my boys now use as their benchmark for all breakfasts. It really does feel like a secret find, with personal touches that can be absent in this busy part of town. We hope to make it an annual visit up to London with the children to see the lights and enjoy our bit of Mayfair life.",5,2010,09,17
144,"Impersonal reception, poky rooms","The Mayfair location is excellent, close to Piccadilly and Green Park, so ideal for exploring central London without even the need for a cab or the tube. The reception area is sterile with a lot of wasted space. The reception staff are not particularly helpful or welcoming. It is clear that the hotel has been renovated to try to cram as many rooms in as possible - corridors are narrow, their floorboards creaky, walls are thin. The room I had was poky with a miniscule shower room (not really a bathroom). Overpriced.",3,2010,09,15
144,Advance to Mayfair,"Flemings is well located for Piccadilly and the West End. Also adjacent to Royal Parks so on a hot day - there is a place to relax outdoors.
The hotel is very comfortable.
Not a great fan of their breakfasts - and if paying extra - as we were - then better value to go to Shepherds Market.
The latter also has lots of good restaurants too.
They have good value weekend breaks - although we were too late to avail ourselves of one.",4,2010,09,10
144,Gorgeous Hotel & Friendly Staff.,Stayed here just last night and had a wonderful time. We stayed for one night only in a Classic Room. The room wasn't huge but it was very comfortable and totally spotless. The fluffy white towels in the bathroom were lovely as were the toiletries. We had an afternoon tea which wasn't cheap at about £25 a head but it was lovely and really made us feel like we were spoiling ourselves. The only thing that let it down was the service at breakfast. We had pre-paid for a continental breakfast but instead of taking our room number and checking we were sat down at table by a waiter with a full breakfast menu and left here for 20 minutes. We got bored of waiting and just ended up helping ourselves to the continental buffet. When a waitress finally checked on us (25 mins after we sat down) there was no apology for the wait and she seemed somewhat put out that we had started eating before ordering! A bit off really however we can't fault any of the other service at all. It's just the breakfast service that would benefit from either more staff or perhaps some further training of the current staff.,5,2010,09,05
144,Could be so much better,"This was the second time we have stayed at the Flemings-Mayfair. We had a few issues last time, but thought we would give them a second chance since the location is perfect - right around the corner from the Green Street Underground, only a few blocks from Piccadilly Circus, & perfect for shopping on Jermyn Street. The main issue is the staff's demeanor - everything is just such a Herculean effort for them. The only helpful, friendly staff members are the door/bellmen - they were impeccable. Everything was just alright  - nothing great, nothing truly terrible. Just not at the 4star level it should be, especially for the price. With so many other choices in London, I cannot, in good conscious, recommend this hotel.",3,2010,09,04
144,Great location and service,"This hotel is in a great location: close to Piccadilly, and many other sites but far enough you don't hear the noise at night. The staff was helpful and efficient. The rooms were clean. I stayed twice in a matter of days. The first time in the executive suite and the second in a regular room. The excecutive suite is more what North Americans would be used to size-wise.",5,2010,08,30
144,Fabulous Birthday weekend stay,"Flemmings is a superb hotel and I would highly recommend it.
Upon arrival we were greeted by concierge who were helpful and polite. We were checked in promptly and quickly with the help of the reception staff, who were excellent.

In our room, we were greeted with complimentary drinks and fruit, as the hotel were aware this was a special occasion, this was very much appriciated, and added to our wonderfull stay.

The room was nicely decorated and beds were comfortable, my only suggestion here, would the to be full length mirror. The bedroom was very clean, and during the evening we were offered a ""turn down service"" if we wished,  this added to our excellent visit.

The breakfast was cooked to order, and breakfast service was lovely, maybe a few more pastry options could be available. The breakfast staff were very approachable and helpful.

As we did not try the evening restaurant, we had primose hill cupcakes and champagne in the library, highly recommended , the cupcakes were superb. If you want a steak meal, try the JW Steakhouse which is a 10-15 minute walk from the hotel, amazing food!

Definately would stay here again, with out a doubt. We had a superb experience, and the staff were excellent. Thank you for a wonderfull stay!",5,2010,08,24
144,"Elegant hotel, but something changed","We’ve stayed the Flemings Mayfair over the past decade. We’ve enjoyed the regular stay in London every summer holiday. Our favorites were 
・Good location　(near the Green Park for the morning Jog) 
・Cozy　atmosphere　(with the friendliness of the staff, Mohammed　etc.)
・Nice breakfast (Hot and cold plates buffet including a piece of the smoked Haddock, Kipper and a slice of many kind of fruits) 
In this July, we stayed two nights. Our room had a view into the inside square and the noise level of ventilators was quite loud. (But this is not the first time.)
The renovation of the dinning room has been finished and the atmosphere is more elegant. Meanwhile the hotel was renovated; we are disappointed to reduce the buffet breakfast menu. (Now it is “Real” continental breakfast.)
　And last year we could read Japanese newspaper.
So, we must say that the customer target should be shifted from Japanese.
Next year we are wondering to search another hotel after 10 year-regular stay.",3,2010,08,19
144,Posh hotel in a great location!,"My husband and I stayed at the Mayfair hotel for 5 days during our time in London. A friend of mine recommended this hotel to me after she stayed here a year ago and we definitely were not disappointed. We loved the hotel's location, right next to Green Park tube stop and right across the street from the park itself. It's within walking distance to many popular attractions such as Buckingham Palace, Picadilly Circus, and the double decker bus stop is across the street from the hotel.
The hotel itself has a very posh interior. The staff was very helpful when asking for help with directions, etc. The rooms are small (as most places are in London) but had everything you would need. 
The only negative thing was when we arrived back at the hotel around midnight one evening, the fire alarm had been going off and everyone was outside in their pajamas waiting to be let back in. We only had to wait maybe 10 minutes until we could go back in, but it looked like the other guests had been out there for a little while and were not very happy. We didn't mind since we were out that evening anyway. 
We are looking forward to our next trip to London and we will definitely be returning to the Mayfair Hotel!",5,2010,08,16
144,Unbeatable Location,"I stayed one night at a great Hotwire rate.  The area, Mayfair, is perfect, with Green Park tube station close by (Piccadilly Line to Heathrow). The tiny room showed a certain amount of wear and tear, and I would have appreciated a better bedside light for reading, but overall the room was neat and cosy. Several affordable food options are nearby, and for relaxation, there's Green Park of course, a lovely oasis on a warm day.  Staff were courteous and polite.",4,2010,08,14
144,Luxurious Hotel conveniently placed to cater for all in an exclusive part of London,"Had a trip to London for our sons summer holidays and decided to stay at Flemings - what a great choice. We stayed for 3 nights and from the moment we arrived we were made to feel at home. Very friendly staff and happy to help with any queries. Also very child friendly.
Could smell fresh flowers when we walked through the door, is beautifully decorated and feels very luxurious. Lovely quiet lounge with modern eyecatching furnishings to have coffee or afternoon tea. 
Our room was an ample size, large bathroom with huge seperate shower cubicle. A sofa bed was assembled each night for our son and the flat screen TV with movies kept him busy before bed.
We had breakfast each morning and there was plenty of choice, from hot cooked english, to cereals, fruit and pastries. 
The hotel is just a few minutes walk from Buckingham Palace, Green Park Tube and New Bond Street where all the designer shops are hiding - fab for us ladies!!!
Would definately recommend to friends for business or pleasure.",5,2010,08,13
144,Fantastic,"Spent two nights here.
The staff were wonderful and couldnt have been more attentive or helpful.
Room was great not only tea and coffe making facilities but a tea pot as well! There was an iron and ironing board as well that came in very useful.
Had a meal in the restaurant on the Friday night and I have to say it was one of the nicest meals I have ever eaten. The crab and tomato cosomme starter although a little small was absolutely to die for, and again the restaurant staff were marvellous.I have stayed in several top London hotels and in my opinion none compare to this gem.",5,2010,08,13
144,Solid hotel in decent location,"We stayed here for 2 nights and it was nice but we'd stayed in better hotels in London for the same price (Millenium Baileys for instance).  It had a posh lobby and the rooms were nicely decorated and clean.  It was a few blocks from the Green Park station so was easy to get to from the Piccadilly line (5 minutes walk).  It has a few shops and cafes in walking distance and a few nightclubs close by so quite a few pluses.

The cons: the shower was hot and cold and would have been terrible if we were there in winter.  There was little storage room and if we were there for more than 2 nights it might have been annoying. Also internet was not included in the price so was a bit of a downer but this could be common in London hotels?",3,2010,08,12
144,great location - very pleasant stay,My colleagues and I stayed at FLEMINGS MAYFAIR for 2 nights during the week. After having had a problem with our luggage at the airport the attentive staff at reception and THE FRONT ROOM managed to calm us down nicely. The rooms we stayed in weren´t the biggest but offered everything a business-traveller needs. Unfortunately we didn´t have the time to indulge in the deliciously-looking afternoon tea. We got the hotel recommended by our business-associates and we´ll certainly stay there again on our next trip to London.,5,2010,08,12
144,Fantastic Hotel Fantastic Staff,"Had a fantastic night here at the weekend the staff couldnt have been more helpful and the room was beautiful, very clean, breakfast was also very good although we had a problem it was rectifed straght away and with no fuss, would recommend this to anyone wanting to stay in cetral london",5,2010,08,09
144,Stylish Afternoon Tea,"I dropped into Flemings for afternoon tea last week and was not disappointed: the service, food and decor were all first class. We had tea upstairs in a beautifully decorated room - I don't agree at all with the earlier comment that the decoration will date quickly as I thought it was classic. The tea itself was enormous - loads of sandwiches and cakes, more than enough and the service was very friendly. We popped into the bar downstairs afterwards and that too was stunning. It's been a while since I was last at Flemings but the place has been transformed and I hope to be back soon.",5,2010,08,03
144,Disappointment,"I've traveled quite a lot and seen many Hotels and the Flemings Mayfair was not one of my favorites. Our room had a view into the inside square. The noise level of ventilators was quite loud. When saying the room was renovated, the only thing that was ""new"" was the sofa and some other furniture, the air condition box was old and so were the shower amenities. The television was not turnable and faced in the direction of the bathroom, so it was complicated to watch TV in bed. The friendliness of the staff was not acceptable, a service lady at breakfast was quite rude and gave answers like ""whatever"". After a fire alarm went off in the middle of the night there was no fire inspector that came to check the hotel, instead the staff said the guests should go back to their rooms. When checking out the next morning there was no apology for the rude awakening or anything of that matter. For that price I would offer more and be a little more friendly to the guests.",2,2010,08,03
144,Comfort in Mayfair,"Stayed here at £204 ex vat special rate.  Complementary upgrade on arrival, reception staff professional and friendly.  Room was great - 2 queen beds, fresh blue and white decor, small but well fitted out bathroom.  L shaped room with sofa so felt very spacious.  Full English breakfast not cheap at £22 but cooked to order - far better than usual hot buffet - and there was a cold buffet selection too.  Rather abrupt service on the Friday morning but charming staff on Saturday - bit of a lottery there?  Public rooms have recently been refurbished and are a bit OTT - lots of garish colours and over the top styling which will date very quickly.  But a great location near Green Park tube, near Oxfort Street and Piccadilly etc.  Would certainly stay again if I could source a good rate.",5,2010,07,27
144,What a great location and very friendly,We stayed for one night and we had a great time. Really friendly and helpful staff and the location is amazing!,5,2010,07,26
144,"Beautiful, great location but extremely small room","This is a lovely hotel in a great location.  However for the price we paid, our room (Classic) was extremely small, with a queen size bed smaller than we are used to. The bathroom was also very small, though adequately fitted out.  Having stayed in hotels for less money with much larger, more luxurious rooms, we know it must be the location that commands the premium price. 

When we arrived, the mini bar was not working so all the drinks were warm on a particularly hot day.  We were told by reception that we would need to order cold drinks through room service, though they later sent a maintenance person to repair the mini bar.  We were charged the full service charge for the room service orders which we were not expecting. 

All in all, a nice hotel, in a wonderful location, but I think over priced for the size and quality of room.",3,2010,07,26
144,Flemings is a gem of a hotel,"The service was great and the staff were lovely.  We were chuffed when we were told we'd been upgraded to an executive room, which was beautiful, comfortable and restful with good facilities and luxurious furnishings.  Mayfair is a fab location and we were able to walk to the Victoria Apollo to see Wicked, as well as lots of famous sights.  What we liked most about the hotel was its wow factor interior design, intimate atmosphere and genuinely nice staff.  Breakfast was generous and tasty, and as for our evening meal... exceptional !  We loved our stay at Flemings and if we stay in London again it will be here.  The best hotel either of us have stayed at.  Thank you so much.  xx",5,2010,07,25
144,Flemings is a friendly and unique hotel perfectly situated in Mayfair,"I really enjoyed my stay. The staff were all friendly, helpful and welcoming.
The rooms were spotless and nicely decorated. 
The hotel is in the heart of Mayfair and is a splendid location.",5,2010,07,25
144,Flemings is a great hotel in a superb location,"Flemings is a great hotel in a superb location.  The Reception staff in the stylish foyer greeted us warmly.  The lift is a delight as it resembles a mini library with book facades covering the walls!   There is also a wonderful selection of nostalgic black and white Getty photographs along the corridors.

Our room was elegant and spacious with a view over Half Moon Street.  I loved the attention to detail, such as the luxury coordinating furnishing and cushions and all the facilities behind the mirrored wardrobe doors.  The air conditioning was quiet and effective. 

We enjoyed an early light supper in the restaurant.  The waiter was attentive and the food was delicious and well presented.

Flemings Mayfair is chic and quite unique – just look at their website.   We have now stayed at Flemings twice, loved the ambiance and budget permitting look forward to our next stay.",5,2010,07,23
144,Afternoon Tea,"The good points:

The newly refurbished tea rooms are elegant and comfortable

The afternoon tea is delicious and plentiful (far more than we could eat)

The not so good points:

Our pots of tea arrived sometime after the food and without milk

The waiting staff had disappeared and we had to go into the kitchen to ask for the milk

A hefty 12.5% service charge was added to our bill (we were not made aware of this at point of booking)

Given that we were the only people in the tea room at the time, these minor problems should not have happened. However we would return as the surroundings are lovely and at £23.50 a head, the traditional afternoon tea is good value for money in central London. We just feel that the waiting staff should be more attentive to the needs of their customers and hope that on our next visit this will have improved.",3,2010,07,14
144,Your Hotel Search is Over! Stay here,"My stay at the hotel was wonderful. The room was neat clean, and the bathroom was so spacious. I also loved that there was tea/coffee maker available. I had tea and biscuits nightly. 
The staff was kind and courteous, and very helpful. They even let me print out my travel documents on the hotel's printer.The hotel is so close to the metro only a few blocks away. Perfect locale close to everything and all of the great Mayfair shopping. I will definitely stay here on my next trip to London.
Only complaint was the price of breakfast. There are so many places nearby to get a bite. Not worth the expense.",4,2010,07,12
144,Perfect Location for couples or small families,"My husband and I loved this hotel.  Great location in Mayfair in a beautiful building.  Close to the market and just 3 blocks to the Green Park tube station.  The entire staff was courteous and friendly.  Our room (207) was perfect.  Quiet and away from the elevator and main hallway, decorated beautifully (see photos of the room with the magnolia style wallpaper).  Sitting area, couch, king size bed, dresser, closet and a large bathroom were all perfect.  I highly recomend this hotel to anyone looking for a quiet stay in London but in reach of all the major neighborhoods via metro.  Cute, boutique style hotel.",5,2010,06,15
144,Absolutely Wonderful!,"My husband, grown children and I recently stayed at the Fleming's Mayfair Hotel from May 29Th til June 5th. We had two rooms on the first floor across the hall from each other. We were able to use the staircase off the Library and really did feel like we were coming home at the end of each day. The hotel is beautiful, the rooms are charming - everyone is helpful. The location speaks for itself. We walked almost every place and if the walk was too much, the tube stop at Green Park was right there. Shepard's Market is around the corner and we found ourselves eating breakfast and dinner there.The Little Square Restaurant was perfect  for dinner-service was personal and attentive, food, delicious. Cafe In - great for breakfast or brunch. Would go back in a heart beat! Loved it!",5,2010,06,11
144,An amazingly beautiful hotel with wonderful staff,"Being a country girl taking a trip to the ""bright lights of London"" is very daunting. However after being recommended to stay at the Flemings Hotel I need not of worried.  On arrival the staff were really friendly and extremely professional. I was taken to my room and the door was opened - I stepped back in amazement.  The room was beautifully decorated and the size of the bed was massive.  It was so clean and had everything that you needed. The decor was very complimentry of the hotel.  The hotel has wonderful arrangements of fresh flowers throughout and you get this great feeling of being in a lovely boutique hotel that does not seem to be in central London.  The following morning breakfast was fantastic.  Although it was ""only breakfast"" the full english breakfast was cooked to order so it was lovely and fresh and it was massive.However if you did not fancy a full english breakfast then there was lots of other options to choose from. The waiter was extremely polite and very friendly and he seemed genuinely happy in his work.

This hotel is situated in an ideal location of London with Green Park opposite and a short walk away from Buckingham Palace. If I had the opportunity I would of loved to have stayed a few extra nights but unfortunately had to get back to reality and back to being a country girl. 

I would really recommend staying here not only because of its location but also for what the hotel has to offer with its lovely atmosphere, beautiful decor and extremely helpful and professional staff.",5,2010,06,08
144,"A great, home from home, central hotel with attentive, friendly staff","I have stayed at the Flemings Mayfair Hotel many times (both business and leisure) and have never been disappointed. This well managed, scrupulously clean, boutique style hotel is a real home from home, and all members of staff (from manager to porters) are most friendly and welcoming. All room types (from classic to the beautiful and impressive apartments) are well appointed and most comfortable with excellent standards through-out (the newly refurbished library and restaurant are a sumptuous joy!!). A quality hotel n a quality location, I would not hesitate to recommend. this hotel to friends or family.

144,Room-service is first class  !,"The thing that stands Flemings apart from other hotel is the attention to detail , the flowers , the cushions, the bottle of wine waiting , You feel as though you are walking in to a magazine photo shoot The location is fantastic ,whether you want to explore the hidden treasures of Mayfair, Green Park , visit a west end show or sight-seeing in general, all are with easy reach of Flemings . 
Room-service is first class. we made use of our dining room table . As is the breakfast serviced in the restaurant . The buffet choice is substantial,while your hot breakfast is cooked to order . 
If you are looking for luxury , tranquility , flexibilty and great location Flemings ticks all the boxes for a great experience .",5,2010,05,31
144,"Fabulous hotel,friendly staff,a real hidden gem in the centre of London",Absolutely superb hotel with a very personal feel. The room was exquisite and a joy to stay in. The staff couldn't have been more helpful and the whole experience made my trip complete. Would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a luxurious stay in a perfect location,5,2010,05,21
144,Elegance and comfort in the heart of London's Mayfair.,"Not for the first time, my wife and I, together with business colleagues, had the pleasure of staying at Flemings Mayfair hotel in early May. Always a very pleasant experience, the hotel improves with every visit. The staff are welcoming, warm and friendly throughout, the rooms are myriad in style, quiet and classy and the food simply excellent.

Whether on business or leisure, I cannot imagine a better location. It is a rare and thoroughly enjoyable way to stay in central London that I would recommend to anyone.

Brian Shaw",5,2010,05,21
144,Perfect location; Excellent value,"Our room on the 3rd floor was extremely quiet (as requested), well furnished, small but with a spacious bathroom featuring a deep soaking tub and forceful shower.  Public areas are beautiful; all staff are very helpful and pleasant .  Concierge services particularly good. The healthful, delicious breakfast buffet in the lovely hotel restaurant was appreciated.  Convenient to all transportation and to many upscale shops and restaurants.  We look forward to a return visit and would definitely recommend this hotel.",4,2010,05,18
144,This would be be first choice of hotel in London,"On arriving at this hotel you are struck by 2 things, the striking reception area which while immediately giving this hotel an air of luxury, also has the knack of making you feel relaxed in your surroundings. Secondly, the courteous and helpful staff who add to your relaxation. There is a room off the main reception area where you can relax which echoes the opulance of the rest of the hotel.
The guest rooms are elegantly furnished and have everything you could need while away from home. I have had the pleasure to stay at this hotel on more than one occasion and all the rooms are of excellent standard. The food and service are second to none. The location of this hotel is ideal whether you're there for shopping, sociallising or simply for a relaxing weekend away.",5,2010,05,16
144,A quiet place in bustling London,"We just had a four night stay in this hotel. Booked a "" Harrods shopping package"". The classic room was on the small side but very clean and well equipped. (they rate it as three star which is accurate).The staff is very friendly and helpfull especially in the restaurant !
Extended breakfast with good quality food ! We had dinner one evening and compliments to the chef... we had a very good meal, very tasty and beautifull presented! 
The location is unbeatable: a short walk to Knightsbridge, and to the left a short walk to Piccadilly Circus and Hyde Park. We would stay again and recommend it to others !",4,2010,05,06
144,"Fabulous stylish and comfortable hotel, with staff that go out of their way to make you feel at home.","Flemings is a hidden gem, in a fabulous location, whether you are looking to spend time in  london on vacation or a short business trip. The minute you walk through the door you are made to feel welcome and at home, and the staff go out of their way to make your stay as comfortable as possible.  Flemings has recently been refurbished, and oozes style and sophistication. A perfect place to return to, and relax after a busy day in London. I look forward to my next stay.",5,2010,05,03
144,"Great hotel, great location, over-priced for certain amenities.","We were very happy with the customer service we received at this hotel, and the location, which is in the most exclusive neighborhood in London.  The staff always greeted us with smiles when leaving or arriving, and the doormen and concierge were extremely helpful with recommending good restaurants and giving advice on day trips, etc.  Everyone was very friendly.  We got a deal worked into our stay for their continental breakfast, which was very good, but extremely over-priced for regular guests (16 GBP for some toast, coffee, croissants & some fruit....you're better off going around the corner to coffee shops).  The rooms were very nice, clean, and decorated nicely; beds were large, although hard and the pillows were not comfortable.  The showers were not fully enclosed, which caused water to accumulate all over the floor, so that when you stepped out, you had to be careful not to slip on the marble floors.  The hotel charged about 1GBP per minute for local phone calls, which was disappointing, the charges for the wi-fi use were totally over-priced.  The lobby and library, bar and restaurant were nicely decorated and the hotel was in a fantastic location.  The hotel was very nice one morning and served us breakfast with no charge early in the morning in their library (because we had already paid for our continental breakfast, but were unable to eat it because we had to leave by 6 am). Overall, we really enjoyed our stay there and would highly recommended this hotel.",4,2010,04,23
144,really superb luxury hotel in the heart of Mayfair,"The public rooms at Flemings have recently undergone a fantastic renovation and are more opulent and comfortable than ever. Bedrooms are quiet and extremely comfortable with large beds and rich tasteful fabrics and every amenity. The staff are extremely efficient and friendly; the receptionist even checked me in for a flight on my departure day!
Thoroughly recommended for business trips or pleasure.",5,2010,04,16
144,Finger on the pulse,"The quality of  4 star hotels  is very variable -especially in London. Well Flemings absolutely merits being a 4 star and if other 4 stars in London were judged by Flemings standards there just might be a very large number of establishments downgraded to a three!
We perhaps were lucky with our room which was very comfortable and well appointed. So what Flemings claim on their website in our experience is the reality of our stay there.
Staff are very friendly and professional. One is greeted upon entering and leaving the hotel and room servicing does not intrude.
We were very  lucky in finding a prepaid deal several weeks prior to our stay that included buffet  breakfast. As all London hotels breakfast is expensive. I tend to judge any breakfast by the coffee and while I have tasted much worse why hotels do not just have a Nesprosso or similar machine machine baffles me. Catching a waiter's eye at breakfast can be frustrating. Similarly if Flemings had a toaster located at the buffet would be useful.
As other reviews state the location is terrific for getting around by foot with lots of coffee bars ,pubs and reasonable dining options. Rather than cram unto the tube the bus stops nearby cover large parts of central and the best way by far is to get an Oyster card .
By phoning [--] and selecting option 3 a prompt reply advises you of tube/bus routes. Buses are very regular and lots more to see .
To put Flemings approach in a phrase I would simply say they have their finger on the pulse of what guests might expect but rarely experiences",5,2010,04,15
144,Recommended with a few cons,"We, a family of four adults, spent five nights in one of the apartments. 

Pros
-Location near Green Park underground, Piccadilly, Buckingham Palace, many restaurants
-Value for money (except internet)
-Living-room comfortable
-Kitchen was fully equipped, bottled water replaced, no charge
-Warm welcome with food, flowers and Easter Egg (chocolate)
-Professional staff
-Nice bathrooms
-Silent sleeping
-Private access apartments with (small) elevator

Cons
-15 GBP for 24 hrs WiFi is so 2006-2007
-One of the bedrooms had a very small bed (no twins)
-Flatscreen sticking out on shelf in bedroom, strange

Recommended for breakfast, nearby at Piccadilly: Pret and The Wolseley. Dinner: Kiku (Japanese restaurant in same street as hotel).",4,2010,04,12
144,"Wow, stylish, efficient, considerate, great night's sleep, staff couldn't have been more helpful.","Not having stayed for a while at the hotel I was amazed at the transformation. The pictures on Trip Advisor don't do it justice. The staff are so accommodating, my room was stylish and comfortable and the food in the restaurant for dinner was gorgeous. Although travelling on business am definitely considering it for a weekend away to make the most of an afternoon tea!",5,2010,04,08
144,"Good location, but unusual stay","We chose the Mayfair for it's great location, near Buckingham Palace and Green Park, Soho, and Piccadilly. The decor looked a little dated, but found out it was recently updated?
It was clean and the room was a decent size. We did have a terrible night sleep due to a fire alarm that went off at 2 in the morning. All of the hotel guests seemed puzzled about what exactly to do, but we found our way through the maze of hall ways and corridors to the lobby and out side. The fire department came, and left rather quickly, but no hotel staff ever came out to say it was safe to return to our room, and even offer an apology for the disturbance. We would not stay here again.",3,2010,03,21
144,Great Area  - Nice Hotel,"We loved the convenience to the tube and the rest of London. Hotel was good, rooms were small but staff was very attentive. I would stay again.",5,2010,03,16
144,"Location, Comfort and Service!","My partner and I stayed at the Flemings Mayfair in late February 2010 for four evenings and were thoroughly pleased.  We chose this hotel for its wonderful location, when traveling we like to stay in a walk-able area but with public transport close by for visiting sites further away.  The Flemings meet both our requirements with the Green Park station a 5 minute walk from the hotel. 
The common areas are handsome, while the rooms are more muted and decorated to high standards. 
The room was good size with two wardrobes, flat screen TV, honor bar at a charge, free coffee and tea making facilities, fast wi-fi in the room at a charge, and a very comfortable bed nicely dressed.  The bath was spacious with plenty of counter space, nice toiletries and a rain head shower that I really enjoyed. 
A continental breakfast was included in our rate and it was just OK, there is room for improvement in the selection but most important in the presentation and the staff needs to keep a better eye on it.  On two mornings the juice selections and the yogurts were empty, when I pointed it out, it was quickly restocked.  The morning restaurant staff was very friendly and always keeps my coffee cup full but every staff member we encountered was courteous and helpful.
They deserve praise were praise is due. If there is anything you are not happy about or need amended just ask and it will be done. 
We would recommend this Hotel for its great location in Mayfair, comfortable rooms and its professional staff. We hope to be back soon!",4,2010,03,05
144,Fabulous Stay!,I stayed at Flemings in February and enjoyed a lovely stay in one of their apartments that was immaculately clean and very well appointed. The hotel itself is stylish and newly refurbished. All staff were helpful and couldn't do enough to make our stay a pleasurable one. Would highly reccommend it!,5,2010,03,04
144,top service and location,"My husband, 17 year old daughter and I spent a week in one of the apartments offered by Flemings. The apartment was large and comfortable, the kitchen was fully equipped, flat screen TV in the living room and bedrooms, wireless internet acsess was available. Bottled water was replaced in the fridge each day. It was great to have the privacy and comfort of a large apartment with the service of a hotel. The concierge, Paul, got us excellent theatre tickets, the doorman went down to Picacilly Street in the rain to get us a cab, all the service was top flight. The location is tremendous, within walking distance of many sights and loads of shopping. We had a wonderful time and would definitely go back.",4,2010,03,01
144,Delightful Newly Rennovated,"This hotel is in an ideal location near Green Park Tube and the Ritz.  Shepherd Market is around the corner and has several delightful pubs and lovely, affordable restaurants.  I have stayed in every accommodation catagory at Flemings and they all excude charm especially since the new renovatons.  On this trip I had friends in one of the apartments.  Their unit was beautifully decorated, had a fireplace, formal dining room and well appointed kitchen.  I stayed in a charming king bedded room that had a sofa, chair and would almost be considered a mini suite.  The beautiful marble bath was perfect.  All common areas have been redecorated and reflect a tasteful upbeat decor.  The dining room which serves a wonderful breakfast is patronized by locals which says a great deal.  The staff can't do enough for you.  Everyone from bellmen, front desk and concierge are expereinced professionals.  They all are eager to please and want to make sure your stay is perfect.  Housekeeping is quick and very efficient.  The hotel is located near many five star London establishments.  The area is very safe for families and women traveling alone. I enjoy Flemings more than the Ritz which is around the corner. This hotel is a find for the discriminating traveler.",5,2010,03,01
144,Mayfair 4 Star - Good for Area and Solo Accomodation,"Back again as a single traveler this time.  Still same great location very close to Green Park Tube...nightmare to get here on the tube as Green Park does not have step to street access which means there are escalators but they don't go all the way up and one is left dragging a bag up two levels of 5 - 10 or 25 or 30 steep steps depending on which exit you use.  An easier way to get there is by taking the tube to Earl's Court (4.50)and taking a cab (£11.00) over.  

That said, the check in was a breeze, although the gentleman at the desk spoke very quickly.  He did mention breakfast was included in my rate.  I asked for a room away from the front of the hotel as recommended by my own prior stay and other reviews in TA.  He said I was on the ground floor...which I was a bit leary of being a single traveler and thinking of noise.  Actually the room - 062- was tucked away up a couple of steps and far enough to the rear where it was very quiet - no elevator or other noises penetrated the room.  That said, it was a delightful single, not large at all, with a single bed and a good bathroom.  The room had a desk which many singles do not and although it lacked a suitcase valet the top of the mini-frig was a terrific height for me and I was able to fit my case on the top and repack quite nicely.  There were enough hangers in the room for my one night stay.  I have to say the bed was very comfortable and perhaps slightly larger than a normal single.  The room was nice and clean as was the bathroom, a slight bit of wear starting to show on the wallpaper (just needs sticking down)  and a bit on the wall where the cases rub but nothing offensive or dismaying.  My friends came in to see the room and one of them said he actually lived in a bedsit the same size when he first graduated from college.

There was only one glitch and that came at breakfast, as I have said before in my other review the coffee here is good and beats some of the local chains such as Costa and Nero.  The coffee was served promptly and a full-breakfast menu was handed to me and I ordered a small hot breakfast as I really didn't see where the buffet was and it was a very cold morning.  The sausage was pretty darn good for pork sausage and I could recommend the size of the portions as they were not too big.  Sometimes a cooked breakfast can be frightening but this was just right, eggs done as I requested, 5 tater tots, the sausage and mushroom.  Anyway, I was happy with my breakfast.  When I checked out they did charge me £2.00 for a hot breakfast, it seems that it was the continental breakfast that was included with my rate but neither my booking voucher nor the check-in man provided that explanation.  I didn't mind paying the £2.00 for breakfast as in terms of value for money it was a deal in Mayfair - what I did mind was not being provided the knowledge up-front.  So it seems one must ask which breakfast is included and this is a training issue, the front desk should be able to say 'you are entitled to the buffet breakfast or you are entitled to the cooked breakfast or you can add on the cooked breakfast for a bit more.'  This is one reception item that keeps me from giving it a 5 star review.  The other reception item also came at Check out.  I had made some telephone calls and I requested that I pay cash for them as I didn't like to place such a small charge on my credit card.  The woman said yes but didn't really explain how it worked so I asked her for a copy of the void transaction and she got all snippy.  She still didn't explain how the transaction billing worked well enough for my slow brain to comprehend.  But again this is a training issue.  I wasn't being snippy, I was exhausted and really didn't understand.

The bellhops were delightful and had great personalities, very helpful.  I did leave my bag there while I went for a few hours to attend to a business meeting I had scheduled and that went well although I thought I had lost my reclaim slip.  The bellhop didn't make a big deal out of it and I eventually found it.

Will I stay here again?  I think I just might as the price for Mayfair was very good and most everything ran smoothly.  For location and cleanliness you can't beat this hotel.  Even if reception is a wee bit surly the bellhops always have charming smiles and actually seem glad to see you!

PS  My friends looked at the room service menu and would have been happy to stay in and order from that but since I was in town only for one night I made them take me out!!!",4,2010,02,14
144,A weekend in London,"The Hotel came recomended and was a perfect locaton to sightsee, the places we had earmarked and the restaurants and theatre that were booked.

The overall impression from arrival to departure,was one of warmth, friendliness, with a strong desire to please.  We were made to feel special and nothing was too much trouble.
The service and standards in the room and around the hotel were first class, everywhere was spotless. Our friends were delighted with our choice of hotel, which in itself was very pleasing.
We are in the process of planning another weekend, as there was not enough time to visit all the places planned the first time.  So no guesses as to where we will stay!",5,2010,02,03
144,Luxury and tranquility provide weekend bliss,"I recently had the pleasure of staying at Flemings , in one of their luxury apartments. On entering the apartment we walked into a beautiful lounge, which had comfortable sofas and large TV , the lounge opened into the dinning room with a polished wood dining table and sideboard . The kitchen was well equipped with a plentiful welcome basket and well stocked fridge . Excellent to start your stay with a welcome pot of tea and biscuits . Downstairs we found 2 Luxury en-suite bedrooms and a outside terrace area .The apartment was spacious, elegantly decorated and well kept .
Since my last visit to Flemings the public areas have been refurbished , giving a contemporary boutique feel to the ground floor lounge and downstairs bar and restaurant . My favorite items of furniture are the huge green armchairs located in the lounge by the fire place . The thing that stands Flemings apart from other hotel is the attention to detail , all the little touches , the flowers , the cushions, the bottle of wine waiting , the welcome card from the GM . You feel as though you are walking in to a magazine photo shoot , then you meet the staff all of whom make you feel special . 
The location is fantastic ,whether you want to explore the hidden treasures of Mayfair, Green Park , visit a west end show or sight-seeing  in general, all are with easy reach of Flemings . 
Room-service is first class (we made use of our dining room table) as is the breakfast serviced in the restaurant . The buffet choice is substantial,while your hot breakfast is cooked to  order . 
If you are looking for luxury , tranquility , flexibilty and great location Flemings ticks all the boxes for a great experience .",5,2010,02,02
144,Great stay in London,"From the moment we arrived had excellent service. The rooms were a very high quality beds very comfortable, bathroom good lots of hot water and a good shower. We enjoyed an excellent english breakfast with everything you could wish for. A very pleasant stay nothing was too much trouble to ask for . Highly recommended!",5,2010,01,28
144,Mixed feelings,"This is the second time I have stayed at Flemings. The first time was in December of 2009 and I picked up a stomach bug from somewhere, I am not saying that the room service was to blame as I could have touched anything in the plane, train or taxi. Nevertheless my first stay was marred with what I can only describe as the winter vomiting bug which was horrid. Had I not been in London on important business I would have gone home. My main issue was that the room was not properly cleaned the following day and I mentioned my sickness to the reception staff. 

I put that visit to one side as a one off incident. I am now half way through my second stay which is proving to be a delight. My arrival was welcomed and my room was excellent. I have not experienced any of the small shabby rooms that some reviewers have mentioned. The staff are better than the average London hotel staff. They spealk reasonable English and are as attentive as your requirements demand. My room service was served to my exact request and was tasty and what I needed. The room is clean and spacious with all the necessary furniture and fittings. 

I like the tartan curtains and the additional touches such as the water, wine and mixed nut selection provided gratis. After a long journey all are most welcome. 

Breakfast was super, bacon and eggs with real streaky bacon cooked to perfection. The coffee, which in some hotels can only be described as floor polish, was rich and very very nice. I am looking forward to breakfast tomorrow!

All in all a good hotel and now my hotel of choice when I am in London.",4,2010,01,27
144,Another indulgent stay at Flemings Mayfair. Go there and get spoilt.,"Check out the apartments at this lovely hotel in the heart of Mayfair.  A real home from home yet in the centre of everything.  We were able to walk everywhere - John Lewis, Leicester Square, Piccadilly Circus, and of course explore all the lovely shops in the Mayfair area.  The hotel has recently been tastefully refurbished and the Library is exquistite.  The breakfast staff were great and I can't wait to go again.",5,2010,01,26
144,Top class service in a top class location,"The hotel was quite a find booked though last minute.com very good value.This was a special weekend and we stayed the Friday and Saturday night.The booking staff new that our weekend was special and we had a room at the rear of the hotel which had been refurbished  to a high standard with a  marble bathroom.There was no street noise at all and we  would wonder if we were  in the heart of London.The staff were attentive from the moment we left the taxi.There is an excellent resident lounge of high qualiity and an art decor bar downstairs which is very different as is the restaurant which serves a set menu if required at a competative price.
The location for all the attractions is unbeatable and given the hotel size the personal touch is still there which is quite rare for a city hotel.We did not dine at the hotel  but had breakfast at Henry,s cafe bar which is to the left of the hotel and left again at the top of the street less than 10 min walk.Good value and serve breakfast intil 12 noon. I will certainly be making a return visit to the Flemmings  Hotel in Mayfair..",5,2010,01,26
144,"Second time here, won't be the last","We revisted the Flemings Mayfair after our stay this time last year. Once again, it didn't disappoint and I promised the reception staff that I would write another review. Excellent location, rooms spacious (we got upgraded) staff helpful and we will certainly visit again",5,2010,01,25
144,Wonderful Hotel. Convenient and clean and excellent service.,Had a lovely time here in Dec 09. So close to everything . Such excellent service and attention to detail. Lovely room - large and light overlooking the street.,5,2010,01,23
144,Pefect Place and Perfectly Placed,"My wife and I stayed here for 31 Dec/01 Jan and had absolutely no problems. Throughout our visit  the staff were approachable,  polite and helpful all the way from check-in to check-out. Our courtyard room (316) whilst compact (small but not tiny) was warm, quiet  and well equipped although the adjacent exterior fans would perhaps make it noisier if the windows were open in summer. There was no pressure whatsoever to eat in the hotel and we easily found somewhere for breakfast at the end of the street even on New Year's Day. This was a special treat for us - we are not well off - however we did not feel out of our depth one bit and the other guests we met were nice people. The location is great for attractions and handy for public transport. We hope to stay again later this year once the bank balance is replenished. One last point, this is Mayfair after all so whilst cost can be a bit subjective we were well pleased with the overall experience.",4,2010,01,02
144,What a Gem in Mayfair!,London is a city that I have often visited in the past with either my mom or dad.  We always book a Virgin Vacation and this hotel was extremely reasonable and in a fantastic location to everything in central London.  Mom and I could walk to picadilly circus and to buckingham palace right from the hotel.  The staff always gave us great advice on where to eat and what to do.  This trip was the most memorable I've had in London.  The rooms were a little small but hey Ive stayed in MUCH smaller in London and were much more expensive but well located.  I felt like I was in a cape cod home with the colors and touches of the rooms.  The breakfast was nothing to write home about but hey thats what the prete down the street is for.  I would really recommend going through Virgin Vacations if you are traveling to England from America to book this hotel.  Its usually a great value.  This is the gem on half moon st. :),5,2009,12,22
144,"Wished I booked a Premier Inn, Instead","If you do not appreciate  a toff/lah-de-dah experience where Higher Purchase is the order of the day then do not stay here. We were first put in what could only be described as a 'Loft Conversion' with no double glazing, condensation windows, ripped wallpaper and decor. We were utterly fuming and as a result complained to our booking company 'Super Breaks'. We were re-accomodated to a double executive room which was allot nicer, but hardly worth the money we paid. Toileteries provided were sub-par, i would of expected something more luxury and the staff accused us of being 'stupid' for talking to our booking company than them first. Although some of the interior looks stunning, where you get located is really a mixed bag, only 150 odd rooms have been refurnished and if you get located in an unfurnished room, expect to be totally fuming! We were told that we got a free breakfast in the morning, only to be sat down, given a waiter service and charged £36 for breakfast! The breakfast was really disappointing, scrambled eggs lacked flavour, no condements by default, 1 sausage! 

How you can charge £18 per head for a breakfast lacking in size and taste is beyond me. The hotel was full of american toff's which made us feel extremely uncomfortable. The hotel also managed to book us under the wrong name, as stated on our television sets. Also, you maybe interested to know.. NO SKY SPORTS! what the hell is that about! £5.90 to rent a movie aswell. This hotel maybe nice for Fred Goodwin but to the average tax payer this place is a complete waste of money. I wished i had stayed in a Premier Inn, the rooms were just as adequate. If you want to p*ss money up the wall, go ahead but book the hilton over the road.

Also you should see the size of the restaurant! for 400+ rooms it holds less than 100 people, what a joke!",2,2009,12,21
144,Enjoyed my stay,"I stayed for 2 weeks in December.   Location is superb: Starbucks, ATM and Green Park Station within 2 blocks.  Green Park Station is on 3 lines which make getting to British Rail and other parts of the city very convenient.  I stayed in a single room on the 4th floor which was small, however bathroom was full size and had plenty of counter space.  Shower had excellent pressure and hot water.  Wake up calls were done by a REAL PERSON on time.   I found the staff pleasant and friendly.   Hotel seems to be combination of 2 buildings so it is possible you may have some steps to navigate when you exit the elevator and walk to your room.   If you have a lot of bags, ask about the steps.   Room was quiet.  Some noise from Half Moon Street to be expected.    Bar was below ground, comfortable, they comped me a drink for my birthday.   Overall, I would characterize hotel as reliable service provider and would most definitely stay again.",5,2009,12,18
144,Legendary,"One of the most enjoyable stays I've ever had, incredibly polite and attentive staff, beautiful rooms and wonderful food. The positioning couldn't be better to get to the west end. I genuinley reccommend it.",5,2009,12,12
144,so so...,"I have very mixed feelings towards the Flemings Mayfair.
The hotel itself seems very nice, very nice decorations, lovely Christmas decorations.
My room itself was nice as well, rather spacious, nicely decorated, the bathroom had a nice bath tube, it was also good size.
BUT....1. my room was on the ground floor, so I couldn't open the window which was very annoying because it was incredibly hot in the room, seriously! You could switch on the air con but it was VERY loud and cold, so you really couldn't sleep with the air con turned on. (at night there was the choice between relatively calm and very hot and cold and loud, i opted for the calmer option...)
Then again because of the ground floor, my room was rather weirdly located, next to the stairs which lead upstairs to other rooms and next to some industrial stairs for staff use only. So the staff would come to that corner to talk, to speak on the phone etc, also in the evening so it was very noisy, you could hear the entire conversations, doors being shut etc...not very nice if you had an exhausting day.
The staff in general, what i can i say some of them VERY nice and friendly, others rude...
Breakfast was another new experience...the first day at breakfast, i don't what happened there but i've never seen so many angry guests in the morning, we weren't served, you had to wait for half an hour to get some tea or coffee, then another half an hour for the food and the the orders got messed up. After waiting for 40 min for my omlette i didn't even eat it because it tasted like...nothing at all...and certainly not like eggs....staff seemed incompetent and arrogant, just one huge disaster.
BUT on the second day the service at breakfast was MUCH better and friendlier, ok there were +/- 6 guests in the entire restaurant so it wasn't hard to handle but still, better service and better food! The buffet however was a bit poor, no real cheese, no ham, just some greasy salami...Good fresh fruit choice though!
I have very mixed feeling when it comes to the flemings mayfair, i think next time in london i will stay somewhere else...",3,2009,12,07
144,Maybe I was unlucky...,"The front desk was busy with guests seeking to change their rooms when I arrived, as was different guest when I left for my meeting in the morning. Yet another guest stood attempting the same thing when I returned in the evening. 

The staff were friendly and efficient, but had few options available. I switched rooms because the bed in my first room was broken.

Room 318 - The bed sagged heavily to one side and made me feel like I was falling out of bed. The window opened onto a courtyard with several noisy extraction fans. 

The room was small, but the hotel was inexpensive given it's location. There was room for a double bed, but I'm not sure where your luggage would go. My overnight bag fit under the desk. 

I am not a giant, but at 6 foot (ca. 185cm) I could put my palm on the ceiling without fully extending my arm. The room was roughly the size of a small ship's cabin.

The bathroom was fine.

Room 308 - You could get in and out of either side of the bed and the bed was flat (an improvement). The room was extremely warm, but at four AM I discovered this was because the heated towel rack in the bathroom was turned on full power. Again, the ceiling was low, but the room was otherwise adequate.

--

If I had been given room 308 on the first night and had discovered the heat source earlier, I would probably have given the hotel a positive review. As it is, I saw several rooms in addition to the ones I slept in. Those on the ground floor open directly onto the street - as in shake-hands-with-passersby-from-your-bed directly onto the street. Not so good if you like to sleep with the window cracked for fresh air.

The staff were friendly.",2,2009,11,23
144,The best hotel I have stayed in for years,"Excellent staff, the rooms are first class as is the service, I would recommend it to anyone. It is in an ideal spot for getting around London.",5,2009,11,17
144,Authentic 18th century experience in the 21st century!,"Purpose of the trip was business. My colleague and I visit London every year for 7 days of meetings. We always stay in Mayfair. Our requirements are: 2 bedroom apartment with living/lounge room (for meetings) and small kitchennette. Basically a home-office away from home - nothing too upmarket.

I stumbled upon this hotel after a disastrous almost -booking with Curzon St apartments. We stayed in the ground floor apartment next the hotel. It has it's own separate entry which is quite charming. The street view is attractive. There are 3-4 apartments all up that are accessed through this separate entryway. Ours was a 2 level, 2 bedroom-2 bathroom-kitchen-lounge room apartment. Entry floor was the kitchen and lounge room. Downstairs were the bedrooms and bathrooms.

Kitchennette was good. Modern clean looking appliances (microwave, fridge, toaster, stovetop) with Euro laundry. Not sure how often these were used. We ordered two filter coffee machines from the Flemings restaurant to use during the meetings. Lucky I decided to give it a test run before serving coffee to our clients - bits of white filmy goo were ""filtered"" out. No problems - I thought - this should clean itself out in 1or 2 filter cycles. I gave up after passing plain water (with no filter paper) through the machine continuously for a day and there was no let up in the goo being produced. I felt sick. No hotel breakfast for me. 

The lounge room was a fantastic size. This is the highlight of the apartment. A meeting with 5-8 people was easily accomodated. It was decorated in the Olde Worlde style of period furniture - fake fireplace, three lounge sofas, a couple of armchairs, buffet. Unfortunately, it really is old. Showing signs of wear and tear. A positive was the dining table in the alcove between the kitchen and lounge room. Handy to set up laptops, store papers etc.

I unfortunately drew the short straw and got the master bedroom. Room size was very good. However it felt like a dungeon with dark furnishings/trimmings in period style. Artificial lighting was provided sparingly. The room did have a window and door (locked) to the outside. I wanted to open the window for some fresh air respite from the oppressive heating, but upon opening the window, I didn't feel safe and the street noise was at the same decibel as when the window was closed. Two wardrobes for storage. I think there was a safe. My recollection is a bit hazy due to tiredness as the laundry truck parked outside the apartment work me up every morning at 5-6am. This is not bad luck for the year I stayed, another colleague stayed here the year after and was woken up by the same laundry truck and it's drivers. 

My bathroom entry was via the shared corridor. The bathroom size was ok - small, what I expected for London. NO RAIN SHOWER. In order to fit in the small bathroom, a small 3/4 size bathtub was provided. It offered a short corded handheld shower head. Having a bath and washing my hair involved contortions. I couldn't believe a GBP423 (excl 17%VAT)/night hotel would not have a standing shower. Even a shower over the bath would have sufficed.

My colleague got the 2 single bed room. His ensuite bathroom had a standing shower. But the pressure and temperature was not so great. The cheap shower could have done with some proper grouting and a good clean.

The apartment also had a private garden/terrace area. This was closed due to outside building renovations when we stayed. I think the renovations have completed - so you should be able to access. This looked nice.

Staff: met some requirements, won't go beyond duty. Housekeeping: met most requirements. 

There was free wireless from the hotel. Unfortunately it did not extend an extra 2 metres into the apartment. It was inconvenient to have to decamp to the Library in the hotel or lean outside the lounge room window onto the street to check emails. 

Location of the apartment is outstanding. 30secs to Green Park, 2 min to Buckingham Palace. Easy walking distance to night spots eg Dover St. 5-10min walk to most hotels in Mayfair and Hyde Park. The running tracks in Green Park are very good. Shopping is close by (Regent St and Oxford St) 10-15min walk. Tesco is around the corner. Sainsbury and Marks and Spencer is 10min walk. There is a dry cleaner and Kikiu 
(japanese restaurant) a few doors down, Cafe Nero at the corner or Curzon and Half Moon St, recommend getting a free coffee card. 

If you are travelling with kids and only staying for a short time 1-2 days, this apartment would be perfect with lots of space. Otherwise find somewhere else before the cracks start to show.

Flat screen tv in lounge room, can't remember what was in the bedrooms - but I think they were small CRT tube tvs.

Needless to say, I stayed at Green Park Hilton and the Ascott Mayfair after this experience at less than half the rate and triple the comfort.",2,2009,11,14
144,OK,"An OK hotel.  The staff were friendly and the room OK.  Attention to detail a bit off, the plug in our bath was broken and one coffee cup was really chipped - but nothing serious wrong.  Great location.",3,2009,11,04
144,A perfect address,"Flemings has to be The Perfect Address in London , you cant get any more central or accessible and quiet. For those of us that enjoy a morning run access to Hyde Park is ideal . Its lovely to see the food and beverage areas being refurbished. The place is looking really sharp. As always the service is exceptional . This place is a gem, at a sensible price for central London",5,2009,11,02
144,Better than expected- lovely stay!,"My ""mature"" uncle- he is in his 80's and does not like the term elderly- waited to visit London and asked if I would accompany him.  We arranged our travel through Virgin Vacations and selected Flemings Mayfair based upon reviews on this site.  As with other travelers from the states, we arrive before the official check in time.  The front desk  staff informed us that our room was not yet available and immediately asked if we would like to check our luggage.  We did not expect our room to be available upon arrival and already had tickets to attend the Knitting and Stitching show at Ally Pally.
      Upon our return from the show to the hotel we were greeted with a smile and an open door. The front desk staff was very friendly and arranged for our luggage to be brought to our room- which was on the first floor.  The room was nicely decorated and  comparable in size to other European hotels that I have stayed in.I did find it odd that the rooms lack drawers. As one other reviewer mentioned, I too had difficulty reaching the shelf in the armoire.  We did not experience any problems with noise even though we were at street level (I believe we looked out onto Clarges Street). 
    The concierge staff- Alberto and Neil- were very helpful with their recommendations for local restaurants. We were very happy with their selections for Indian and Italian cuisine.  We enjoyed our breakfast - included in the package- at the hotel and found the food to meet our expectations. If you choose not to eat at the hotel, there are several coffee shops within a block or two from the hotel. 
   My uncle was very impressed by the friendliness of the staff. Everyday the staff asked my uncle what was the plan for the day and assisted him in determining whether an overcoat and umbrella was necessary. Upon return from our outing, the staff always opened the door and attentively listened to my uncle's review of the day. I can't say enough about the attentiveness and caring that the staff displayed to my uncle.  We had a lovely stay.",5,2009,10,25
144,Perfect home away from home for a solo traveller,"The Flemings Mayfair was a great find.  It is in a perfect location just blocks from the Ritz Hotel and close to the theatre district.  The room was small but well appointed, very clean and recently renovated.  The closest Tube station is green park on the Piccadilly line so if you arrive at Heathrow you can take the line directly to the stop, then walk three blocks to the hotel.",4,2009,10,15
144,My new favorite in London,"Although I live in Atlanta, GA, I am an Anglophile who has visited London approximately 35 times and stayed in at least 20 different hotels, including some of the big boys such as The Connaught, Claridges, The Ritz and The Savoy, all of which I loved.  My recent experience at Flemings was right up there, but certainly less expensive.  My wife and I arrived in their lobby at 8:10 AM, after flying all night.  The gentlemen at the front desk informed us that our room was not ready (as we knew would be the case), but just as I started to ask if the hotel would keep our luggage while we walked around (which is what we often do), he added that there was a small room that we were welcome to use and take a nap until our room was ready.  Wow!  That was a first for me.  Our room was delightful and every member of the staff was friendly and professional.  The location, just off Piccadilly, between Mayfair and St. James's, is absolutely perfect.  The decor is very tasteful and I could not have asked for anything better.  The value was outstanding.  I definitely plan to stay there on my next visit.",5,2009,10,15
144,Excellent location,"Located across the street from Green Park, a short walk to Buckingham Palace and down the road from Picadilly. Easy walk to most of the London highlights. Restaurants and bars in walking distance. Personnel very helpful. Beds comfortable. The only negative is that it can be noisy on the street side.",4,2009,10,08
144,Lovely Hotel Right in the Heart of London,"We were definitely enchanted from the moment we arrived at the Mayfair.  The concierge staff went way out of their way to answer any questions that we had and made us so welcomed.  The lobby itself is very charming and beautiful.  Our room was a little small, but was extremely comfortable and had air conditioning that was actually working extremely well (hard to find in Europe).  The Mayfair is right in the heart of London on a beautiful, safe, quiet street.  Five minutes across the park and you are at Buckingham Palace.  A few minutes to Shepard's Market where you have a number of lovely restaurants to choose from.  You are in walking distance to many of the London sights.  We had a wonderful stay and will not hesitate staying at the Mayfair the next time we are in London.",5,2009,10,08
144,The epitome of English Engineering - things are expected not to work,"I am writing this review much belated, as the stay was a year ago. But as I visit London every October, I am reminded about it - this year I am staying somewhere else!!

We took the two bedroom apartment opening onto Halfmoon Street. Construction next door (but that should be finished by now - maybe). Bedrooms downstairs, living, dining and kitchen upstairs. The latter were ok - nice and roomy, but the bedrooms and bathrooms were terrible. Something out of a Jane Austin book. Billed as bedrooms with individual on-suites - one of them did not have a shower and in the other, the stand alone shower water regulator simply did not work. The hotel advised that there was nothing wrong with it and that it was designed that way! This apartment was extremely noisy - especially for the front bedroom - were the 6.00am delivery of linen woke my colleague every day (see pic taken from Hilton across the street).

The hotel provided free wireless - it just didn’t extend to our apartment!.

On the positive side, a couple of the staff actually spoke passable English.

Location is good, being close to the centre of Mayfair – over-priced restaurants – and Piccadilly.",2,2009,10,02
144,Excellent hotel in a wonderful location,"I stayed a week ago in Flemings in Mayfair. I can say the room was very good and in good size if you compare to others European hotels. The locations are fantastic, with walk distance to the park, restaurants, shops and the tube. I only have good things to say about the hotel, and definitely recommend to others.",5,2009,09,29
144,Flemings Mayfair Is Fairly Good,"TripAdvisor travelers really are spot-on in their reviews of this hotel. I had read several before traveling, so I knew what to expect.

When my friend and I arrived at the hotel, tired from a very long flight from the U.S., the door was opened for us and we were immediately greeted by a bellhop, who took our luggage. As we had been warned, the desk clerk, a young woman, was rather snippy with us. (She partially redeemed herself the next day, when were in need of a camera repair store and she graciously looked up places on the Internet and printed out a map of the area.) The rest of the staff were extremely nice.

The hotel is in a prime location. The neighborhood is upscale (right near the Ritz and the Woseley), and the hotel is a mere three blocks to the Green Park tube station. Half-Moon Street is quiet and out of the way, and it's right near Shepherd's Market, which is full of restaurants. 

Our room was small but comfortable. However, there were a few drawbacks. There were NO drawers for our clothes, so we were forced to put all of our clothes for the week on the top shelf of the closet and hang up whatever we could fit in the closet. I am short, so this was rather inconvenient.

The bathroom was lovely and clean, but the bathtub was so high it made climbing in and out a dangerous predicament every day. The shower controls were a bit complicated, and it took a while to get used to them.

(A warning to U.S. flat-iron users: Your flat iron will not work, even with a converter. You're better off just buying a cheap one there, as I ended up doing.)

There was also no full-length mirror, and we could have used a make-up/shaving mirror in the bathroom.

As for breakfast, don't bother. The one time we ate in the hotel restaurant, we were given the choice between a hot English buffet breakfast for 18 pounds and a cold American buffet for 16. The English breakfast consisted of runny eggs and lots of pork products that I can't eat. The American breakfast consisted of dry cereal and pastries. You're better off going to the Pret a Manger down the street.

Overall, the hotel is clean, nicely decorated (I found the fake-book elevator amusing), and comfortable. I would recommend it.",4,2009,09,18
144,Beautiful Hotel in Great Location (but bring your own restaurant and tourist guide!),"We stayed in a very large, luxurious room with two queen size beds, separated a good distance, a sitting area and a large newly renovated bathroom.  It was beautiful.  Clean, A/C worked great.  Beautiful common areas.  Location was superb.  Safe and pretty but walking distance from both Piccadilly and Buckingham Palace.  2 blocks from the tube.  Only complaint was that, despite the desk marked ""concierge,"" they don't really have anyone to help you with touristy stuff.  We invested in a Michelin Guide for restaurants and bought theater tickets at the large tourist office near Trafalgar Square and we were fine but don't rely on the hotel for this assistance.  Also, no free WiFi, which just bugs me when you're spending many hundreds of dollars a night.  Most Pret a Manger cafes have free WiFi so I just stopped in from time to time for coffee and internet access.",4,2009,09,17
144,Good value,"Even though the rooms are very small, they have been cleverly furnished. They decoration of the room is nicely done and everything looks quite new. The location is very convenient for visiting London. Lots of nice restaurants and shops in the neighbourhood. Green Park is the closest tube station.",4,2009,09,14
144,Great Service - Wonderful Hotel,"We booked this hotel as part of the Virgin Atlantic package.  We were two ladies....first time in London and we were unsure as to what to expect. We were very pleasantly surprised. The staff at the Flemings Mayfair are absolutely wonderful...helpful and so courteous. We were treated so special that is was hard to leave. We arrived on Sunday before they had a chance to get our room ready. They offered to keep our luggage safe and gave us another room to use to freshen up before we went out to tour London.

Our room was a little smaller than those in the US but plenty large enough for us. It was clean and the beds were very comfortable. There was a tea service with coffee and tea in the room.

The breakfast buffet was plentiful and delicious with hot foods like sausages, eggs, ham, potatoes, beans and tomatoes. There was a table of fruits, breads and cheeses. We were served coffee or tea in a white tableclothed dining room.

The hotel is located on Half Moon...a side street only a couple of blocks from the Green Park tube and all the bus stops. Even when walking back to the hotel after dark we felt safe in the area. We were only a short walk to Buckingham Palace from the Mayfair.

There is a large fee for making long distance calls from your room in the hotel. They call it a connect charge. There is no connect charge for incoming calls from the US so we found it less expensive to have family and friends call us at the hotel.

We really hated to leave the hotel when it was time to go back to the US. The Flemings Mayfair felt like a home away from home for us. We would definitely stay there again if we travel back to London.",5,2009,09,13
144,Truly Splendid,"I first visited the Flemings Mayfair when I met an old friend for dinner at an adjacent Japanese restaurant (also very good for Japanese foodies!!). Then, I recall the wonderful greeting from the front of house team and the warm, friendly feeling that seemed to exist around the place. Rarely do you find happy employees in hotels but it feels as though the team really enjoy what they here.  

At that time, I knew we needed to make plans for some guests that were arriving from overseas. I asked if I could see some of the rooms and was introduced Simon who is, in fact, the General Manager. He showed me several room-types and also the apartments they have. Simon has a keen eye for detail and I can se why this hotel is as good as it is. 

What I also liked about this place is that it feels homely - many hotels are so stuffy that you actually cannot relax and if you ask for something you end up having to repeat the same question 5 times. It can feel as if you are in a commercial for compare the meerkats.com. Not at the Flemings  - the people are attentive and responsive! Flemings is a boutique hotel with such charm and splendor. 

Recently, a group of friends were due to accompany us to the Last Night of the Proms and when they told us that they were booking an hotel, I immediately advised them to book in at the Flemings. So much so, that we also stayed the night too.

We started in the bar (as you do) and were all impressed by the healthy selection of beverages. Given the post code, you would expect to be paying through the nose but this place really does offer quality and value. The bar and the restaurant are presently being refurbished but this did not interfere with us in the slightest and I look forward to returning when it is finished. 

The room we occupied was beautifully presented and had every amenity one could wish for. I have a pet hate about hotel beds but I have to say that I had the best nights sleep I have ever had in an hotel. Such comfortable beds and linen took

As we had had a late night we took breakfast in the room and everything was really good.

Because we were catering for our guests, we arrived by car and had no problem parking outside the hotel where there are plenty of spaces (you pay from 08:30 - 18:30 Monday to Saturday and if you are unlucky enough not to get a space then there were several other car parks we noticed as we left for home. Parking charges were not exorbitant either.

All in all an excellent hotel in an excellent location with all the creature comforts. Well done Simon and his team!!!",5,2009,09,13
144,The perfect spot with great service and comfort,"We took our two teen age sons (12 & 15) to London for the first time. We booked through Virgin Vacations and The Flemings was one of the hotel choices.  We could not have chosen better!  The location was ideal. It is across from Green Park, 2 blocks from the tube, around the corner from Shepards market, minutes from Piccadilly but on a QUIET street. We walked the entire city and could always find a Tube to get us back to Green Park. We got 2 rooms both of which were well appointed and nice size.  The boys got a little bored of the breakfast selections after a week and were missing pancakes and french toast.  But the staff was courteous, knowledgeable and friendly. I would to hesitate to stay again (with or without the boys) and I would love to try one of their apartments next time.",5,2009,09,04
144,Flemings is without doubt the best hotel I have stayed at in London,"Flemings is an outstanding gem located just off Green Park near The Wolsey and The Ritz. The rooms are breathtaking both in their scope and cleanliness.  Nothing was too much trouble - we were pointed to Shepherd's Market for lunch which was a great find and the room itself was huge with a four poster bed and a beautiful bathroom.
I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough; from the stunning reception area to the incredibly attentive and helpful staff, we never felt crowded just warmly welcome.
Both myself and my wife cannot wait to book again and be indulged!",5,2009,09,03
144,A Fantastic Weekend,"My partner and I enjoyed a fantastic stay recently at Flemings.  We were attentively looked after and our apartment was wonderfully well appointed, both luxurious and homely.  Certainly the comfiest bed I've ever slept in.  The hotel is in the perfect location; quiet and private but within a stone's throw of Hyde Park and the in the heart of the West End.  I could not recommend Flemings and their team more highly.  An absolute gem.",5,2009,09,01
144,Flemings - a fantastic hotel for a special weekend!,"From the very moment we entered into Flemings we were bowled over by the stunning reception area. The experience only got better when we were shown to our room, a huge apartment. The room had everything we could wish for, a huge bed, two bathrooms, a lounge and a kitchen. We were very impressed to say the least! The room was very clean and the furnishings were incredibly plush. 

The staff were incredibly friendly and helpful and bent over backwards to help us. The breakfast was lovely, with everything you could wish for. Given its location in central London, you would expect it to be relatively noisy. However we couldn't hear even a car tooting from our room. The hotel is incredibly tranquil and ideal for a getaway. When the last morning of our stay arrived (after two nights in a very comfortable bed,) I did not want to leave Flemings.  I can honestly say that our weekend at Flemings was the most wonderful weekend away, and after being treated like royalty it was a bit of a shock to return to normal life!",5,2009,08,29
144,Great hotel choice for families,"Stayed in one of the Flemings Mayfair apartments for four nights with three teenage kids.  Great choice if you want space and convenience.  The hotel is a five minute walk through Green Park to Buckingham Palace and is on a quiet side street off of Piccadilly.  The apartments are great with one - three bedroom choices, full kitchens and a LR.  Kids can get away from each other (and you!) when needed and can sleep separately.  All rooms had TVs.  Hotel staff was very helpful.  Green Park Underground (subway) station is just a few blocks away and from there you can go anywhere in the city via the London Underground system, which few cities do as well.  Tip: get an Oyster Card at the first Underground station you see and you'll save time and $$$ when you use the trains.  It's a rechargeable ""credit card"" that you can give it back when you leave and they'll refund what you don't use plus the small fee to get the card initially!",5,2009,08,26
144,Most enjoyable.....,"lovely period property with all the modern features that you need within a City hotel.  Great location, right in the heart of Mayfair, although still surprisingly quiet.

Staff were very attentive, and we were even upgraded for the night, which was very nice indeed.

i would certainly recommend this to my friends.",5,2009,08,25
144,Lovely & perfect location,"We spent a long time pondering over different hotels in London...I am so glad we chose this one. The room wasn't huge, but we had a good deal on it so couldn't complain. It was spotlessly clean & very well presented. It had everything we needed, toiletries in the bathroom, big comfortable bed & plenty of cushions, everything you expect from a 4 star. Across the road is Green Park, 5 mins walk to Buckingham Palace. Around the corner are plenty of little bars & traditional pubs. Around the other corner is Pret & Starbucks, and the tube! Oxford St is a 10 min walk ( max!) Very pleased with our stay - staff friendly & helpful too. We'll definitely go back.",5,2009,08,24
144,average stay at the Flemings Mayfair,"I stayed at this hotel for a week with a friend.  The room was small, but clean and neat.  We had two twin beds and one of the beds was extremely uncomfortable.  Some basic amenities that you would expect to find at a hotel of this caliber, such as an iron and an alarm clock, were missing from the room.  The staff were very polite but were slow to respond at times.  Breakfast was included with the stay but very disappointing.  There was little variety to the options and they were the same every day.  The best thing to recommend the hotel was the location, which was convenient to the Tube and in walking distance to many sites.  Overall it was an average stay but I would not stay there again.",3,2009,08,20
144,"Tradition with a twist, Flemings is one of the nicest hotel environments in London.","A warm welcome with genuine hotel staff goes a long way in London! I stay in Hotels on business all the time, as a lone female traveller it is so important to feel safe and not intimidated, when in hotels, and this can only be realized where staff are welcoming and have time for you. When in London I would recommend Flemings for either type of visit, business or pleasure. I was fortunate to stay in one of the beautiful, quite traditional Apartments. I understand, from talking to staff , that the Hotel is undergoing some refurbishment. This will completely modify the restaurant area and many of the rooms. This Hotel is comfortable, calm, unpretentious, and certainly does not feel like is situated within shouting distance of Buckingham Palace... and just across the road from The Ritz.  I've been lucky enough to enjoy the afternoon tea at Flemings too, and I'd certainly pop back to the Library for the experience again! 
Now the important bit....My Bed was extremely comfortable, the soaps and shampoo's supplied in the bathroom were fresh and lovely. The rooms were clean, the bathroom was spotless and all the facilities did waht they were supposed to do. I plan stay in one of the 2 bedroom apartments when i stay in town with some friends for a forthcoming theatre trip as it will actually be more cost effective than getting a few rooms in a hotel, and you have the luxury of a living room, kitchen with cookeing faciclities and 2 bathrooms. Oh and have I mentioned the great flower displays in reception. Works of art in themselves!",5,2009,08,18
144,Excellent hotel; outstanding service; great location!,"Our family of 6 just spent five nights at the Flemings Mayfair and we had a wonderful experience.  The location is perfect; the hotel is recently renovated; and the staff is totally committed to outstanding service.  Traveling with such a big crew and a list of special requests, I always assume that some aspect of our stay will not be perfect -- so my ultimate measure of a hotel is how the staff responds and recovers from the inevitable mix-up.  In the case of Flemings Mayfair, the staff responded and recovered better than any hotel we have ever experienced.

If you are visiting in the next few months, note that they are renovating their main restaurant, so breakfast is served in the downstairs bar which is (a) under-airconditioned and (b) too small when the hotel is full.",5,2009,08,12
144,"Wonderful time - great hotel, excellent location great value.","I would highly recommend this hotel. It is centrally located in one of the best parts of London with many of the major tourist attractions within walking distance. The staff members were professional and courteous. The only caveat I would offer is that the internet access, which was available through the TV in our room, was pretty useless. That's about the only negative comment I can make. We will definitely stay at the Flemmings Mayfair if/when we return to London.",5,2009,08,07
144,Fantastic Location,"Fantastic location & great staff. Having stayed for 5 nights the Flemings Mayfair provided me with a home away from home. I was made to feel very welcome. Wonderful concierge staff & the guys were always willing to assist, nothing was ever a problem. Will certainly stay here on my next visit to London.",5,2009,07,29
144,Lovely room in a fabulous location,"Stayed here for 2 nights in May.  Usually stay in the Hilton across the road but it was fully booked.  It is a great location as it is an easy walk to Buckingham Palace, Picadilly and Knightsbridge.  We were feeling energetic and walked Covent Garden talking time in Trafalgar Square en route.

Booked a standard room which was a generous size and smartly decorated.  It also included a small sofa which gave a feeling of space.

Breakfast was extra and around £18 which you come to expect in similar hotels.  However, it was freshly cooked to order and beautifully presented - a lovely treat.

A great hotel.  Would definitely stay here again although also like the Green Park Hilton which tend to have more special offers.",5,2009,07,14
144,What a fantastic hotel,"FLEMINGS  What can i say but first class in every department, one word to describe this hotel would be EXCELLENT.",5,2009,07,13
144,"The best hotel in London, fantastic in every way!!","We stayed at Flemings, with friends, last week.  We were thoroughly spoilt by the General Manager and all the staff. I cannot recommend Flemings highly enough.  The food was excellent, the room was perfect and the service second to none.  Mr Scarborough,  the General Manager, made some great recommendations on places to visit during our stay.  We will return again soon.",5,2009,07,08
144,an oasis in the hustle and bustle of London,"From the moment we arrived outside this elegant hotel in Mayfair  we knew we were in for a treat.  From the doorman to the  receptionist and the all the other staff we encountered we were treated with charm and consideration, we could not have ask or expected more from them.  We met the general manager Simon who was lovely and he even took the time to show us to the apartment we were staying in. Some of our party stayed in the hotel and the rooms were beautifully and tastefully decorated. The apartment was superb and it was just perfect to relax in and have the space to have our friends in for a drink before going out. The hotel is well located for getting about ,the nearest tube is only 3 mins walk and Green Park is just across the road, you can walk to Buckingham Palace in less than 10 mins. There are some lovely unique shops and bistros in waking distance. This hotel is a MUST if you are coming to visit London.",5,2009,07,08
144,"Good location, bed could be more comfortable","We 3 stayed 1 night  in July 09 for weekend in crazy  London. We booked 2 double rooms but there weren't on the same floor. Had a nice time there although had only 1 night. Rooms were ok of size, well appointed for a 4* in London. Downside of room is the noisy air con, uncomfortable bed (old mattress I think, hotel could replace them as a tip), rather small bathroom. Also there's only 1 (fun as a library) elevator in the hotel and no business center for internet access.
But the concierge staff is really nice and helpful. Front desk could be nicer. Location is really nice, near Green Park tube station and bus stop. Nearby is Starbucks and Pret a manger for starting your day.

There's also a FedEx Center nearby so you could use internet and print some stuff. Pay as you go. Ask concierge is case.

All in all, had a pleasant stay but not sure we're going back there.",3,2009,07,08
144,"Good Location, Mediocre Hotel","This Hotel is near Green Park and walking distance to most of the major tourist sites.
The room was average. The Bell boys were very friendly. The people at the registration counter were not friendly at all. At checkout, they tried to bill me for 2 breakfasts and an item from the refrigerator in the room. I got them to correct the ""error"".
They charge about 25 dollars per day for use of wifi, ouch! Go to the Pret A Manger coffee shop around the corner for free wifi.
There are many hotels in the immediate area so you may opt for another place.",3,2009,07,06
144,"Good location, but a little expensive for what you get","The location of this hotel is fantastic, 3 mins walk from Green Park tube station, and not far from Picadilly circus.  The room we had was quite small but was in a good state and had it's own air conditioning, which was a bonus during the summer. Staff seemed pleasant enough although we didn't spend a lot if time in the hotel, no issues with check in or check out.

For it's size I felt the room was a tad over priced and was priced like that because of it's location only",4,2009,07,05
144,absolutely the best - congrats to the staff,"We have just returned from our stay at the Flemings Mayfair. We stayed for 4 nights earlier in June and again for a couple of nights at the end of June. We are a family of 6 with 4 small children. We have travelled extensively with our kids and can say that the Flemings Mayfair is one of the best, if not the best, hotel at which we have stayed. We like to stay in comfort and close to the relevant attractions. This hotel fits the bill perfectly. It is in a quiet street so it is away from the hustle and bustle of traffic but at one end is Piccadilly and a short walk across the Green Park to Buckingham Palace and if you head the other way you can head towards Hyde Park or the Bond St/Regent St shops - both just a short walk away. So it is a wonderful location and easy to get to the Theatre district, shopping, parks and major landmarks. The location in my view, is perfect.
As for the hotel itself we were so very impressed. Rooms were lovely, large and comfortable and beautifully presented and clean. Bathrooms new, luxurious and well thought out. However the best part about this hotel is the staff. From check-in which was fast and uncomplicated to the concierge and porters who had the bags looked after before you had time to blink, to the bar and breakfast staff, we were blown away by the efficiency and the friendliness of all of the staff. They knew where to go to eat, how to get anywhere and were always willing to help, friendly and professional in their manner. We can't wait to return to this hotel and give it our highest recommendation.",5,2009,07,03
144,A Great Value,"I just returned from my stay in London and my decision to stay at the Flemings-Mayfair was based mainly on the reviews from TripAdvisor. Overall, I was satisfied with my decision and enjoyed my stay. The hotel is within walking distance to most of London's major sites and the Green Park tube stop is located a couple of blocks down Picadilly. The staff was friendly and always very helpful. 

I was traveling solo on this trip, so I booked a single room. My only complaint was that the room was rather small. I would certainly stay here again, but I'd up grade my room to a double. 

You can easily reach the Flemings-Mayfair from Heathrow by taking the Picadilly Line. I would recommend against doing this, since the line is heavily used by commuters and crowded most of the time. I discovered dot2dot (www.dot2.com), a great shuttle service to both major airports. A roundtrip fair between Heathrow and central London is under 40 pounds. I booked dot2dot back to Heathrow and had a charming driver and saved myself the headache of navigating a crowded tube station with heavy luggage. 

The staff will be glad to book day tours around London. I used Evan Evans, a local company, and took a day trip to Paris and another to Stonehenge, Bath, and Salisbury. Very happy with my choice and the tours. 

Overall, I really enjoyed my trip and very happy with my choice of the Flemings-Mayfair. I'd certainly return for another stay. Thanks to all of the other reviews on TripAdvisor. I will certainly consult this site for my next trip.",5,2009,07,03
144,"World Class hotel, exceptional service, a real gem","The word opulence gives you an impression of grandure on an out of this world scale.  That is what you get at Flemings.  However, whilst you get the opulence and the grandure, there is none of the attitude that you would expect from a 4-5 star hotel in Mayfair.

The staff are nothing but courteous and helpful and the General Manager, Mr Scarborough is a delightful chap whom with his staff seems only to be interested in providing a service to customers which far exceeds first class.  

I have stayed at Flemings on two occasions now and to be frank, I would not stay anywhere else in London as the rooms are exquisite. 
 On this particular visit my room was on the ground floor overlooking Half Moon Street.  You would have thought that this would have been noisy, but I never heard a peep all night.  The room was an extremely large room with a huge bed in the middle.  Without being crude, my wife and I could lye at opposite ends of the bed and still not be able to reach eachother whilst holding our arms out.  It was truely the most comfortable sleep in a hotel bed I have ever had !!

The room was beautifully decorated with a  warm wooden floor.  Opposite the bed was a huge mirrored dresser with a plasma television and mini bar.  There was also a sofa seating area and a writing section with Flemings note paper so you can write a note to friends letting them know the high quality hotels you stayed in.

The bathroom was mainly marble and very well decorated.  I was also extremely surprised to find the shower was more powerful than the luke warm mist that showers in other hotels emit.  

In summary the room was flawless.

Breakfast was included and offered everything you could want from the full english to continental style pastrys.

The hotel is perfectly situated for exploring the sites of london. We arrived in to charing cross station and caught a london taxi over to the hotel this cost just over £5.00.  
During our stay we mainly used the underground to get around, the hotel is a short walk  (less the 5 Min) from Green park tube. Plus its only a 5 min to St jame park / hyde park, Bond Street and most importantly Tiffanys & Co !!

A wonderful hotel, cant wait to visit again.",5,2009,06,30
144,"Great location, great value","The location, for anyone visiting London for the first time or wanting to see all the major sites, was absolutely perfect.  Close to Hyde Park, Buckingham Palace, and right next to a tube stop, but on a quiet, one-way street which really added to the pleasure of staying there.  Great local restaurants a close walk away.",5,2009,06,30
144,"I will never, ever hesitate to stay at Fleming's Mayfair.  We loved it.","I heartily recommend Fleming's Mayfair, particularly their individualized customer service which is superb.  Our rooms were small -- which is typical of London hotels -- but absolutely pristine and beautifully appointed.  I will not hesitate to return to Flemings, now that I've found it!   The location, steps from Picadilly and Green Park, is the absolute best.",5,2009,06,29
144,Great location but looking a little tired,You can't beat the location right in the middle of Mayfair and just down from Green Park underground. Hotel seems to be going through a much needed refurbishment at the moment as many of the publc areas and bedrooms are looking in need of a refresh. Bedroom a reasonable size for central London and well equipped. Main restaurant closed but buffet breakfast was adequate served in a nearby room. Staff efficient and answered request for iron and ironing board quickly.,3,2009,06,28
144,Lovely hotel,"The Flemings Mayfair is a lovely hotel. The reception and library on the ground floor are fantastic and the library is a nice place to relax with papers. Staff are very friendly and helpful. There were four of us staying, four girls on a weekend trip, we had two rooms and one of the rooms 111 was delightful - spacious and nice decor. Bathrooms well stocked and all very clean. Our room 321 was just as nice but very small - which was disapointing. The location is superb with the delightful Shepherds Market just around the corner. Green Park tube station is five minutes walk away. There is a Tesco express and a Neros on Curzon street literally two minutes walk away, so well served for water, coffee and snacks. Breakfast was very good with plenty of choice and helpful staff who brought us coffee and toast liberally. All in all a very nice stay - had I had a larger room it would have been a fantastic stay.",4,2009,06,28
144,"Perfect location, lovely hotel","Perfect location for a shopper, 15 minute walks to the Selfridges and Harrod's and everything in between. Green Park tube comfortably near. Room modern with a traditional feel, good size for a single room. Loved the corridors and nooks, felt like living in a mystery movie from the 20's. Lovely restaurants and pubs nearby. Would definitely return!",5,2009,06,27
144,Never again,"Expectations were high after reading other reviews on Tripadvisor, but we were disappointed. Highlights included the doorman on arrival, one of the  friendliest EVER; the receptionist, one of the most miserable! Had to spell my name 5 times before he finally got it right and found our reservation. The room was clean and tidy, but the condition was poor; wallpaper hanging off the wall and varnish all but peeled off the bathroom door, for example. The taps dripped and the aircon was LOUD. Talking of loud, the noise of doors/lifts/ hotel guests was incredibly high and after a rough night's sleep, the fire alarm went off at 0820. Any apologies from management when mentioned? None whatsoever. Le Meridien prices at Holiday Inn quality. Try somewhere else; we're kicking ourselves for not sticking to what we know.",3,2009,06,22
144,Great quality,"Excellent quality hotel, very good service and a very clean room. The meal was nice, if a little lacking in atmosphere, and the bar was a lovely place to go unwind. The only downside of the entire experience was the room size, fairly small, but for a hotel in central London you've really got to expect this. Would definitely recommend.",4,2009,06,20
144,Our stay at Flemmings exceeded all of our expectations,"What a fantastic stay we had at Flemmings for my fathers 60th birthday. The staff and service and amenities were outstanding, and we could not recommend this hotel enough. The rooms are furnished to an extremely high standard, and the attention to detail throughout this elegant hotel were faultless. The hotel staff were aware it was my fathers birthday, and really went out of their way to make our stay extra special. Breakfast was fantastic, just what we needed the next morning with sore heads! Will in future stay at this hotel instead of our usual The Metropolitan.",5,2009,06,17
144,Superb customer service!,"This is my third stay at Flemings Mayfair.  The service, attention-to-detail and excellence surpasses most 5-star hotels.  The friendly, warm and inviting atmosphere is conducive for business and pleasure.  The general manager is committed to excellence which penetrates to every employee level.  They are personable yet professional.  It feels like home away from home.  I will never stay elsewhere in London while Simon Scarborough is the general manager.",5,2009,06,16
144,Affordable 5 star treatment in Mayfair,"Immediately my wife and I were greeted by a genuine smile by the doorman outside Flemings, we knew we would be in for a treat. The abiding memories were the friendliness of all staff, the feeling we were friends rather than guests and a room which was faultless from the size to the furnishings. 
Its position couldn't be more perfect being near a busy taxi route, near the tube, parking metres right outside and fabulous Green park or the Ritz within 5 minutes walking.
We will return!",5,2009,06,16
144,Great hotel and lovely staff !,"All in all very impressed with this hotel.

Staff on reception were great, very welcoming, friendly and efficient.

We booked a double executive room and it was a great size with a long well sized bathroom (with shower and bath).

The room was decorated very tastefully and th bed was huge and very comfy.

We didn't have breakfast, mainly as £16- £18 was just a bit too pricey so we grabbed breakfast at one of the many cafes on Piccadilly to save time & money.

Great location, fairly quiet at night considering its in the heart of mayfair and we would definately stay again.  Its a 2 minute walk from Green Park Tube station and it took us  15 minutes on the tube from Euston.",5,2009,06,15
144,All facade and no interior,The smallest room I have ever had in London - the bathroom was bigger.  Dark and needs redecorating.  The two porters stood near the door watching as I dragged my suitcase up the steps to reception.  In room internet did not work because the batteries were flat. Breakfast very expensive - you'd do better by going round the corner to a cafe in Piccadilly or Curzon Street.,3,2009,06,06
144,"lovely hotel, in a lovely area","excellent service, lovely rooms, beautiful location, very nice breakfast.
Would definitley recommend.",4,2009,06,02
144,Small rooms but great location,"Perfect location for walking London, good pubs and restaurants just around the corner in Shepard Market.  Hotel is fine although the single rooms are small and as with most hotels made up of converted townhouses there are lots of steps as you navigate the corridors.  I recommend it when there are good deals to be had, otherwise it's a bit pricey for the accommodations offered - you pay for the location!",3,2009,06,02
144,Very Nice but very noisy!,"great hotel, service, food etc but should have stayed at home instead.  No sleep achieved at all!  Very noisy inside & out of the hotel.  Very disappointed.  Beds & pillows extremely hard too.  Went home to bed afterwards!!!!",3,2009,06,02
144,Excellent Friendly Hotel,"We have stayed in London many times but this has been the best hotel.  The location is in walking distance to Buckingham Palace, Big Ben,, Westminister Abbey, the London Eye, St. James Park and Oxford and Regent streets for shopping.  It is around the corner from Shepherds Market which has a variety of restaurants.  Its only a short walk to the Greenpark underground station.  I can't say enough about the staff.  They were all friendly and very helpful.  The breakfast room was lovely. A unique elevator surrounds you with a library of books.  This was all park of a Virgin Airlines package which included the hotel, airfare from the USA, breakfast and an Oyster card for the underground.  It was an excellent value.",5,2009,05,26
144,Will definately be staying again,"Enjoyable stay, only negative comment would be the maid was a little ""too"" tidy and tidied away our toiletries after we had laid them all out ready for battle, but we are being very picky here!",4,2009,05,26
144,"Superb service, and attention to detail","We were really lucky to be able to stay in the hotel just after the new year as a suprise for our daughters 11th birthday, myself, my husband and our two daughters 11, 8 stayed in the hotel, the girls absolutley loved their time at flemings, the staff were really lovely and attentive and the girls felt really' grown up' staying in town' the hotel is so  close to the west end we were able to take in a show and staff were so considerate in looking after our belongings whilst we had a great day around town the next day.",5,2009,05,23
144,"Lovely location, shame about the size of therooms.","The hotel is in a wonderful location and has a beautiful marbled lobby. But this is where the superb decor ends.  The restaurant and bar are sub-terrainial and somewhat depressing. Although the staff were all smiley and welcoming.  Our biggest dissapointment was our room.  We had booked a Junior suite, which was billed as having a separate seating area, which it did....but then the bed was stuck in a tiny litttle room.  Frankly it wasn't big enough to swing a cat and looked out over a horrid light well.  We could bearly walk around the bed.    We filled in the card for breakfast in our room on Sunday morning.  They charged us £21 and the tray delivered bore no resemblance to what we ticked.  When quizzed, they said this was all they had !!    So no apple juice (we found some in the mini bar (which we were charged for again), no white toast and no cornflakes - I found it hard to beleive that they had run out of these basics.  I visit london regualrly and there are so many beautiful boutique hotels in Mayfair, that I wouldn't bother with this one again.",3,2009,05,22
144,LOVE this hotel...and their staff,"What a pleasant surprise this hotel was.  The staff could not have been more caring, responsive or accommodating, and the location was superb.  Would stay there again in a minute.",5,2009,05,14
144,Lovely hotel in Mayfair,"Really enjoyed a 3 night break at Flemings,friendly staff and comfortable room (quite spacious for London.) Decorated in a contemporary style with nice touches e.g tea& coffee making facilities(again unusual for London).
Just around the corner is Shepherds Market a quaint little area but buzzing with pubs and restaurants and just a stroll from Green Park tube station and buses.
If you prefer a cosier less corporate feel from a hotel book now.",5,2009,05,10
144,"If I come Back to London, I will Stay Here.","This 18th century building with all the modern amenities for a hotel is perfectly located. Walking distance to SOHO, the theater district, Hyde Park and Buckingham Palace. The hotel staff was friendly and helpful. Room service was prompt and the food was good. The jar of nuts they place on the desk was too tempting and I ate them constantly. The rooms tend to be small, since it is a historic building, but they are top notch.",4,2009,05,05
144,Great Classy but Friendly Hotel,"Great location, very easy to find. 
All staff very friendly. 
The bar is really lovely and has loads of character. 
The rooms are all very different, very clean and of average size. 
Great Stay, thanks all!",5,2009,04,07
144,excellent value for money,"Got a very good rate via an internet agent for the 3 nights bed and breakfast.  We were in london to see some plays and do some shopping.  Picked this hotel as it had such a good location for both.  We could stroll back from Shaftesbury Avenue after the theatre and in the morning we were close to Bond Street for shopping and the Bond Street tube was just a short walk away.  Room was nicely decorated.  Service was efficient and polite.   Ate at the Wolseley restaurant on Piccadilly one night for dinner which was great and just a few minutes from the hotel. 

It is rather noisy during the night unfortunately but that is probably to be expected given its location.  some triple glazing would be great - but other than that - had a very enjoyable stay",4,2009,04,02
144,Flemings is a charming and welcome gem ticked away on Half Moon Street.,"I was very pleasantly surprised by my recent stay at Flemings Mayfair. Wonderfully located near Hyde Park, within walking distance of Harrod's and Piccadilly Circus, Flemings is truly a gem. The staff is friendly and extremely accommodating, I never waited more than 5 minutes to have my requests answered. The rooms are charming and comfortable, no one room looking quite like the next.
Flemings has plans to redo their restaurant and bar area, which to me was the only minor drawback in the hotel. My accommodation was a lovely 2 bedroom, 2 bath apartment, with a full service kitchen, with washer and dryer, and a large parlor with a dining table. This would be perfect for a family of 4, or a corporate client that required a longer stay. The rates at the Flemings are extremely reasonable, and the dollar/pound
conversion is the best it has been in years.",4,2009,03,19
144,Highly Recommended,"Great Westminster location, a short walk through the park to watch the changing of the guards or to have tea with the Queen.  While maintaining plenty of old world charm, the rooms and public spaces all feel fresh and clean.  Staff is wonderful!!  Delicious variety of selections available at the bar and restaurant.  Looking for an extended stay or need some extra room - must try their apartments!  (ask for the two bedroom with full kitchen and private outdoor deck!)  Very well priced, excellent value.",5,2009,03,17
144,Arriving at Flemings is like opening the front door of your own home and feeling an immediate sense of well-being.,"When I stayed at Flemings the other weekend I thought that I really must share my experience concerning this exceptional London hotel.  From the moment I arrived until the moment I left I had a truly wonderful stay.  The staff are so genuinely friendly and helpful and the accommodation met all my expectations.  And if you want to know what special events are on in London in the week you stay at Flemings - just look very carefully
at the stunning flower arrangements which adorn the hotel!",5,2009,03,17
144,"Excellent location, romantic room","Our package included free continental breakfast.  This breakfast included toast, fresh tea, ready-made side dishes, however this ""free breakfast"" did not include any hot meal (i.e., omlette, french toast, pancake, like that).  

Decoration of the room was very romantic.  Check the photo!
The location of the hotel is fantastic for the London sight seeing.  Walking distance (one of the closest) to the Buckingham palace, Victoria Station (I think), and the famous double deck bus stops.
Although this is rather high end hotel (meaning bit expensive), I recommend this hotel to anyone who loves nice&chic hotel and also who is tight on a visiting schedule in London, so that you can save so much time trying to get to the public transportation.",5,2009,03,06
144,"Fabulous Hotel, Great Location and Great Staff","Flemings is a real gem and a real find in the heart of Mayfair. The bedrooms are beautifully decorated and air conditioned (which is rare for the area the Hilton Opposite is not) the staff were superb during our stay and keen to help at every opportunity.

Breakfast at flemings is a real treat but for lunch head round the corner to teh delightful shepherds market which is full of restaurants and nice pubs.

We will definately be stopping again, Much better than those chain hotels",5,2009,03,05
144,Lovely room and good breakfast,"Lovely room. Nice staff. Good breakfast.  We would highly recommend this hotel, for its location and also its high standards of cleanliness, and general attractiveness. The location is great if you want somewhere central for the shops and the sights. Just on the edge of St James Park  and very close to Green Park underground station it's handy for everything we wanted. We walked to the Churchill exhibition and strolled to Covent Garden. Having arrived quite early on the sleeper, the staff were happy to look after our luggage until the room was available.  At £159 for a double room for one night, we thought this was pretty god value for central London.",4,2009,03,03
144,Friendly staff and great location,"Stayed here with my mum for 2 nights in January with a great deal from Superbreak which included the hotel and tickets for the opening night of Oliver.  The hotel is in a great location, across the road from Green Park and a few minutes walk from the tube station and about 10 minutes walk from Piccadilly Circus.  The staff are friendly from the moment you arrive and very helpful.  The room was great with 2 large single beds which were so comfortable and had big squashy pillows.  We had a big bathroom (with a window) and lovely toiletries.  The breakfast was fine, the continental probably better than the cooked breakfast.  Would love to stay here again.  Best London hotel bed I've slept in.",4,2009,02,23
144,A tranquil haven in the busy city,"We stayed for 3 nights in one of the private apartments, our daughter loved having a double bed and her own en suite bathroom. The apartments are decorated to a high standard with all the amenities of home but with a touch of luxury, plus your own private entrance which was such an added bonus.
The staff are very attentive and friendly. We eat in the restaurant one evening and food and service were excellant.
The hotel is 2 mins from Green park Tube station and also in walking distance to the centre of London.
We will certainly be going back for another visit and would not hesitate in recommending it.",5,2009,02,23
144,A Celebration to Remember,"Flemings Mayfair is definitely the best hotel in London.  The service is outstanding from the minute you step into the hotel you are treated royally - nothing is too much trouble.  The hotel is beautifully appointed - the rooms are tastefuly decorated and the restaurant serves delicious food at all times of the day.
We celebrated my husband's special birthday in a private room which was fantastic.  Reception drinks were served in an adjoining romantic candle lit room with superb staff who made sure your glass was never empty.  The dining table was attractively arranged with beautiful white flowers and it was breathtaking as you entered the room.  Again the service was superb and the dinner out of this world. 
 Staying the night in the hotel is such a wonderful treat as the rooms are so lovely with every luxury aqnd the breakfast is delicius.  Congratulations to the General Manager and his Staff on achieving such a high standard in every way - there is no where else in London we would wish to stay.",5,2009,02,23
144,Absolutely Fabulous!,"We stayed at Flemings Mayfair very recently and could not fault the service and location in any way. A five minute walk from many key locations in central London situated in a beautiful, quiet street minutes from Hyde Park. Hotel is small and discrete but beautifully maintained and the service was exceptional. We will definitaly be coming back here in the future - hopefullt to sample their afternoon tea which I've heard is marvellous!",5,2009,02,22
144,Excellent dinner event,"I recently arranged a dinner at Flemings Mayfair in the private dining room for some important clients.  I was extremely impressed with, not only the organisation of the event, but also the atmosphere of the very attractive panelled dining room, excellent food and friendly and attentive staff.  

I would not hesitate to recommend this venue for either a similar work event or, indeed, for personal events such as dinners to celebrate birthdays, anniversaries, marriages etc.

An excellent venue in an excellent location.",5,2009,02,19
144,A Gem in Central London,"Flemings is a must stay at hotel in central London.  I stayed for three nights in January on a business trip and was very well looked after.  The rooms are recently refurbished, staff very attentive and location perfect for anyone wanting a home-from-home experience just minutes from Theatreland and the best restaurants London has to offer. I will be using Fleming on my return to London again for sure.",5,2009,02,17
144,Fab little hotel,"I loved the Flemmings Mayfair. Tucked away down a little side street, only a minutes walk from Green Park tube, Hyde Park Corner and the Ritz, with a Big Red Bus stop at the end of the street, it is a perfect hotel to base yourself during a trip to London. I stayed for one night with my Mum and we had a standard twin room. We arrived at 11am to find that our room was ready (officially check in wasn't until 2pm). The rooms are a good size and the twin beds were huge. Rooms had a lovely character to them. The hotel staff were helpful and attentive and couldn't fault any of them. The only downside was the breakfast, which for a fairly small hotel was disappointing. Would definately stay here again.",5,2009,02,17
144,Fantastic,"My family and I went to stay at Flemings Mayfair in January.
From the time we arrived to the time we departed we were made to feel very specail. The staff and service is of excelent quality and nothing is too much trouble.
The personal approach the hotel give to all who stay there is second to none.
I couldn't wish for a better hotel to stay and spend time with my family.",5,2009,02,16
144,best hotel in london by far!!!!,"I booked to stay at Flemings Mayfair Hotel in February this year and I just knew it was going to be an amazing experience from the second I spoke to the Hotel to book my room, the staff were just so kind and friendly on the phone and made booking my room a very pleasurable experience. When we arrived at the Hotel it just took our breath away with its stunning location and interior, it really is a total experience and a must if you are staying in London!!!
The room was perfect and just the most comfy room I have ever had the pleasure of staying in! I have to say this is one stay that we will not forget in a long time and will be highly recommending it to everyone, the staff were so helpful from start to finish and the only down side to the weekend was having to leave to go home, we can not wait till we come back again and will not be staying anywhere else in London as no other hotel will be able to come half as close now we have stayed at Flemings Mayfair Hotel",5,2009,02,16
144,Good change from corporate hotels,"Flemings is a great change from a corporate such as Hilton Radisson etc. What appears to be a family run hotel in a great part of London.  We booked a Shop Till You Drop package which was £143 for double rooms and included breakfast, afternoon tea on one day and a foot spa package.....though you had to do the foot spa yourself!! 
We liked the varied rooms, the responsive staff and the location. There was a mix up on our afternoon tea reservation which left the staff a bit confused for a few minutes, but Mary the food and beverage manager soon got things sorted out. 
Breakfast food quality is good, but the dining room, especially the seat fabric does need to be renovated.
I would recommend this hotel because its different to the chains and seem to employ real people who wan't to do a good job for their customers.",4,2009,01,30
144,not bed,average quality for price,3,2009,01,12
144,Fleming's Mayfair revisited,"My wife and I have stayed at the Flemings Mayfair three times in the last 5 years, booking our vacation through Virgin Airlines Vacations.  We have found our stay at this wonderful hotel an absolutely positive experience.  Everyone at the hotel is very professional as well as friendly and helpful.  Their breakfast menu is superb and the waite staff is very competent.  The hotel is located just across Picadilly St  from Buckingham Palace and a ten minute walk to Picadilly Square and Leicester Square.  The Green Park Underground is just a five minute walk as well.  All in all, a very rewarding way to spend time visiting London, just minutes from many attractions.

144,"Great location, great rooms but missing something","Our 2nd stay here. Use this hotel when going to a show in London. Have managed to get excellent bed and breakfast rates both times. Nothing to really fault the hotel but there is something missing-think the staff could be friendlier, although they are not rude.

Overall, would stay again for an overnight stay but for something special I would look around more.",4,2009,01,07
144,Great location but small room,"My girlfirend and I stayed at Flemings of Mayfair for 3 nights and 4 days from the 2nd of January. To begin with as we had already stayed in London seveal times we knew that the location of the hotel was great; close to The Ritz, Fortnum and Mason, Buckingham Palace etc. A wonderful part of the city with the tube station (Green Park) 2 mins up the road.

The concierge and staff at the desk were friendly and helpful. The reception area was very boutiqie.

On first entering our room (Room 69) we were disappointed to discover a very small room indeed. We have stayed in London 4 times and this was the smallest room we had come across. The bathroom however was of a good size and both bathroom and room were well decorated.

Bar the size the main problem with the room was that the temperature within the room became suprisingly warm. We do not like to use air conditioning but this was needed or else we wouldn't have slept. The air conditioning unfortunately was also fairly loud which became quite annoying.

Breakfast was nice, but again having stayed at other hotels in London it didn't particularly stand out.

We felt that maybe we were unlucky with the room that we had and that possibly other rooms would be of a larger size. 

The cost of our stay was cheaper than other prices we had seen therefore we could not complain, however if we had paid the higher prices seen elsewhere we would have been geatly disappointed.

If location, service and room decor then this hotel is recommended. However for us the size of the room was that bit too small and the hotel didn't stand out as well as we would have expected for the usually high price.",3,2009,01,05
144,"Very friendly and comfortable hotel, would definitely stay again.","We stayed at the Flemings-Mayfair for just the one night in December for weekend of shopping.

We arrived mid morning, our room was ready and we were able to leave our overnight bags.

The room was lovely and the beds were comfortable.

We had breakfast the following morning, which was very good and enjoyed by both of us.

The staff were very friendly.

I would certainly recommend this hotel and I will stay again when staying in London.",4,2008,12,27
144,Flemings Mayfair apartment is a great home-away-from-home,"We stayed for a month in an apartment-style room at the Flemings Mayfair.  It is a great property!  The apartment is very large and spacious - ensuite, dressing room, bedroom, 1/2 bathroom, living room, fully fitted kitchen.  It truly is a home away from home.

The staff are extremely pleasant.  What shocked me the most was on our first day, after checking in early in the morning and returning after work at the end of the day, the doorman and reception lady knew my room number and the doorman escorted me to the room!  What great service!

It is quite expensive to stay here but the hotel is in such a great location and is such a quality property that it really deserves the price.

I have already recommended that when other colleagues travel to London should stay here!",5,2008,11,20
144,Happy with our 3 day stay....,"We arrived at the Flemings Mayfair in the early morning of August 20,2008...We had booked the room for that day so we could take a rest before hitting the streets..Everyone at the front desk was so helpful as well as the bellman..The room was very clean, but abit small...That seems to be the case in London..Next time I may upgrade my room if we were to stay longer..We only stayed 3 nights in London as we were going to Paris, so it was fine for that long..It is a lovely location and we enjoyed the breakfast in the nice little breakfast room..I would certainly tell my friends of this hotel and would stay there again next time in London...I may look into their apartments, too, as that would be a nice change to have abit more room..Green Park is just across the road and it was fun to take a walk to Buckingham Palace through the beautiful park ..",4,2008,10,21
144,Great Place,"Be advised that we stayed here in Dec04.  That aside, this place was great.  The Flemings was only a short walk  from the Green Park Tube station.  That turned out to be one of our favorite attributes since that gives you access to the rest of the city.  The check in/out was a breeze and the staff was very helpful.  The rooms were small by most Americans standards but clean and neat.  The location was great with access to a tube station but not on a busy street.  Would definitely stay here again.",5,2008,10,05
144,The friendliest hotel in Mayfair,"We decided to return to Flemings for a long weekend despite finding cheaper accommodation in the neighbourhood  we did not regret the decision for one moment.  Srawberries in the rooms as a welcome to repeat guests and a speedy faultless check-in was a great start to the weekend.  All the staff, from the porters forever hovering around the door, the reception desk staff and the restaurant team were the most welcoming and cheeriest of hotel staff I have ever come across.  The rooms were excellent and were checked twice a day by cheerfull staff.  Is it something they put in the water in the staff canteen, or as I suspect an excellent management structure, whatever, it works, we shall return!

P.S. Anyone eating in the neighbourhood would not be dissappointed with Finos in nearby Mount Streeet (the downstairs wine cellar) and the forever popular El Pirata Spanish Restaurant.  The only slightly offputting note, is the eyesore of the unoccupied and increasingly derelict property at the junction of Picadilly and Halfmoon Street. Its about time the legal wranglings were sorted out with regards its future as it detracts from all the advantages of the area.",5,2008,09,06
144,"Lovely hotel, super location, skip the breakfast...","We booked our 3 night stay at the Flemings Mayfair based largely upon its superb location and the reviews we found on Tripadvisor.

We were not led astray in either instance.  The hotel is superbly located at the Green Park tube, Buckingham Palace a short walk away, easy access to everything and lots of little restaurants and small grocery stores in the area for those quick bites to eat.

The hotel itself is lovely and we found service at the front desk to be always prompt and efficient.    The room, while not large by any means, was adequate for our requirements and it did have AC which was most welcome as London was quite warm during our stay.   We find AC particularly useful in the sense that windows can stay closed and on the lower flowers this avoids what might otherwise be significant street noise (not just traffic, but also voices!).    

I'm not sure whether stuffiness or noise would have been an issue without the AC, but we had just arrived from a 3 night stay in Glasgow where both of these WERE a major issue in our accommodations so we were happy that this wouldn't be a problem in London and we were able to catch up on some lost sleep.

One caveat - my son is quite tall (6'5"") and in many areas he had to be cautious to avoid hitting his head on various ceiling fixtures.  In our room, the wood trim above the bathroom door was quite large and he knocked his head on it resoundingly twice.   There may be rooms with higher clearances and if you are tall - I would suggest you ask for such a room.    However do bear in mind that there are numerous locations in the hallways where a tall fellow might acquire a bump or bruise during his stay.

We weren't thrilled with the ""included"" breakfast.  To upgrade to a cooked breakfast was ridiculously expensive given that the cooked breakfast wasn't particularly appealing once it arrived.  Getting a refill of coffee nearly required the engagement of a marching band.   Servers seemed somewhat oblivious and not very bright.  We watched one set out with a full coffee pot on several occasions, refill one cup, then return to his station without offering anything to other tables he passed.  Other patronss seemed to be having a similar issue.  When my eggs were served (the one time I ordered a cooked breakfast, not a recommended activity), I requested a refill not only of my own coffee cup but for others at a nearby table who had achieved no success in flagging down a server.     

The continental breakfast was just so-so in terms of selection but we managed with that because we could not justify the increased cost for the cooked meal when none of us especially enjoyed it.   If breakfast is not included in your room cost, I would go elsewhere for it.",4,2008,08,15
144,Hidden Jewel,"Stayed in london for 1 night, my husband and I and my daughter and partner. Spent weeks trawling the web to find a decent hotel
near Bond St that wouldnt break the bank. Tried several that were fully booked and eventually found the Flemings which was a good price and had good reviews. We got a taxi from paddington which took about 7 mins and cost £8. The hotel is
up a side street just opposite green park and green park tube station. Lovely entrance/reception. Extremely friendly staff. We had arrived 2 hours earlier than check in but our rooms were ready. The rooms were lovely. Quite small but everything we needed. Free safe and fridge/mini bar/coffee/tea etc. The only thing that I would say I didnt like was the view from the windows - 
basically there wasnt one! Just a grey building that housed a generator or something. As it was raining, the air conditioning was good ,and we were out all day and evening it wasnt a problem. We had taken champagne to have a toast before we went out and we rang and asked reception if we could have some glasses. A few moments later 4 champagne flutes arrived on a silver tray! The beds were comfortable, there wasnt any noise 
from the street so we had a good nights sleep. We needed to get taxis several times and each time a member of staff walked to the corner to hail one, all for a smile! The hotel was very attractive
and in good order throughout, a buffet breakfast was included which was good. I will certainly be booking this hotel on my next visit to London",5,2008,08,11
144,What a gem!,"Stayed in this hotel during a business trip.  Very charming, excellent service and lovely breakfast.  Location also very handy for tube as well as nice local restaurants.  Not the largest room in the world but well decorated with flat screen tv, very clean and very comfortable bed - what more do you need?!",5,2008,08,04
144,loved this hotel,"Stayed here last year, but forgot to write a review about our stay there. Loved the location of this small hotel. Rooms were a bit small but we were always out taking in the sights of London, loved that it was so easy to catch a bus just yards from the hotel to take us a wee bit along the road to piccadily and back. The ritz hotel is just around the corner and the back end of the hilton is just across the small road. We loved London and this was a perfect wee place to stay.",5,2008,07,26
144,much better this time round,"We stayed in the Flemings for two nights last week. We had stayed previously and had a few issues which we put to the manager. We were invited back to stay with the managers assurance that he could change our mind about the hotel. He was right. The room was a lovely, large king size room with a sofa area and was airy and bright. On our previous stay, the noise was very much an issue but this time it was extremely quiet - the management had obviously taken on board our point about the soundproofing and allocated us a room accordingly. The bathroom was also very spacious and everything was extremely clean. We were welcomed with a gift of fruit and on our last night were given a gift of pastries and fruit as a thank you for staying with them. Not sure if everyone gets this or we were just treated extra special but it was certainly a nice touch. Breakfast was not up to much unfortunately, hard poached eggs and burnt sausages, but there was lots to choose from and the second morning was slightly better as we knew what to avoid! All in all, this time round our stay was great, the staff are very friendly and efficient and we would not hesitate to recommend it to other travellers- you cannot beat the location and it is head and shoulders above the Hilton Green Park which is directly opposite the hotel, where we stayed on our last night - so if anyone is thinking of going there - dont! But thats another story....",4,2008,07,12
144,Look Beyond First Impressions,"I chose this hotel for a variety of reasons, primarily its excellent location for the start line of the British 10k run I was running the next morning. I booked a single, and paid slightly above average but I expected a better than average condition. I am a firm believer that you get what you pay for, so I am happy to pay a little more to receive a little more.

In fairness the room had everything you could want, a TV, safe, stocked refrigerator, internet access with a wireless keyboard, air con.

However, what I found was that the room (121) was dimly lit, no view (inner courtyard) which had some kind of generator which intermittently came on and would be no good for light sleepers. Although the bathroom and room was clean, I found what looked like dried blood stains on the curtain. 

The bathroom and room were very small, manageable, but small and the bathroom looked like it needed a makeover.

Looking at other reviews and pictures of other rooms I do seem to have been unlucky, so maybe it is just this room that is a problem.

Another curious and worrying problem was that I checked in (which was quick and efficient) about 4pm, and about 5pm I decided to nip out to get some food, returned about 6pm but in that hour someone had been into the room and tidied up the bathroom, not sure I feel comfortable with that.

On a side note, the refrigerator and room service prices are disgustingly expensive, £16 for their burger on room service, £3 for some crisps, £1 for a normal sized kit kat for example. Whilst I have already said you get what you pay for , the prices do seem steep, so I would look to eat elsewhere.

The location is good, few min from tube, and shops close by. 

Would I stay here again?  Maybe, but unlikely.",2,2008,07,09
144,Great Location and charming rooms,"We slept here for 2 nights. Checking in was fast and efficient. The hotel is easy to find from the Green Park Station - only 5 min walk. Location wise - excellent! Green Park is just one stop to Piccadily Circus or Bond Street! Plus, the hotel is 50 meter walk to Buckingham Palace.. 

The room was spacious and nicely decorated. There's a flat screen but you don't watch TV in London anyway! No view from window - only facing bricks.

The bathroom comes with shower, bathtub. They replace towels and soap/shampoo etc everyday.. They give nice smelling shower gel, body lotion etc that I brought them home. lol. 

Breakfast is English and continental.. selection is not great given the rate you have to pay for the room! but the service is nice and they were polite to everybody. 

one thing I don't like about this hotel - the elevator is TINY! it's for midgets! but that is just being picky.

Most of the staff is eastblock, but they are fairly decent at English so it's okay, but it is a problem when they are also behind the front desk, and you want to ask detailed tourist questions.

will I recommend this hotel? YES.. of course!",4,2008,06,29
144,What a find!,"We recently stayed in one of the two-bedroom apartments for a few days before picking up a cruise out of Harwich.  While the bedrooms were smaller than what we are used to in the USA, they were so beautifully decorated that you didn't even notice.  The living room was also beautifully appointed and had a nice table for eating.  We loved the kitchen that also included laundry facilities.  With the restaurant prices in London, it was nice to be able to fix our own breakfast.  The location was very convenient.  A Starbucks right around the corner, and a small grocery shop also convienently located.  Walking distance to Picadilly and Green Park.  The tube and bus stops very close.  We didn't know what to expect when we booked this - but we loved it and would stay there again in a heartbeat.",5,2008,06,28
144,Wonderful 2-bedroom apartment,"We recently returned from a week's stay in one of the apartments at Fleming's Mayfair.  All signs of renovation (scaffolding, etc) are now gone.  The apartment was very comfortable and well-appointed, and it worked well for our family of four.  Location couldn't be better -- most places on our itinerary were either within walking distance or 1-2 stops away on the Tube.  The staff were uniformly pleasant and helpful.  As has been mentioned before, lots of nearby places for coffee, takeaway, groceries including M&S Simply Food and Tesco Express, as well as a Pret-A-Manger.  Broadband Internet is 15 pounds per day, but I was able to pick up the hotel's free wireless signal both in the Library and in one corner of the apartment.   We will definitely stay at Fleming's again in the future.",5,2008,06,04
144,great weekend,"we stayed a night at the hotel, like the other reviews we found that the hotel was near a lot of the main attractions, the hotel was very clean, we had a large bedroom with all mod con's, staff were very  polite, there was a good choice for breakfast, we had a good deal with superbreaks, we would definitely use the hotel again, FIRST CLASS",5,2008,04,28
144,Wonderful!,"My husband and I have just returned from a weekend break at Flemings Mayfair and had an amazing time.  This Georgian hotel is beautiful, it has all the charm and style of a Georgian hotel but with modern facilities discreetly inserted.  Bedroom was large and clean, the bathroom had a wonderful powershower.  

Location is perfect, two minute walk from Green Park Tube.  It is on a direct undergroud link to Harrods and Oxford Street.  It is less than a five minute walk to Buckingham Palace, across a lovely park.  

The staff were great, nothing was too much trouble.  They all appear to enjoy their jobs and because of this do them well.  

Our room rate included breakfast and it was wonderful, everything we could of wanted was there.  

I would have loved to have stayed longer and will defintely be heading back to Flemings Mayfair for another wonderful weekend.",5,2008,04,28
144,Nice Easter Offer,"Stayed at the hotel March 1st. 2008 as a part of a weekend tour to London, including a concert at The O2.
The hotel is within walking distance from Picadelly Circus, Westend and more. And it is excellent situated for the tube station Green Park, that runs directly to The O2.
There was some work in progress on the facade, but we didn't experience any problems/noize at all.
We booked directly on the hotel website (look for package offers), and asked if they could upgrade us from the normal double room in the package to the superior double room by just paying the normal difference - and no hazzle - they did it even that the superior wasn't normally a part of the packages on offer this time.
Oh - and I love it when there is a guy holding the door for you - he wasn't there always - but yes, he did it, when he wasn't running with suitcases.",5,2008,04,03
144,"Great Hotel, Extremely Convenient","I agree with the prevailing theme of the recent reviews preceding mine, which is to say that the Flemings Mayfair is a very comfortable, well-managed and perfectly-located hotel.  As of late March, 2008, renovations were complete and the scaffolding was in the process of being disassembled.

Flemings finds itself among very good company.  The Hilton Green Park is across the street.  Brown’s Hotel is six streets east; The Ritz is four.  And while the area is as upscale as London gets, there is also no shortage of coffee shops, convenience stores, sandwich shops and drugstores in the vicinity, all easily accessible by foot.  Green Park tube station, London’s most central and convenient in my opinion, is just three streets away; you’ll pass an HSBC on the way.  There’s not likely a more convenient hotel in London.

The property is quite pleasant and maintains its British feel, even after the renovation.  They modernized it but didn’t try to turn it into the cliché, contemporary boutique hotel.  The lobby is small but not crowded, and the staff was professional, welcoming and helpful when needed.  I had a double room, which was standard sized for London.  Americans will think it is a little small (…which it was ;-).  Broadband Internet is free for hotel guests, an outstanding perk since it is not uncommon for London hotels to charge £15-20 per day for this.  There is a mini-bar in the room, stocked, but with an open row for your own items.  Nice touch.

My room was comfortable, although not without a couple typically-European peculiarities.  The LCD TV is mounted on the wall directly in front of the desk.  The shower door—really more of a glass partition—only runs about half-way, which means there’s a cool breeze coming into the shower and water leaving it.  The climate control, as someone else mentioned, is neither easy to fine tune nor particularly precise.

Closet space was an issue.  My room had no dresser, and the closet isn’t practically designed.  It barely fit my things and I pack light!  Someone also seems to have forgotten about the elevator during the recent renovation.  There’s only one and it’s not very big.  But it's very slow, and taking the stairs is unfortunately not an option as the hallways are so convoluted you will never find your room.  I’m not kidding—you won’t.

But overall, the positives greatly outweighed the negatives, and in a city not known for having the best or most affordable accommodations, Flemings really shines.",5,2008,03,30
144,Competitors could learn alot off Flemings Managment and staff!,"For the 3rd year in a row I have spent 5 nights in London and have stayed  at Flemings and each year it gets better and better! #1 the staff, when you are a longer stay like me it makes so much difference when you have not just familiar staff (how does this hotel keep them so long?) but they remember me, my name and why I come to London #2 I love the location of the hotel in Mayfair - first I feel safe, as a woman travelling alone I feel comfortable with walking to Shepherds Mkt for dinner at night. #3 There are some fab funky restaurants opened on Piccadilly (The Wolsley is my favourite) as are the new Fortnum and Mason restaurants.  #4I come to London on business each year  from Aust/NZ but always stay an extra weekend to do the 'touristy thing' - I can walk to Knighsbridge, the posh shops of New Bond St, walk to M&S in Oxford St, stroll Green and Hyde Parks and I am on the bus routes to all major museums #5 the hotel is really clean, I mean really clean - try to do the finger sweep test in public areas and guestrooms and bathrooms and you will be surprised!!

Flemings is an example of an exceptionally well run hotel. Congradulations to the staff and managment of this hotel - your competitors could learn alot from you.",5,2008,03,26
144,Great hotel within walking distance of many London attractions,"Stayed one night Easter weekend 2008. Hotel swathed in scaffolding outside but interior newly renovated and top quality. Warm welcome, nice room, whilst a little on the small side, really well equipped. Immaculate bathroom, again well supplied with top quality toileteries and bathrobes. (Room hot despite no radiator on and temp outside freezing. Air con cooled the room but a bit excessive to have to use use it in March!!) Lovely comfy bed and high quality linen etc. Flat screen TV - all in all good value for money at £125 inc full breakfast, and Easter egg. Super breakfast and what made the short stay pleasurable were the smiley attentive staff everywhere. If you are looking for a small incredibly well located hotel for business, or as a tourist you want to b eamongst the fabulous sights in London this is the one! (Scaffolding to be removed very shortly to reveal the lovely facade again.)",5,2008,03,24
144,Excellent hotel in prime location,"Stayed two nights in connexion with visiting Royal Academy exhibitions, conveniently just around the corner.

Booked at a most favourable B & B vat-inclusive rate via hotel's own website. Most Mayfair hotels sadly cater for those who can afford and don't mind outrageous prices but neither applies to me !!

The place is bang opposite a Hilton establishment and is presently undergoing a major refurbishment and externally is swathed in scaffolding. Once inside, the lobby is most impressive, with gleaming marble floor and a fascinating  giant 'Jaguar' car/automobile mascot that probably once graced a Mayfair car showroom [some kind of explanatory plaque is required, perhaps ??]

Single lift but modern with a most unusual interior decor !! leading to labyrinthine but very stylishly decorated bedroom floors.

Compact but most tastefully-furnished bedroom and bathroom, all befitting the overall standard of the place. Excellent, comfortable, large bed. Efficient [if a little noisy] newly-installed wallmounted aircon unit but wardrobe position made access to the distant wall control for it very awkward.

Ditto the spacious dining room but beware those with limited mobility as it's down a short flight of stairs in the basement and the lift doesn't seem to descend that far.

Breakfasts were of a high standard and served by most pleasant attentive and efficient and smart young people.

Have previously stayed at the Mayfair Holiday Inn on nearby Berkeley Street and this was much better both as regards value and ambience and comfort. Highly recommended !!",5,2008,03,18
144,Above average accomodation,"Stayed 1 night to see a show in London, and booked through hotel website. Scaffolding outside hotel means views from the windows are of scaffolding poles and sheeting, but we were not there for the views, and the price we paid for the room was very good. Room was clean and quite large for London, with a sofa, coffee table and writing desk.Bed was comfy, and breakfast was included in price of room with lots of options.Other big plus for this hotel is its staff, everyone we encountered was very friendly, and if we could get a good deal we would return.",4,2008,03,12
144,Great hotel and location,"Got an excellent deal for this hotel, 260 euro for two nights for two people including breakfast. hotel is lovely, staff are friendly and helpful and location is great. 
The internal renovations are complete but the exterior is still being worked on, for all the people who complained about the scaffolding, ignore them, it doesnt make any difference to your stay (they cant close the hotel just incase some people might get offended by scaffolding!!!). plenty of buildings in the area are getting similar work done.
The location is great especially for site seeing and shopping on bond street and oxford street.",5,2008,03,10
144,pity about the plumbing,"Front of building covered in scaffolding. Had been told that work would have been finished by the time we were due to visit. Reception was satisfactory but bedroom (101) very small with a tiny filthy window overlooking back of the property. Nice bathroom, but pillows rather firm and not comfortable. Biggest problem was the plumbing in that major pipes ran down outside the wall of the room and water appeared to flow frequently throughout the night seriously disturbing sleep. Do not stay in room 101!
The hotel does have  a lovely small lounge which was a pleasant place to sit and have tea or a drink.
Great location for Piccadilly and Mayfair but I would suggest looking at other nearby hotels first.",2,2008,03,06
144,Great hotel and excellent location,"My wife and I stayed in the Flemings Mayfair Hotel for a long weekend and found it very friendly and comfortable.  We had a very generously sized room that was stylishly decorated.  Also, we had an immaculate bathroom, which was very spacious.  The breakfast was lovely and good quality. 

It's very central and very close to Green Park tube station.  We were very impressed with everything Flemings had to offer and would stay again.  There is currently external refurbishment underway on the facade of the building.  However it didn't affect our stay – it was just a pity we couldn't get a look at the Georgian facade!",5,2008,03,04
144,"oh well, never mind !","My boyfriend booked this hotel on line for my surprise 30th birthday yesterday.

On turning into half moon street we were greeted with a ton of scaffolding covered over with black boards stretching as far as the eye could see!

Apparently the hotel has had an extensive refurbishment which Superbreaks said was completed. No mention of this at check in or any apology for the inconvenience.

Once the door to our room was open, we were overcome with paint fumes and more scaffolding from the view of our bedroom window! could not open the window in the bedroom or bathroom to try to get rid of the stench as painted shut so people wouldn't stumble out on the scaffolding presumably!

Bedroom very small bathroom very large. The only thing that was good was the location and breakfast.",1,2008,03,02
144,Nice small hotel - good value during refurb,"If you want to stay in London's Mayfair district (i.e. just about the most expensive hotels in the world), a good tip is to find one with the builders in, provide you check it out carefully. Flemings Hotel is covered with scaffolding outside but inside there is no disturbance at all.

We asked for and got a quiet room and got 411 in the roof. The room was very comfortable for one night, though the cramped bathroom and lack of drawer space might not be good for a longer stay.

The room has powerful heating and aircon that seem to operate entirely independently - not so green!

Staff pleasant and helpful and full English breakfast was included in our rate.",4,2008,02,21
144,issues w/everything but location,"Location is it's only redeeming quality. Missed hotel on my first pass due to scaffolding. Supposed interior improvements yielded a tired/dated lobby & public rooms. Even my room, #211, had frayed carpet; why wouldn't they have cut this?! 2nd fl room but up & down 3 sets of 1 or 2 steps, even a small one to my room. Thank God there was no fire at night, I would have broken an ankle at a minimum getting out of there. The A/C is horribly loud, from a bubbling watery sound to bizzare changes in fan speed to chrystal chandelier-sounding tinkling. Turned it off. It got hot, I opened the window but w/scaffolding, who knows who/what could have climbed in so I tried to close but window got stuck. Urgh. Sink too small. water everywhere after a shave. 141 pounds/night on corp plan. I will not be back but will find something else in Mayfair.",2,2008,02,14
144,I could have stayed there forever!,"I was impressed with this hotel as soon as I stepped inside the lobby. Small, but lovely. I arrived about 8:30 am hoping that they might have a room ready for me (knowing that check-in was not until 2 pm), however, they did not. They were kind enough to take my bags while I walked in St. James Park to refresh myself from a long flight. I came back about 90 minutes later, and the porter took me to my room, which, although very nice....was not made up yet. So, back to the lobby we went. They called the cleaning staff to check on the room & were told it would be another hour. I went into the library off of the lobby to relax, and before I could blink, a fresh pot of tea & cakes was placed before me. What a treat for a weary traveler. The staff were brilliant, breakfast was wonderful. My room was large and had every convenience I could possibly want. The bathroom was luxurious. 
The next moring I noticed an envelope near the door, and inside was an invitation to dine in the hotel restaurant one evening during my stay as an apology for the room mix-up the day before. 
Most other hotels wouldn't have even offered me a room that early, much less apologize for not having one ready. I plan to stay at Flemings Mayfair again in October 2008.",5,2008,01,29
144,"Very good, very expensive","Our family - parents and twin 17-year old boys stayed here in December  for 8 nights. We had the penthouse apartment - 2 big bedrooms, big living room (complete with Christmas tree), kitchen, 2 bathrooms, 3 toilets. I believe the hotels' big attraction is its position - Piccadilly,Green Park, Regent Street, Bond Street are all a short walk and that is just so convenient.
Our apartment was great, very well appointed, plenty of room, reasonably quiet (some street noise, but you're in the middle of a big city). Breakfast just OK - better to be had at Shepherd's Market - 2 minute walk. Other good restaurants there too - Boudin Blanc is nice.
We thought the hotel was charming - nice staff, amusing layout and the apartment was terrific. It has to be said though (and I know it is London) that well over 1200 Australian dollars a night is a lot of money.
I don't regret it at all, but it makes being value-for-money very tough.",4,2008,01,27
144,Great Stay,"Stayed at this hotel for a weekend theatre break, the staff  were very friendly and the room was very nicely decorated and of a good size and very clean.  We had a problem with our tv and a member of staff attended immediately . Although the front of the building was being upgraded at the time this did not affect our stay whatsoever.  We found the hotel to be very central to all areas e.g. Picadilly Circus, Leicester Square, Oxford Street , Hard Rock Cafe and and there was also an underground straight across the street.  The hotel is located up a quiet side street.",4,2008,01,16
144,Didn't like this Hotel,"We were a lot of people staying at this hotel for our Christmas Party.  To start with no one from the hotel told us that the hotel was under refurbishment.  Most of the rooms were very small and some only had a shower!  Our room was ok but still small.
For £180 per room I think they saw us coming!  The staff serving drinks before we went out for dinner, at The Dover Street Jazz Bar and Restaurant, which was fantastic, were slow motion personified.  I ordered a coke and a dry white wine and it took 15 minutes to arrive.  Too late as we had to be at Dover Street by 8pm.  Breakfast was diabolical, undercooked bacon, sausages and as for the scambled eggs, yuk.  I have received a call from the Manager and I said that most people were extremely disappointed and for the money it was very poor.  He was supposed to ring me back on Friday last, but he hasn't.  I am thinking of the Chesterfield in Charles Street for this year's party.
The only saving grace were the bar staff on our return to the hotel who mixed a mean Marguerita!",2,2008,01,15
144,Nice location,"Flemings Mayfair was very nice. The building and rooms are tastefully decorated. Very small, but well accommodated. The street is about 200 yards from the Underground if you walk down Half Moon and turn left. If you walk across into Green Park, a nice stroll leads directly to Buckingham Palace. Beautiful area with plenty of coffee shops, dining and shopping.",4,2008,01,14
144,"Small, pleasant hotel well located in Mayfair","I've stayed at Fleming's Mayfair at least 15 times in the last three or four years.  It's small, and the staff are consistently very helpful.   The rooms range from small but nicely appointed singles and to large doubles, and ocassionally I've been ""bumped up"" into one of the elegant apartments.  It's not a place for  someone who likes or needs wide, flat hallways, since the hotel has been built by assembling three or four adjacent 4 & 5 story townhouses and there are a lot of places on each level where you have to go up or down a couple of steps as you pass from one building to the next.   

It's on a side street just off  Picadilly.  There's no noise from PIcadilly and the rooms are double glazed so there's not much sound from the street.  The AC is a bit noisy.  The accomodations are modern, although the stye is typically Edwardian (?) English -- heavy drapes, curved armrests on the plush sofas.  The bathroom fixtures are up to date and there's broadband Internet in the rooms and WiFi in the public areas.  

I go to London on business, and if you don't need the sort of business center you find at a big hotel and if Mayfair is a good location for you, Fleming's is fine.  The hotel is very well located for shopping & theater.  It's three short blocks from the Green Park tube station on the Picadilly Line, which is a straight 50-minute shot from Heathrow.  It's a 10-minute cab ride to Paddington and the Heathrow Express, and 15 minutes on the Tube from the Eurostar train terminal at St. Pancras.  

This winter, price have been UK169 a night plus VAT, including breakfast.  I prefer to stay here and walk 10-15 minutes to my firm's office rather than stay  across the street from the office because it's friendly, well appointed and accomodating.",5,2007,12,28
144,Very Disappointing,"We have just stayed in this hotel and I was very disappointed.  They are undergoing refurbishment and there is scaffolding everywhere.  However, it was the room that was disappointing.  It was small and the bathroom was very small, but the worst thing was the room was next to the lift and all night I could hear the sound of the lift motor and when the doors opend there was a loud noise - which resulted in my having no sleep at all.  Also there was a problem getting hot water - the only way this could be achieved was to leave the tap running for several minutes and when we are always being told to conserve water is not a good idea - all in all the experience was very disappointing and one I would not wish to repeat.",2,2007,12,19
144,"MMmmm, not sure.....","I stayed one night at Flemings Mayfair on 5 December 2007.

The exterior of the hotel is currently being renovated so is completely boarded up. A note in the room said they had spent £5M renovating the interior which is now complete.

Lobby is small & it was unclear where reception was.

Checked into room 401. Very small room but as I was on my own so it was fine and the decoration was nice, a bit different, it looked quite cute. Double bed, wardrobe witch housed the mini bar, kettle, safe as well as hanging space.

Flat screen TV on the wall at the end of the bed was nice but there were very few channels.

Bathroom was bigger than I expected for the size of the room with marble tops and a shower over the bath.

Problems - the sink in the bathroom is too small. You can't fill the mini kettle from the tap as the sink is too shallow and it's difficut to use to wash your face as the tap is fixed and there is so little room either side of it that you end up with water everywhere.

There is no clock in the room. Unless you bring your own or have a mobile phone you won't know what the time is.

The hallway is well lit which is nice, except that there was a big gap at the bottom of the door so the light shone through when i was trying to sleep. I eventually put a pillow down and that worked quite well.

I suspect that very little of the £5M spent was on sound proofing. The bed was on the hallway wall and that combined with the gap under the door meant I might have well have slept in the hallway. I could also hear other guests in their rooms - never good.

Bed was comfortable. Air con was noisy.

Food - I didn't eat at the hotel. Even though I was on business and my company was picking up the tab I couldn't justify spending £16 on a burger. Breakfast was £18. Again, wouldn't even spend someone elses money at that price.

Good points - great location for the tube, Green Park is 2 blocks away, doesn't take more than a couple of minutes to walk there. Streets around the hotel felt safe, even when walking back to the hotel from the tube station late at night. Also a great location for anything in the city or tea at the Ritz.

I'm not sure I would stay at Flemings Mayfair again, the one thing you need is a good nights sleep and I didn't get it here. The location is good but for the price of a room I think there are better options.",2,2007,12,07
144,Exceptional Apartments Value For Money,"We have stayed at Flemings Apartments on most London visits over the years.  Last time, we tried the Collingham Apartments, but hurried back to Flemings again on this visit.

The apartments at Flemings Hotel have their own separate entrance from the street, without the need to pass through the hotel lobby.  We have stayed in both 1 and 2 bedroom apartments in the past.  The apartments are names after authors, and this time we stayed in 'Dickens'.  Dickensian it was not!  Luxury is the order of the day here.  

Quality furniture and decor, large living room, separate guest toilet, full bath with separate shower closet, ample closet space, aircon, writing desk, dining table to seat 4, Internet access in room, CD player and widescreen TV in both main rooms are just some of the features.   Then there is a fully stocked kitchen and fridge with tea, coffee, bread, butter, milk, eggs, biscuits, bottled water and fresh fruit provided free!  

For quality and value - Flemings is hard to beat.",5,2007,12,02
144,Out of this world service!!!!,"Hi I was lucky enough to stay at this hotel last week.  
Everything about the hotel was perfect!!

Staff very friendly and would out of their way for you.  We stayed in an executive room which was extremely comfortable.

Brill location within minutes of Green Park Tube station...nice trendy bars and restaurants near hotel.

Breakfast was fantastic with lots of choice.  

Two nights wasn’t enough....Would definitely recommend",5,2007,11,21
144,Still the best bargain in Mayfair,"In the two years since we last stayed at Flemings, it has only gotten better.  The rooms are compact, but beautifully furnished with all modern amenities.  As always, the lobby, lounge and dining areas are comfortably plush.  Every area of the hotel is spotless.

All employees from reception to cleaning staff are pleasant, efficient, and knowledgeable.  Of particular note is Priscilla in Dining who noticed a minor concern with the preparation of my breakfast and immediately corrected it without being asked.  As far as touring London is concerned, we have run out of superlatives in describing William, the charming concierge - he knows all, anticipates all, and strives to meet each guest's needs.

We know of no other 3 star hotel in Mayfair that provides as much value for money.  Certainly there are none so perfectly located with Piccadilly Circus, Green Park, Shepherd Market, Hard Rock Cafe, and even Buckingham Palace all short walks from the hotel. 

As always, search the internet for special offers.  I suspect reviewers who thought Flemings too expensive were tourists who did not investigate thoroughly before making reservations.",5,2007,11,05
144,Superb - in every way!,"After reading previous reviews for this hotel, I approached my holiday with caution. I need not have worried. Although check in is not until 1400 we were allowed to leave our cases there as soon as we arrived in London, and the check in process was carried out early so we only needed to pick up our key when we returned. The room was compact, but there was plenty of room to move around and it contained every convenience we were looking for, and was exceedingly comfortable. Full English breakfast was included in our stay, which was tasty and filling, but we also had full access to the breakfast buffet, which was regularly restocked and contained everything you would expect of a hotel catering to international tastes. The staff were wonderful. They were friendly and helpfuland very efficient. The hotel is perfectly located about 10 minutes walk from Piccadily Circus, and just round the corner from Green Park tube, so it's easy to get to the hotel no matter where you are arriving from. Our stay here was perfect, and I'd happily stay here again.",5,2007,10,31
144,Treated like royalty!,"Two friends and I stayed at Flemings-Mayfair for six nights 9/19 thru 9/24/07.  The staff offered excellent service including reception, concierge, housekeeping, restaurant and porters.  Check-in and check-out were effortless.  Ice was always provided to our room upon request.

The room was two double beds with a pull-out sofa making it a triple.  Friend reported the sofa very comfortable, as were the beds.  Room was ready for early check-in, and daily housekeeping kept it clean and tidy.  We had an in-room air conditioner which kept the room very comfortable without much noise.

Continental breakfast included croissants, sweetrolls, ham, salami, cheese, yogurt, cereal, toast & jam, and fresh fruit.  Very ample, and good.

Upon arrival four staff members scurry out to greet you - two holding doors open, two at bottom of 3 steps to help with baggage, etc.  Upon entering lobby the concierge greets you with a personal question i.e. ""How did you like Buckingham Palace today?""  Never waited more than a couple of minutes for the lift - which is lovely decorated as a library.

The library off the lobby is a perfect place to relax and unwind prior to retiring to your room.  Comfy sofas and chairs, windows overlook Half Moon St., fireplace for colder temperatures.

Definitely looking forward to staying here again!",5,2007,09,29
144,What a Hell Hole!!!,"We stayed at Flemings of Mayfair Hotel for 2 nights.  It is like a building site.  Scaffolding is erected with builder shouting, dropping tools from 8.00am to 6.00pm.  & having to look out a the Builders fat stomach is not a room with a view.  Unable to relax in rooms, as builders & heating engineers in & out constantly, we were even being interputed whilst in the bathroom.  Had to complain to Front of House manager several times, before he would get the workmen out of our bedroom.  The bedroom were not made up by 2.00pm & again had to chase the manager, to get this done.
& the heat!!!! (I read a previous review from earlier this year) the heating/airconditioning is still not working/fixed.  I woke up in a bath of sweat & my hair having gone all fuzzy.  I was like waking up in the tropics!.  
Afternoon tea was disgusting too.  Very small sandwiches (which were dry, probably due to the heat) & £37.00 for 3 people, it is a rip off.
The one lift, which is very slow is used by Guests & Hotel staff as a service lift.  When you call the lift, you have to wait ages for it.
Staff were indifferent & rude.  The female receptionist would rather chat to her friends on the phone than deal with guests.
I would not stay at Flemings of Mayfair again & I would not advise anyone else to either.  Keep your money & book into somewhere else, where there are no builders, rude staff, heating/airconditioning is working & don't pay of the over priced afternoon tea.",1,2007,09,25
144,Great hotel,"My wife and I stayed here for one night to take in a show in the west end.
Excellent location, a minutes walk from Green Park underground and only one stop away from Piccadilly and two from Leicester Square. 
All the main attractions are easily accessible on foot, with Piccadilly only 5-8 minutes walk and Buckingham Palace about the same.
The rooms are very comfortable and overall we found this hotel to be a good example of a four star hotel. For good rates we found alpharooms hard to beat.
Hope you enjoy it as much as we did.
",5,2007,08,22
144,dissaster,"Total dissaster, booked two rooms direct with hotel for myself, my husband,and three small children to stay for two nights, only to find on arrival only one room had been reserved and there were not two rooms available, didn't seem to matter to them although mistake was theirs, so we were left in London with no accomodation.
",1,2007,08,14
144,Loved our apartment at Flemings!!,"My husband and I stayed at the Flemings Mayfair for 3 nights and wished we had stayed longer. The staff was so wonderful, nice and welcoming upon our arrival.  Throughout our stay they were always so helpful in answering any of our questions.  We stayed in one of the apartments which was absolutely amazing.  The room was very spacious and had such a comfortable bed.  We plan on returning to London in the future and will definitely be staying at the Mayfair again. We highly recommend this hotel to anyone.  It was also in such a great location. Only a 5 minute walk to Picadilly and Buckingham Palace!
",5,2007,07,18
144,Great location but most other things disappointing,"We like to stay in the St James's / Mayfair area and we looked at the
hotel website and thought we'd give it a go. The hotel has a great location just off Piccadilly but on approaching the hotel alarm bells
started ringing. The hotel is a small side street and adjacent properties are very run down for this upmarket area. On entering the hotel we were aware of the lack of staff around and on checking in we had difficulty making ourselves understood as the receptionist had a poor command of the English language, although he supervisor quickly took over and saved the day. We were shown to our room which was a very small, dark room on the ground floor next to the library. The room itself was ok but tired looking and  not quite what we were expecting. There was however a comfortable lounge area in the hotel. The hotel lacked atmosphere, we were on a room only basis and so we didn't eat at the hotel. The hotel has great potential but if you're looking for something a bit special then you will be disappointed",3,2007,05,13
144,Nice location but would not stay there again,"The hotel is located in a nice location in the Mayfair area close to the  major attraction areas and the hotel and room atmosphere was quite nice, but the hotel has major issues with their service.  The breakfast that comes with the room rate is awful and while you're sleeping in the morning, the cleaning lady opens your door with one knock on the door (without waiting for us to respond).  This happened twice out of three days.  The trip may seem ok until you check out to see your phone bill. I made a 25 minute call to my friend who lives in London city area and the bill came out to 100 pounds ($200).  I complained since the calculation seemed to be a mistake based on the directory info and they first said 'London hotels are quite expensive especially to mobile phones'.   I asked for an explanation based on the info provided and without good explanation they said 'ok, how about 50% off then' as if it was a cheap flea market bargain. I was still quite unhappy since the information on the directory said it's 88 cents per minute. I explained my calcuation and they said 'ok, 36 pounds then.' When I asked for a receipt, they just typed in '36' on the receipt without any details. It was very unprofessional.  Then, I heard another lady who seemed to be happy when she came to the reception yelling at the front desk when she saw her bill.  I would be very careful when you stay at this place.
",2,2007,05,02
144,birthday treat,"what a wonderful short stay, brilliant location, staff were efficient friendly and helpful.  we had evening meal and breakfast and i have to say although evening meal was a little expensive, it was delicious, breakfast was included in the price and was fabulous.

Ihave stayed in london on lots of occasions and this was by far the best we have stayed in not just value for money but beautifully clean and catered well for children.
",5,2007,04,19
144,Excellent Time!,"My friend and I stayed at the Flemings Mayfair from March 9th to March 17th, 2007. We booked the hotel along with our flight on go-today.com. Our room was always clean and the staff was very helpful. We ate breakfast every morning as part of our reservation. Although the food was nothing special, there was enough to satisfy me. Their food included cereal, pastries, fruit (not that fresh), meats (I didn't try them), toast and yogurt. I'm not that picky so cereal and tea for breakfast was fine with me. The hotel is a five minute walk from the nearest tube station (Green Park) and a ten minute walk to the next one (Picadiily Circus). We were a stone's throw from Buckingham Palace and Green Park. I would recommend eating dinner at one of the restaurants in Shepards Market. It's just two blocks from the hotel. We had a fine meal at a Turkish Restaurant in Shepards Market. There's also a Fedex with twenty-four hour internet service just one block away. I have given the hotel a high rating b/c of the cleanliness, helpful staff, and it's close proximity to a tube station. This hotel was perfect for my spring break trip to London!
",5,2007,04,02
144,Flemings Was Fabulous,"I think Flemings is one the most friendly and comfortable hotels in the whole of London. It is also excellent value. Situated in the heart of Mayfair (truly the most fantastic location) this is one of London's unsug gems.

Originally built in the 18th century, it retains an appropriate old-fashioned charm - mixed with the modern virtues of impeccable service and cleanliness. The food is brilliant, too.

There are a variety of rooms to suit all tastes, from suites to singles, and all are equipped with everything you could possibly need. They are beautifully furnished.

The well-mannered staff strike the perfect balance between charm and discretion, allowing the visitor space and time, but also attentive to all needs.

One last tip - don't miss the breakfast. it must be the best in London.
",5,2007,03,21
144,London's finest,"I have now stayed at Flemings several times and each time the standard of service has been exceptional.
The rooms are immaculate and comfortable - and most importantly the bar serves the best gin and tonic in town.
",5,2007,03,20
144,Wonderful Hotel,"We were three friends sharing a triple. The room worked perfectly. Immaculate lovely bathroom and very spacious.Plenty of towels and a heated towel bar. The maid service was outstanding, crisp white sheets on the beds, plentiful pillows and they redid the room invisibly. We never encountered them.
The concierge was charming and helpful. All in all a totally pleasant experience.

144,"Great stay, would definitely stay again","I stayed in the Fleming Mayfair between March 4 - 11th with my family into two separate rooms. This was my third trip to London
and I have to say my favorite hotel.  The room was more than adequate in size (for London).  The room had industrial AC units 
in them that were a bit noisy, but kept the room cool.  The hallways and rooms can be stuffy / hot as all the windows are sealed /
stain glass.  The hotel was very neat, staff very helpful and organized.  I found the bar and library to be very nice places to 
relax.  Breakfast was wonderful.  We had the contential breakfast every day which had a full spread of cereals, juices, fresh fruit,
pastries, fish, breads and hard boiled eggs.  For 2 pounds more you coul have the English Breakfast (C - 16 pounds, EB - 18 pounds).
Breakfast was included in my stay so I ate everyday.  The room had guest terry cloth robes to wear and was smartly decorated.  

The location could not be better.  Located in Mayfair, a beautiful part of London with a grocery store just around the corner, multiple restaurants
and coffee shops.  Take the time to explore Mayfair after you checkin, including Shepherds Market.  

To get the hotel (cheaply), take the Piccadily line towards central London and get off at the Green Park stop (about 45 minutes on the
Underground and 4 pounds in cost).  Walk up the stairs to ""Piccadily North"".  Take a hard right once you reach street level and walk about
3-4 blocks down to Half Moon and Piccadily.  Take a right up Half Moon and the Fleming Mayfair will be on your right and in the middle
of Half Moon Street.

I really enjoyed the Fleming Mayfair hotel and will stay there again.  Another tip.  Take the Big Bus Company tour right across from the 
Green Park underground station (Green Park, the actual park, side of Piccadily).  It was 20 pounds for the day but the Red Line tour was great.
Much better than the Original Bus Company.

144,Great location & Friendly staff,"My husband and I spent a week in London at the Flemings Mayfair. This is our 2nd trip to London and I was very pleased with the room.  This hotel was a package deal from Go-today travel and so I was a bit nervous about what our lodgings would actually pan out to be. I actually went through tripadvisor and checked the reviews on all the hotels that were offered by Go-Today before making my selection. 

I was happy with my choice. The location is perfectly situated, less than 5 min. walk to Green Park tube station. It is also situated across the park from Buckingham Palace for those interested. Piccadilly station is a 10 min. walk or take the tube if you are tired.

The staff was very friendly and helpful. The hotel was trendy looking. The room was small, but a good size for London standards. The room was also pretty warm-ok hot. I would agree with the other reviewers, but easily solved by opening the windows a bit. Of course by opening the windows, you also open the room to the street noise. If you don't like the street noise at night you definitely won't like it in the a.m. If you are not an early riser, you may want to request a room away from the street because it does get a bit crazy.

The continental breakfast was average.  It was buffet style and was filling with a variety of selections. The wait staff was very friendly. 

Overall,  we did not care about the noise or the heat, you can adjust to these minor inconveniences. After all you are in London...relax and enjoy the city.

I gave the review an above average rating because of the proximity to the tube station and  the friendly service. In London it is a good thing to be close to the tube, saves your feet.
",4,2007,02,21
144,Little Gem!,"What a lovely little gem!  We had very generously sized rooms that were stylishly decorated. Very friendly, helpful staff.  Lovely breakfast and nice bar meals.  Good location, tucked away down a side street from Green Park tube. My only minor moan would be that the reception desk/area was too small and check in/out could take a while...apart from that I would recommend highly.
",4,2007,02,18
144,Would not stay again!!,"I stayed at the Flemings Mayfair on Valentines Day with my boyfriend. First impression was good but when checking in we had to wait while they ""checked something in our room"" We both thought this was a little bit strange but didnt read much into it. We popped out for shopping and when returning to our room we noticed someone had been in as the curtains/blinds had been ajusted! It appeared that the staff hadn't prepared our room for our arrival as we noticed things appearing in our room i.e towels, glasses. Not impressed! We found it hard to sleep as it was really hot in the room and even had a temporary air con unit in the room! Doors were continuiously slamming early hours in the morning so I kept waking up with a shock! Breakfast was not impressive at all. It was warm, not hot and not very nice. The table salt was in a tray unchurned so you found it too salty! We even got chatting to another couple who approched us and told us how they hated their stay. We were not alone. I wouldnt recommend this hotel, I'm also a travel agent and i will definately not be staying again. The location was good but overal rather dissappointing especially at £60 a night!
",2,2007,02,17
144,Excellent hotel,"My wife and I stayed at this hotel for two night in January 2007 (room 207).
We found the hotel to be an excellent choice, in a good location and at £119 per room per night, excellent value. Our room was a standard room but of a good size with a large comfortable double bed. The bathroom was also a good size with a large bath and seperate shower cubicle.
It is located in a quiet side street (a bonus!) close to Green Park tube station, over the road from Green Park (a short walk through the park to Buckingham Palace), West End in fact very central for everything.
We would definately stay here again.
",5,2007,02,09
144,"Lovey hotel, good choice!","Alovely weekend spent in the elegant Flemings of mayfair. It is an intimate, quiet hotel in a side street, but very central, very close to green park tube station and within walking distance of regent street/piccadilly. 
The lobby was filled with the most beautiful flowers, the smell greeted you every time you walked in, a nice touch.
It was spotlessly clean, and well decorated. the breakfast was great, buffet on the sunday, table service on the monday.
the room was well appointed, and not a bad size for a standard twin.
there is one problem that i will mention, The heat! although it was january the room was extremely hot, and the air-conditioning unit was too noisy to have on at night. this would make me think twice before booking in the summer which is a shame as it really is a lovely hotel. hopefully they will sort this out soon.
I would recommend this hotel however, as it is well placed and well run.

144,spot on,"Stayed Flemings for 3 nights in London as part of Silver Wedding Anniversary break. Found the room to be smallish but very quiet and comfortable. Staff top notch and food (Dinner) was great - breakfast a little overcooked though.

Ideal for theatre land, Royal Albert Hall and Oxford Street. 
Would definately go again and / or recommend.

144,Great Location,"Stayed for 2 nights late Nov 06 as part of theatre break. 
Excellent location, easy to walk to Oxford/Regent Streets. Covent Garden also walking distance, my 70yr old mother was fine this
No problems getting cabs from hotel.
Breakfast cold buffet, also cooked English if you wish. Service felt a little hurried.
Saff helpful and friendly.
Bar area could do with updating and it was smokey the night I went in (not long to smoking ban though) again staff friendly.
Room and bathroom clean room for a small seating area with couch.

144,A wonderful stay,"I stayed with my children here for a weekend break in London during the October half term break. What a lovely hotel Flemings is! Everything was perfect, from the welcoming  and professional staff at the reception desk, to the beautiful rooms and the excellent buffet breakfast. We were very impressed with everything Flemings had to offer and  would stay again in a heartbeat! The location was excellent, being just minutes away from Green Park station and an easy walk to Piccadily. Thoroughly recommended!",5,2006,11,26
144,"Wonderful Hotel, Excellent location","My husband and I stayed at the Flemings Mayfair hotel for 5 nights in November.  We had a room with a king size bed. The room was wonderful and very comfortable.  The location is amazing, it's on a side street off of Piccadilly.  We walked everywhere, never felt the need to take the tube.  Walked to Harrods, Piccadilly Circus, Trafalgar Square, Oxford Circus, museums, Westminster Abby, etc.  Excellent little cafes around the corner.  Samuel Pepys Pub on Claridges Street, behind Half Moon, literally 1 minute walk.  Cheap beer & good pub grub.  Also on Claridges street, right at the corner, is an amazing Lebanese restaurant.  Excellent food and not very expensive.  In the other direction, a 2 minute walk the other way, are more pubs and restaurants.  There's also a Tesco Express (London chain of grocery stores) which is very convinient.  On Piccadilly street, grab a great sandwich or salad at Pret a Manger, another chain you'll see everywhere in London. 
We took a day tour, which is probably the best way to see London and then decide where you want to explore.  We were there 6 days and still have so much to see. Enjoyed the city, food, theatres, etc,....The people are so polite and the city is just beautiful.  Can't wait to go back.

144,Gem of a hotel,"Spent Sat 28th October 2006 at Flemings and had a superb time.  Hotel staff very pleasant and helpful.  Breakfast excellent and rooms furnished well and clean.  Would recommend and will return.  It is just such a great central situation for a weekend break.
",4,2006,10,30
144,uninhabitable,"With an ideal location -- close-by Shepherd Market and convenient to 
all of Mayfair -- Flemings features some of the smallest rooms we've 
ever experienced, reached via airless and sweltering hallways. Of the 
few common spaces, The Library is charming but sadly uninhabitable by 
even the most hardy of non-smokers. But most disappointing is the 
service, especially by the front desk, which typically exhibited that 
""who are you and what could you possibly want that would matter even a 
whit to me?"" attitude. Book this hotel only when there are no other 
options in the area.
",1,2006,10,24
144,Soooo Hot,"We stayed at Flemings Mayfair for two nights. The location was absolutely great for us as we love shopping in Knightsbridge and the atmosphere of the West End. The hotel itself lacked atmosphere and unfortunately class. It was so so hot in the coridoors and rooms. The rooms were tiny and very clostrophobic. The breakfast was good, but again there was very little atmosphere in the Restaurant. On the Sunday we returned to our room at around 3.30pm for a little snooze and the room had not been serviced. True to form the door and telephone then did not stop asking if we required our room to be serviced. We agreed we would be out for around 6pm & the housekeeper agreed the room would be serviced then. At 5.15pm the door knocked again for our room to be serviced. We gave up and requested that they did not service our room as it was more trouble than it was worth. We had a great weekend in London however would not recommend the Flemings.
",3,2006,09,19
144,Very pleasant room in excellent Green Park location,"I selected this hotel from several options as part of a Virgin Vacations package, so I think we got a better-than-usual rate; therefore I can't evaluate it in terms of value for cost.  I was a little apprehensive because the Trip Advisor reviews were quite mixed, and a lot of people seemed very upset about the air-conditioning situation.  However, when we arrived in London the weather was moderate, and air conditioning was not really an issue (also, I took the advice of one Trip Advisor reviewer and opened the window at times).  I was very happy with this hotel and would try to stay here again.  My favorite aspect of it was the location, on a quiet street a short walk from the Green Park tube.  If you are a frequent Tube user, this stop is great--not only is it a straight shot from Heathrow (no changing lines), but it's on 3 lines and convenient to everywhere.  This location is also walking distance to many great places.  Our room and bathroom were newly redecorated and very pleasant and comfortable; no view from the window, but that was okay.  A large buffet-style Continental breakfast was included (with excellent pastries), and for just 2 pounds you could upgrade to a full cooked English breakfast (that rate is much higher at some other hotels, I believe) in addition to all the items from the buffet.  The staff was pleasant and helpful.  I made only one complaint during our stay, since our in-room electric teakettle had exposed coils that seemed strangely stained green; since we aren't used to this design of kettle in the U.S., I didn't know if it was safe.  A staff person came to our room within 5 minutes to assure us that the stains were just minerals, the coils were supposed to be exposed, and the kettle was safe.  She then replaced it anyway with a brand-new (unstained) kettle of a different design that looked more appetizing.  It was a minor matter, but I was very impressed with their quick response and eagerness to please (especially since it probably seemed like a ridiculous complaint to people who use these kettles all the time).  I was sorry when our time at this hotel was up, and would gladly stay here again.
",4,2006,08,27
144,great hotel,"Great location, friendly and very helpful staff, clean rooms and ample breakfasts included in the price which was booked through the Superbreak website on a per person basis. The price was less than half that quoted by the hotel direct. Central location and the Eye is an easy walk. If you want beer, nip round the corner to Shepherds market  where there are three pubs and several cheap bistros. If you are really on a budget, Tescos and M and S are a few hundred yards away!
",4,2006,07,31
144,Excellently located - rooms are a (bad) joke!,"I stayed at the FLemings Mayfair for two nights in early June on recommendation of a Travel Agent who found it in the Internet but had never been there herself. 
The Hotel is very pleasantly situated and nice to look at from outside. The Lobby is spacious and very clean, the adjacent ""Library"" is comfortable for reading a newspaper or meeting guests. My room was TINY! The AC did not work, but a transportable AC unit was provided which consumed most of the little space the room had to offer. Unfortunately that piece of equipment was not up to its task: it sucked in warm air from the court yard and delivered it to the room. It was one of the first summer days in London this year with outside temperature about 25°C/77°F. Inside the room it was considerably hotter and the air was very bad. I opened the window during the night because of the suffocating heat. However, there was a huge noisy beast of an AC engine in the court yard. Had I not thoughtfully brought a pair of ear plugs, I would not have gotten a wink of sleep.
Room and bathroom (also tiny) were very clean and pleasantly furnished, but they will not see me there again before they have solved the AC problem.
The staff was very friendly.
",2,2006,06,19
144,Expensive typical mayfair type hotel,"In summary, I would say the place is vastly overpriced for what it is.  150 pounds plus will get you a single room in which there is not much space.  It is a typical old Mayfair hotel and they all seem to have small rooms and charge a fortune for it!  The rooms have got aircon but it is fairly noisy and a huge 'roll around' unit.  The bar will cost you about 6 quid for a beer (bottle) so you might be better to use on the the local pubs.  Food is overpriced as well but the restaurant is pretty good.  I have been staying here for business reasons on and off for a few years now and I would say the bar has no life and is little frequented.  Money have obviously been spent on the hotel decor, etc with everything pretty top quality stuff... but it seems to have been spent for the sake of spening and is really not very practical.  The staff however are very helpful and couteous and the place is in a good location.  It is an upper end hotel but I would think you could do better within a short radius. 

I would have pretty similar things to say about the Hilton which is right opposite on Hlaf Moon Street.  Hope this helps.
",3,2006,06,18
144,Bad Business Hotel,"I stayed here in late May on a business trip but would not recommend the hotel.  The room was extremely small, even by European standards.  A very large air conditioner/air filter took up a lot of floor space.  There was no desk chair so it was impossible to work in the room.  I cancelled a wake up call but was called any way.  The dining room tables are so tiny it is impossible to read or work during breakfast.
",2,2006,05,31
144,"Small, clean but steamy hot room","I really liked the conciegre, Wiliam. The room was very compact  yet clean.  However the air conditioner spit out more hot air than was originally in room.  I called the front desk and they sent someone up.  He told me it needed to be on longer.  After day out the room was a sauna.  I turned it off and slept with the windows open.  Much better.  Also, my remote did not work with the TV.  The front desk was insistent that I wasn't operating it properly.  Finally the same man came up to my 4th floor room to tell me that my TV was the old kind and I couldn't view movies or many channels.  It's not brain surgery staff, the remotes and TVs do not respond.  Come on people get it straight!  The AC is more of a heater.  The TVs do NOT get movies or more than four or five channels.  Other than that it's a clean bed in a central area.  Consider this if booking and mention to staff that you read about the heat and TVS.
",2,2006,05,16
144,Won't be going back,"I was disappointed with this hotel, having done extensive research checking reviews, I can't say that mine will be very positive, and to be honest, I expected more from a 4star deluxe.
Our room was on the top floor and small, the bathroom was extremely compact but clean.  The bed was comfortable but we did expect more from the tea & coffee tray, they didn't top up the sugar and it lacked a complimentary packet of biscuits, a touch that many other hotels have.  
The TV remote control was unresponsive, and the teletext was infuriating as it wouldn't let you key in a page number or accept the colour buttons.
The room was hot, I know we have just had some warm days in London, but the air conditioning unit was noisy, we switched it off at night and had the window open, but being at the back of the hotel  we experienced a lot of noise from the street below.
The staff were pleasant and helpful although we did have an uncomforable moment with a waitress due to a language comunication problem in the restaurant over desserts.  
It was slightly annoying there only appeared to be one lift but it was interestingly decorated with a book shelf effect. My key card was barred twice meaning extra trips back to reception. One final thing that puzzled me, I often found the hotel to have a stale smokey air, especially in the foyer.
Although this hotel did have some beautiful features and some good points, I will be looking for anoher hotel next time I'm in London.
",3,2006,05,08
144,Pity about the heat!,"The hotel in general was very good and in an excellent situation for access to business/tourist areas. Staff were courteous & attentive. Buffet breakfast was OK but don't expect fried egg, only slimy scrambled. Our room was very compact but included most necessities. However, the shower was not the easiest to use mainly as it had a fixed shower head. Apparently the air conditioning is only working on the groundfloor at the moment. It is installed on other floors but we were told it will not be working until at least the summer (waiting for planning permission!) so we had to decide between be kept awake by the heat or by the noise from the open window!
",2,2006,04,25
144,"Excellent service, good location.","Whilst the room I had was very small and pretty dark (it was on the ground floor and at the back of the hotel) it was more than compensated for by the excellent service and standards of all other aspects of the hotel. The staff were very friendly and efficient, the breakfast was superb, the room rate reasonable and the whole place was spotless and quiet. Very close to Green Park tube, a short walk to Picadilly Circus and the West End.
",4,2006,04,23
144,Loved  Flemings,"We took our 12 year old grandson to london to show him historical London.  We stayed in Flemings Hotel in Greenpark.  The hotel was wonderful.  He certainly enjoyed it.  Rooms were very roomy and comfortable and very clean.

The breakfasts were very enjoyable.

Hotel was very central, few minutes from tube.  We could also walk to Picadilly circus.  We had a wonderful time.  He wants to return next year with his younger brother, and he said must stay in the same hotel.

144,"Lovely Hotel, Fantastic Location!!!","Well I absolutely loved this hotel.  The front desk staff were all extremely friendly and helpful.  Didn't really use concierge but he was always there with a smile and warm welcome!

Our room was great.  It was a good size with a king size bed and small seating area.  Remember rooms in the uk - especially cities (think New York) - are generally nowhere near the generous proportions many hotel rooms in USA can boast! The room was decorated to a very high standard and spotlessly clean.  Our room was on the ground floor, looking on to Clarges Street.  I was worried about potential noise when we first arrived, but thankfully we had no problems there whatsoever!

The breakfast was really nice, again staff friendly, although there was a severe amount of what appeared to be ""moaning"" between them.  However they were generally attentive (although not consistently!)

The biggest selling point to this hotel is location.  A pleasant 5 minute stroll brings you to Buckingham Palace, 5 minute walk along Piccadily brings you to Piccadily Circus then on to Soho/China Town.  15-20 minute walk to Trafalgar Square/Westminster. Oxford Street will take you again about 15-20 mins.  Everything is on your doorstep and a pleasant walk will take you anywhere!!

I would seriously recommend this hotel and as someone else said ""I would return in a heartbeat!"".",5,2006,03,06
144,Wonderful Hotel - Highly Recommended!,"I was recommended to use this hotel by some forum users on trip advisor.  What a great find!!! beautiful hotel with lovely rooms and service.  Modern but classic old touches - i loved all the mirrors in the lobby and the bookcase style lifts.  Even the service in the bar was great.  Would happily stay here again especially as we got a superb rate from hotel doorman.  My boyfriend was so pleased with my choice that he proposed!!!  Many thanks

144,Lovely,"Yes, the rooms are small.  However, they are new and very clean.  The hotel staff was a bit scattered with the exception of the sweet concierge, William.  This hotel is so centrally located it made travel quite easy.  I would stay there again in a heart beat, but make sure to have a quiet nights sleep I'll request a room in the back next time.  PS:  I saw a friends hotel room that was utterly dingy and depressing.  So even though their room was bigger at a different hotel it was a DUMP compared to my small yet lovely quarters.

144,"Tiny room, expensive, good location near Picadilly","I stayed there for two nights this week because I found myself in London at the last minute and wanted to be near Picadilly Circus.  This was the closest I could find and took a chance based upon the reviews on Trip advisor.  The location was ideal, around the corner from Picadilly street, green park tube stop, restaurants and even starbucks and a 5 minute walk to picadilly circus.  The room I got was the smallest room I have ever been in in London after repeat visits all over the city.  It was nicely appointed and all with a twin bed, which honestly left no room on the floor for a suitcase, there were literally 8 inches between the end of the bed and the dresser and that was all.  Even the front door did not open all the way because of an oversized chair that partially blocked that door and the door to the bathroom from opening all the way.  We ae talking tiny.  Had I not slept with my suitcase on the bed, there would be no way out of the room in the event of a fire.  Free hard wired internet that did not work when I got there but it was just  unplugged, no help from the clueless bellman who wss sent up to look at it.  The room did not have controlled temperature, rather a large standalone blower that blocked part of the one corner and needed to be on all the time to properly ventilate the room I believe. it was rether loud also.  The room wass 144 pounds per night, on the high side of average for central london.  The clincher was at checkout.  I had called and asked that my bill be prepared as I had a tight flight at the end of rushhour/  I got down to reception and it was ready. they had charged 9.68 pounds for one 3 minute call - which is today $16.80 US, when I asked about this I was told that the call was to a cell phone in London and therefore used that many units.  I did not dispute that further but seems quite high to me, even in new york standards.  From that time to when the clerk finally ran and handed me my bill was ten minutes, I know this because the taxi was out front waiting.  I do not know what took her so long...... I probably would not bo back there due to tiny room, cost for calls, and just not quite right on the little things.

144,Perfect Hotel in Mayfair London,"Just returned from five nights at Flemings Mayfair London and have nothing but the highest recommendation. First of all, the staff...Simon, William, Michel made our trip so special from the first moment we walked into the lovely hotel lobby. The rooms were nicely sized and the bathrooms were fantastic. Breakfast was incredibly awesome and included in the room rate. 
The beds were so comfortable, though we didn't spend much time there!
To sum it up, a lovely trip to London was made even more beautiful by the Flemings Mayfair.

144,Compact yet charming - a hotel with personality,"Needing a room for a single night stay, I booked Flemings Mayfair on the day of my arrival in London. I had heard the hotel was good, but as I paid such a low rate, I was concerned I would be accommodated in a tiny cupboard of a room. However, this wasn't the case. Whilst the room I had was compact, it was cleverly so, and absolutely ideal for my needs. I feel like I got the bargain of the day. The facilities were excellent, the staff perhaps a little over-attentive for my liking, and the location just off Piccadilly was excellent. If I had paid full rate I may have been disappointed, but it was tremendous value at the bargain rate that I got, and it was so lovely to stay somewhere charming rather than somewhere that is just functional. It has real personality, something that seems to be very rare these days.

144,Nice Mayfair Hotel for Business Travelers,"My husband and I stayed several nights at the Flemings Mayfair twice in the past year (Sept 2004 and April 2005).  The hotel was recently renovated and modernized, and the lobby and all of the rooms have been tastefully decorated in a sleek modern style.  The 18th century building is charming, though it has some unavoidable drawbacks, like winding hallways and smaller rooms.  The bathrooms in both rooms we stayed in are large and gorgeous.  Robes are provided for guests. Internet access through the flat screen TV has also been installed, though we needed the staff to set it up in our room before use. The staff at the front desk is very professional and helpful.  

The hotel is on a quiet street just off of Picadilly and 2 blocks from the Green Park tube station.  That makes it a very convienent location to combine sightseeing, shopping and business.  Just around the corner is charming Shepherds Market which has several cafes, bars and upscale restaurants.  It is a comfortable area to stay in for frequent travelers.  

This hotel is not cheap, so if you are a tourist I'm sure there are lots of alternative locations and prices.  However, for business traveler's in the overwhelmingly expensive and ritzy Mayfair district, this hotel is priced right for the value.  We look forward to return stays at the Flemings Mayfair.

144,Don't stay here!  Please read this review!,"The hotel was a trojan horse, pretty on the outside, horrible on the inside.  The staff was unbelievably incompetent and it would take me too long to list all of the problems.  They kept trying, but ended up failing each time.  The only pluses are the location and the breakfast room, here is an overview:

1. Asked for a quiet room not on the street or near an elevator.  The first two times they gave me the above, it took an hour to get a room.

2. Woke me up an hour early the day I was leaving, 4:45 AM!

3. Alex the concierge gave me bad info on museum openings, etc. and I ended up missing out on some activities.  William, the head concierge was better.

4. Room was tiny, 4 channels of TV, no movie video on demand, no high speed Internet, couldn't get to my e-mail through a dial up connection, no clocks in any of the rooms.

5. Asked for a list of health food stores.  Got a list but was told the best was on a huge street in another section of London and to just go there, I should be able to find it as they didn't have the phone number or exact address!  In checking with a taxi driver, he said that I never would have found it as the street is several miles long.

6. Asked for a power converter for 110 volts for my laptop.  They brought up the wrong one the first two times.

We will be staying again.

144,Great Hotel,"Great Hotel.  Excellent lcoation.  We stayed here in July.  If you're there in the summer make sure you get a room with air conditioning.  Breakfast is great.

144,Family Reunion Was a Hit,"Spent four nights here with my family...8 rooms, so I feel good writing this review. The rooms were fine. By British standards, they are average in size, some with slightly larger sitting areas, with love seats, chairs, minibars and tv's. Our queen bed was fine. The bathroom is small, but adequate. My parents were in in Room 67, I believe, which was a suite. It was wonderful. Two of the 8 rooms had poor air conditioning units, and I commented on this in a survey before checking out. The English breakfast was fine, although the bacon and eggs were slightly undercooked by American standards.  My three teenage children and three teenage nieces and nephews loved the hotel. The staff was very nice. We spent a few evenings in the bar and would recommend this to readers.  Our rooms were clean and so were the bathrooms. I've stayed at the London Conrad, Hazzlitts, and lived in the City a year in college. This is a wonderful hotel. The location is great for walkers and joggers, just across from Green Park, and not far from Hyde Park.  There are several neat pubs within 300 meters from the hotel. There are also several nice places for inexpensive lunches close by on Shephard's Lane, too. I'd stay here again in a flash. The negative reviews below wouldn't stop me from rebooking here. I would try to negotiate a rate below the current 169 pound room rate,however.

144,not worth the money,My mum and I stayed here last year and I have to say that it one of the worst hotels I have ever stayed in.  We arrived early about 10am and were told that the room would be ready at 2pm but we could leave our bags.  So we hit the shops only to come back at 3pm to be told our room was still not ready!  At 5pm they allowed us to have a key to the worlds most smallest twin room I have ever seen.  Only one person could walk around at any one time it was that small the beds were pushed so close together.  The bathroom was a joke.  The only good thing about this hotel was the location.  The staff are unhelpful and rude and I for one will never return!,2,2004,05,06
144,Great location - friendly staff,"We stayed at the Flemings Mayfair from 19 April - 23 April 2004. 

The positives: terrific location, only 2 blocks from the Green Park tube, easy and very pleasant walk through Green and St. James Parks to Buckingham Palace, very convenient for the West End (either by a long walk or by tube). We found all the staff to be quite friendly and helpful. Our room was comfortable, two twin beds (as requested) with a small sitting area. Fine bathroom, though the tub was very deep, use the handles! Plenty of hot water. Never a problem or long wait with the 1 elevator.

Disappointments: buffet breakfast is only a cold breakfast and selection dwindles very quickly. Housekeeping was spotty, especially with the bathroom. Some used towels not replaced, just re-folded. Curtains could have used a vacuuming (very dusty). Maintenance glitch - floor lamp didn't have a bulb. We didn't mind only 5 TV channels, some would. Surprisingly loud street noise, soundproofing not great.

We would stay at the Flemings Mayfair again if we had our size room or larger, though we won't book the buffet breakfast package.",4,2004,04,29
144,"Good Location, Lousy Room","I stayed here in April 2004. I got a last minute deal through a well known website, so only paid £55 per night, instead of the rack rate of £169 for a single. Had I paid the full rate, I would have demanded my money back. In order to get to the room, I had to negotiate a labyrinth of hallways and stairs. Thankfully, I only had one bag with me. The room itself was small and stuffy, with a single bed. I was able to open the window, but never got it to close again. The street outside, was surprisingly noisy, so I ended up switching on the airconditioning to create some white noise, and cool the room down a bit. I was unable to double lock the door, which resulted in a maid coming into my room without knocking, even though I had the ""do not disturb"" in place. Not all toiletries were replenished on a daily basis, and the washcloth that was there when I arrived, was never replaced. In order to get to the safe in the wardrobe, I had to move the television. There was no minibar and the pay tv option wasn't available. There were only 4 channels, plus CNN. There was only one elevator, and that was broken on one of the days I stayed there. The location of this hotel is excellent, but I wouldn't consider it to be 4 star.",2,2004,04,13
144,"Flemings Mayfair Hotel, Great Location","Clean, fashionable and what a convenient location. Just one-half block off of Picadilly Circle (so not noisy) and one block to Green Park Station (London Underground). It is also one block from the Ritz Hotel which is a pick-up place for any bus tours, the Hop-on, Hop-off bus or the Evans-Evans tours which take day trips outside of London (ie, Stonehedge, Warwick Castle). The price includes breakfast and the concierge(s) are just jumping at the chance to answer any questions you may have. I would stay here again but only if I had some sort of airfare-hotel deal. The board behind reception said it was 269 pounds/night for a double so it is only affordable if your stay is bundled up in some sort of package deal.",4,2004,03,03
144,We loved it!,I have just returned from a 5 day stay at Flemings with my mother and my 13 year old son. We were given a large twin room with a pull out couch on which I slept quite comfortably. The bathroom was clean and spacious and the buffet breakfast was just lovely. The staff were extremely pleasant and always welcome to answer any queries. We had booked as a package through Virgin Vacations so our breakfast inclusive room rate was astonishing low. We had done a similar but lower priced Virgin package last year at the Barkston Gardens but the small incremental price for Flemings was well worth the investment.,5,2004,03,03
144,We didn't stay!,"After reading the great reviews of the Flemings, we thought we had discovered a ""find"". We arrived late at night after our trans-Atlantic flight. The lobby of the hotel put me on guard. It was very tired looking and not particularly clean. We were escorted up the elevator and down a long, long hall (which got dirtier the further we went) to the end where two rooms were opened for us. They both were VERY cramped. The furniture was mismatched, old, and some actually broken. 
The lock on one door did not work, it's window opened to an air shaft, the heat was blazing and there was no way to turn it down or A.C.. The other room was equally shabby. It's heat was a large,stand-alone unit on the floor that was very loud. The bathroom stank of urine. My husband went back down to the front desk to ask for different rooms - there were none. I made calls to other hotels and got a reservation at 47 Park Street. We left. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone. It is too expensive to be this poorly maintained.",1,2004,01,19
144,Lovely Apartment,"My wife and I, together with our teenage daughter and a friend stayed at No. 13 Half Moon Street for 6 nights over New Years. Our penthouse apartment (2 BR, 2 1/2 baths) was lovely. The apartment was quite comfortable, the kitchen was nicely outfitted and the overall setting was wonderful. Set on a quiet street in Mayfair, near to the tube and to wonderful shopping, we could not have been more pleased with our choice. We have stayed at many first class hotels around the world and our apartment at No. 13 did not disappoint.",5,2004,01,04
144,Fantastic!,"I love this hotel. The Flemings Mayfair is definitely my choice when staying in London. It's location is fantastic, only a couple minutes walk from Green Park tube station; and Mayfair is a splendid area just to waltz around and do a little bit of window shopping (and starbucks!). The staff are absolutely lovely; you cannot fault them. 
Very friendly, helpful, and will go out of their way to help you. I have visited a couple times this year and the rooms I had were comfortable and clean and a place I feel I could relax. My only bad point would be the hotel bar....around £4 for a Cola!?! Would definitely visit again.",5,2003,12,31
144,"Lovely hotel, lovely location!",Stayed at the Flemmings Mayfair hotel April 2002 with my husband. A fantastically located hotel in probably the nicest area of London-just off Picadilly. The nightlife of Soho and Theatreland is a 20-25 minute walk away and Oxford street is about 15 minutes walk away. Green Park is the nearest tube station a few minutes walk away and there are a few small supermarkets within the vicinity for snacks/drinks etc. There is a Hard Rock Cafe a few minutes walk away on Picadilly. Hotel appears to be small but cosy as you walk into the reception area. A porter assists you with your luggage and the lift if required. We had an executive room which was surprisingly small but clean. Decorated in yellow and blue with a small double bed and a sofa plus a nice white and black tiled bathroom with bathrobes. I have to say the bathroom was quite dirty with mould on the tiles and the pipes at the back of the sink and toilet were rusty.,4,2003,11,11
144,A wonderful hotel!,"My sister and I stayed in an apartment at 13 Half Moon Street, a part of the Flemings Mayfair hotel. It was unbelievably wonderful. The apartment was beautifully decorated and everything about the apartment was top notch. From the fresh flowers, basket of fruit and breakfast provisions, they looked after us in a way that we both loved.

We stayed there for three days in early September, 2003, and then two more nights in early October. It was our favorite place to stay in all of England. The staff is wonderful and was extremely accommodating. We got good rates on the two bedroom, two bath apartment with living room and kitchen--keep looking for specials as they can be found. Ask for apartment 704--it's just lovely.",5,2003,10,09
144,fleming mayfair hotel,"my wife and I just got back from a trip to London. We used to go on a fairly regular basis, but have not been back for approximately 5 years. I checked internet sites this time and discovered the Fleming Mayfair Hotel off of Picadilly Street and five minutes away from the Green Park Tube station. It was an excellent choice. The room was large with a sitting area with sofa, table and chair, plus tv. The bed was a double. The bathroom was nicely appointed. Very smart lobby and commen areas for all guests. The breakfast, which was included with our room rate of 99 pounds per nights was of the highest standard, english breakfast, plus buffet. Our room faced the street which was ok with us, but we live in a city. So street noice even with double glazed windows, book the rear room in the hotel.",4,2003,02,04

144,Not a real 5 star,"The hotel is well looked after, especially in the common areas, but honestly it would be an excellent 4 star, not 5 star.
The service is taken care of up to a certain point, the room is really small for €450 per night. Few benefits (no spa - no bar open all the time - afternoon tea only in a very short period of time), friendly staff but nothing exciting. The location is excellent, but everything else isn't 5 star for me.",2,2024,01,03
144,Poor English organisation,"Excellent location but the hotel is not up to the standard of a hotel in central London. Few services.
Bathroom without window and without ventilation. Distracted staff. It's not worth 400.00 Euros per night, sorry.",3,2023,10,30
144,Best hotel in London,"The hotel has a great location, one minute from Green Park with Buckingham Palace, lots of nice restaurants and shopping streets everywhere. The staff under the German management of Henrik Mühle is excellent. And then there is the breakfast, simply delicious and a great buffet.",5,2023,09,13
144,"Süßes, kleines Hotel mit einer der besten Lagen in London","Wir waren für einige Tage in London. Ich bevorzuge dafür eine Unterkunft in Mayfair. mMn könnte die Lage kaum besser sein. Ca. 4 Min. zu Fuß zum Buckingham Palace, direkt an Berkeley Square, New Bond und Regent und Oxford Street sind in untermittelbaren Nähe. Harrods ca. 20 Min. zu Fuß, Piccadilly Circus ca. 10 Min. zu Fuß, was will man also mehr?

Wir hatten eine Studio Suite (#207). Diese ist sehr groß, allerdings im Wohnraum mMn etwas „lieblos“. Die Materialien sind jedoch sehr hochwertig und das Badezimmer hat mir sehr gut gefallen. Es gibt aber bestimmt noch schönere Suiten, wir hatten nur extra eine Suite auf der selben Etage mit unseren Freunden gewünscht, deswegen lag es wahrscheinlich an diesem Wunsch.
Suite hat drei Fenster zur Straße, welche sich öffnen lassen. Lärm ist gar kein Problem, da es eine ruhige Seitenstraße ist.

Der Service und die Gastfreundschaft war auch gut und höflich, leider haben wir nur keine Einweisung in unsere Suite bekommen und nicht alle Mitarbeiter hatten das selbe Service-Niveau.

Die Bar ist sehr schön, die Drinks waren super lecker. Leider hat diese für meinen Geschmack viel zu früh zu.

Das Ormer haben wir nicht besucht.

Ansonsten fehlt dem Hotel mMn leider ein „besserer“ Aufenthaltsraum. Klar, man kann z. B. im Drawing Room was trinken, aber irgendwie gibt es keine Karte und es wirkt eher so, als würde man stören, wenn man dort was ordert. Es gibt im Hotel leider keine Möglichkeit mal um 21.00 Uhr noch kleine „Snacks“ a la Burger oder ähnliches zu bestellen. Sehr schade.

Ansonsten muss man sagen, ist das Hotel schon toll und süß. Klein und verwinkelt und hochwertig.
Auch der Preis ist für diese Lage und Qualität eher angemessen für London.",4,2023,02,18
144,Wiederholte Begeisterung,"Auch dieses Mal haben wir die Wahl dieses wunderbaren stilvollen Boutique Hotels nicht bereut. Die Lage ist natürlich unschlagbar. Die Zimmer sind stilvoll und sehr gepflegt.  Personal sehr freundlich und hilfsbereit. Hatten zum Frühstück perfekte Eggs Benedict.

144,Enttäuschend,"Das Hotel entspricht überhaupt nicht einem 5-Sterne-Hotel. Unser Zimmer ist alt und abgewohnt. Das Bad ebenso. Das Schlimmste aber ist das Bett, denn das ist nur 150 cm breit. Man bat uns tatsächlich gegen den „kleinen“ Aufpreis von 80 Pfund pro Nacht ein Upgrade auf ein ebenso abgewohntes Zimmer, das allerdings größer war und ein 180 cm bereits Bett hatte. Gerade haben wir erfahren, dass wir auch nicht das volle Frühstück bekommen, sondern nur das magere continental breakfast!! Bei dem Preis einfach nur ein Witz!!! Das einzig Positive ist, dass wir wirklich zeitig aufs Zimmer kamen, da ich starke Kopfschmerzen hatte. Das war nett. Insgesamt ist das Personal recht freundlich, aber Ausstattung und Qualität sind angesichts des hohen Preises überhaupt nicht angemessen.",2,2019,12,06
144,Tolles Hotel mit super Lage,"Das Flemings Mayfair bietet einen exzellenten Service. Gute Lage und eine top Ausstattung. Mein Zimmer war modern und mit Charme eingerichtet und war sehr sauber. Das gesamte Personal war zuvorkommend und alles verlief reibungslos. Das Frühstück war super und ein großes Lob an Maria und ihr Team für den hervorragenden Service beim Frühstück. Ich kann dieses Hotel ruhigen Gewissen weiterempfehlen. Ein kleiner Tip noch zur Zimmerwahl, man sollte lieber die oberen Etagen Belegen da man im Erdgeschoss von der U-Bahn wach gehalten wird , die unter dem Hotel verläuft.",5,2019,11,28
144,Bene ma non benissimo ,"Lascio 4 stelle perché un albergo bellino a Londra a due passi dal centro e dalla metro di solito costa il doppio, però va detto che la mia camera era davvero ma davvero micro, mentre la doccia era nella vasca, a getto fisso e si allagava dopo 3 secondi. Poi mettono gli uscieri all’ingresso e ti propongono una candela ricordo a .... 39 sterline ....",4,2019,11,14
144,Un boutique hotel nel cuore di Londra,"Il Flemings Mayfair è un boutique hotel, piccolo ma estremamente curato. Si trova di fronte a Green Park e a soli 200m dalla stazione della metropolitana e alla fermata dei famosi bus rossi. Il personale è super cortese, ti accolgono con un sorriso, con gentilezza e professionalità. Pulizia impeccabile. Colazione continentale ottima.  ",5,2019,09,01
144,L’arte dell’accoglienza ,"Quando una struttura alberghiera ti fa sentire benvenuto, coccolato e speciale, ha raggiunto il suo obbiettivo.
Il Flemings Mayfair è un delizioso piccolo hotel situato proprio di fronte a green park. Tutto è a pochi passi, letteralmente. 
L’hotel è curato in ogni piccolo particolare, gli spazi comuni sono deliziosi e la stanza (un po’ piccola a dirla tutta) è molto bella e confortevole, con un bagno eccellente.
Cosa dire del personale? Dal momento che ci si avvicina all’ingresso a quello in cui si lascia la struttura si ha la sensazione che tutti ti stessero aspettando e siano lì per prendersi cura di te. Tutti sorridono e si mettono a disposizione dal l’accoglienza alla reception al consierge al personale del ristorante. Non si può chiedere di più.
Pulizia al top e servizi eccellenti.
La stazione Green Park della metropolitana (Piccadilly line e jubilee line) è a 200 metri e con la Piccadilly Line si va direttamente in aeroporto senza cambiare.
Unico piccolo neo, i treni della metropolitana so sentono passare ai piani bassi (noi eravamo al primo). Magari una stanza a un piano più alto risolve questo problema.
Colazione a buffet e a la carte. Tutto molto buono.
Fatevi un regalo e trascorrete qualche giorno in questo hotel.",5,2019,08,22
144,Affascinate in piccole dimensioni,"Consiglio questo hotel per chi ha buon gusto e vuole stare in una struttura più piccola.

Manca la spa ma a pochi passi ce ne sono di molto belle.",5,2019,08,19

Das Personal sehr nett, manchmal ein wenig übereifrig, aber sehr aufmerksam.

144,"Bellezza e comfort con molte luci, ma qualche ombra","A Londra per lavoro ho soggiornato in questo piccolo hotel in zona Mayfair ricavandone una impressione nel complesso più che soddisfacente, ma scoprendone anche qualche punto debole. Tra i lati positivi la cortesia del personale alla reception, la comodità del letto, la qualità degli arredi, della biancheria e delle spugne, la disponibilità di un wifi velocissimo, macchina per caffè espresso in cialde, acqua e biscotti gratuiti, climatizzazione silenziosa ed efficiente. Giudizio negativo per la doccia (il soffione nella vasca con la paretina di vetro non è il massimo della comodità), l’accesso alla camera (raggiungibile solo attraversando il bar con porte pesanti da aprire e spazi ristretti, non ottimale con i bagagli al seguito) e la sua rumorosità (affacciata sull’esterno con via vai di personale con carrellini per smaltire vetro e rifiuti vari alle 3 di notte.....probabilmente sono stato solo un po’ sfortunato nell’assegnazione).",4,2019,02,27

Mit ein paar schönen Möbeln und Accessoires ist es nicht getan. Der Service ist medioker und nicht einem 5 Sterne Haus würdig. Das Restaurant befindet sich im Basement, praktisch ohne Tageslicht. Der Concierge bemüht sich freundlich zu sein, aber er ist es nicht wirklich. Nicht dass er den Job nicht erledigen würde, nein, aber er gibt einem das Gefühl als würde man stören.

Alla reception ho chiesto se il 24 dicembre a loro risultava aperto il Museo di Storia e mi è stato detto di sì quando in realtà era chiuso. Scadente anche la colazione. 
Per la prima volta mi son sentita dire che le camere il giorno di Natale non sarebbero state rifatte in quanto il personale non era in servizio trattandosi per l’appunto del 25 dicembre. Essendo stato il primo Natale trascorso a Londra non so se sia abitudine del paese. Nelle altre capitali mai mi sono sentita rispondere così.

144,Maximal 3 Sterne,"Wir sind erst heute in diesem angeblichen 5 Sterne Hotel angekommen, es ist eine Katastrophe!! Wir haben schon viele 5 Sterne Hotels in unserem Leben besucht, auch in London, aber das Prädikat „Small Luxury Hotel“ ist ein absoluter Witz, das einzige was stimmt ist „small“!
Wir haben zwar nur ein Classic Doppelzimmer gebucht da sonst nichts frei war, aber trotzdem kann man für rd. 350,-€ die Nacht in einem 5-Sterne Haus einen gewissen Grundstandard erwarten, der ist aber in diesem Hotel in keiner Form gegeben, zumindest nicht in den Zimmern die wir gesehen haben, das Bad in unserem ersten Zimmer war verkeimt, Schimmel überall, die Armaturen verrostet und alles in einem ekelhaften Zustand, die Größe des Bades ist ein schlechter Witz, zu zweit könnte man sich dort weder aufhalten noch bewegen....unglaublich!!
Nach unserer Beschwerde hat man sich zwar entschuldigt und uns zwei andere Zimmer der gleichen Kategorie gezeigt, aber da hat jede mittelmäßige Jugendherberge ein besseres Bad zu bieten!! Wir haben dann ein anderes Zimmer ausgesucht wo das Bad nicht ganz so verkeimt war und einen kleinen Tick größer, dieses Zimmer war dann mit Blick auf den Innenhof und ein wunderschönes riesiges Kühlaggregat das es uns unmöglich gemacht hat mit offenen Fenstern zu schlafen, der Lärm war wie an der Autobahn!!
Mehr als wir bisher gesehen brauchen wir auch gar nicht mehr zu sehen, es ist alles eine Frechheit für diesen Standard so viel Geld zu verlangen, außer der sehr guten Lage hat das Hotel nichts zu bieten, dies kann auch in unseren Augen nur der einzige Grund sein, dass hier überhaupt jemand übernachtet!
Bitte nie wieder !!",2,2018,06,25

Der Service beim Frühstück war ausgesprochen aufmerksam und nett. 
Bei einem Aufenthalt im Sommer würde ich versuchen, ein Zimmer zur Straße zu bekommen. Die Lütungsanlage im Hof lärmt schon ganz schön - Schlafen bei offenem Fenster wäre nicht angenehm. Aber vielleicht ist das in der Lage auch zu viel erwartet. Das sonstige Ambiente verführt halt zu solchen Ideen.",4,2018,03,15
144,Un buen hotel,"Excelente hotel con un cuidado servicio y excelente desayuno y cena. Una lastima que el sistema de agua caliente de la ducha estuviese estropeado ya que en intervalos cortos se convertía en fría, por lo demás todo perfecto y muy amables todo el servicio del hotel.",5,2018,02,28
144,"Hotel di nicchia, delizioso","Hotel di nicchia, delizioso. Camere molto piccole, ben attrezzate. Ottimo letto. Bagno piccolo, ma pulito e ben organizzato. Servizio discreto, direi che il concierge potrebbe essere più attento. Check in veloce.",4,2018,01,21
144,Stilvoll in perfekter Lage,"Wir haben in der ersten Januar Woche leider nur eine Nacht in diesem wunderbaren
Boutique Hotel in London Mayfair gewohnt. 
Es besteht aus mehreren Stadthäusern die liebevoll und stilvoll zu einem Hotel
geformt worden. Die Lage unmittelbar am Green Park könnte besser nicht sein.
Ob zu Covent Garden oder Knightsbridge, Oxford Street oder Soho, die beliebtesten
Viertel sind in kurzer Laufnähe. Trotzdem ist die Lage ruhig und sehr gepflegt.
Alles ist mit exquisiten Geschmack und sehr individuell eingerichtet.
Die Atmosphäre war sehr herzlich und freundlich, keine steife Atmosphäre.
Die perfekte Wahl wenn man gerne 5 Sterne mäßig wohnt, aber einem
die Luxusketten zu unpersönlich sind.
Wir hatten eine wunderschöne Suite in einem unverwechselbaren und hochwertigen Stil.
Freunde die mit uns reisten hatten eine ganz anders eingerichtet Suite, aber ebenfalls 
wunderschön und stilvoll. Hier hat man wohl für jedes Zimmer ein ganz individuelles
 Aussehen kreiert. Das Restaurant hatte leider noch Pause, aber wir konnten das Frühstück einnehmen. Ich hatte Egg Benedict, perfekt wie sie sein müssen!

Gerne kommen wir wieder, dann hoffentlich etwas länger.!!",5,2018,01,08
144,Die Sonne lacht auf der Half Moon Street,"Kleines, sehr angenehmes Haus. Der Service war gut und sehr persönlich, stets freundlich. Gutes Frühstück. Saubere gepflegte Zimmer mit guter Ausstattung.
Die Lage ist sehr zentral und dennoch ruhig. Aus unserer Sicht blieben keine Wünsche offen.",5,2017,11,28
144,Perfetto,"Mi capita di essere spesso a Londra per lavoro e soggiorno sempre in quest’albergo, particolarmente comodo,  data la posizione  centralissima (Mayfair, fermata della metro Green Park).
Allo stesso tempo, la via in cui è situato (Half Moon Street) è una traversa di Piccadilly Str., tranquilla e silenziosa.
Molto cozy, è stato recentemente ristrutturato e ammodernato, ma rimane sempre un piccolo albergo accogliente. C’è anche una dependance di fianco al corpo principale dell’albergo (al n. 13) in cui mi piace particolarmente soggiornare perché sembra proprio di essere a casa.  
Le camere sono dotate di ogni confort (c'è anche il ferro da stiro!) e il personale è gentile ma mai asfissiante.
Prezzi in linea con la zona e il livello dell’albergo (intorno a € 250 a notte). Ultimamente ho optato per eliminare la prima colazione dal pacchetto. 
Preferisco farla in uno dei caffè della zona, con notevole risparmio.",5,2017,11,04
144,Hermoso hotel con personal super amable,"El hotel es muy bello, excelentemente ubicado, a pocas cuadras de Piccadilly y de Buckingham Palace. Las habitaciones son algo pequeñas por el precio, pero la atencion es buenisima. El personal de recepcion es muy amable, y el room service tambien. El desayuno continental es de buena calidad, y el personal, de nuevo, muy amable y servicial. Fue una grata experiencia y sin dudas volveria a elegirlo.",4,2017,11,02
144,Una pena y un mal trago,"Este hotel podría haberlo calificado como el mejor hotel en que me he hospedado, y puedo decir que viajo habitualmente entre tres y cuatro veces al año y elijo hoteles de similares características.
El grave incidente que baja mi calificación fuertemente es el siguiente hecho: siempre hago compras on line antes de mi llegada; en ese caso, cuando me entregaron los paquetes un ítem de alto valor faltaba a pesar de que había sido entregado en mano al personal del hotel. Al comunicar lo ocurrido no sentí que el hecho les resultara relevante. Todo lo que recibí es un “Im sorry” del guests Manager.
En fin...",2,2017,10,16
144,Not so good ,"Sono stato ospite in questo bell’hotel londinese
Peccato che la mia camera non fosse all’ altezza delle stelle dell’ hotel in particolare il bagno sporco e obsoleto
Non capisco come una catena seria come SLH permetta queste cose

144,Excelente hotel en una magnífica ubicación,"Es la segunda vez que me alojo en Flemings Mayfair. Es un hotel muy conveniente, céntrico, limpio, cómodo, bonito y con personal amable.
El desayuno es variado y bueno.  Las habitaciones modernas y muy cómodas.
Repetiremos en nuestra próxima visita a Londres.",5,2017,09,27
144,Hotel boutique normal ,"Es un hotel pequeño sin grandes salones y con muy diferentes tipos de habitaciones. El desayuno continental es fabuloso y más que suficiente como para pagar el extra. La habitación 604 está en un edificio anexo típicamente inglés pero para mi gusto con encanto aunque sea un rollo salir a la calle para ir a desayunar. La zona es Mayfair que decir aunque la calle es bastante fea y desagradable 
En fin para lo que cuesta si es con oferta está bien para ser Londres",4,2017,09,11

144,Lindísimo,"Gran opción para parar en Londres.  Volví después de muchos años y me encontré con un hotel completamente renovado.  Para mí la ubicación es inmejorable cerca de restaurantes, negocios y medios de transportes.  Los apartamentos son un lujo, muy bien decorados y equipados y además se tiene la sensación de no estar dentro de un hotel.  La atención del personal es impecable y muy buen desayuno.",5,2017,07,20

144,Afternoon Tea im Flemings Mayfair,"Zu jedem London Besuch gehört seit Jahren ein Afternoon Tea. Zum ersten Mal waren wir dazu im Flemings Mayfair und wir waren begeistert. Viele Locations geben- ob der großen Nachfrage- mittlerweile eine Verweildauer von 1 Stunde. Man hat dann das Gefühl, gleich wird einem der Stuhl weggezogen. Ganz anders im Flemings. Der ""Drawing Room"" bietet ein angenehmes Ambiente. Die Bedienung ist liebenswürdig und hilfsbereit. Der Knaller sind allerdings die kleinen Schweinereien, die zur Verköstigung kommen: Leckere Sandwiches, herrliche  Zutaten zu den Scones und die besten Petit Fours, die wir je in London bekommen haben....sehr empfehlenswert",5,2017,06,26
144,"Hotel tradicional, elegante para visitar el centro de Londres","Hotel antiguo, elegante, con habitaciones modernas re-modeladas, de buen tamaño, y tranquilo, sin ruidos. Tiene buena ubicación para visitar caminando el centro de Londres, sus principales atracciones, parques y lugares de compras. Buena conexión WiFi en las habitaciones.
Personal muy atento y conocedores de la ciudad. El desayuno incluido es continental, de buena variedad, pero si quieres el ""desayuno inglés"" con huevos slachichas etc hay que pagar extra. Tener en cuenta que en esta fecha hay muchos alergenicos, polen etc, en los parques, así es que hay que tenerlo en cuenta, ya que son parques muy bonitos y hay que visitarlos.",5,2017,06,04
144,"Klein, aber fein","Schön renoviertes Boutiquehotel mit aufmerksamem und freundlichem Personal. Zimmer schön und geräumig. Badezimmer mit Schlauch- und Regendusche. Nette Details in Ausstattung. Sehr zentral gelegen und doch ruhig!

Preislich eher stolz, aber dank Corporate Rate für mich im Rahmen.",4,2017,06,01
144,Hotel correcto en el centro de Londres,"Me alojé a finales de Abril con mi marido y mi hija de 7 meses. La habitación correcta, de tamaño no muy grande pero suficiente; nos tenían ya preparada la cuna para el bebé a la llegada. El baño con suelo radiante y precioso, con una ducha muy agradable y amplia y amenities de olor spa de alta calidad. 
El desayuno continental de surtido no muy amplio pero con productos de buena calidad ( pan y mantequilla holandesa exquisita). Lo único mejorable el zumo de naranja, pero que para ser Londres no estaba nada mal; y la bollería que me llamó la atención por ser algo seca. En la sala de desayunos hace fresco, al igual que en los pasillos del hotel. 
El personal del hotel muy agradable y servicial, ademas de muy numeroso. 
El único incidente y con el que ya contaba por haber leído algún comentario por aquí fue que intentaron cobrarnos un extra por servicios en la factura final; pero al ver que no me cuadraban los números el chico me dijo amablemente que si quería lo retiraba de la factura porque solo era opcional... la verdad me parece un detalle de muy mal gusto en un hotel de esta categoría y que no queda muy elegante. ",4,2017,05,13
144,qualità /prezzo scarsa,"L'albergo  è carino in una posizione centrale, di fianco a Piccadilly street, abbastanza pulito anche se non abbastanza e non nei particolari.
A mio avviso  caro per il tipo di albergo. Pensavo che le camere fossero più grandi e il servizio migliore. Per il prezzo che abbiamo pagato pensavo meglio.
Ho trovato anche un capello nella teiera in camera.
Nessuno che parlasse italiano in reception.",3,2017,05,01
144,Ideal für Familien,"Das Hotel Flemings befindet sich in Mayfair, 2 min von der Underground Green Park und wenige Minuten vom Buckingham Palace entfernt. 
Wir hatten das 2-Bedroom-Appartement, das neben den beiden Schlafzimmern auch 2 Bäder, 1 Toilette, eine voll ausgestattete Küche und ein Wohnzimmer hat. Alle Räume sind eher klein aber gepflegt und sauber. 
Die Bar ist sehr gut geführt und empfehlenswert. Das Restaurant hat sogar einen Michelin Stern. Wie in England üblich, werden die Gänge sehr schnell hintereinander serviert, was gewöhnungsbedürftig ist. 
Alles in allem ein sehr gutes Hotel. ",4,2017,03,20
144,Mi hanno rubato una borsa in camera,"Per lavoro ho soggiornato in questo hotel dal 20 gen al 1 feb. Sarebbe stato tutto perfetto: hotel carino, confortevole, continental breakfast discreta, per me comodo agli uffici peccato che mi sia sparita una borsa di Borbonese del valore di ca. 200 euro da dentro la valigia! Segnalato il malcapitato all'hotel tante belle parole di scuse e telefonate di circostanza, ma neanche un cenno ad un minimo sconto come risarcimento. Certamente capisco... la mia parola contro la loro. Considerando che sono stata lì 13 notti e che la mia azienda ha portato negli stessi giorni al Fleming's altre 30 persone, almeno una complimentary night avrebbero potuto omaggiarla. E invece, mi avevano anche addebitato del mini bar che non avevo mai consumato! 
Quindi, hotel carino, ma ATTENZIONE rovistano nelle valigie e provano ad addebitarti qualcosa in più che non hai consumato!",1,2017,02,02

144,Raffinato,"Per un week end con mia sorella ho prenotato una exécutive. La camera e il bagno me li aspettavo più grandi, però veramente bella curata e elegante.
Tutto l'albergo è estremamente elegante e curato nel dettaglio dell'arredo.
Personale efficiente e gentile.
Una nota dissonante con il trend è la colazione a buffet, francamente troppo troppo essenziale. Per questo ho scelto uova alla Benedict alla carta squisite.
Posizione perfetta, vicinissima alla fermata di Green Park, quindi comodissima. 
Quartiere ovviamente molto bello.",4,2016,11,21
144,Liebevolles Boutique Hotel in zentraler Lage,"Wir haben ein langes WE dort verbracht. Das Hotel hat sehr zuvorkommendes Personal. Überhaupt eine sehr wohlwollende großzügige Firmen Policy: unser Zimmer war durch einen temporär installierten Generator auf der Straße vor unserem Zimmer 2.Stock sehr laut, und auf Nachfrage haben wir ohne wenn und aber, sofort ein unglaubliches Upgrade bekommen. 
Wir hatten auch ausversehen mit unseren
Freunden eine Doppelbuchung, normalerweise, hätte man dies ohne Gnade berechnen können! Hat man auch sehr wohlwollend gehandelt! DANKE
Das Frühstück ist sein Geld wert, der Raum liegt zwar im Souterrain, aber das Buffet sehr frisch und reichhaltig! Service auch gut! 
Wir hatten auch einen afternoon tea fur 49£ wunderschönes Ambiente in dem sehr stylischen modernen kolonialen Barraum
Sehr gemütlich und lecker! 
Die Lage ist sehr bequem in Bezug auf shoppen und Verbindung über piccadilly Circus  nach Heathrow!
Würde es sofort wieder buchen! ",5,2016,11,17
144,Sehr zentrales Hotel mit sehr gutem Service,"Das Hotel liegt mitten in Mayfair und mit nur 3 Minuten fussläufig zur Subway Station Greenpark kommt man auch ohne Stau sehr schnell durch die Stadt. Die Zimmer sind klassisch und schick eingerichtet, und das Bad ist modern gehalten. Sehr zu empfehlen ist die sehr gut sortierte Hotelbar im Keller. Beim Frühstück könnte die Auswahl an Wurst und Käse etwas größer sein aber man bekommt eine sehr gute typisch englische Auswahl an Eiern. Mein Favorit waren Eggs Benedict.",5,2016,11,15
144,Tolles Hotel,"Wunderbar renoviertes Haus. Geschmackvoll eingerichtete Zimmer, leckeres Frühstück und sehr zuvorkommendes Personal. Ich habe mich rundum wohl gefühlt. Die Lage ist perfekt. Mitten in Mayfair und gleich an der U-bahn Station Green Park. Komme bestimmt wieder. ",5,2016,11,10

144,sehr freundlicher Umgang mit einer Beschwerde inklusive großzügigem Upgrade,"Schönes, topzentral gelegenes Hotel. Wir hatten Bauarbeiten vor dem Fenster (trotz Bitte um ein ruhiges Zimmer).

144,Engañoso,"El exterior y zonas comunes son tal cual se ven en las fotos, las habitaciones nada que ver. Empezando que para llegar a la habitación después de salir del ascensor teníamos que bajar unas escaleras y luego subir otras, un auténtico laberinto. Habitación interior pero ruidosa por una obra que trabajaba de lunes a domingo 24 horas. Habitación súper reducida.
Desayuno prepagado y entonces limitado.
Para colmo casi perdemos el avión porque en recepción nos encargaron un taxi y se confundieron de hora y el precio por supuesto el no concertado. 
La ubicación perfecta ",1,2016,10,30
144,Von A-Z einwandfrei ,"Fünf Gehminuten von der U-Bahn Station Greenpark entfernt (raus und dann rechts die Straße runter), sehr schön zentral in einer Seitenstraße schräg gegenüber vom Hilton gelegen. Small Luxury Hotels of the World Auszeichnung hat es sich verdient. Sehr nette, aufmerksame und flinke Mitarbeiter, hohe Qualität, tip top Zimmer, stylisch und luxuriös ausgestattet, sauberes Badezimmer, coole Bar, alles wunderbar. Das Hotel ist etwas verwinkelt, hat aber einen super Charme - immer gerne wieder. Morgens zum Laufen innerhalb von 1 Minute im Greenpark - perfekt! ",5,2016,10,28
144,PERFECTO!,"Todo es perfecto! la atención! los cuartos, la ubicación, los restaurantes, las personas! la limpieza todo! de verdad es el mejor hotel! debería tener 6 estrellas! que servicio tan espectacular!

144,"very british, aber nicht perfekt","Wir waren für ein Wochenende im Flemings Mayfair. Ein wirklich schönes Hotel, aber leider mit ein paar Mängeln, die bei den aufgerufenen Preisen nicht sein sollten.

Der Empfang war sehr freundlich, wir bekamen ein Upgrade von einem Executive - King - Zimmer auf eine ""Junior Suite"". Das Zimmer lag in einem Nebengebäude, war gut eingerichtet, wenn auch nicht annähernd so wie auf den Bildern auf der Webpage. In USA hätte man gesagt ein nettes Doppelzimmer, in London eine Junior Suite. Warum auch immer, es gab kein Sofa.

Die Einrichtung wirkt stilvoll und wertig, es gibt ausreichend Steckdosen. Die WiFi Verbindung ist gut und schnell, das Zimmer wirklich sehr sauber und in gutem Zustand. Der Schrank ist nicht nur sehr klein, sondern auch extrem unpraktisch. Hängt man Teile auf die Bügel, die länger als ein Hemd sind, kommt die Kleidung in die im Schrank bereitgestellten Kaffeezubehörteile.  Das Bad ist sehr sehr klein, die Brause sorgt selbständig für Wechselduschen, die Temperatur schwankt doch erheblich.

Das Frühstück gibt es im Haupthaus, das Buffet ist zwar mit guten bis sehr guten Zutaten bestückt, aber doch sehr überschaubar (mit Abstand das kleinste Buffet, das ich je zu diesem Preis gesehen habe). Dafür ist der Service sehr gut, der Orangensaft schmeckt frisch gepresst. Kann man so lassen. Fast schon unverschämt sind aber die Aufpreise für Extrawünsche, selbst bei dem gebuchten englischen Frühstück für 26 Pfund/Person sind Pancakes ... extra zu bezahlen. Das muss nicht sein.

Und da kommt dann auch der Haupt - Kritikpunkt. Wenn ein Hotel schon so hohe Preise aufruft (Zimmer und Frühstück), dann muss auch alles passen. Da stören dann auch Kleinigkeiten und es fallen Dinge auf, die man sonst gerne übersehen würde. So wurden zwar beim Check - In die Ausweise geprüft, aber dass da ein Geburtstag war wurde nicht bemerkt. Muss nicht sein, wäre aber bei einem solchen Hotel einfach schön gewesen. Am ersten Abend hat der Turn-Down-Service auf einer Seite des Bettes einen Vorleger und Hausschuhe platziert (his), hers wurde aber irgendwie vergessen. Am zweiten Tag kam der turndown - Service erst nach 21:30 Uhr und wollte hartnäckig ins Zimmer, obwohl wir das ""Do not disturb"" - Schild an der Tür hatten. Der Eingang zum Gebäude war mit einem Zahlencode versehen. Sinnvoll, da dort kein Personal vor Ort ist. Hilft aber nichts, wenn wie in unserem Fall in 4 von 5 Fällen die Tür einfach offen steht und jeder ins Haus kann.

Und so gab es eben einige Kleinigkeiten, die aber bei dem Anspruch (definiert durch die Preise) nicht so sein sollten und die auch eine bessere Bewertung verhindert haben. Trotzdem aber ein schönes Hotel in ausgezeichneter Lage, leider mit Mängeln.",3,2016,10,17
144,Hotel PERFECTO,"La situación es perfecta en MAYFAIR pegado green park, al lado de la zona mejor de parques, tiendas y restaurantes,

La via è una laterale di Picadilly str e a piedi ci si può recare in buona parte della città.
L'atrio è piccolo ma il personale è cordiale, la stanza era comoda, di piccole dimensioni ma per le mie esigenze sufficiente, bello il bagno con vasca e comodo l'ombrello a disposizione.
La colazione a buffet con poca scelta, direi essenziale.
Al check out volevano farmi pagare una colazione in camera mai fatta ma dopo anni nei vari hotel mi accorgo che ""ci provano spesso"".",4,2016,09,08
144,Ein Juwel,"Was seit Beginn der Renovierungs-Umbauphase hier entstanden ist, ist einfach traumhaft. Die Einrichtung, Farben, Stoffe, Bilder......... für Liebhaber des stilvollen Geschmacks eine wahre Augenweide. Mir hat es an nichts gefehlt. Super Frühsück, aufmerksamer Service, tolles Bad, uvm machen selbst einen beruflichen Aufenthalt mehr als angenehm. Und die Bar hat eine wunderbare Atmosphäre- nach einem stressigen Tag bestens geeignet, um abzuschalten.",5,2016,08,30
144,Nach der Renovierung ein Tophotel in sehr zentraler Lage,"Unser Aufenthalt im Flemings war ein Erlebnis! Die mit viel Liebe zum Detail sehr aufwändig renovierten Zimmer (wir hatten, dank Upgrade, auch Gelegenheit eine der Suiten kennen zu lernen), sind wirklich toll! Frische Blumen, frisches Obst (sehr grosszügig) im Zimmer und das jederzeit freundliche und hilfsbereite Personal sorgen dafür, dass man sich sofort wohl fühlt. 

Ein weiteres Highlight: Die (Boxspring-)Betten sind einfach super! ;-)  Sehr komfortabel! 
Wir haben in Hotels selten so gut geschlafen und uns auch gleich den Hersteller benennen lassen, um diesen Schlafkomfort auch zuhause haben zu können. 

Ach ja: Das Restaurant - Ormers Mayfair - im Haus ist sensationell! Unbedingt probieren!",5,2016,08,24

144,Schönes Boutiquehotel an perfekter Lage,Die Lage ist sehr gut.  Die normalen Doppelzimmer sind z.T. sehr klein und einfach. Gönnen sie sich ein Executive Zimmer mit Patio. Die sind der Hammer. Das Hotel ist ein paar Minuten von der U-Bahn Station Green Park entfernt. Zu Fuss in 10 Minuten am Picadilly Circus oder Buckingham Palace. Ein Häuserblock entfernt ist das traditionelle Shepard Quartier mit ein paar super Pubs und guten Restaurants.,4,2016,05,22
144,Solide Adresse in Mayfair,"Hotel wird Teil-Renoviert, daher etwas lärmig. Bekam ein Zimmer mit Innenhofsicht (Vorteil kein Strassenlärm). War etwas eng, aber für kurzen Geschäftsaufenthalt ok.

144,"Super Lage, top Wohlfühlfaktor, sehr motiviertes Personal!","Wir – fünf Personen - waren sechs Tage im Flemings Mayfair. Ein Hotel mit Stil und Charme. 

Wir haben uns sehr wohl gefühlt und werden gerne wieder kommen. - Warum?

- die Lage ist sehr zentral. Piccadilly Circus, Green Park, Buckingham Palace,  Boutiquen, Restaurants, etc., alles in unmittelbarer Laufnähe

- bereits vor der Anreise wurden unsere Wünsche zeitnah und gerne aufgenommen

- die Hin- und Rücktransfers vom und zum Flughafen waren einwandfrei organisiert (Danke, Joshua)

- der professionelle Check-In und Check-Out wurde dank Evelina und Franzi mit einer persönlichen Note vorgenommen

- die ruhig gelegene, neue Penthouse Suite, mit einer tollen, hochwertigen Ausstattung bietet jeglichen Komfort

- die individuellen Services sind tadellos

Vor allem aber, zeichnet sich das Flemings Mayfair durch hoch motiviertes Personal aus, welches sichtlich Freude an der Arbeit hat. Das Team und die Teamarbeit sind beeindruckend. 

Alice, herzlichen Dank für die gute Betreuung und die hervorragenden Insidertipps!

Wir werden das Flemings Mayfair gerne wieder berücksichtigen.",5,2016,04,16
144,Hotel in wunderschönem klassischen englischen Gebäude beim Green Park,"Ich kann das Hotel jedem empfehlen! Die Half Moon Street ist eine Seitenstrasse von Piccadilly. Der Green Park und die gleichnamige Tube-Station sind 2 Minuten vom Hotel entfernt. Die Half Moon Street ist extrem ruhig. Wir haben gar keinen Verkehr gehört - nicht wegen der ""guten Isolation"" sondern weil diese Strasse wirklich ruhig ist. In Richtung Green Park wird es dann natürlich laut und läuft man in die andere Richtung geht, ist man in einem typischen Mayfair-Viertel. Wunderschön und ruhig.

Das Hotel hat Zimmer im Hauptgebäude, wo auch die Reception ist. Wenns im Hauptgebäude kein Platz hat, dann bekommt man Zimmer im Nebenhaus (Hauptgebäude und Nebenhaus sind aneinandergebaute Häsuer, aber nicht mit Durchgängen verbunden). Wenn man ein Zimmer im Nebenhaus hat, dann öffnet man die Haupttür des Hauses mit dem Zimmerschlüssel, da das Haus geschlossen ist bzw. nicht öffentlich zugänglich ist. Im Nebenhaus gibt es natürlich keine Rezeption aber man kann natürlich trotzdem anrufen und Zimmerservice verlangen. 

Die Zimmer im Nebenhaus (evtl. sind die Zimmer im Haupthaus grösser) sind zwar sauber und schön eingerichtet aber sehr klein. Der Koffer hatte offen keinen Platz neben dem Bad.

Öffnet man das Zimmerfenster, schaut man in den ""Hinterhof"". Nicht schön, aber oft so in London.

Leider hatten wir nie die Möglichkeit genutzt im Hotel zu essen, da wir London lieben. Am letzten Tag wollten wir uns in der Hotelbar (ist im Untergeschoss) von den Strapazen erholen bis es zum Flughafen geht und wir waren dann erstaunt, wie schön die Bar bzw. das Restaurant schön gestaltet sind. Schade zwar, dass sie im Untergeschoss sind, aber beim nächsten Mal werden wir bestimmt einen Abend in der Hotelbar verbringen.

Das Personal war sehr freundlich, hilfsbereit und professionell!!!

144,Quanta polvere... Evitatelo...,"L'apparenza inganna, e non è un modo di dire. Quello che viene descritto, sul sito, come un albergo di charme, è, nella realtà, una struttura molto piccola e poco confortevole: le stanze sono buie, anguste, con letti più adatti agli gnomi che a persone di statura normale (io, che sono alto 1,84, dormivo regolarmente con i piedi di fuori...) ma soprattutto sono polverose e tenute male dal personale di servizio che in dieci giorni di pernottamento ha cambiato le lenzuola una sola volta, il penultimo giorno, dopo la quinta richiesta inevasa. Un albergo che non merita assolutamente le quattro stelle. Eppure i prezzi sono da capogiro; per una standard con letto aggiunto (un divano letto, che, per giunta, abbiamo dovuto prepararci da soli per le prime due notti) abbiamo pagato 480 sterline a notte, senza colazione, però con tasse incluse.... 
Nel periodo in cui siamo andati (inizio/metà luglio) c'erano i lavori di ristrutturazione in un'ala dell'albergo che portavano polvere anche nelle stanze, nel bar  e nel ristorante. E passaggio di operai a tutte le ore. Infatti per questo motivo non abbiamo mai fatto colazione in albergo: ci sono bastati due caffè ""alla calce"" per convincerci che erano meglio, molto meglio, evitare.
Ecco, evitare: è la parola chiave. Albergo da evitare con cura. E senza rimpianti.",1,2015,08,03
144,Un ottimo hotel nel cuore del Mayfair!,"L'hotel è molto carino e accogliente e il  personale è molto gentile. Le camere sono belle e molto pulite. Si trova a due passi dal Green Park, dal Picadilly Circus e dalla bellissima Regent street, non si può chiedere di meglio, una posizione perfetta! Ci torneremo sicuramente.",4,2015,06,04
144,Great location,"Für 3 Nächte hielt ich mich in dem Hotel auf. Die Lage ist ideal, die U-Bahn Station Green Park ist in knapp 5 Minuten zu Fuß erreichbar. Die Straße direkt vorm Haus ist sehr ruhig.

Man merkt das es bei dem Hotel sich ursprünglich um Wohnbebauung hielt. Die Zimmer haben unterschiedliche Größen, unabhängig der Zimmer Kategorie, auch geht es im Haus über ein Auf und Ab an Treppen über Zwischenetagen. Das macht es aber abwechslungsreich und interessanter zu den üblichen Londoner Hotels. Die Zimmer sind ruhig und modern eingerichtet, das Bad auch ausreichend groß, oftmals ein Problem in London.

Der Frühstücksraum ist modern aber dennoch gemütlich möbliert, das Frühstück Sortiment ist reichhaltig aber in Sachen Auswahl etwas eingeschränkt. Von der Karte kann aber verschiedenes zusätzlich bestellt werden z.Bsp. Eggs Benedict. 

Das Personal ist durchgehend sehr freundlich und kompetent, allerdings dürfte der Service im Restaurant etwas flotter sein. Auch würde den diensthabenden Managerin im Restaurant ein etwas freundlicheres Gesicht stehen. 

Abgesehen von den kleinen verbesserungsfähigen Punkten uneingeschränkt zu empfehlen.",4,2015,06,01
144,Excelente ubicación,"La situación del hotel es excelente para unos días de turismo en Londres. Esta muy céntrico pero a la vez en una calle tranquila y poco ruidosa. A un paso de Green Park y del metro en uno de los barrios más bonitos de Londres.

Es una opción muy aconsejable para pasar un fin de semana en Londres.",4,2015,05,31
144,Gute Lage,"Ich war schon mehrfach in diesem Hotel und es scheint, als bekäme ich jedes Mal ein kleineres Zimmer. Dieses Mal war es wirklich ultra winzig, nichts, wenn man länger wie eine Nacht bleiben möchte und hoffentlich nicht ein Zimmer, das für zwei Leute gedacht ist. Den Koffer kann man kaum wohin stellen. Das Frühstücksbuffet ust sehr mager. Generell Sehr freundlicher Service",3,2015,05,21
144,Excelente hotel céntrico ,"El hotel de 10 solo le falta cambiar sus alfombras. Pero los cuartos están muy bien modernos. La atención es la correcta. Y se maneja muy buena tecnología. El restaurante fue mi sorpresa. Es muy bueno, y muy buen servicio. Sorprendido. Es para volver!",5,2015,05,17
144,"Londra,Flemings e una vacanza che ha lasciato il segno...","Hotel molto bello, situato in una zona molto vicina a a Piccadilly... vicinissima anche la fermata di GreenPark.. insomma volete sentirvi dei signori il flemings è a mio parere un ottima scelta... cortesia del personale al primo posto... gli unici lati negativi del Flemings sono i prezzi e il fatto che le stanze, le camere e i corridoi sono un po' ''all'antica'' io mi sono innamorato della colazione e non mi scorderò mai dell'ascensore fatto a libreria... Insomma come dice il titolo è stata una vacanza che ha lasciato il segno... Consigliato!!",4,2015,05,15

encontramos una oferta del 50% en este hotel, y nos quedamos maravillados!! la habitacion no era muy grande, pero no echamos de menos el espacio. todo muy bonito, adecuado, con adaptadores de corriente. 
el personal muy amable, pero no hablaban español (cosa que no fue un problema para nosotros).
el desayuno no lo teniamos incluido, pero no hacia falta, en los alrededores hay miles de cafeterias y locales para comprar un cafe e ir tomandotelo por las calles cual ingles.

144,LINDO HOTEL BOUTIQUE,"El hotel esta muy bien ubicado dentro de Londres. LLegamos al aeropuerto y tomando el tren te bajas a solo dos cuadras, asi que la llegada es muy sencilla. La decoraciòn es muy buena y tiene àreas comunes muy confortables para pasar un rato. Con respecto a las habitaciones, como en casi todo Londres, son diminutas. Llegamos y nos habian dado una habitaciòn del primer piso. La cama doble era tan chica que pedimos si nos podìan cambiar, nos dieron una ùnica opciòn, una habitaciòn en la planta baja. La tomamos porque era mas amplia y con una cama king, pero no tenia vistas mas que a un patio con todos los equipos de refrigeracion y calefaccion.... en fin. El baño muy còmodo y todo muy limpio.",4,2015,03,30

El hotel era muy acogedor y silencioso. Está muy bien situado , cerca de una entrada de metro y en frente tiene un hermoso parque que al cruzar llegas a Buckingham palace.Se puede ir andando a Picadilly circus, a Hyde park y alas zonas comerciales por excelencia: New Bond St, Carnaby St,Oxford St. En la zona hay varios pub y restaurantes.

144,soggiorno in stanza singola. Consigliato.,"Mi sono fermata a Londra dopo un viaggio di lavoro, ero sola e quindi quello che cercavo era un hotel in una zona sicura, facilmente raggiungibile dall'aeroporto perchè non volevo perdere tempo negli spostamenti e di buono standard, visto che le singole, notoriamente, sono spesso delle stanze sacrificate. Ho pagato 115 p (esclusa IVA) a notte, compresa l'english breakfast, che mi è sembrato un prezzo conveniente se paragonato con gli altri alberghi della zona della stessa categoria. Sono rimasta molto soddisfatta. Splendida posizione, zona chic, strada tranquilla, metro e parco ad un passo. Potevi tornare in albergo in un attimo da tutte le zone di interesse turistico, quando ti andava, per poi riprendere i tuoi giri comodamente. Stanza carina - non entusiasmante - ma mi hanno dato una doppia invece che della singola e lo ho apprezzato tantissimo. WiFi gratuito in tutte le zone comuni dell'albergo (sala relax confortevolissima con il camino). Ristrutturato lussuosamente, anche se con un gusto non proprio sobrio. Colazione apprezzatissima. La qualità del cibo era eccellente, il servizio impeccabile, tutto perfetto. Lo consiglio a tutti, specialmente per un we romantico.",5,2013,03,05
144,Veramente stupendo. OTTIMA posizone,"Mi sono recato in questa struttura lo scorso weekend per 4 giorni a Londra col mio fidanzato.
Devo assolutamente dire che la qualità prezzo è ottima, essendo la zona di Mayfair.
a 2 passi la fermata di GREEN PARK, dove passano 3 linee metropolitana (Jubilee, Piccadilly e Victoria).
La posizione è il pezzo forte dell'hotel. A nemmeno 10 minuti a piedi dal Piccadilly Circus e Soho. Personale gentilissimo e cordiale su tutto. La camera ce la rifacevano 2 volte al giorno!!
Parlando dell'hotel devo dire che è molto moderno e le camere sono spaziose nel giusto e letto molto comodo anche se un po' piccolo al fondo! comunque molto pulito e molto grande.
Lo consiglierei a tutti quelli che vogliono fare una vita notturna in pieno centro Londra senza preoccuparsi di farsi chilometri per tornare a casa la sera.
Buon viaggio",5,2013,01,24
144,"Hotel nella media, in una buona posizione","Il Flemings è sicuramente in una posizione molto comoda per che voglia visitare Londra: a pochi isolati dalla fermata Mayfair della metropolitana (che  - tra l'altro - collega direttamente la città con l'aeroporto di Heatrow) e non lontano da tutta una serie di luoghi d'interesse (Buckingham Palace, PiccafdillY Circus, Hyde Park).
Il personale è gentile, disponibile ed efficente.
Soltanto, essendo uno ""Small Luxury Hotel"", ci si potrebbe aspettare qualcosa di più: la nostra camera (N° 122), al primo piano, non era servita dall'ascensore, e andare su e giù per le scale, strette e ripide con i bagagli non è stato molto agevole; la stanza era abbastanza ampia ma un po' malandatina: tappezzeria strappata in un paio di punti, moquette macchiata, tende non pulitissime. La colazione negli standard, ma spesso mancava qualcosa dal buffet; ad esempio una mattina non c'era il pane ed i camerieri ci hanno confessato che per quel giorno proprio non ce ne sarebbe stato......
In conclusione, non ne siamo rimasti delusi ma nemmeno entusiasti.",3,2013,01,07
144,Al centro perfetto!,"Io la mattina mi alzavo, prendevo la metro e andavo nel posto prescelto e poi tornavo a piedi sempre nello stesso tempo...per dire che è messo veramente bene; prendevo la metro per i posti più lontani, ma per piccadilly circus e vicinanze parliamo di 5 minuti a piedi così come per il palazzo reale! il quartiere poi è il migliore di londra e la notte è piacevole, sicuro e vivibile. l'albergo è molto bello, la mia camera era abbastanza grande per gli standard londinesi, gli spazi comuni molto belli e la pulizia ottima (a parte l'accapatoio con segni di ""sgommata"" il primo giorno).l'accoglienza molto fredda e il personale un pò...istericuccio!! la colazione molto buona!
L'ascensore fa molto rumore!!",5,2012,09,07

144,Posizione da favola,"Ho soggiornato in questo hotel grazie a un'offerta trovata su booking, camera singola, perfetta come punto di appoggio, in particolare per la posizione strategica in cui si trova la struttura. A pochissimi passi c'è la fermata della metro, Green Park e diversi posti per fare colazione. Ricordo anche che il personale parlava italiano, il che non guasta mai. 
Per un breve soggiorno la camera singola è sufficiente, ci ritornerei molto volentieri.",5,2012,08,30

Insomma, in zona centralissima e di altissimo pregio: la mitica Mayfair.
Tutto molto bello e perfetto.
Personale gentilissimo.
Qualche appunto.
Le camere standard sono piuttosto piccole.
Il bar e la sala per le colazioni sono sotto il livello della strada e quindi senza finestre.
L'arredamento a mio parere è un pò pacchiano, direi stile americano.
Il mio voto è comunque altissimo.
Siamo a livelli top in una città top.
Il prezzo non è da meno, ma adeguato.",5,2012,05,22

144,Hotel romantico e di tendenza,"Ho soggiornato con mia moglie in questo Hotel a fine febbraio e ci siamo trovati benissimo.
Posizione veramente centrale con la stazione metropolitana di GreenPark a soli 100/150 mt di distanza, il Fleming's è situato in una stradina laterale poco trafficata e tranquilla di Piccadilly Street , siamo solo a 5 minuti di camminata per Buckingham palace e  altrettanti per le famose vie dello shopping.  Gli spazi comuni sono finemente arredati la Front Room è spettacolare ed anche l'ascensore a libreria è originale.
Il personale sempre gentile e a disposizione per qualsiasi richiesta che gli abbiamo rivolto.  Non abbiamo usufruito del ristorante per la colazione perchè decisamente caro.  La nostra stanza sempre pulitissima e in linea con gli standard dei 4 stelle, gli unici difetti l'impossibilità di regolare la temperatura del riscaldamento, abbiamo dormito due notti con la finestra semiaperta dal caldo, ed un lavabo decisamente troppo piccolo dove anche lavarsi i denti cominciava ad essere un'impresa. Penso anche che , visto i prezzi non proprio economici, l'utilizzo d'Internet poteva essere gratuito.",4,2012,03,04
144,"""Very British""","Schönes altes englisches Townhouse,toll eingerichtet und wie so üblich, ein bißchen klein und eng mit vielen Türen zwischen den Gängen. Netter Empfang, schöne Lobby, gutes Frühstück vom Buffet oder A la Carte, Service allerdings bei ""Ansturm"" etwas überfordert. Lage am Green Park sehr ruhig, wunderbar für Jogger, Piccadilly um die Ecke, Hyde Park ebenso. Bei der Abreise allerdings wurde ein ""Taxi"" bestellt, das in 5 Minuten das sein sollte. Nach 10 Minuten Wartezeit habe ich dann ein ""normales Cab"" genommen - hat den Doorman sichtlich nicht gepasst - ging ihm offensichtlich Provision durch die Lappen.",4,2012,02,23
144,"Hotel carino, camere piuttosto piccole!","L'albergo è situato in una posizione privilegiata, in centro, vicino alla metropolitana e a 10 minuti a piedi da Piccadilly. L'ingresso è piacevole, molto carino e tipico, la sala ""relax"" è arredata con gusto e molto carina. Qualche perplessità sulla colazione, decisamente cara in rapporto alla varietà disponibile, è comunque più che sufficiente per gli standard di colazione italiani. Unico ""neo"" le camere, decisamente piccole, per quanto dotate di tutti i confort (cassaforte, tv lcd, internet, frigobar, necessario per la preparazione del the). Visti i prezzi, internet avrebbe potuto essere gratuita e anche il frigobar avrebbe potuto avere prezzi un pò più accessibili. Il personale è cortese e disponibile, il concierge all'altezza della situazione. Quindi, concludendo, ottimo hotel se non si hanno necessità particolari di spazi in camera ed ottimo per coppie che vogliono passare dei giorni in un albergo di classe, romantico e ben posizionato per girare Londra.",4,2011,12,22

Die großen Shopping Strassen sind gut zu Fuß erreichbar. Joggen kann man im Park. Überraschend und kreativ ist die Liftgestaltung in Form einer Bibliotek passend zum Thema ""Fleming"".

Kann es weiter empfehlen und werde selbst auch dort zu Gast sein.",4,2011,06,23
144,Sehr schönes Hotel mit guter Lage,"Das Hotel verfügt vor allem über einen großen Pluspunkt: eine unschlagbar günstige Lage. Wenn Sie von Heathrow kommen, liegt das Hotel direkt an der Piccadilly-Line! So dass Sie ohne Umsteigen mit d U-Bahn zum Hotel fahren können? Daneben sind die Zimmer deutlich besser in Scguß als bei der Konkurrenz gegenüber (dem Hilton Green Park Hotel) Buchen Sie ein Zimmer nach hinten, da die Straße morgens (beim Müllabholen) recht laut ist. SEHR freundliches Personal!!",4,2011,03,30
144,"Kleine Zimmer, Superlage, nur zu empfehlen!","Ich war nun mittlerweile zum zweiten Mal im Flemings Mayfair in London für 2 Nächte. Die Zimmer sind klein, was aber normal ist für Hotels im Herzen von London. Dafür sind sie charmant eingerichtet mit kleiner aber ausreichender Minibar, Safe, Lan/Wlan (kostet 15 Pfund pro Tag), Fön.

Was mir besonders gefallen hat und für mich wichtig ist:

- Lage: Hervorragend am Green Park gelegen, Tube zum London Heathrow Flughafen quasi vor der Haustür.
- Ruhig: Es ist relativ ruhig, aber man kann gut schlafen selbst wenn man Lärmempfindlich ist. Die Betten sind ein Traum.
- Wärme/Kälte: Klimaanlage vorhanden, aber Heizung funktioniert ebenso einwandfrei. ich friere leicht, daher äußerst wichtig Nachts.
- Service: Der Service ist diskret und gründlich. 
- Sauberkeit: Das Zimmer war durchwegs sauber und wird sehr früh gereinigt, so daß man recht schnell ein aufgeräumtes Zimmer hat.

Einziges kleines Manko, es gab keine Switcher für die britischen Steckdosen. Man konnte aber für 5 Pfund überall einen erwerben.",4,2011,02,15

Kaum Tageslicht, aber egal für nur Übernachtung. Im Zimmerpreis von ca. 200 Euro natürlich kein Frühstück, es kostet 17 Pund extra. Habe ein Omlet mit Champignons, Paprika etc. bestellt.

La habitacion tenia un tamaño adecuado ( dicen que los hoteloes suelen tener habitaciones pequeñas pero este no era el caso) y limpia, tenia dos camas queen size muy comodas; la unica pega es que creo que no funcionaba la calefaccion o no la habian conectado todavia y a pesar que nos hizo un tiempo buenisimo por las noche te tenias que echar la manta y justito. El desayuno no lo contratamos porque nos parecia caro 12 libras por persona, habia un par de cadenas de desayunos muy cerca que nos vinieron muy bien. Lo aconsejo y si pudiera volveria, esta justificado su precio por la ubicacion pero podian poner el desayuno un poco mas barato. (Nosotros conseguimos una oferta y nos salio mejor de lo que suele ser). Ah se me olvidaba que un defecto era el acceso a internet a traves de la pantalla de television con un teclado que funcionaba muy, muy mal, seria una cosa que tendrian que mejorar.",4,2009,11,01
