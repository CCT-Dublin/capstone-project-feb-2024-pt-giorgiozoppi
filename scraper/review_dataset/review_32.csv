32,"Barcelona Gem, Wonderful Staff","We loved this hotel! We arrived after a long red eye flight and were greeted by Facundo and Roberto in the lobby, who were so kind and helpful that we instantly felt glad to have chosen this hotel. Our room was clean and lovely! This hotel is perfectly situated in a fun and central area, easily walkable to all our favorite parts of Barcelona, and the rooms are quiet. The rooftop is such a nice touch, where we can sit to drink cocktails with a gorgeous view of the plaza. When we checked out the manager helped us to acquire a taxi and helped bringing our bags out to the car. The staff were warm and professional and made everything easy and comfortable. My partner and I pass through Barcelona several times a year and we've found our new place to stay!",5,2024,05,07
32,Fantastic location .,The hotel is situated halfway up The Rambler (main st in Barcelona.) 10 minutes walk to the harbour. Central to many attractions. Beautiful hotel and room. Very clean and peaceful. Wonderful food. Definitely recommend,5,2023,02,24
32,Perfect stay,Wonderful hotel. Lovely room looking over the square. Beautiful bathroom. Good shower. . Staff friendly.   Recommended restaurants which were great. The hotel is close to everything.  Close to subway. Shops and restaurants. Could not have asked for a better vacation.,5,2024,03,10
32,5 star,"Location was superb, rooms were clean and well stocked and the staff was exceptional. They were responsive, friendly and informational. The beds were comfortable with great pillows. We would highly recommend this hotel to others. A must see is the rooftop.",5,2024,02,20
32,False advertising,"While the location is ‚Äòcentral‚Äô in the city, there were homeless people sleeping outside the front door, no hotel lobby, lights off, and the sign for the hotel looked temporary and dirty. I tried to cancel my reservation after they asked for every personal detail including passport number and picture but they wouldn‚Äôt refund me. I stayed somewhere else in the city and so glad I did. I went to check out this hotel while there and it did not feel safe.",1,2024,02,06
32,"Good, but with the wrong classification.","The hotel has a great location, it is in a square that despite a little noise with beggars partying all night long, noise of bottles breaking, and urinating through the walls, it has a charm, a accordion playing music at dusk, restaurants.

The rooms are very clean, and with a construction care.

The Wi-Fi works 60% of the time, the room keys often stop working. The service has average quality, and unprofessional, which in some moments cause a lot of sadness.

The expectation was for a memorable experience, but no, it‚Äôs common.

If I had a 4-star rating, it would be more honest.",3,2024,01,05
32,Not a 5 star hotel,"It is puzzling how DO Sonder can be classified as a five-star hotel. Three or four stars would be more appropriate.
Advantages: The location in the city center is good (although the hustle and bustle and music at Placa Reial can be disturbing), the hotel has an old-fashioned charm with nice albeit slightly worn suites.
Disadvantages: The breakfast is hardly five-star. Guests are forced to choose from four small fixed menus, which means you can forget about loading up for the day. Freedom of choice should be a given at a five-star hotel. Some of the staff should take a course in service. The hotel‚Äôs Wi-Fi is a joke.",2,2023,12,19
32,Great hotel,"Great little hotel. Rooms were excellent. A funky vibe, with sprial staircase funky old lift, great art in the rooms, 4 post bed, great facilities, double sink bathroom and fantastic shower. Even supplied an umbrella just in case. I had a seafood paella from the hotel restaurant on my first night which was great. Brilliant location, right on the square with lots of bars and restaurants, and on the other side, La Rambla with walking distance access to everything. Great staff too. Thank you üòä",5,2023,12,04
32,"It‚Äôs beautiful, great service but needs a little attention to detail.","Beautiful small hotel right in the square! The location can‚Äôt be beat and easy walk to everything including the main bus station about a 10 minute walk. Breakfast is included and is great. It is downstairs but the main restaurant is upstairs and that one costs money. There is a rooftop and a small pool. Service for bar is hit or miss you might have to go downstairs to the main bar to order. Or just bring your own bottle and ask for glasses at the bar downstairs. The room. Nice. Big. The issues‚Ä¶it‚Äôs very dark, lights not working. Plugs are hit and miss. Check your phone as it is charging woke up in the morning and phone was dead. Stayed in room 15 on the first floor it faces the side and not the main courtyard which for us is great it‚Äôs not as noisy as it turns into a party at night.",3,2023,11,14
32,"Central hotel, beautiful room, great service",Stayed in room 21.  This beautiful top-floor room was clearly recently renovated so there were quirky lighting issues that were promptly addressed.  Super central gothic quarter location so a bit noisy on weekends.  Great breakfasts.  Employees were friendly and efficient.  I would stay there again.,5,2023,10,22
32,great staff,"I had the pleasure of staying at this Hotel during my business trip, and it exceeded my expectations. The room was well-appointed and had all the necessary amenities for a productive stay. The hotel's conference facilities were excellent, and the staff ensured everything ran smoothly. I will definitely choose this hotel for future trips.",5,2023,09,25
32,Great trip to Barcelona,"We stayed at the hotel for 4 nights. The room was excellent, the front desk folks were super friendly and the hotel overall was comfortable and great. It was also at a great location within walking distance to many attractions in the Gothic Quarter. Would highly recommend! ",5,2023,09,16
32,4 nights at SonderPlaca Reial,"This hotel is rated 5 star and has very high ratings. We found the facility to be less than outstanding, especially for the money.
First the pros:
Large comfortable room, we had a 1 bedroom
Fabulous, knowledgeable staff, especially the front desk and the cleaning staff
Ideal location for sightseeing in the old city or going to the beach
The cons:
Terrible location for late night shenanigans, the Placa Reial goes until 4AM minimum! If noise bothers you, look elsewhere
The queen mattress was sagging and uncomfortable
Included breakfast has only 4 choices, whilst paying customers have access to the full menu! A 5 star hotel should allow access to the full breakfast menu. 
The rooftop deck was dirty and the very small plunge pool was filled with pigeons! We also rarely saw any service available at the bar.",3,2023,09,10
32,Amazing.,"Amazing stay. Room and facilities were amazing. The breakfast downstairs was great, as well as the rooftop bar. The hotel felt quiet as though nobody was around and this was a lovely comfortable feeling. Location wise; you couldn‚Äôt get a better spot. It was worth every Penny and the staff were great. 
Only one thing I would like to point out in my review which I hope the hotel take seriously is the attitude of the waiter who took charge of the roof top bar. tattoos and dark hair. He was rude to us on multiple occasions and whilst I don‚Äôt think he intended to be, it made us slightly uncomfortable. We were told we could take our drinks from the bar to the rooftop - he would tell us we couldn‚Äôt. We were guests of the hotel, he saw us every day in the lift. One day he‚Äôd accept cash others he wouldn‚Äôt. He was totally oblivious to guests at times and to be frank, his attitude overall wasn‚Äôt great in such a beautiful setting. He should consider how this rubs off on guests. 

I‚Äôd really like to highlight this was only one person and it didn‚Äôt change our experience - more just to raise awareness to the staff. I‚Äôd absolutely recommend this hotel without hesitation.",5,2023,08,12
32,Great location but expensive for what it is - service was often poor,"Plus points
- Good central location 
- The city is amazing to explore.
- Superb receptionist - Lady with red curly hair was so friendly and helpful!
- Nice themed room
- High ceilings 
- Big bathroom 
- Good amenities in the room, coffee maker etc 
- There were issues with the room but they did get rectified quickly so that‚Äôs positive.

Negatives
- It felt overpriced for the following reasons.
- The so called pool at the hotel is the size of a big hot tub. Not for swimming in.
- Shower was so weak
- The hotel is in a big square of restaurants. When it gets to the evening this turns into Ibiza! Packed full of people getting drunk and loud. Be aware of this before booking. It only became quiet at 4am each morning. They even give you ear plugs by the side of the bed. It wasn‚Äôt a huge issue as we were on the top floor but it was loud.
- The police park a big armoured truck outside of the hotel each night as there is that much ‚Äúactivity‚Äù.
- There is so many homeless people! The city needs to do more. They literally sleep outside of the front door of the hotel. And as there is nothing stopping them walking in and up the stairs your room door is all that separates. We had one homeless person really bother us on the last day which really upset my partner.
- The breakfast area downstairs was closed so we were forced to eat breakfast outside whilst we watched the homeless people pick up beer cans from the previous night. Breakfast wasn‚Äôt great, a rather basic set choice. 
- Excluding the Receptionist, we found a lot of the servers dismissive. On an evening they were just rude and incredibly protective over ‚Äútheir tables‚Äù. Want a drink outside overlooking the square at your hotel you are staying in? Only if you are eating and spending money on food. Otherwise you get dismissed up to the rooftop bar where its ‚Ç¨15 a cocktail.",4,2023,08,07
32,Terrible customer service,Starting with the positive - the rooms were nice and the hotel staff were very friendly. However the whole experience was completely undermined by the fact that Sonder refused to give me a direct contact number at the hotel so I couldn‚Äôt ask for advice  in advance and the car park they recommended was a long walk from the hotel. My wife and I had to carry all the luggage for a family of 5 in 30 degree heat for half a mile. Do not stay at this hotel if you are driving. I will not be staying at √† Sonder hotel again.,2,2023,07,22
32,Boutique hotel in historic center of Barcelona,"Wonderful location and great Staff. What a Gem in the center of Barcelona. Look forward to visiting again! Definitely worth each penny! 
Great complimentary Breakfast on the rooftop. They also have a great restaurant called Tomate full of delicious options (we ate there 3 times!!).",5,2023,06,30
32,Very disappointing room. ,"Stayed in Room 3. There were tiles missing from the bathroom and grout missing in many places. The room was very musty and stuffy, and the window was too small and difficult to open. The d√©cor is in need of updating and did not match the nightly cost of ‚Ç¨220. I do not or would not tolerate missing tiles and dirty grout at home,  The bed was comfortable with very clean.  The breakfast was excellent with lots of coffee.  Staff were very friendly and professional. ",3,2023,06,28
32,Disappointing for the money,"We chose this hotel for its location and amenities. It was very disappointing. The staff at the desk was very nice and helpful but we had many problems. The air conditioning and lights in the room were not functioning normally. If we turned off the lights in the room, the A/C went off. The rooms were not cleaned‚Ä¶the towels were changed and the bed was made but the bathroom weren‚Äôt cleaned. The included breakfast was good but choices were very limited. the rooftop terrace had no ambience ‚Ä¶just a few tables and chairs and the pool was a dipping pool‚Ä¶you couldn‚Äôt swim in it.  The location was perfect. Overpriced hotel for the services we received. This was an expensive hotel and it was not worth the extra money, sadly.",3,2023,06,26
32,SONDER STAY,"Overall amazing, however I would add a pan for the use of the oven and more trash bags  for the can. I wish I could‚Äôve stayed longer. I‚Äôll be back in august though. The apartment was nice and spacious and I love the balcony ",5,2023,06,14
32,"Great location, reasonable price, and good amenities.","I was here for a work trip and this place had everything I needed. Gym, work station, and a comfortable stay!

you must go to the terrance and enjoy the pool and the bar upstairs. definitely a great pick!",5,2023,06,06
32,Seamless,"Everything was lovely at the Sonder! Check in and check out was seamless. My only complaint would be the irons in the rooms being extremely cheap and do not get very hot at all. Upgrade your irons. Other then they, a 10/10!",5,2023,06,05
32,Great apartment in good location,"Beautiful big apartment with modern touches. Loved that the TV has chrome cast built in therefore you can steam from phone or tablet.  Full kitchen with appliances, cooking tools, plates, drinking cups, etc. Location is great. Shopping and Restaurants walking distance. Parking two blocks away.",5,2023,06,05
32,Loved my stay!,"First time using Sonder. Stayed for a Con with my best friend and honestly had an amazing experience. Everything is super convenient, clean and support is super friendly. Would highly recommend! I‚Äôll be using Sonder on future stays ",5,2023,06,05
32,A true pleasure,"Our Sonder was a 10/10 stay in all aspects - location, safety, cleanliness, comfort

Will definitely be staying again!",5,2023,06,04
32,Summer summertimer...,"This is where you want to be in Philly!

32,Perfect stay,"Perfect location. Beautiful, spacious room. Very pleasant and helpful staff. Varied breakfast included in the room rate. Very pleasant rooftop with swimming pool. Everything has been thought out down to the smallest detail and the decoration is superb. The price is high but the services are up to scratch.",5,2023,05,29
32,Pleasant experience,"Our room was extremely quiet at night it was prefect. The concierge was really helpful and the breakfast was delicious. The restaurants near the hotel were all great picks to eat at. Only downside, which was not in the hotels or nearby restaurants fault, was the peddlers.",5,2023,05,28
32,Great location and reception service,"Great location, got free upgrade, very friendly reception. Breakfast was average, 1 minor incident where we left the towel on the bathtub to get new one, but housekeeper hung it back up instead of change new towel for us. Overall a still a great place to stay. ",4,2023,05,25
32,Would stay again,The unit was clean and everything was in working order. Staff was friendly and responsive.  Location was central and easy walking distance to attractions. Would definitely stay again. Check in and out was easy.,5,2023,05,25
32,"Next time the same place, for sure!","Really nice place. Perfectly situated. With closed windows no noise at night (Room No. 14) Had a balcony to the plaza, so beautiful! Clean bath, very good cleaning of rooms. The front desk is very helpful, ;-) Mr. Barcelona.
Breakfast: choose out of four choices and then ask for additional things like eggs or combine the various offers. Served on the outside terrace in front of the hotel at the plaza, fantastic! The serving people from Restaurant Tomate are very charming and helping. Perfect. ",5,2023,05,15

",5,2023,05,14
32,A Great Hotel choice,"Beautiful hotel in an outstanding location. Ask for a room with a window or balcony overlooking the magnificent plaza. Jordi was extremely helpful with recommendations and travel support. The breakfasts were premier and the staff in the restaurant did an excellent job and adapted to your specific menu choices. We hope to return soon. Rooms 24 and 34 were perfect. Enjoy the rooftop ambience and performances on the Placa!
Warren",5,2023,05,13
32,Family trip,The views is beautiful! And the place is spacious. As a family we really enjoyed the space. Really walkable area and close to a lot of different shops and tourist attractions. I would recommend this place to anyone,5,2023,05,13
32,Couple stay,"The place was extremely nice and well kept. The bedding was clean, which is definitely something I look for when staying in any hotel, air bnb, etc.. In addition to the cleanliness, the room was well styled and felt like a luxury hotel. Will definitely be staying here again.",4,2023,05,10
32,Will certainly be back!,"I traveled here with my partner to revisit the city we met in. We absolutely loved it! We were able to accomplish everything there is to do in Philadelphia due to the central location. Walkable to Rittenhouse Square. City Hall, Rocky Steps, museums, etc. Access to Federal Donuts in lobby. Extremely clean upon arrival. The A/C unit did have a loud whirring sound. Easy access check in / check out. Noise level fine! Most ideal AirBnB experience we've had yet.",5,2023,05,09
32,Perfect place to stay.,"Very nice apartment building. I've stayed here several times. It used to be an Embassy Suites hotel before the Pandemic. Large, spacious rooms with a full kitchen. Very good location. Very close to restaurants, shopping, and public transportation. ",5,2023,05,02
32,Excellent Barcelona City Stay,"The hotel is charming and very well located at Placa Reial. Both rooms are stylish but not in pop colours, very elegant but not conservative. We liked the shampoos and soaps, a part of the well beeing there... Also the breakfast at the square is excellent and if you want to crab a drink in the evening, Bar Tomate provides all you need...",5,2023,05,02
32,My home away from home,"I have loved the building where The Terrace is located, the view takes my breath away. My family and friend are impressed with the amenities offered by Sonder and have plans to stay as well. Thank you",5,2023,04,28
32,Highly recommend this hotel!,"Never stayed at a Sonder hotel! This Barcelone hotel was awesome. Great location, great customer service and a great night's sleep! This hotel is walkable to everything. The front staff personnel, as well as that hard-working lady that serves breakfast each day, were awesome. I asked so many questions and they were so helpful. And, the room was quiet and clean. Just a great, great stay.",5,2023,04,20
32,Thank you Sonder and The Terrace at 18th,"This past fall, my husband was diagnosed with a rare condition that required intensive in-patient surgery at PennMed. Knowing that the hospital does not allow visitors overnight along with the fact we were driving up from Delaware - I needed a place to stay for the week my husband would be in the hospital. During a very trying time of my life when my focus and concern was on my husband, I knew I needed to find a place to stay alone that I felt safe in but also could get to the hospital quickly each day. This is where the Sonder property, the Terrace at 18th, comes into play. After searching for a reasonable rental for the week, my husband and I found the Terrace and booked it.
The surgery was intense for my husband, and recovery was not easy. Every morning I would get up, walk to grab coffee at the Wawa less than a block away from the Terrace, stop at the park between the Wawa and the Terrace, and prepare to go to the hospital. I would stay at the hospital for 10 hours a day, and sometimes not return to the Terrace until after 9pm. 
I parked in a garage literally within 1 minute from the apartment and never felt unsafe walking back to the building. Not only is the Terrace an excellent location for tourists in terms of being on the Ben Franklin Parkway and near all the museums, but it is perfect for someone like me who was in the city to be there for my husband at PennMed. Regardless of the fact that I previously lived in Philadelphia and am comfortable walking the city streets by myself, I felt that the Terrace and its location would make anyone feel comfortable no matter their experience in the city.
PennMed was less than a 10 minute drive and very easy to get to with GPS, even during busy morning rush hours. When I would leave and return, an employee would always be at the front desk to greet me and I never had any issues getting into the building or my apartment. At one point, I needed to change rooms due to his hospital stay being extended, and I was able to use the lockers in the Terrace Lobby to store all of our luggage for the entire time I was at the hospital that day. Again, there were no issues with the luggage storage and the availability of lockers was plenty.
Not only was this a safe place for me to return to each day and decompress, but the apartment itself was inviting and homely enough that I could attempt to relax for the evening in the open living room of the apartment or even on the private balcony overlooking the parkway. I wanted to find an apartment versus a hotel room as I knew I would be constantly stressed about my husband's surgery and recovery, and a hotel room would not have helped me relax. At the Terrace, I was able to feel as ""at home"" as possible in the evenings, and considering my appetite was not the best, the kitchen allowed me to eat at any time of the evening I felt compelled, which often turned out to be a bowl of ramen made with the kitchen accessories supplied. Unless you are attempting to cook a four course meal there, the kitchen supplies were perfect for basic cooking and there was plenty of storage space for anything I brought with me.
If I wanted to find something to eat, there were many places within walking distance that I could visit, including Victory Brewing which is literally attached to the Terrace and open until at least 9pm. Wawa, Manhattan Bagels, dine in restaurants and many small shops were close to the building so it was very easy to find anything I needed while staying there.
I can't say enough about how wonderful my stay was at the Terrace and I truly believe it is because I was able to stay in an apartment that I was able to function each day during such a stressful event in my life. The apartment was clean, spacious and exactly what we viewed online before booking. I am so glad we found this location and the ease of booking with the Sonder made the experience even better. I was not worried about some of the oddities of other rental groups in terms of the owners setting rules, lack of security, etc and the professionalism of the Sonder employees added to the experience's success. 
I would recommend the Sonder to anyone that wishes to stay in the city and wants to know they are staying in a safe, secure and comfortable location. Thank you Sonder group and the Terrace for being such a needed element to help my husband's surgery event go well for me as his wife, I am forever grateful.

32,Perfect stay!,"Gorgeous hotel, in a great location and we had the perfect stay! The hotel had all the facilities we wanted and the staff were all so welcoming and friendly. The hotel was in a relatively busy area but we found it so quiet in our room.",5,2023,04,18
32,Absolutely superb !,"Absolutely loved this hotel. Excellent location on Placa Reial. Only got about 18 rooms I think, the room we had was awesome. Large, corner plot overlooking places reial, all mod cons you could ask for, massive bed, seating area, superb bathroom. Staff were amazing and both wife and I said hands down the best breakfast we‚Äôd both had .",5,2023,04,14
32,Love Barcelona and love this hotel!,"I liked the location of the hotel. Even though this area could be considered to be in a very touristy area, I loved our Placa Reial in the Gothic Quarter.  The plaza was lively, vibrant and offered many places to eat. We enjoyed eating dinner at night and a mid-day beer at different restaurants in the plaza; it was fun to people watch.  The employees at the hotel were courteous, friendly and helpful. Our room was large, clean, well-maintained and had a great view of the plaza below.  The bed was super comfy.  Yes, the plaza can be noisy at night; but, it's nice noise (people having fun, not rowdy) and the hotel provides earplugs.  I actually had a great night's sleep!  The included breakfast was delicious and filling (we could not finish our meals).  We were able to walk to most tourist sites. To the places that were a bit farther (Sagrada Familia and Park Guell), we easily took a taxi as there is a taxi line outside of the hotel. Restaurants and shops are also within walking distance.  I highly recommend staying here!",5,2023,04,03
32,Interesting design boutique hotel with Limitations at a central & noisy location ,"It was about 8-9 years ago when I last visited Barcelona and back then I had passed by Placa Reial and had found it picturesque & appealing. On the placa rested the hotel Sonder DO which at the time had ""tickled my fancy"". Come 2023 revisiting Barcelona and decided to spend a romantic long week-end at Sonder DO. The hotel is a boutique hotel (18 rooms) with an attractive interior design that will definitely please. However when you are rated as a five star GL (Grand Luxe?) hotel the expectations rise dramatically and then the hotel fails to meet some of those high standards. The rooms are a good size (approx. 30-35 sq. meters) with nice design, large bed (king size) with standard cotton linen (but not luxury), very nice bathroom and decent bathroom amenities (but not any posh brand) fixed on the wall (environmental & sustainability reasons). Breakfast is barely OK as it is served in the basement and offers limited choices giving you the impression that they are trying to save money. Also, the service during breakfast is mediocre. The hotel claims that they have outsourced the breakfast and this is the reason of the different level of service. Albeit it may be true, it is not a good excuse. Also, due to the small size of the establishment, the common areas are very limited and the service provided cannot meet (although some are trying hard) the standards of a 5* + hotel. For a 4* hotel it is good, but not for a 5* +. As a conclusion, I cannot wholeheartedly recommend Sonder DO because also its location that once attracted me, has now become overtly touristic resulting in low-crime incidents (pick-pocketing, watch stealing, etc.) and very noisy!",3,2023,04,03
32,Great Boutique Hotel,"My wife and I stayed at DO Placa Reial for 6 nights.  This is a small boutique hotel with only 18 rooms. We were in room 12 which has a juliet balcony that you can even go out on and that has a wonderful view of the historic Placa Reial square.  This large square is lined with small restaurants/cafes and there is always something entertaining going on like street performers or scheduled local performances or vendors setting up booths selling everything from art, jewelry, clothes, to antique coins and stamps.  If you like music and night life this is a great location. It‚Äôs also on the street ‚ÄúRambles‚Äù which is lined with cafes, shops and things to do.  If you like Flamenco, then make reservations at Tablao Flamenco, right across the street for dinner and the show. It is amazing.
The staff here all spoke very good English and were always trying to be helpful in every and any way possible. Really great people. I want to especially thank Henry at the front desk for all his help. He is a terrific guy and great asset to the hotel.
The included free breakfast was good. My only comment would be that it could have more variety in terms of choices, but the service and food were both good.
Be aware that while the hotel has a bar, it does not really have indoor seating, however you are able to step outside to their tables and chairs and enjoy your drink (and tapas) as well. They have plenty of outdoor seating.
Room service is not really available, but if you order any food from their kitchen you can always take it up to your room. There‚Äôs also a pizza restaurant a few short steps away where you can order Italian to go.
Overall, I‚Äôd like to strongly recommend this hotel. The location is wonderful and the staff is terrific. It feels like Barcelona.",5,2023,04,01
32,Perfect Stay,"Lovely stay, we had an fantastisch time.

32,Best Hotel in the heart of Barcelona,"The rooms are very spacious with high ceilings, and a lovely view of the square. With the windows closed it was very quiet, even with people in the square until late hours of the morning. The location is perfect for seeing anything in Barcelona, with the metro station a short walk away. The room and common areas are modern and well-maintained, and very clean. I am totally impressed with the size of the rooms and how comfortable the beds are. Staff throughout the hotel were very friendly, from the front desk to restaurant staff. After staying in Barcelona a few times, I would stay at this hotel again.",5,2023,03,28
32,great city trip to Barcelona,really enjoyed the stay. The location of the hotel is outstanding and numerous sights can be reached on foot. The hotel staff were also very accommodating and always had good tips and recommendations.,5,2023,03,28
32,Great location and stay,"Perfect location in Philly with nearly every attraction less than a mile. 
Room nice and clean and every thing you need. 
Loved the gym, pool table. 
Definitely download the app to make check in less tricky. No cable, but you can stream with their Chromecast  easily from your phone or laptop as long as you download your streaming apps. ",5,2023,03,26
32,First time visiting Barcelona,My first time in Barcelona on a quick business trip. Perfect location and upon check in  (Alejandro? but didn‚Äôt get the other gentleman‚Äôs name) ) we‚Äôre so friendly! I booked room with private pool/patio and incredible views-I made the mistake of thinking pool was somewhat heated and it is not! So not worth staying in room w pool unless it‚Äôs summer time. Breakfast area so so-kind of cold atmosphere but was only there for one breakfast. I‚Äôm returning  in Sept and definitely will stay here. ,5,2023,03,25
32,"Great location, views from the balcony, and a lovely staff!","A great location and friendly, helpful staff. The staff made the stay relaxing and were always helpful with all of our requests, including when we asked for sauna time, help with booking tickets to a flamenco show, and hailing a taxi to the airport. We asked the staff for help on numerous occasions and they always responded with friendliness and competency. The views from our room onto Placa Reial were awesome. The bed was comfortable, the room spacious, and we also loved the sauna and got a lot of use out of it. 

The one thing that could be improved would be attentiveness to coffee/tea supplies in the room. The coffee machine was great and we would have appreciated having more available, plus plenty of creamer packets. Also, more tea varieties would go a long way with making the drink station a better highlight. But the whole stay was excellent and we highly recommend the Sondor DO Placa Reial!",5,2023,03,24
32,Excellent location ,"Location was great! The staff were warm, friendly and very helpful. Lots of food options, local and regular stores all Within walking distance. The Boqueira market is a 3 -5 min walk. The beach is about a mile away- you can‚Äôt go wrong with this hotel!",5,2023,03,24

I just walk out the door and everything is there e.g. restaurants, coffee, bars, clubs, shopping, etc. Very clean room and very helpful hotel staff. Also they had very comfy pillows.

The rooms were beautiful, elegantly furnished and very quiet with thoughtful details including my favorite brand of shampoo and care products!

32,Great view and comfy rooms,"Absolutely great place to stay, fantastic location and comfortable bed. 

All of the staff was nice and helpful.

We stayed for four nights and loved it due to its location in the Gothic Quarter and closeness to the Liceu station which allowed us to hop on and get around the city easily.

They often photographed pont brisbe is a quick five minute walk, La Rambla (if it‚Äôs your thing) is also right by this hotel.

We had the King room with balcony and it was idyllic for grabbing a Cortado and standing out on the balcony and just watching the people bustling in the Placa Reial.",5,2023,03,09
32,Very displeased with address,Couldn't find the address that was provide. Drove around all night trying to find the place did check into room until after 6AM. I was looking to get a credit to a refund for 1 night because of this experience?,5,2023,03,08

32,Amazing Experience,"I got an amazing experience staying in an apartment in Philadelphia (The Terrace). It felt like home actually. There was everything I needed here, a fully-equipped kitchen with all the cookware and utensils, a spacious beautiful living room and bedroom, great amenities in the building (game room, fitness center, club room, etc), and especially a balcony with amazing views of the city. 

It was absolutely beyond my expectations. I highly recommend checking out Sonder. I will definitely be back here. 

Thank you to the Sonder team for their wonderful job. ",5,2023,02,22
32,Great place to stay,"Cute small boutique style hotel. Loved the Juliet balcony, big room & bathroom, very clean. Breakfast included & very good. Good location, right on Pla√ßa Reail, in Las Ramblas strip, close to everything. Very very busy area, loud.",4,2023,02,17
32,Best Spot in Town,"This was our first vacation after a very trying few years and furthermore it was my husbands first time out after the success of his chemo; as you can imagine, I wanted it to be an exceptional experience and searched long and hard to settle on Do Sonder.

Sometimes things do not tend to go the way you had planned, and then other times they go WAY above expectations. Do Sonder was just that.  Above expectations.

We booked room 21, the King Suite with Juliet balcony, for a week and found it to be  an outstanding experience. The room itself is massive, more than enough for 2 people.  Overlooking Placa Reial with 2 balconies that open up to the square, you will never be bored.

The bathroom is gorgeous with a separate shower and separate toilet, something we much appreciated, and is equipped with up market toiletries, replenished every day, including razors, combs, toothpaste and brushes.  There is also coffee maker, kettle, and a small fridge.

The Suite was on the 2nd floor and although sometimes the sound from the square that never sleeps was a little excessive, it was never really an issue as after a certain hour it dies down.

That said we had no idea that we had arrived on the eve of Saint Eulalia's Festival, the Patron Saint of Barcelona, so for 3 whole days and nights most of the Gothic Quarter was throbbing with a sea of people.  At times when we were too tired out from site seeing and eating all the fresh amazing seafood at the market, we didnt have to even leave our rooms to be part of the party, we just sat back in our chairs and looked out at the square.  Perfect People watching.

Breakfast is provided and served in the basement.  Not as bad as it sounds because the space has very high ceilings and has a cosy welcoming feel.  The breakfast itself was perfect with 4 options to chose from.  This is not set as you could change and swap items if you fancied.  All the coffee was delectable and juice is freshly squeezed that morning.

There is a sauna accessible to the guests with prior booking.  We visited the sauna 4 times in a week :) and they even had a fridge with cold water as well as a tiled space to cool down if the heat got too much.  Also the space was spotlessly clean.

The staff are out of this world, with Gonzalo especially welcoming, although every single person in the Sonder Team was an asset to the Sonder brand.  All the staff speak multiple languages at a proficient level and are there to cater for your every need with a smile.  Nothing was too much and you were always left feeling special and cared for.

There is an outdoor space at the roof of the Sonder, although we didnt visit as we had too much to do.

We would usually have lunch at the outdoor market, La Bouqueria just up the Ramblas, with our preferred stand being 'The Universal Kiosk'.  If it is busy be sure to find the head waiter in order to be put on his list and soon you will be sat in front of the best seafood your heart can desire.

As for things to do in Barcelona, even 7 days were not enough to experience what this beautiful city has to offer.  Thankfully the Do Sonder is smack in the middle of the best and oldest part of the city, you will never need a cab to get anywhere and when you get tired you can just hop into your room and refresh.

Around about here might add this:  Make an attempt to visit anything Gaudi.  I had no idea how moving and special his works were and the visit to the Sagrada Familia was an event I will NEVER forget.  Go in the morning on weekdays in order to avoid crowds and to catch the morning light on the glass panels. Thankfully Guell Palace is just across the road from the Do Sonder. so perhaps this is a good first stop.  Also look out on Reial Square and you will see some of Gaudi's very first pieces of work.

If this is your first time in Barcelona or you want to treat someone special, this is the place to book.  I would not hesitate to book the Do Sonder again and would most enthusiastically recommend it to all my friends and family.

32,What a place !!!!,"Perfect Location. Staff Fantastic. 
When we first arrived we were met by the gentleman on reception who was polite and helpful. 
We stayed in Room 11 which looks over the square, opening the windows you are whisked away into another life.
Room was impeccable, The noise was the only issue but this was only a minor point and something to be expected being so close to the square .

10/10 for us. Lovely Place",5,2023,02,15
32,Wonderful and comfortable location,"Everything was the way it should be - great location, property, room, ambience, and service - for a competitive price.

Very comfortable!",5,2023,02,13

32,Great service!,"There is so much good to say about this place. The location is perfect, with easy access to public transportation. The hotel has a classy old world charm, and has successfully kept the hotel modern while still retaining details of the past. 
Pablo and his colleagues were very helpful, full of good recommendations and took action to address any small concerns.

My only less than perfect comment would be that the breakfast area is in the basement. The night time temps were low, and we found the breakfast area to be very cold in the morning. It is unfortunate as this took away from the enjoyment of an otherwise fantastic breakfast.",5,2023,01,24
32,There is no better place to stay.,"My wife and I visited Barcelona in January and had a spectacular experience. Most of that was due to the incredible, thoughtful, and kind people at Sonder.

32,Great place bad tech,"The space was great, loved the place for our stay. The tech in the building (front door and elevator) need work. 

Every time that I would use the front door or the elevator it was a fight. The touchscreen on the elevator doesn‚Äôt work right. If you touch a 6 it reads a 2. Not good when the code ends in 6! The front door sometimes just wouldn‚Äôt work at all no code no phone key. We had to buzz the front desk to get in. 

On the bright side great location and great room.",4,2023,01,15

The location is perfect to be able to walk to most areas, little tapas restaurants within a stones throw, and plenty of restaurants and bars in the square. The breakfast was tasty, if anything too much food for us as we eat light in the mornings, all freshly cooked and good produce. Staff are super friendly, special mention to Henry who greeted us on arrival and checked us out.

Within easy walking distance to subways, trains, hop on hop off buses. The staff were as nice and helpful as any staff I‚Äôve encountered.  Very personal service. The breakfast, not a buffet, was always delicious with several different selections and lovely staff.  Our room had a nice soaking tub and a great shower.  As with many European hotel rooms  it was on the small size but was plenty big enough.  I asked for a second chair in the room and received it with no problem.

We discovered an absolute gem of a hotel called Sonder Placa Reial, just a minute from Rambla de Mar, the famous walking street and bordering on Placa Reial, a beautiful square with a fountain and a number of indoor-outdoor restaurants;  all part of the Gothic Quarter.  The location is ideal for seeing the sights but also just a 10 minute walk to the very lovely harbour, recently developed.  The hotel is also recently renovated with very comfortable new rooms in a classic style and modern bathrooms with everything that you could desire.

32,Well located and clean. Look elsewhere for luxury experience.,"Hotel Review

We stayed in the king suite with private terrace and pool for our honeymoon in November. As far as we can tell this is their nicest room.
TLDR: The location is great and the staff was helpful. The hotel was clean and comfortable.  BUT, this is not a 5* hotel.  It is at best, a good 3* hotel. This gives a review of 4 green orbs. 

Things which were 5*
- The private terrace was amazing. 
- Customer service was amazing. 
- The fit and finish in the room, particularly the bathroom was great. 
- The location is 10/10. Amazing. 

Things where were 3*
- Premium suite next to late night bar.  Seems like an oversight and diminished the experience. 
- I could see through the towels. 
- The plumbing seems a bit wonky.  Really loud gurgling and sometimes smelly. 
- The electrical in the room is complicated. Easy to accidentally turn off all the outlets. We are fairly sure the electrical turned off on its own overnight cause the AC to also turn off.  And our electronics weren‚Äôt charged. 
- The air conditioner seems incapable of maintaining one temperature.  Seems there is an unlabeled switch that turns off the AC. Often hot overnight regardless of thermostat temperature. 
- The included breakfast has only three options.  While these are good, I‚Äôd expect either a broader selection or a variation from a 5* hotel.
- Room service was so hard to figure out that we have up. 

This is a great hotel in a great location but it doesn‚Äôt come close to other 5* hotels. If you get a good deal, stay here.  But don‚Äôt pay top dollar.",4,2022,11,15
32,Wonderful Hotel,Absolutely loved this hotel. Interior was clean and wonderfully designed. The location is also great as you're right off La Rambla and Placa Reial so plenty of famous spots to see within walking distance. Our room was very comfortable and spacious and also included a balcony.,5,2022,11,15
32,Sonder Philadelphia,"Great place everything we needed, beautiful neighborhood. Great comfy bed.  Roomy common space.  There was a gym, large rec room, and an outside deck that we were able to use on a beautifully warm November Saturday in the city.  Will definitely stay here again!",5,2022,11,14
32,Best Hotel in the city Center!,"Not only because the location is the best. The service is personalized and warm. The whole reception team welcomed us very well and explained many things about the city and the building. Thank you very much Jordi, Marina, Geo and David!

About the room, it is perfectly designed. Very comfortable and extremely clean, it is a pleasure to sleep in that bed! The bathroom is spacious and away from the bed. The arrangement of the furniture and the use of space is very well thought out. 

The hotel is boutique, cozy and functional. It has a small rooftop pool and a bar that is open from 17:00hs to 00:00hs. On the second floor there is a sauna, which is appreciated in these cold days in Barcelona. 

You can tell it is a classic hotel but adapted to modern times. You can communicate with the front desk through the Sonder app and by whatsapp!

The breakfast is amazing. This service is not part of Sonder but honestly the quality is very good and guess what... it's included! 

Being such a centrally located hotel and being located nothing more and nothing less than in the Pla√ßa Reial of the city, it is true that some nights it is a bit noisy. If you are looking for a quiet and peaceful place, don't go downtown! 

Nothing more to say. Thank you Sonder! We will definitely come back.",5,2022,11,14
32,The Only,Is it noisy? Yes. Is it inconvenient to drive down Las Ramblas? Yes. Doesn‚Äôt matter. The only place to stay. Simply best location.

32,Great little place in the heart of the Gothic quarter,"We had a wonderful stay at this hotel. We were lucky in that our room didn't face the Placa Reial directly so the noise from the square was minimal. If you are a light sleeper, this is not the place for you. Our room (15) was roomy and comfortable. The bathroom was very nice and stocked with various amenities. Best of all was the staff. Pablo was the absolute best. He was so helpful in giving advice about how best to see the sights, how to buy tickets, etc. He was a delight to work with and a great ambassador for the hotel chain! We had some internet issues while we were there and the staff in the afternoon reset the router to fix the issue. The staff at La Tomate (the restaurant where breakfast is served) were very pleasant as well. All in all, a terrific small boutique hotel and would most definitely stay there again and recommend to others.",5,2022,11,08
32,Terrific find!,"This was my first time staying at a Sonder or any short term rental that was not a hotel. I could not have been happier. A beautiful suite.

The couch is a pull out if you need an extra sleeping place. Be prepared to pay atleast 100$ for overnight parking in the parking garage next door. We stayed two nights and paid 104$ just in parking.,5,2022,10,07
32,Exceptional stay ‚ù§Ô∏è,"My husband and I stayed at this hotel for a few nights after our cruise. We were pleasantly surprised at the location.  Absolutely perfect and walkable to so much.  Staff was very helpful, pleasant, and professional.  The rooms were well adorned with all the amenities needed.  Excellent views from the terraces. Enjoyed a cocktail on their rooftop terrace:). Breakfast was delectable and service was excellent!!  Only small drawback is the noise at night ( worse on weekends than weekdays). They do provide ear plugs. Honestly- we were so tired after all the walking, sightseeing, sun, food, and drinking that we fell asleep with no problems. Highly recommend this hotel.",5,2022,10,04
32,Gorgeous!,"I was only in Barcelona for about 22 hours during a long flight layover on my way from Vienna to the US. I wanted to be somewhere fun, safe, and nice. This was the most gorgeous hotel suite I‚Äôve ever stayed in, and all of the staff members were great. Could not recommend more! I hope to go back and spend more time.",5,2022,10,01
32,Will definitely book this hotel again!,"- we stayed for 4 nights. 
- There is a place to storage your luggage if you arrive before check-in time. 
- Rooms are clean and comfortable with great view to the courtyard. 
- Breakfast is simple but elegant. It‚Äôs tasty and just the right amount for you to start your day. 
- The reception, Henry and Elsia. We‚Äôre lovely people, they helped us book our attractions in the city and ordered us cabs to the airport. They always made sure we had a good time. 
- Sauna, pool and a great rooftop, were all amazing and easy to use. 
- We didn‚Äôt have trouble using the app. It‚Äôs mainly for check-in. 
- Location is the best!! It‚Äôs in the center, safe and filled with people.
Can‚Äôt see any reason why not to book this again on my next trip to Barcelona.",5,2022,10,01
32,Sonder pla√ßa reial,A beautiful hotel in great location. Staff were very friendly and helpful and took great care of us. Hotel offered baggage storage before and after our check in/check out which very helpful as we could explore the city before catching our flight unencumbered,5,2022,09,28
32,Incredible!,Wonderful location on pedestrian street with center plaza. The service was impeccable. The room had 12‚Äô ceiling and impressive decor. We ate at their restaurant and LOVED their miso salmon so much we ordered a second plate for dessert.  Great locale. Would stay there again.,5,2022,09,26
32,Great location and staff,Great staff very friendly and helpful. Rooms nicely appointed and clean. Great location on the square.  Rooftop bar has a wonderful view and the bartender is very talented. Breakfast was very good. Only downside was that wifi was out when we were there but they comped us with free breakfast to make up for it.  Pool very small,5,2022,09,26
32,Beautiful boutique hotel in a perfect location,"Absolutely beautiful hotel.  Location can't be faulted, off La Rambla in an amazing square. The room was very well appointed with high ceilings, a very comfy bed and a massive bathroom (two showers!). Perfect for couples to spend a weekend exploring Barcelona and getting lost in the Gothic Quarter.

Honestly can't fault it at all. I'm writing this with a coffee on the square watching the world go by and I don't want to go home...",5,2022,09,26
32,"Charming, clean, comfortable & close to so many things!","I  chose this hotel based on previous reviews and it was in Placa Reial just off of La Rambla.  The room was not ready when I   arrived off the MSC Cruise ship much earlier then check in time but Roberto & a lovely young lady were at the desk.  They offered to keep my bags and Roberto took a lot of time recommending restaurants and showing me places on the map.  The young lady ( sorry I   forgot her name) was very helpful with my bags when I   returned later to check in.  The only issue I   had was my adaptor did not work with their plugs but another young lady who worked 9/24 to 11pm ( sorry forgot her name) offered to keep some of my things and use the charger at the lobby desk.  She also suggested some activities for me Saturday evening for the festival. Everyone was so very friendly and knowledgeable at the lobby desk.  My room was spacious and overlooked the fountain.  The bathroom was large with a towel heater.  They had a tea pot with tea bags & cups to make tea in the morning.  There was also a mini frig and safe, luggage rack and large closet.  I  took a look a the roof top pool and lounge area.  It was lovely but it was a cool afternoon.  I'm sure I   warmer months it wood be a great place to relax after a day in the city and enjoy the spectacular views.  If I   was there longer, I  think I  would like my morning coffee/tea up there.  My  breakfast was included in the cafe outside overlooking the square.  It was a lovely place to have a meal.  I  mentioned to the waiter that I  was heading to airport and was in a bit of a hurry.  He had my scrambled eggs, tomatoes, toast & tea ready in less than 10 minutes and they were absolutely delicious.  The service, and charm of this hotel is worth a try.  The location is just a bonus!  I will be back!!  Thank you to Roberto for taking so much time to answer all of my questions.  And everyone else at the lobby desk on 9/24- 9/25 were all very very helpful and polite. Thank you!",5,2022,09,25
32,"Comfortable, convenient, and safe","Nice buliding in a good area of the city.  Easy walk to convenience store, food market, banks, pharmacies, and restaurants.  Quick 10 minute walk to the beautiful Rittenhouse Square.  

Front desk folks are friendly and helpful.  Check-in and out was easy.

Good wifi and A/C.  Can't speak to the TV since we didn't use it.

Kitchen well-equipped, dishwasher works great, king size bed very comfortable, good linens, plenty of towels.

Free washer/dryer right across the hall.

You could easily have a dinner party considering the kitchen being well-stocked.

SUGGESTIONS  for improvement:  supply a baking /casserole dish and try to fix the shower as the pressure is quite low and only lukewarm.

All in all, I enthusiastically recommend this apartment for a short or long-term stay.",4,2022,09,24
32,"Amazing Hotel, Great Location !","Spacious rooms, modern upgrades, super clean, super friendly staff and in the heart of Las Ramblas‚Ä¶. Who can ask for anything more ?

Drinks on the rooftop terrace overlooking the square below was always a perfect end to a great day !

Will definitely come back!",5,2022,09,20
32,First Timer,"This was my first time using Sonder. I‚Äôve used multiple lodging apps and I‚Äôll definitely use Sonder again. The location was only a few blocks from the start of my half marathon, which was why we were in town. The place was stylish, spacious, spotless, and offered exceptional security. 10/10 would definitely recommend. It‚Äôs perfect for a couple, had great bed linens and endless hot water. Well done Sonder!",5,2022,09,19
32,Excellent Location,"The room was very nice - large, well-equipped, has a nice little balcony. My only complaint is that it has a very modern-vibe furniture wise and it looks lovely, but I wish some of the furniture was a little more comfortable.
Everything else was excellent, great location right on the parkway next to the museums, downtown, close to tons of public transit options. Also, check out is 11 but there are storage lockers you can use to put your luggage if you have a later flight, and also a ton of space on the second floor where you can relax and watch tv and hangout until you actually need to head back to the airport. Very preferable to just having to sit around somewhere with all our luggage for 3+ hours.",5,2022,09,18
32,Wonderful stay,"The unit is beautiful and really well equipped. You feel like at home , location is great.  The only thing to improve is internet access, I was traveling with friend from Europe and the moment she left the apartment internet connection was gone . Is really inconvenient to order the Taxi or Uber . Also elevator notification could be on lower value when you sleep in the living room you hear them .",5,2022,09,17
32,Incredible,"Location - excellent 
Staff - excellent - especially front desk 
Room - excellent - pool was perfect in the heat and terrace was to die for. 
Breakfast - excellent 

So good we have already booked to return!",5,2022,09,16
32,Girls weekend,"Beautiful room with all the amenities that we needed, was very central to everything we wanted to do and nothing was too far of a walk, had a little trouble getting into the room but called the service line and they answered and got us in our room within minutes, was very pleased and would stay here or at any Sonder owned place again.",5,2022,09,12
32,Great hotel,We had a really lovely stay at this hotel. The staff were really great. A very laid back vibe but focused on helping wherever needed. We Really enjoyed the rooftop bar and plunge pool. Really nice breakfast. Location just brilliant for exploring the area.,5,2022,09,06
32,Fabulous stay,"The hotel exceeded our expectations, the room was absolutely stunning with great lighting, spacious layout, ample cupboard space and huge mirrors. Very comfortable bed and a warm welcoming environment.",5,2022,09,05
32,Loved it!,"Loved it. Great staff. Great location. Great breakfast. I‚Äôve said what I wanted to say but 200 words have bee asked for so what else? I was concerned about the check in because we were arriving so late, at 10pm, on the train but there was someone there to greet us so I needn‚Äôt have worried. 
Be aware: The Placa Reial is perhaps the busiest touristy square in Barcelona so it‚Äôs throbbing until 3am. We were on the third floor and it was fine but close the windows and shutters if you yearn for a sleepless night. Worth it though. It‚Äôs such a vibrant atmosphere in the square.
We‚Äôve stayed in Barcelona many times but we‚Äôd definitely come again.",5,2022,09,05
32,We loved it,"Premium location for visitors. The decoration is fantastic as soon as you have entered the lobby. The crew is very helpful. The room was just perfect and very comfortable. 
Bonus: the rooftop terrace with the swimming-pool, a drink, and a splendid view over Barcelona and Pla√ßa Reial !",5,2022,09,01
32,"Very nice , great attention during my stay, 5 stars","both the situation of the hotel, strategically located in the royal square and the care provided by the hotel staff: Perfect. (Special mention to the boy on the day shift who helped me with some personal administrative procedures and recommended the best places to eat/dine).

As for the room, I stayed in the penthouse suite, where I spent a brief but spectacular stay enjoying the private pool. A mix of relaxation and disconnection in the middle of the city.

100% recommended, this hotel brand has pleasantly surprised me.

Greetings.
Jorge (Madrid)",5,2022,08,29
32,Fantastic,"Fantastic location, great amenities and super clean.  We will look for Sonder properties in other cities we plan to visit!  We want to especially thank the phone support person who guided us through pre-check in and Rob, the tech/maintenance expert on site.",5,2022,08,27
32,LOVED! Can I come back for a full month? (But seriously!),"The room photos do no justice, absolute luxury and a steal for the price! Everyone was also SO kind to me and helpful. I honestly am going to inquire to get a 1 month rate. The location, the free breakfast, the staff..everything SO lovely!",5,2022,08,26
32,Great place!,Such a wonderful place to stay. Instructions for check in/check out were very detailed.  Chat service was quick to respond with any questions. Clean and perfect for a stay in Philliy. So close to many attractions and plenty of dining. Highly recommend!,5,2022,08,20
32,Great location and property,"This property is an apartment building where several of the floors are Sonder rental property. The building was in a great location, super close to Logan Square and the Franklin institute, making it easy to access transit options and attractions. The building was easy to access with a code for the building and the apartment and an elevator access code for the Sonder specific elevator. We (1 parent, 1 teen, 1 preteen) stayed in a 1 bedroom apartment with a king bed and a pullout in the main space. We didn't find the building noisy or hear a lot of external noise (we were on the 7th floor). The kitchen had what we needed to prepare simple meals and even a small dishwasher. The chromecast TV was easy to use. There was a lot of light coming into the main space at night since there was not blackout curtain on the balcony door. It didn't see bother the teen who slept out there though and kept them from sleeping until noon. There is a donut shop off the building's lobby which made for an easy breakfast of - better than dunkin - donuts. We'd definitely stay again if we ever visit Philadelphia in the future.",5,2022,08,19
32,Great Stay In A Busy Spot,"This hotel was a mini sanctuary in the hustle and bustle of Barcelona‚Äôs Rambla. The attached restaurant was fantastic. Customer service as wonderful. The hotel room was clean, modern and efficient with well thought out features and design.  Super!!!",5,2022,08,15
32,Great little find!,"We were looking for a small, well located hotel in Barcelona and couldn‚Äôt have been more pleased with our choice! Room was lovely, with everything you could need. Great attention to detail, even down to little things like the lighting. Roof top bar was fab and breakfast delicious. Exceptionally well located too, although as others have mentioned a little noisy, but thats all part of the ‚Äòheart of the city‚Äô experience I think and didn‚Äôt really bother us! Wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to stay again and would recommend to all.",5,2022,08,14
32,couldn't be better,"Super place to stay if you want to be in the middle of everything, and in style and comfort.  I cant think of a single thing that could be improved.  The staff was friendly, breakfast was good, view from room was excellent, the bed was comfy, the bathroom was big,...",5,2022,08,13
32,Perfectly located!,Thoroughly enjoyed my 8 night stay! Conveniently located to all that Philadelphia has to offer. Very secure and safe access to building and room. Clean and attractive layout of rooms. Great bed and shower.,5,2022,08,08
32,love it,"loved my stay, best way to end your trip in barcelona. very cozy rooms, felt like home. elevator was down during my stay though. it is noisy outside but lots of things to do, very touristy area so its hard to get a taxi but receptionists were amazing.",5,2022,08,07
32,Nice location,"There is Phlash bus stop by the hotel. The Phlash bus is free if you have a Septa card. The location is convenient to go to tourist attraction, restaurant, grocery stores and Septa stops. The common area on the second floor is very nice. 
The kitchen is well equipped in the room. They even supply salt and pepper, olive oil. We can cook meals.",5,2022,08,07
32,"Big rooms, but the staff is what made it great!","What a beautiful (big!) room in a perfect location! Bed was super comfy. High ceilings, great AC, bath and shower with lovely products. Great food at the restaurant.  
The staff was particularly wonderful- Paulo and Geraldo made everything better with their hospitality and great recommendations. I would definitely stay here again.",5,2022,08,03
32,Best place in Las Ramblas,"This is a must stay in Las Ramblas.  It is centrally located to all attractions.  The front and entrance of the hotel opens into the royal courtyard.  There are lots of restaurants and open space so you don't feel like you are right on the main street.  We arrived earlier than check-in.   Pablo was at reception and did an amazing job taking care of us.  We had done the check-in online and that made it seamless.  He took our bags for storage and then took my number so he could let us know when the room was ready.  We were actually able to get in about 3 hours earlier than check-in.  Pablo also offered suggestions for places to grab coffee and breakfast.  
We returned to check in and our bags were already in the room.  I asked Pablo about a few wine bars friends had suggested and he knew 2 of the 3 - actually friends of his owned 1 of them.  With his wealth of knowledge, we found the right place for us.  Having such a welcoming experience at the reception was one of the bet parts of our stay.  
Our room was beautiful.  It was spacious and had all amenities.  I  will say that it is loud at night but am not counting this as a negative - Las Ramblas is a party late into the night and early morning so it was expected.  The hotel does provide ear plugs beside the bed.   The rest of the property is lovely as well.  There is a rooftop bar and small pool.  
We will stay here again and we will try other Sonder hotels.",5,2022,08,01
32,Sonder in Philadelphia,"We stayed in a Sonder unit in Philadelphia! It was absolutely wonderful. We have stayed with Sonder in Boston and Savannah and we have always been extremely happy. The bedding is wonderful, the space is extremely clean, and always wonderful kitchens. Can‚Äôt wait to stay with them again! PS my son is getting married in Nashville and I‚Äôm trying to get everybody to stay with Sonder!",5,2022,07,25
32,Great surprise,"I wasn't really expecting much to be honest. Did not know the city or the Sonder appartements. When I walked in, it was such a great surprise. Really clean, really convenient and well organized. Much bigger than expected. I stayed for 3 days, but I could have easily do a week or two in there. If I ever go to another city, I will look for a Sonder appartement.",5,2022,07,24
32,Wonderful stay!,"Wonderful hotel! The staff worked with us when our air conditioning did not work. They found us a suitable solution and upgraded us. The hotel was beautiful and every detail was thought of! They even provide a shaving kit, sewing kit, lotion, etc. The pool is a huge plus as well. Highly recommend!!",5,2022,07,23
32,July 18th 2022 stay.,"The staff at the hotel are so wonderful and helpful. Our baggage was lost with the airlines for a few days and they were so helpful dealing with that situation. Also, the room, food, and overall service was top notch! It was a wonderful stay even with the baggage problems.",5,2022,07,21
32,"LOVED our Sonder, perfect location and amazing property","Our room was large with a great view of the Plaza. Bed was comfy, shower was amazing. It was very noisy at night but we ended up staying up late one night just to join the party!  It's super quiet if you want to sleep in but between 3-5am there can be some rowdy party goers outside.  The rooftop pool was a nice way to relax when we weren't out enjoying the city. and the food at Bar Tomate was all delicious!! We had a wonderful honeymoon there and will definitely look for a Sonder anytime we travel for a long period of time again, it was a beautiful home for 6 days!",5,2022,07,08
32,Central location but reasonably quiet.,"Great private pool, room is only guest room on top (4th) floor so easy to access the terrace which was rarely used by anyone else.
 The hotel is right on Placa Reial so there was noise and hustle and bustle but nothing disturbing or annoying. Ear plugs are provided but with the sliding doors shut I slept soundly. We had more noise from hotel guests going on to the terrace late at night.
 Air con was great in the room, TV was old and strange to operate - I used a Firestick to get access to content. Shower is great although at night with the light on, the large window to the side of the shower may allow people to see in. They would have to be in apartments several blocks away though. During the day, due to the privacy tint, you are perfectly safe.
 Room has a small fridge which we crammed a few items into. Maybe could have benefitted from an ice machine somewhere within the hotel (or a larger fridge).
Staff were pleasant, room was cleaned every day. It was expensive but we thought it was worth it. I would return.",5,2022,07,08
32,Great stay in central Barcelona,"Very nice location, room and staff. Highly recommended for an urban holiday in Barcelona. The staff was very attentive and took great care of us. The decor of the room was really nice and the bathroom outstanding. We stayed in the king suite and it was spacious and  cozy. Will definitely book again.",5,2022,07,06
32,Great location and friendly Staff!,Great Staff and great location! The room was amazin! Hope to to visit again someday. Food was great as well in the restaurant. We also liked the design and furiture in our room. I can recomend this to anyone who want a central location in the beautiful gothic quarters.,5,2022,07,06
32,Lovely hotel in perfect location,"The absolute best staff in Barcelona!!  Room was beautiful and clean. The location is right on the plaza which is a busy place but the hotel leaves comfortable ear plugs so you can drown it all out if you want.  The rooftop is lovely as well, but the pool really isn‚Äôt a pool, more of a wading pool. But I enjoyed an afternoon up there!",5,2022,06,30
32,Perfection in Barcelona,This Sonder is absolutely breathtaking! The high ceilings and gorgeous decor was beautiful! Not to mention the kind staff and great restaurant! The view from the balcony into the plaza was the best! Would recommend anyone to stay here!,5,2022,06,29
32,Excellence in Every Way!,"Absolutely the best experience you can imagine. From the hospitality, beauty of the rooms, perfect cleanliness, rooftop, location and decor, I felt completely taken care of. I also felt very safe as a solo traveler. The staff are very helpful and friendly.  I now understand the 5 star experience. A fabulous home to have when adventuring Barcelona. Gracias para todos!",5,2022,06,28
32,Great Locations for Museums,The location allowed us to easily walk from the bus station and to all museums and local attractions. Local buses were available if unable to walk. Lots of restaurants also in the area. Did not need to take any public transportation or taxis.,5,2022,06,27
32,Amazing location and amazing staff!,"Would highly recommend staying here.  The location is second to none,  Alway something happening in Placa Real, lots of restaurants, bars and places to people watch.  Easy to walk everywhere around the city and to the beach.  The staff (Luciia and all the staff we encountered) were friendly and super helpful and we couldn't have asked for more.  This is a small boutique experience we thoroughly enjoyed.",5,2022,06,24
32,"Worst hotel ever, please do not stay here !","We booked this hotel for Sonar Festival as it was in a great location, but on day 1 the AC broke down and the reception told us that there was a misunderstanding with the engineers that fix the AC and that we would have to spend the night with no AC and to open the windows. To give you an idea, it was 34 degrees that night, no breeze and there was an event in the square below, so the noise was unbearable. 

We managed to get the front desk to agree to cancel the booking and refund the money for the stay, so we could move to another hotel. We moved to the new hotel which was more expensive, but Sonder refused to pay for the difference in rate and even refused to pay for our taxi to the new property which we had to take at 12 at night. 

Additionally they refused to give us a direct number to the General Manager and told us it will take 15 days to get our refund and that they could not speed the process. We‚Äôre 7 days in since our checkout date and when we called booking.com today they told us that they still haven‚Äôt heard from the hotel to confirm the refund and when we call or email the hotel to one picks up.

Please don‚Äôt stay here ever, avoid at all cost, there are much better hotels in Barcelona that offer a better value and service.",1,2022,06,21
32,"Clea, spacious, great location","Excellent stay, near museums and lots of restaurants.  Quiet at night. Everything was spotless. Kitchen had everything...even dishwasher. Lots of good clean towels in the bathroom.  Well supplied for all travelers' needs.",5,2022,06,15
32,Modern place to stay in great location + many on-site perks,"Freshly renovated building. Has its own common area, pool table, game room, large terrace overlooking the bvld. Best is the large gym it offers, very well equipped. 

The location is the best in Phila, you have one of the best parks right under your window. Every main thing is within walking distance. 

Rooms are also very well equipped, you can cook a Thanksgiving dinner there if you want. 

Perfect for more extended stays as well.",5,2022,06,12
32,Perfect location!,Great pricing. Awesome AC! Location was ideal for us...we could walk everywhere! HENRY WAS INCREDIBLE...COULD NOT BE HAPPIER WITH HIS PROFRESSIONAL SERVICE! Seriously...this fellow needs to be promoted ASAP! Thanks Henry!!!,5,2022,06,10
32,Beautiful hotel in an amazing location,"We stayed in room 47 with the private pool and terrace and it was absolutely beautiful. A perfect little oasis in the city. Location was amazing, right in the Gothic Quarter with hundreds of bars and restaurants minutes away. We arrived early and our room was already ready - couldn't fault anything!",5,2022,06,09
32,"Stunning hotel, outstanding location, helpful and friendly staff","Beautiful hotel in outstanding central location.   We had a lovely room with enormous bathroom and small balcony overlooking the lovely square.  We were able to check in early at 11am which was hugely appreciated.   Friendly and helpful staff and wonderful location just off the Ramblas and in  a beautiful square lines with cafes and restaurants  in the heart of the Gothic quarter. 
Lovely rooftop terrace with a small pool.  
We loved our stay here and would highly recommend.",5,2022,06,08
32,Amazing!,"We recently visited Spain and our highlight was time spent in Barcelona.  The location of Sonder DO Placa Reial is nothing short of AMAZING.  Situated just off the Ramblas, overlooking a beautiful square buzzing with activity and nightlife, and a short stroll into the heart of the Gothic area.  Amidst the nightlife and excitement that is Barcelona,  the rooms at the hotel still manage to be quiet and are stylishly decorated.  The staff were helpful - especially Augusto who went out of his way to make our stay unforgettable.",5,2022,05,11
32,A Perfect Stay in Barcelona,"My wife writes: ""Sonder DO, Pla√ßa Reial.  Augusto helped us immediately when we showed up early (9:00am) and feeling a bit lost after our long walk from a taxi near the Barcelona's cruise port. He helped us with our bags from La Rambla. The room was lovely with a large rain shower and comfortable bed. A rooftop terrace with a pool and delightful view of the Gothic quarter is found on the fourth floor. The location is perfect on Pla√ßa Reial with restaurants and bars outside the hotel, palm trees with parakeets and early Gaudi lamp posts. La Boqueria market is within easy walking distance and the Metro is steps away. Evening was a delight as local families came to dine and enjoy the pla√ßa. A team of acrobats suddenly appeared one evening and performed. Children played with aerial spinning lighted tops. The kind and efficient caf√© staff brought us a delicious breakfast with eggs, fruit, yogurt, toast, croissant, fresh orange juice and cappuccino. The afternoon tapas were excellent. The afternoon, evening and morning staff took care of all our needs and arranged a 6am taxi for the airport. We will hold wonderful memories from our stay at Sonder DO Pa√ßal Reial.",5,2022,05,09
32,let's be fair here,"well - I'll try to be objective. Yes, the location is great, yes, the building is impressive. But yet the entire experience is disappointing. The place had almost no public spaces, everything small and cramped. ""Reception"" is a   small desk in a corner with a clerk person, looking at various screen and smartphones apparently watching security cameras of other properties and taking care of multiple tasks. It seems to be the only staff at this Hotel. Bad luck if 2 or more guests need  to be attended to,  or bad luck if the clerk is simply not there ( suppose there are coffee breaks and bathroom times) - feels strange to be in a high category Hotel with no staff. its odd to see people have breakfast in that small public are on a sofa with trays on their knees, no -one want to sit in the totally inhospitable and windowless basement dining room. Come down early morning and  the bulk of the little public space on the ground floor is used as storage area for their outdoor Restaurant furniture. Location is great on the map and during day time. But careful at night - many homeless people roaming right next to the entrance, massive police presence, loads of people on the square, a general feeling of in-comfort being in the area after dark. They have some really nice rooms, but they describe them as SUITES which, per definition, they are not, really misleading this, annoying .  A big room is a big room and a suite is suite (with a physical separation between sleeping and sitting, have a meeting without having to look at an unmade bed...). Why would the misrepresent ?  My experience was furthermore shadowed by the hotel companies APP and communication, which is totally chaotic and bothering. And prepaid reservation is also something that is uncomfortable..  come back, no . Recommend to friends? no.",2,2022,04,29
32,April visit,"We booked Sonder after visiting Barcelona many times and enjoying the square outside and when we found this hotel we knew it would be the best location for us. We booked for 3 nights in a Balcony room, the check in was simple, not much conversation from the staff, and as seen on reviews online a welcome drink was normally offered however we received no drink, just our keys. 

The room itself is beautiful, however a little dark, huge comfy beds and clean towels. The bathroom was well stocked with thoughtful amenities, robes, slippers and big bottles of shower gel/shampoo/conditioner, but no moisturiser was in the rooms.  As advertised we thought we would have complimentary water in the rooms and a mini bar but unfortunately no water and the fridge was empty. The room had no iron. The kettle was a nice touch with teas and coffees (no milk) and a small jar of sweets. 

We asked about breakfast as we thought this was included but the reception staff said we didn‚Äôt have breakfast but never explained how much breakfast was or how to get breakfast other than I believe it was on the terrace. 

We went up to the terrace and it was a lovely area, however no service was up there, it was basically closed, the pool area is very small with two sun beds and no towels for the beds. We did ask if we could have drinks on the terrace and we got them from downstairs and took them up ourselves, the staff kindly brought us some food up when we ordered lunch, which was delicious. 

We did request a few items during our stay which were promptly brought to us, which was helpful. 

To say this hotel is 5* in my opinion it is lacking many features, I have stayed in 4* hotels before which have exceeded expectations so when a few things were lacking it was a shame. 

The location is brilliant, the design and details are lovely in the hotel but it does need to refine a few things in order for me to give a happy 5* rating on here. 

The main things that were missing for me were only small things such as the welcome drink, more info on the hotel facilities, the lack of water in our rooms, no mini bar, no moisturiser, the Mirror was cracked and sharp in our bathroom, and the seal around the shower was mouldy. It would have been lovely to have our stay more personalised or asked questions as we were celebrating it would have been nice to have this recognised. For the price we paid we feel like we had a fair deal for location but all in all the hotel did lack a few things.",4,2022,04,27
32,Great boutique hotel in the heart of the Gothic Quarter.,"Fantastic location just off the busy La Rambla. Our room looks over the square. Although the square can be busy, there is no noise once the windows are closed. The room is airy with a high ceiling and well equipped. 

Residents have access to the roof terrace which a great view of Pla√ßa Reial and the skyline of Barcelona. 

The staff is helpful and friendly. 
The restaurant is an informal caf√© with outdoor seating on the square. Menu consists of tapas and a few main courses.",5,2022,04,21
32,Never again,"We spent one night here and were absolutely disappointed. The check-in took over 15 minutes (and we were the only ones). There was no water in the room- neither bottled free of charge nor in the mini bar. The mini bar itself was also empty but a few sweets. Room was really small itself which surprised us too. However, the best part was that when we returned to the hote at 1 am it was closed, our keys did not work and after ringing the bell a few times and knocking on the door, noone answered. We then had to call the hotel to be let in which was a very strange experience - especially because the staff said there is someone there 24/7. 

Finally, when we checked out we were asked if everything was ok and we raised our points - to which it was replied- hmm, strange. And that‚Äôs it. Personally, not worth a stay and would not be back even if the location is great.",1,2022,04,16
32,OPERA INN SRINAGAR,"An excellent  Hotel, with spacious Rooms, nice Breakfast and Dinner with highly dedicated hospitality. Being little out of the city you save time from traffic to reach out side spots. Mr Nazir Sahab is too good a Host to provide any help and advice.
Thans a lot to all Staff including Mr Mudassar.Will be a repeat show.

32,Barcelona Vacation,Location in the Gothic Dist is perfect. Everything is walkable and central. The staff is super friendly and helpful. Rooms were small but updated and very nice. Best shower in a hotel ever.  Restaurants markets very easy to access.,5,2022,03,26
32,Very comfortable.,We really enjoyed our stay.  The hotel is well located and the room and ensuite were well equipped and clean.  The bed was very comfortable.  We didn‚Äôt eat in the hotel as we went room only.  I‚Äôm assured their food was very good.  The guys on reception were extremely helpful and happy to deal with any requests you made of them.  We wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to book again with them.,5,2022,03,17
32,New Favorite Hotel in Barcelona!,"Great hotel.  Location is fantastic.  Rooms are very nice, especially the corner suites.
Rooftop bar and pool!
Very clean and daily service.

Best thing was the staff.  They were all pleasant attentive and polite.

We will definitely book here again!",5,2022,03,03
32,Great stay will come back!,"It was a wonderful stay. The hotel is in a great location. The staff was great and very helpful!
The room was very spacious and well decorated. And the bathroom was amazing. The shower was very big. All the way up they have a pool which is amazing to swim in. Overall a 10/10 experience. ",5,2022,02,17
32,Family vacation,"It was good service, Good place to stay here. Finally staff is very polite and good to be here, especially like Shubhadra, Ramana, teja very good staff and house keeping department was nice. Finally thanks!",5,2022,02,16
32,In general a good experience,"In general we liked our stay at Do Placa Reial. 
The strongest point is definitely hotels location, which is extremely convenient for discovering and moving around the city. The rooms are also beautiful. 
The common areas are quite small but as we were staying at Do Placa Reial in December 2021 (during pandemic still)  it was not overcrowded. The breakfast room is in the basement but quite spacious and bright. We were the only ones to have breakfast at that time but the service was really really nice and the food was really good.

My biggest problem about DO Placa Reial was the noise at night- there were homless people gathering just in front of the hotel on Saturday night and, I guess, celebrating, so it was really noisy. But well, most probably that is the price to pay to be well located during day discoveries in Barcelona.",4,2022,02,14
32,"Great location, great room and great staff","The staff were very friendly and accommodating. They all spoke English very well, and having a staff member available 24 hours was very reassuring. We stayed in the ""King Suite w/ Balcony Square View"" room, which had a (small) balcony overlooking the plaza. The room itself was impeccable. I loved the vaulted ceilings, the double bathroom sinks and showerheads- everything felt very spacious for a european room. I would definitely stay here again.  

I have nothing but praise for the hotel itself and the staff.  The parent company, Sonder, has some work to do.  I sent them an email before my stay and never got a reply. I also requested an early check-in via the app which was denied, however on arrival the staff clearly had not seen that request and they were able to shift things around for us to accomodate a somewhat-early check in. Several more things- not worth listing them all here. But I would not hold this against the hotel,  Sonder just has some work to do.",5,2021,12,25
32,Great staff and perfect location.  Wonderful plaza view.,"We arrived to be greeted by a thoughtful manager.  The food on their plaza was delightful and the plaza activity entertaining.  The adjacent plaza embraces a variety of restaurants and weekend music.  Sundays have a variety of antique sales tables in the plaza.  Our room was large, spiffy clean, and well-appointed.  We also enjoyed the rooftop pool area.  We  will return.",5,2021,10,16
32,"Amazing authentic place, great location and helpful staff","Sonder DO Placa Reial has a great authentic atmosphere, beautiful rooms and a very serviceminded staff. It is located in the very center of Barcelona meaning that we walked to the sights and when sights were too far away (Tibidabo) public transport is only two minutes away. Many great restaurants nearby. Great experience. Thank you.",5,2021,07,27
32,Sonder Do Placa Reial Barcelona,"Where to begin? The hotel location was right on Las Ramblas, walking distance to the beach and smack ON the plaza which in the evening is a hub of music, people, and fantastic dining options Most amazing was the personal attention from the front desk/concierge team of Silvia and Laura. Their attention to detail and help with everything (suggested shopping, dining, shows, directions, etc.) made all the difference in our stay. The hotel photos are true to life and totally accurate. It's as good in real life as the photos appear. The only difference was that the basement dining room was closed at the time of our visit. So, if coming to Barcelona, don't waste time looking for a better priced hotel; this place was a total deal for anyone looking for VALUE for your money; impeccably clean, good sheets, bathrobes, great location,  spacious rooms, refrigerator stocked with complementary water bottles and safe in our room, and a beautiful rooftop. Breakfast was also delicious, although a little on the pricey side. Regardless, we will definitely be back!",5,2021,07,23
32,I'd give higher than 5 stars if I could!!,"Absolutely fantastic hotel!  The staff is incredible, the location is awesome, and the rooms are luxurious!  If I could come up with more glowing superlatives I'd add them! 
Our flight arrived at 6:40 AM from the US so we were at the hotel by about 7:30 in the morning.  Check in time isn't until 3 PM which we knew and were prepared to leave our bags and walk around for hours.  Luckily they had a room available and allowed us to go ahead and check in.  Made for a wonderful nap before exploring the city in the afternoon!  The rooms aren't particularly large, but everything is so luxurious that the extra space isn't needed.  Plenty of storage both in the room and bathroom.  The bed and bedding is amazing - you can even choose from a ""pillow menu"" if you don't like the feather pillows that are on the bed.  I'd kill to have that bathroom and shower at home - and the upscale toiletries, robe, slippers, and towel warmer just topped off the deal!  Every evening there is a nice treat in the room, fruit and/or pastries, and of course the turn down chocolate.
The location right on the plaza was perfect.  Loved looking out our little balcony to the activity below.  But have no fear, the windows are very soundproof and (except for the English football fans that chanted late into the night one night) you don't hear the sounds from outside. And it's very central - an easy walk to the harbor/beach or further into town the other direction.  Or just cruise up and down Las Ramblas  right outside.  Also close to a metro stop so you can get anywhere else you might want to go.
Oh, and the rooftop deck!  It was a bit chilly when we were there but we spent time up there anyway.  I imagine in the warmer months it's the place to be!
I really can't say enough wonderful things about the Hotel Do - our entire 6 night stay was perfect from start to finish.  No question about ever staying anywhere else if/when we return to Barcelona.",5,2020,03,02
32,World class hotel in perfect location,"My wife and I stayed at the Hotel DO after a Mediterranean cruise so that we could explore Barcelona. The service, accommodations, and food are world class. Oscar the hotel manager, and David, the restaurant Manager, were both outstanding making sure that our stay was perfect.  The location is perfect in the heart of the Bari Gothic within walking distance of everything.  We will absolutely stay there anytime we return to Barcelona.",5,2020,02,16
32,"Outstanding boutique hotel inPlaca Reial, Barcelona","I travel at least 70 nights a year for business. This time Barcelona was a lay over to my final business destination in Malaga, and decided to stay in a boutique hotel. What a fantastic experience! The personalized experience at the Hotel DO, was above any expectation. This hotel by far exceeded my expectations. The personnel at the hotel were super helpful, and tried to make your stay even more special. I will definitely stay here again during my next visit in Barcelona! Fully Recommend.",5,2020,02,16
32,Best hotel of our trip!,"Stayed in multiple 4 and 5 start hotels throughout our trip including Paris, Barcelona, Amsterdam and Copenhagen. 

This hotel was by far our favorite. Great spacious room, wonderful view over Pla√ßa Reial. The location was walkable to almost everything we planned on seeing and doing. The staff was very friendly, helpful and knowledgeable. We will definitely be returning to this hotel next time we‚Äôre in Barcelona.",5,2020,02,04
32,"An Elegant, Cozy Home Away from Home","A gem of an hotel, right off La Rambla.  The rooms were spacious and comfortable, and the treats that the staff surprised us with over the course of the day - fruit, chocolates, baked goods - were wonderful.  There was always fresh bottled water in the room and lobby.  The staff was lovely and helpful.  Will definitely be back!",5,2020,01,29
32,A+ service from Laura & David,"We walked in for a rate and booked right away. The adorable plaza with quaint lobby was a warm welcome but Laura at the desk and David showing us up to the room was most memorable. We enjoyed a delicious cup of coffee in the lobby and fruit water while we waited for the room (we came early). We were asked if we preferred the first floor with balcony or higher up for views: we went with the balcony. The room had high ceilings, bath and shower with a large bed, floor to ceiling windows, accent lighting, towel warmer and great toiletries like hair brush and loofah. It was raining so we used their umbrella. The hotel basement has a beautiful restaurant and apparently a sauna and rooftop I wish we had time to use. I appreciated the turn down service with sweets so I had tea at night. One complimentary water bottle was really great to have when I awoke. Next day Laura helped us book a rental car, and David chatted with us on recommendations. The two of them make a great team and make the hotel a better place!

Really 5 star experience in the best location. Muy bien!!",5,2020,01,23
32,Awesome hotel,"My husband and I spent four nights here and it was a lovely experience. Every single member of the hotel staff was friendly and helpful. The view onto the plaza was fantastic and the hotel‚Äôs room service was great.  We booked the superior double for reference and it was a good size with a giant bathroom. 

No complaints, but bring earplugs because Spain likes to party literally until the sun comes up. ",5,2020,01,21
32,Great boutique hotel,"My husband stayed for one night after disembarking from a cruise. Great location off La Rambla, spacious room overlooking scenic interior court yard. Friendly, helpful staff. Concierge arranged for tickets for us to visit Sagrada Famiglia. We will be back!",5,2020,01,18
32,A bit of luxury in the old world,"This was the perfect location for seeing and doing everything I wanted to achieve in Barcelona.  La Ramblas is outside the door, a plaza is out the window, metro stop is one block away, and the rooftop terrace allowed me to sit in the sun every day.  The staff are super helpful and friendly making recommendations for local food and sites and just for making me feel welcome.  The rooms are luxurious and the perfect spot to recover from long days of sight seeing or just for lounging.  I definitely recommend this spot with charm, views, and modern amenities.",5,2020,01,18
32,Beautiful room in heart of Gothic Quarter ,"A true five-star experience. The room was beautiful and the view from our balcony was great. The staff were helpful and courteous. And we got fun snacks and fruit every night!! 

Our only complaint was that it was a bit noisy because the Pla√ßa Reial is very popular at night. However that isn‚Äôt the hotel‚Äôs fault and is expected when you are staying in the heart of the city. ",5,2020,01,16
32,Fantastic hotel,"The Hotel Do is located in a beautiful spot within walking distance of many sights, the market, great food , the waterfront and a metro station for longer trips. The staff is very helpful and kind and the food is fantastic! The breakfast is very high quality and beautifully served. With fresh fruit or a sweet in your room at night and great water pressure in the shower, great linens, a comfy bed and bathrobe and superb pillows, this is a great place to stay in Barcelona! ",5,2020,01,11
32,Lovely boutique hotel,"This is a pretty little hotel just off la Rambla. It overlooks a lovely square surrounded by restaurants. I believe the whole area was renovated for the olympics-they even have street lamps designed by Gaud√≠. This made it a little noisy over New Year‚Äôs Eve but I‚Äôm a light sleeper, my husband wasn‚Äôt disturbed. 

The rooms are comfortable with plenty of Molton Brown products in the bathroom. It was very clean with staff calling regularly to tidy, turn down beds, leave fruit and little cakes. 

The staff in the hotel make a massive effort to make sure you have a lovely holiday. They are polite and helpful at all times.

Breakfast was fresh, beautifully presented and plentiful. Warm rolls, smoked salmon, meats, cheese and hot breakfast upon request. Served 7-11 so times that suit everyone. 

We would definitely stay here again. Views from roof on NYE attached.",5,2020,01,02
32,"Great Hotel, Location and  Staff.","We stayed for a week at this first class hotel in the best part of the city, Las Rambles.
Right off the bat I want to thank, Javier, Oscar and Laura for making our trip memorable.  Our conversation with all of you will always be remembered.

Off of Las Rambles, you have all you need.  Resturants, shops and a super market a few blocks away to pick up water or some food.  The ""market"" is close by to walk around and see the fish, meat and Tapas stands. 
The marina and the beach is 10 to 15 minute walk.  

Our room was a twin bed room, beautiful shower and bathroom.  roof top bar and small pool. They will serve you fruit and chocolate in the evening. Breakfast was good made to order eggs and omeletts.

Also you are in the square with plenty of restaurants and shops.  Walking around the city was great, be aware of your surroundings  for pick pockets.  Yes, there are homeless, but they will not bother you.

We visited the la sagrada familia.  Casa Batllo Gaudi and Casa Mila. 

You can get to any part of the city from here.  Barcelona is a great walking city.
We took the #24 bus to Park Gruell.  We made like a local and it was great.  2.20 euros one way.  Just ask the bus driver when to get off, you can pay on the bus.  Just have small bills.

Thank you for a great stay.  Happy New Year to all.......",5,2019,12,31
32,Upscale experience & fantastic location!,"Right off Las Ramblas, the Hotel DO was a great find! I highly recommend the breakfast downstairs. The bathroom was luxuriously appointed. The only thing I'd skip is the dinner at the restaurant. It was just ok; if you're just getting in and jet-lagged, it's not bad however.",5,2019,12,27
32,A wonderful gem in the heart of the Gothic area in Barcelona,"This was one of the most wonderful boutique hotels I have ever stayed at. The service is Fantastic, the rooms are beautiful, the location is perfect and convenient. I can‚Äôt say enough good things about this Gem of a find. It made an exciting trip exceptional. My hat is off to the super friendly and helpful staff.  They are full of smiles, always willing to go the extra mile to book excursions and fill you in on the places to go and see, and where to avoid.",5,2019,12,26
32,The best boutique hotel ever,"My partner and I stayed at the hotel for a few nights and absolutely loved it from the minute we stepped in. The attention to detail was in absolutely everything. From the incredible decor of the entrance, the restaurant and our room to the attentiveness of the staff. Staff were very friendly and accommodating and ensured we enjoyed every minute of our stay. On my partner's birthday we had a very pleasant surprise when we returned to our room there was some birthday dessert and champagne waiting for us. The bed was extremely comfortable and so hard to get out of. My partner and I are very particular with mattresses - he likes soft mattresses and I prefer hard ones as I have a bad back. This matress was super comfortable for both of us, so much so that we overslept a couple of times. Additionally, the hotel is in an ideal central location just off Las Ramblas. It is busy and noisy outside so that's something to be aware of but thankfully we could not hear anything once we were inside our room. 
I'm not sure what we're missing more - Barcelona or this hotel. We will definitely be back! We would like to extend our gratitude in particular to Jean Claude, the manager, as he went above and beyond in his care for instance he recommended a lovely restaurant and even offered to walk us there. Thank you so much for such an amazing stay üòäüòäüëåüèΩ

32,Possibly the best hotel we've ever stayed in.,"A beautiful boutique hotel in a stunning plaza just off La Rambla. Stylishly presented, mixing classic and modern design touches throughout the building, this really is a special place to stay for a romantic city break. The basement restaurant (serving excellent breakfast) and the roof top terrace bar in particular are both very chic.

The staff were warm, attentive and friendly making us feel very welcome. There were nice little touches such as complimentary fresh fruit and pastries being brought to our room every day. The room was very stylish and spotless with comfy beds, fantastic shower/bath suit and a balcony looking out onto the bustling walkway between Placa Reial and La Rambla.

Only word of caution would be that it might be noisy on weekend nights as the hotel is close to a number of lively bars and a couple of clubs. As our stay was midweek it wasn't a problem for us.

We will definitely be back!",5,2019,12,14
32,"Great Hotel, great location","We stayed in a Junior suite room 11.  Room was spacious and well appointed over looking Pla√ßa Reial.  Staff was friendly and over the top accommodating, they even helped us make arrangements to ship some purchases home that would not have survived the flight.  Breakfast was excellent and can be delivered to your room for a small up charge.  Location was perfect as Pla√ßa Reial offers over ten restaurants within 100 yards with different price points and indoor/outdoor seating.  All major attractions are within walking distance or a quick cab ride ( a cab stand is located right out side on La Ramona ) .  Definitely will stay here again when we return.",5,2019,12,03
32,Staying here now.,"We have been to this hotel many times over the years for drinks and dinner & this  year decided to stay.

Rooms have high ceilings and modern bathrooms with heated towel racks and heat lamp racks. Breakfast is awesome. Hotel has a homey feel and Jean Claude Abraham and  David Cuveyie took great care of us each night. We hung out in the lobby at the bar and enjoyed fabulous drinks and the view of Barcelona through picturesque windows until the early hours of the morning. Can‚Äôt say enough about the service at this hotel. It was outstanding. Thank you to everyone for making us feel at home, especially jean Claude and David !

32,Great Boutique Hotel in the Heart of Barcelona,"Great small hotel with impeccable service. Room was good size and amazingly appointed but what stood out the most was the attention to service of the staff. They were bringing fruit to the room daily and always some nice local baked snack when we came back from dinner. The locations is very central with easy access to all the sites we wanted to see and easy access to the subway. We booked the room including breakfast and could not have picked a better way to start the day every morning. They both offer hot dishes and a phenomenal breakfast buffet with an outstanding choice of local charcuterie, breads, pastries, and fruit.",5,2019,11,25
32,Tiny room but nice ambiance and location,"On a business trip to Barcelona I stayed for a few nights in this boutique hotel at the lovely Pla√ßa Reial next to La Rambla. Not a lot of staff so patience is a virtue but they are very friendly and helpful. Relaxed atmosphere. Nice and clean but absolutely tiny room. Probably better suited for tourists than for business. But hey, you're in Barcelona.",4,2019,11,22
32,Perfect,"This was our first trip to Barcelona and I feel very fortunate that I found this hotel. It is in a perfect location for walking and seeing the city.  Our room overlooked the square which was very busy, but it was amazing that when the window was closed we couldn‚Äôt hear a thing.  Large bedroom and bath and the staff went out of their way to make us feel welcome.  Too tired to go anywhere so we had tapas at their dining on the square.  We‚Äôre pleased when complimentary glasses of cava appeared before us.  Perfect meal after a long day of travel. Breakfast was included and very good. We will absolutely come and stay with them again. Loved Barcelona and didn‚Äôt spend enough time there.",5,2019,11,15
32,Beautiful hotel a bit noisy ,We booked in for one night prior to a cruise as we have seen it many times . On arrival staff first class we were early and accommodated us with a room . Room was super spacious and clean bathroom great however sink leaked on to floor . Our only disappointment was the restaurant menu not a great choice for a 5 star hotel and we were on the first floor and the noise from the bars was all night 5.30 am was the only quiet time for approx 1 hour so glad we were only here one night . Shame because hotel is beautiful.,4,2019,11,13
32,Perfect Place,"What a find!  This hotel is wonderful - in a perfect location, and exceptional service.
It is like staying in a Bed & Breakfast, but with the services you'd expect in a top hotel.
Right in the heart of the Gothic quarter, with easy access to metro, taxis, and walking tours.    A great breakfast included, and the terrace is a terrific place to have a drink or a meal.  And the staff - it almost felt like family.  If we get back to Barcelona, this will be where we stay.",5,2019,11,11
32,Wonderful Hotel,"This was our second stay at this beautiful Hotel.  It is completely renovated and the rooms are extremely comfortable.  The shower is wonderful!  It sits on the corner of a historic square that is gorgeous.  What really makes this hotel a standout is the service.
Each and every staff person is gracious and works hard at making you feel welcome.  We ate at the hotel 2 nights and the food is delicious. The breakfast is very nice also.
The area surrounding the Hotel is great for exploring.  Don't miss the market right down the street.  We will definitely stay here again.",5,2019,11,08
32,Gem in the heart of Barcelona,Super friendly service and beautiful location. Just off La Rambla on the charming Pla√ßa Reial. This hotel is somewhat pricey but actually great value for money.

32,Fabulous boutique hotel in Barcelona,"I have just returned from a fabulous stay at the Hotel Do in Barcelona.  From the moment I arrived until I left, the staff was amazing. They were very friendly and kept me updated as to when the room would be available.  The room was wonderful with a private balcony and plunge pool. Nice chaises and chairs on the balcony. The bathroom was large and comfortable. I loved their huge and soft bath towels. The buffet breakfast was also wonderful with a nice selection of fruits and croissants. You can also order eggs from the menu which were included. I will definitely be returning to the Hotel DO on my next Barcelona visit. Thanks to all the wonderful staff.",5,2019,11,01
32,Best hotel in Barcelona!,"This property is right on La Ramblas and right along Pla√ßa Reial. It‚Äôs walking distance to many things and easy access to the metro. The hotel itself is lovely, with many thoughtful touches and very well maintained. My single room was upgraded to a suite for 3 nights of my 5 which was very appreciated but even the single room was very nice and comfortable. The beds are comfortable and the rooms are quiet. In the evenings the staff bring little treats like fruit or cookies before bed. Breakfast was also the best  I‚Äôve had at a hotel and includes a small buffet section with meat, cheese, cereal fruit and yogurt but also a menu where you can order omelettes, waffles sausages, bacon etc at not charge. 

The staff is very welcoming and really go above and beyond to accommodate you. I felt that they were always happy to help or provide advice. Mariel and Laura at the front desk were especially welcoming and helpful and always greeting me with a happy ‚Äúhello‚Äù. 

This hotel was a bit of a splurge for me at the end of a 6 week vacation and I am very happy I made the choice. I wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to stay here again or recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Barcelona!",5,2019,10,28

32,Excellent hotel,"If you're visiting Barcelona, this hotel boutique, is the perfect place to stay. Excellent location in the center of the city and and as it has only 18 rooms, the service is exclusive!

We stayed here for 3 nights and the staff is wonderful and very helpful. We felt so welcomed during our stay, the room was amazing and very clean, and the sauna was a bonus!

We included breakfast and dinner in our booking and everything was delicious. For breakfast, you can eat cold and hot meals and fresh served coffee. For dinner, an elaborate meal!

We definitely recommend this hotel and we would book here again when we come back to Barcelona!",5,2019,10,27
32,Best hotel in Barcelona,"I stayed at this hotel for 4 days, and I only have a word of gratitude for excellent staff from arrival to departure.

Thanks to the staff for making us feel at home.",5,2019,10,25
32,Favorite Boutique Hotel,This hotel stay was perfect for us.  It is located in the Gothic Quarter off La Rambla on a beautiful inner plaza.  We ate dinner at the restaurant on the plaza the first night and had drinks there several times.  The hotel staff checked us in smoothly and showed us our room.  Everyone at the front desk and all of the bellmen were very helpful and spoke excellent English.  The gentleman at the front desk recommended restaurants and booked all of our dinner reservations on our first night.  The bed was very comfortable and there were plenty of outlets for charging.  The bathroom was spacious with two sinks and a nice shower and tub.  Breakfast was delicious.  They would bring fruit to our room late in the afternoon.  We spent four nights here and this was my favorite hotel on a three week trip.  They gave us a bottle of Cava and Tapas.  We really liked the location in the Gothic quarter.  This is a small boutique hotel which is what we enjoy.,5,2019,10,25
32,DO stay at the DO Hotel in Barcelona!,Our recent stay at this property was really a pleasure. The staff was uniformly helpful and provided top notch service. We had breakfast and dinner at the hotel several times - the food and service kept us coming back. The location on La Rambla and an inner square made for great people watching both from the upper deck bar and the plaza restaurant. Any fish you order will be fresh and tantalizing. The bed was very comfortable and the room quiet despite the hotel's location in the center of things. We were lucky enough to see a parade with many giant puppets on the feast day of one of the patron saints of Barcelona. We would definitely stay here again - thanks to all who made our visit a real treat.,5,2019,10,21
32,Fabulous Hotel ,"This was a lovely experience. We were greeted with water and the staff explained all of the amenities associated with the property. The staff was exceptional. Surprise knocks at our door included midday snacks such as apples and evening macaroons. The sauna experience was amazing, we reserved time there which was included in the stay and it provided nice secluded relaxation time from our trip. Cards with the location of the hotel and our names were printed on cards for safety out and about! We felt so safe here and cared for. I can‚Äôt say enough about how nice our short time was here.   One of the most thoughtful hotels I‚Äôve ever stayed in. We will be back!  ",5,2019,10,19

We were greeted by Laura Nel-Lo and we informed her that my wife's purse was just recently pick pocketed in the Barcelona Metro. My wallet with all my identification and cash along with my new cell phone were stolen. Upon hearing this information, Laura welcomed us inside the lobby, provided us with wifi access and started going on the computer to help locate her phone and offer solutions to help her problem. She allowed us to use the hotel phone to make toll free calls with our credit card companies and inform family back home of the incident. Laura was patient and kind and offered us comfort, support and refreshments during a very stressful time. Although we was never a guest at Hotel DO Pla√ßa Reial Boutique Hotel Gastronomic, I am very grateful for all of her hospitality. You have an amazing employee and we look forward to making accommodations at your hotel if we are ever in Barcelona again.
Thank you so much.

32,THE place for your vacation!,"Perfectly located between Gothic Quarter and las Ramblas, the Do has outstanding service, nice rooms and delicious breakfast! The staff was amazing and the location was great for sightseeing. Highly recommend!!!",5,2019,10,13
32,"Relaxing Rooftop, Pretty Details","Lots of pros: location on La Rambla, beautiful rooftop, full breakfast included, beautiful rooms, turndown service with chocolates and weather report for following day, attentive and amazingly friendly staff, helpful with making taco and dining reservations, very clean, modern updates/decor, ‚Ç¨70 bottles of Veuve at the bar that can be enjoyed while overlooking the pretty plaza, very affordable for the quality of the hotel. We would stay here again!

Single con: some confusion on the per person tax while booking through a third party site. Be sure to clarify exact number of guests per room versus just number of rooms needed. Staff was very accommodating despite the third party booking issue.",5,2019,10,11
32,A first class hotel in the best location,"We stayed at the Hotel Do for 3 nights early October for our wedding anniversary.  My husband had organised it all as a surprise so i was slightly concerned as to where he would choose, however, he really did come up trumps with this place!  From arrival through to departure, the staff at the hotel could not do more for you.  they were excellent.  so professional, yet friendly.  i believe they had been in contact with my husband prior to arrival to arrange any requests etc.  we had a junior suite right on the corner of the hotel overlooking the square and it was beautiful.  Lovely high ceilings, beautiful decor, art, furniture etc.  Gorgeous bathroom with a double shower, bath and double sinks.  Turn down service every night where they would leave chocolates and a 'treat' on our table.  Nespresso machine, Moulton Brown toiletries, bath robes etc.  Super comfy bed.  Breakfast was served in the restaurant which was lovely - very welcoming and again, super efficient friendly staff.  great food choice and the best fresh made spanish omelettes.  we had pre and after dinner drinks in the hotel every night, in the square, watching the world go by.  The location is excellent and we were able to walk to everywhere we wanted without having to use taxi's, other than the airport.  some super restaurants nearby serving authentic local food with lots of locals eating in them.  If i returned to Barcelona, i would definitely stay here again - wouldn't even consider anywhere else.  a five star hotel and experience.
the only thing i would say and this is no fault of the hotel's, but night life in Barcelona goes on to the early hours and if you are used to total silence at night time, you might want to take some ear plugs.  my husband slept through it all but if you are a light sleeper, it may wake you up.",5,2019,10,11
32,Barcelona Bliss,Fantastic loved everything about the hotel the location was superb the staff were great very attentive and friendly. Our room was beautiful very clean and comfortable. The breakfast was very good a great selection which I think would suit all it certainly did for my husband and I. The rooftop bar was a great place to chill should have spent a bit more time there. Couldn't fault it would definitely return.,5,2019,10,10
32,"Great location, well appointed rooms, great service until the end","This hotel is meticulous - the management goes all out the ensure a perfect customer journey.Our experience from prior arrival including reminder confirmation, high service level with a smile from check-in and to restaurants, personalised name cards.  As we booked directly, we were also offered complimentary wine and tapas and late check-out. The rooms were well appointed. There are two things that let this hotel down, I had to remind them to make the room twice - and finally done at 5.30pm and the other was they checked me out - that is packed our bags and cleared the room before our agreed check-out time at 1pm!  The lady Clare at reception is in the wrong job - no personality with an attitude problem.  She said as we did not return at noon - checkout - they cleared our bags without even attempting to call me!!  I am still giving this hotel a 4 star.",4,2019,10,05
32,Great location! Friendly Staff!,"I booked this hotel after looking through TripAdvisor. My wife and I were not disappointed. We stayed 8 days in Barcelona at this hotel. Firstly, the location is ideal, in the gothic quarter, at walking distance to many restaurant, shopping and landmark options. We walked all week. Did not use a cab at all except for the airport transfer. We even walked to Park Guell from there. It took us about 1 hour.
We booked a junior suite with a king bed. The room was very spacious and clean. The bathroom was quit big as well. My wife would have liked a bit more lighting in the bathroom. Every night, when we got back to the room, we would find some fruit and chocolate. Nice little touch.
We did not eat at the main restaurant but we spent several nights on the rooftop. Good drinks and tapas. Very enjoyable. We also had breakfast at the hotel every morning. The food was very good and the selection was adequate for breakfast.
The hotel is situated in Pla√ßa Reial. It is definitively a lively area. Nice to sit at the many outdoor tables around there and watch the activity at the end of a busy day,
Finally, the staff was very friendly and helpful as most people in Barcelona. 
It was a great week! ",5,2019,09,30
32,Superbe,This little hotel is fantastic. Great location. Great service. Lots of charm. Perfect. The suite with the little pool is Just fantastic... I hope to come back soon....... And Barcelone is always great. Wonderful weather. ,5,2019,09,27
32,Just amazing,"This hotel is fabulous! No other word the staff make this place . The food is second to none, the rooms amazing , in my mind and I've been to Barcelona alot it's the best place to stay roll on march ! ",5,2019,09,27
32,Great place to stay,My husband and I really enjoyed this hotel!  Staff were very nice and helpful.  The hotel is located in the heart of the gothic area.  It‚Äôs located in a nice square with its of good restaurants and live entertainment at night,5,2019,09,27
32,"Great location, staff is attentive, clean, comfortable accommodations!","On the cusp of the old Gothic City & newer shopping district & marina it is a perfect location for walking the city.  I read reviews that the Placa Reiel is loud at night & they had trouble sleeping - this was NOT my experience - I am generally a light sleeper but the shuttered windows (closed via staff @ night) muffled any noise that would be loud enough to keep me awake (and we visited during festival!)

We found the staff VERY accommodating.  We had an early tour one day & were going to miss the included breakfast (opens at 8am) & they offered to pack us a picnic to take with us!  It was there & ready with the taxi they called to escort us to our location.  When we opened the bag/boxes we found a feast!  Fresh fruit, pastries & crusty bread sandwiches with local meats.  There was way to much for the two of us & we saved a large portion & made a homeless mans morning with their neatly packed banquet.

The rooms are well kept, ours was spacious & looked down onto the Placa with a small balcony.  Great water pressure in the bathroooms, slippers & robes included.  The turn down service was awesome, they would deliver a midday snack of fruit & in the evenings a small sweet!

The wait staff was friendly & personable (sadly not always the case in the rest of the city, depending on where you dine).  The front desk always had change for my larger Euros.  Roof top terrace was nice & relaxing by the smallish pool (meant for cooling off & relaxing vs. swimming) When the bar wasn't yet open (they open at 6pm) the staff sent a waiter up to take our adult beverage order.

Perfect stay! Highly recommend!",5,2019,09,26
32,Excellent Stay at Hotel DO in Barcelona.  Highly Recommend.,"We stayed at Hotel DO in Barcelona 7 Nights (09/16/19 - 9/23/10.)    I cannot say enough about this hotel.   I was completely delighted.   The location was perfect  (on the edge of the Gothic District and convenient to everything.)   

The Hotel is off of La Rambla and  in the Placa Reial.   Perfectly situated.

The Hotel is beautiful and spotlessly clean.   There was no amenity lacking.   The rooms had everything one could ask for.   My room was overlooking the Placa Reial,  which can be quite lively.   There was no worries at all about noise,  none at all.   Instead,  it was delightful to see the festivities from the balcony.   When the door was closed,  it was completely quiet.

The staff at the hotel was exemplary.    I cannot say enough about them.    Every detail was taken care of with ease.   From the moment we booked,  and requested airport pickup,  throughout our stay,  to getting us back to the airport,  every detail was perfect.   

The rooms were lovely  (no amenity lacking),  security was on point,  staff was very friendly (very important to us).    We felt very comfortable there,  and well taken care of.    

The Staff at Hotel Do takes making every aspect of the stay excellent very seriously.   Every Detail was taken care of.  Evenings there was turn-down,  and fruits/pastries.  

One morning we had an early morning tour of Sagrada Familia,  and when we asked when breakfast was served,  and it was after we needed to leave,  they immediately asked if we would like a picnic breakfast  (we didn't even need to ask).   They packed a DELICIOUS  breakfast picnic  of sandwiches,  fruit, pastries,  juices that we ate in front of Sagrada Familia.    It was scrumptious.   

Breakfasts were delicious.   A buffet of fruits,  pastries,  meats,  cheeses,  juices,  in addition to a menu of eggs,  waffles,  etc.  coffee (delicious).   

The front desk was exemplary with accommodating any request for information regarding where to go, suggestions,  directions,  taxi's,  etc.   

The waitstaff was excellent!!   We were there for a week,  and enjoyed our experience with each and everyone.  The went above and beyond.   Professional and FRIENDLY.   One afternoon,  after a long day sightseeing we went up to the terrace and took a dip in the pool.  The bar was not open on the terrace yet,  but we called for 'room service' to the terrace for a beverage.   Shortly the waiter ran up to the terrace and brought us beverages by the pool.   

Long story short...   Excellent Location,  Excellent/Beautiful Hotel,  Excellent, Excellent  Staff.   Highly Recommend.   

All in all,  our stay there was wonderful and we would highly recommend.   

Thank you to all at Hotel DO for making our stay such a pleasure.",5,2019,09,24
32,Jewel Boutique Hotel!,"This jewel boutique hotel was the perfect place to end our magical cruise and vacation to Spain and Portugal.  The hotel is conveniently located near La Rambla, wonderful restaurants and shopping, and all the sites we wanted to visit.  The rooms are spacious and beautifully equipped. We loved the rooftop lounge and bar. The staff was helpful and attentive. Thank you for a delightful experience! ",5,2019,09,23
32,Probably one of the best boutique hotels that i have stayed in,"My wife and I spent a fabulous 4 days in Hotel Do Pla√ßa Reial and the whole team hosting us especially the ladies on the reception desk were fantastic!  
The trip was a surprise for my birthday and I had no idea that I would be flying out to Barcelona until the night before.
The Christina at Hotel Do Pla√ßa Reial handled my reservation and knew about this.  She did everything she could to make our stay special as well as researching prices of places I was interested in visiting ahead of our arrival, as well as the cost.  
We were upgraded to a beautiful suite and she arranged for bottles of wine and a cake to be in our room on our arrival for that special touch with a red rose too!  Thank you again, Christina!  
Danny their concierge was also super professional and extremely friendly.  He told us that he lived in the UK for some time and nothing was too much trouble for him.
This boutique hotel was in an amazing location overlooking the square and had a real family-run feeling to it which made us feel welcome and at home there.  I also liked the fact that you could book the private use of their spa/sauna room.
The team treated us like every day was our first day, always on hand with advice and tips and a welcome smile when we came back from our long day out and about.
The continental breakfast was really nice.  We would look forward to those as it was tastier than previous ones we have had.   

We would most definitely stay there again.  Loved it! 
Thank you Hotel Do Pla√ßa Reial! üôÇ
",5,2019,09,22
32,Best boutique ever!!!,"I am extremely picky about where I stay and this hotel is amazing.  The staff are so accommodating and take care of your needs immediately.  I stayed here for 7 nights and reserved a junior suite - the best - very big rooms, large bathrooms, double shower as well as bathtub - plenty of towels and robes and slippers..  The location is amazing in the center of the city.  Near the subway and walking distance in town.  One day we left the safe open with all our valuables including our passports - came back after a day of sightseeing and nothing was touched.  Breakfast is included and delicious.  You will not be disappointed - I don't believe you will get better service than this hotel compared to the chair hotels.  You may get a great room but because they are so big I believe you would not get the warmth and quick service as you do at Hotel Do.  I would definitely return to this hotel.  Also the view is amazing overlooking the square",5,2019,09,17
32,Nice hotel but WAY overpriced,"We just stayed at this ‚Äúluxury‚Äù hotel. Great spot, wonderful breakfast, nice staff, exceptional breakfast server.  But not worth the high price. We paid $1200 euros for 3 nights and from the reviews expected to love it. Sure its a nice room but on par with $150-$175 euros per night room. Small quarters and yes lovely bath and lotion but you‚Äôd think at that price they would replace the small plastic bottles when you used them up. Also let us have the bag of chips for goodness sake! You‚Äô d think its the location but there are similar and nicer hotels near here that are not nearly as expensive. I rely on trip advisor reviews and would have hoped someone would have indicated priced much too high for what you get. We travel alot and have stayed in all price ranges. This is the first time we have felt so ripped off. Nice hotel and staff, yes but dont come here and spend the $ on this hotel. Its shameful. ",2,2019,09,15
32,Beautiful hotel with wonderful staff in great location,"Hotel DO was the perfect hotel to stay at in Barcelona. The hotel is beautiful, clean, and the staff was so helpful, warm, and genuinely concerned about your happiness and enjoyment. The location of the hotel was perfect-- right next to Las Ramblas. We loved the room-- the bed was comfy, and the staff came to make up the room and leave little treats including fruits, pastries, and chocolates multiple times a day. The front desk staff were especially helpful. They helped us plan beach excursions, visits to the main Barcelona attractions, dinner reservations, and night club outings. Marielle and David were especially helpful and always went out of their way for us-- but the entire staff was wonderful. We highly recommend Hotel DO and hope to be back soon!",5,2019,09,12
32,Absolutely great!,A great stay in this beautiful boutique hotel on the Placa Reial. Very friendly staff and a from our junior suite we had a great view on the lively square. Even the rain didnot ruin our day. We will certainly be back!,5,2019,09,12
32,All you need and want from a luxury boutique hotel,"The Hotel DO Pla√ßa Reial is a gem just off the busy (and rather horrid) Ramblas, a hideaway of comfort, luxury, and warm service.  Our double superior room was large, comfortable, beautifully maintained;  the bathroom, with tub and separate shower was very large and loaded with Moulton Brown amenities.

The breakfast is fabulous with enough to keep you stoked for the whole day with products of the highest quality, and the service is charming, smiling, and efficient.

Not exactly in the budget or medium category, the DO is a haven and a heaven in itself.",5,2019,09,08
32,"Great hotel, Shame about the bed","This hotel is fabulous including the very helpful and friendly staff except the bed was so uncomfortable we had to ask reception to do something about it.  
On inspection there seemed to be 2 additional layers of additional mattress pads which suggests the owners know they have issues with the beds and to be fair perhaps it was only our bed (avoid room 33)
The bed did improve somewhat after night 1 thanks to the helpful staff but was not great.  
 Not sure why hotels do not put the quality and comfort of their beds as the number 1 priority. Maybe this hotel spent all the budget on monogrammed sheets and towels !!",3,2019,09,08
32,Very beautiful hotel and friendly staff in great location,"We stayed in the Double Superior Room overlooking the plaza.  I wish we would have stayed longer and enjoyed the hotel more.  The room was spacious and very large bathroom with every amenity, even a towel warmer.  The staff is very friendly and responsive, have to mention Andrea from the plaza bar who was very friendly and generous and makes one of the best Cava Sangrias.  There is a small balcony in the room and another one in the bathroom.  The rooms are very clean and sound proof even though there are people outside all night long.  Located in great location right on Ramblas, which is convenient when you have luggage and not far to have to walk.  There is a very lovely terrace in the hotel.  Next time in Barcelona I would definitely stay here and for a longer period.",5,2019,09,03
32,Very reccomended,"my best place to stay when I get to Barcellona: great accomodation, lovely food, very kind service, staff sensitive especially William. Canno‚Äôt wait for my next time in Barcellona. 2 words: very raccomended. ",5,2019,08,31
32,Excellent Hotel,We selected this hotel for a two night stay prior to a cruise based on previous TripAdvisor reports.  The hotel is well located just a block from La Rambla.  We prefer boutique hotels and this one was perfect.  The staff was wonderful and room very comfortable.  There was also an excellent breakfast.  We would definitely choose this hotel on our next trip to Barcelona.,5,2019,08,31
32,Amazing place to stay,"We stayed at the Hotel Do and while it's a small hotel it's charming as..... The staff are super friendly and go out of their way to help the guests... 
Bookings for tourist sites  , no worries 
Help send a postcard home , no worries
Random friend drops in at breakfast time - here's a free coffee...

If I came back to Barcelona, I would absolutely stay here... Nice rooms, Central location, absolutely amazing place to stay !
",5,2019,08,28
32,Fantastic customer service in great area of town!,"Great small hotel in a fantastic area of town.  Loved the vibe of the neighborhood and the plaza where it is situated.  The DO's customer service is exceptional as is the way the hotel is setup to work with both guests and non-guests who may come to dine in the restaurant or live it up on the rooftop deck. We appreciated the welcome visit from Henry, who explained how everything  in our room works, the hotel in general and what we should expect in terms of amenities/services. The room was absolutely lovely (although the beds themselves were not very comfortable - literally our only complaint but not one to be discounted) and appointed very practically but beautifully. The housekeeping service was also excellent and thoughtful. The flexibility of the staff was on par with any five star hotel we've stayed at around the world. We will absolutely stay there again and recommend it to anyone traveling to Barcelona.",5,2019,08,26
32,A great small but very convenient hotel,"A great hotel, small but with friendly staff and personalized experience. We enjoyed the experience and would love to come back again. Rooms are not big, but they upgraded me free of charge which was enough as a start.",5,2019,08,22
32,Great Hotel ‚Äì Wonderful Surroundings,"Had a great stay at this wonderful hotel. The staff were amazing: very helpful, very courteous. My room and the hotel facilities were excellent ‚Äì great rooftop pool.
Very quiet and not overwhelming despite being situated in one of the most famous squares in Barcelona.",5,2019,08,16
32,"fabulous hotel, great location","What an amazing hotel, great sized room for a hotel in Europe, as they are usually quite small. The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom spacious too.  The staff were very attentive, friendly and always on hand to assist with a smile. The only minus, there was no coffee provided in the room, only tea.  Which was bazaar as they served great coffee for breakfast. And every afternoon they would bring a little plate of fruit to your room.   The breakfast venue was stunningly designed.  Also, top marks for their breakfast. Brilliant location, incredible choice of restaurants straight outside the hotel, with the famous La Rambla only a few steps away.  Initially we were concerned about the noise levels at night given the nightlife in that area, but not problem whatsoever.  Would recommend this hotel in a flash, a wonderful hotel in which to experience Barcelona.",5,2019,08,15
32,FANTASTIC BOUTIQUE HOTEL,"A fantastic hotel in the heart of Barcelona and the Gothic qtr.  Nothing was too hard for the staff and they went beyond what was required.  Fitout was charming and full of character.  A fantastic hotel that we would highly recommend,",5,2019,08,13
32,Best Place Ever!,"Best place in Barcelona for location, service, and comfort! Seriously, every staff member tried to do anything he or she could to make our stay perfect.  Hotel is small, but it has everything.  We went during hottest part of the summer, and AC was wonderful.  They have very clean rooms, good hot showers with shampoo and conditioner, good WiFi, great morning breakfast with the kindest server, and a perfect location that was excellent, especially on the plaza with several restaurants nearby.  We could walk most places, but a convenient taxi stand is right by the hotel.  Each night, staff would bring a little plate of fruit or treat, and if we asked, they would bring us a bucket of ice. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here! ",5,2019,07,30
32,A fantastic and comfortable hotel!,"This small hotel is well kept, comfortable, convenient and most of all, staffed by very friendly staff! Despite the location on Placa Reial, the rooms were very quiet- I had no trouble falling asleep at night but be realistic, you are in the middle of a city, there will be some baseline noise. The one negative I will say is that Barcelona has a large homeless population and you will see some unfortunate folks sleeping on the streets around the Ramblas.",5,2019,07,27
32,Wonderful Place!,"My wife and I spent the first several days of our honeymoon at DO Hotel, and our experience was fantastic from start to finish. The staff was incredibly welcoming. We mentioned once off-hand that it was our honeymoon to Danny, who showed us to our room, and a day later they treated us with a bottle of cava! The breakfast experience was wonderful. We sat outside on the terrace/plaza and enjoyed watching the square wake up everyday, and the service was extremely friendly. When we were having trouble booking train tickets to France and finding a hotel, the staff at the front desk, who spoke french, booked them for us and charged it to our room to make it easier on us. She even offered that we could call from France if we needed help with other bookings! Overall, it was an incredible experience. Aside from the staff, the hotel itself is beautiful, and the location is excellent. We loved the pool and sauna. I would recommend this hotel to anyone.",5,2019,07,23
32,Nice restaurant with a great terrace,"I had dinner here twice on consecutive evenings. The menu has something for almost everyone from crustacea to steaks - although vegans might struggle to find something. The good is simply cooked. The truffled potato tortilla as a starter looked a bit small but was very filling indeed. The steaks are reasonably priced. I splashed out on a bottle Marqu√©s de Murietta and had a very enoyable evening just watching some of the entertainments in Pla√ßa Reial.

The hotel has a roof terrace that I didn't explore.",5,2019,06,29
32,Absolutely Great,"Lovely place, beautiful room and bath, and excellent service.  We were served wine upon arrival.  We had a very early flight and they prepared box breakfast/lunch boxes for us to take to the airport.  Cannot say enough good things about this place.",5,2019,06,28
32,Really Lovely Hotel,My husband and I stayed for a couple of days before going on a cruise.  It‚Äôs a perfect location close to la ramblas and overlooked a plaza.  The room was so clean and comfortable.  We were well looked after and would definitely stay again. ,5,2019,06,24
32,Great boutique hotel!,"My family and I booked two rooms for a 1 night stay before our cruise. Lovely hotel, well appointed and located, good food at the hotel restaurant located on the plaza or downstairs in the restaurant. Only downside was the non/stop party happening on that Saturday night in the plaza that lasted all night until 6:30 in the morning. Locals and probably tourists too, having a good time, but tough for sleeping soundly! All in all, I‚Äôd still recommend this hotel and would return when back in Barcelona.",4,2019,06,16
32,Great Hoter,Very nice hotel in the heart of all Barcelona has to offer. Very friendly and efficient staff. Would highly recommend The restaurants in the surrounding area offer great food and drink. Just a short walk to many attractions,5,2019,06,04
32,Med Cruise with a stop over in Barcelona,"We took our first trip over the pond and started and finished in Barcelona.  We stayed at Hotel Do pre & post cruise. The hotel is a small boutique hotel that provides you with a full service experience.   It is located right off La Rambla and the Gothic Quarter- which is the perfect area to stroll and see the sights.  We loved the little touches that the hotel does for its guests - the cherries and chocolate in the room, the welcome drink, the personal service and touches.  

I do agree that the hotel is on a lively square, which can be loud on the weekends, but we stayed on a higher floor and it didn't bother us.   I read that it can be noisy, so I asked to be placed higher and they accommodated us. You are in the heart of the city - so it is to be expected. 

We had a full breakfast each morning that was included in the price and it was great and filling.  

All in all, we were so pleased with our stay that we would absolutely add them to a must return list!",5,2019,06,03
32,"Comfort, privacy and everything you need. ","This hotel is in the thick of the busy Pla√ßa Reial off La Rambla. However it‚Äôs a gem. There are only 18 rooms and the service is very personal and attentive. 
I visited with my sister and our room was well furnished, exceptionally clean and had Molton brown toiletries, bathrobes and slippers and everything you could need for your stay. Fresh fruit was placed in the room each day and snacks at night when sheets were turned down.
The rooftop terrace is a nice private area to relax and staff can be contacted easily whilst allowing privacy. 
Breakfast was included each morning with a selection of cold cuts, fresh fruit, continental breads, hot breakfasts were to order and also included. 
Staff were great and overall it was a great stay in a lovely location. ",5,2019,06,01
32,Do!,"Great sexy room... helpful and attentive staff! This hotel is small and delightful. Great views off of The Barcelona skyline on the deck above . Good location as welll... loved the vibe here... so chill, so cool, so Barcelona!‚ù§Ô∏è",4,2019,05,30
32,Perfect place to enjoy Barcelona ,"Wonderful place in the central part of the tourist section of Barcelona. Only about a 10 minute walk to the bay, that has paths taking you around to some very nice restaurants along the bay.  The room is was quite large in European standards. The courtyard where there were lots restaurants was quite noisy, but once you shut your window you couldn‚Äôt hear anything. The hvac system worked great too and was very quiet. Breakfast included was adequate, you can order items off the menu, included. Highly recommend staying here next time you are in Barcelona. ",5,2019,05,29
32,Beautiful Boutique Hotel,"This hotel is right in the heart of it but has a wonderful boutique atmosphere. Peacefully quiet rooms, attentive staff, wonderful terrace for an afternoon drink, and gorgeous breakfasts. 

It‚Äôs a lovely place to return to after after a busy day exploring the city or night out on the town. 

You can‚Äôt go wrong here. ",5,2019,05,22
32,Classy boutique hotel,"We loved this hotel where we stayed for three nights.    It is elegant and pretty and the rooms are well appointed.  We especially loved the spacious bathroom and the sink for two and having a full size hair dryer in the room!  Also, they offer USB outlets which is great for those of us who travel with multiple devices and only have one converter. Bedding was comfy and room was spotless.   We enjoyed the doors that you could open to the little balcony to get some fresh air or a glance at the action below.  However the table and chair set up (in front of them) makes it a bit awkward & cumbersome.  Also, worth mentioning that the doors keep out almost all of the noise from the square below.  For those who are worried about this being a problem we were pretty impressed.",5,2019,05,22
32,Can‚Äôt wait to return!!,"Hotel DO was more than we had hoped for! Every part of the property was spotless, beautifully decorated, fresh flowers, perfectly appointed rooms! The staff were uncompromising in their professionalism and desire to meet every need of their guests. We can not wait to come back and spend more time there!",5,2019,05,18
32,Great location,"Great service in great location. Would gladly recommend it to everyone. 
The hotel being a five star hotel and its pricing should not charge for water beyond the first bottle. There should be a free replacement of water bottle on a daily basis.  Small things matter in a competitive market.
Otherwise, thank you hotel DO Reial for wonderful hospitality.",4,2019,05,10
32,Fantastic hotel in great Barcelona location,"Stayed one night prior to cruise embarkation.  Hotel Do is located off of La Rampla and our room overlooked Placa Reial. Cab stand conveniently located just outside.  Room was fantastic - large, charming, comfortable.

Rate included a bottle of wine, tapas for lunch (or dinner), and breakfast.  Staff were very helpful responding to email questions prior to my arrival.  Well worth the money.",5,2019,05,09
32,Absolutely fabulous,"We are world travelers and we love boutique hotels. I must say this one tops our list! In my typical review fashion I will include pro‚Äôs and cons
pros: the rooms are incredible. Comfortable beds, gorgeous and roomy bathroom with wonderful amenities including a mini bar. We booked the junior sweet overlooking the square (opposite side of Las Ramblas) Service is top notch. Very welcoming and accommodating and genuine. The terrace, though small is beautifully decorated with a view of the square below . We could hear live muscians from our viewpoint. You must try the tapas on the terrace as they supplemented the perfect ambience leading to a perfect experience. The hotel architecture and design is very beautiful. If you utilize the stairs instead of the lift you will admire the beautiful castle like stairway decorated with beautiful pendant lights. I normally don‚Äôt highlight much decor im my reviews but this hotel I would emulate in my own home! I love the elegance of this boutique hotel. We prefer smaller hotels as we feel the service is more personalized.location of the hotel is at the beginning of Las Ramblas but the hotel is quiet. We never had any noise worries. Delicious breakfast. You can eat dinner at the restaurant downstairs or upstairs on terrace roof. The also offer courtyard seating. 
cons: we only stayed one night. Next time it will be a week. I truly can‚Äôt think of any improvement for this hotel. Thank you Barcelona and Hotel DO for sharing this experience with us.",5,2019,05,08
32,WMW,"A wonderful hotel. Friendly and professional staff, first class comfort and amenities, great location.  The shower and bedding are exceptional.  The breakfasts were included in the room rate and were delicious.  ",5,2019,05,07
32,Great stay spoiled by niggles,"A boutique hotel. Only 18 rooms. Great design. Lovely terrace and basement restaurant. Roof terrace area with pool and bar.

Beds and bathrooms spectacular. Attention from staff good.

Central location.

Drawbacks. 

Unfortunate disagreement over bar bill. We were overcharged, we complained. It wasn‚Äôt handled well.

Room for one of us had no window, we weren‚Äôt warned.

Disabled access needs to be improved. My room had a dog leg access, hard in a wheelchair. No grab rails in bathroom, no seat for shower. The roof terrace has four steps. It has a chair/stair lift. But covered up and unusable because at the top there was a huge planter, blocking the way off.",4,2019,04,29
32,Fantastic,"Great central location, beautiful hotel, and impeccable service. What more could you want?  Rooms were large and tastefully updated. Breakfast was perfect and served in a very elegant/interesting room. We loved it and would definitely return for future trips.  ",5,2019,04,27
32,Beautiful hotel and lovely staff!,"I would like to thank the hotel staff for helping me so much with my lost luggage in Madrid. They were so helpful and nice and helped me til I finally got my luggage. The hotel is located in a very convenient place (except that you‚Äôd hate it on a weekend at night cause you can hear all the drunk people in the square) but other than that this hotel is perfect in every way. Beds are comfy, loved the simple breakfast, awesome location and most of all, superb accommodation to the customer. ",5,2019,04,24
32,superb experience!,"this is a perfect boutique hotel, located directly on the Placia Rieal. seriously, everything about our stay was perfect, from checkin to checkout. rooms were large by typical European standards, location was excellent, situated between the marina/embarcadero and the Gothic areas. all the fixtures were modern, plenty of amenities (high-end soaps and lotions), huge towels. idk if they do this for every guest but we were given name cards with our names and hotel name and address printed on them. not sure of the utility in these modern times, but it was still pretty cool :)

we only had one meal (breakfast) in the hotel restaurant (included with our plan) and it was perfectly satisfying, if not elaborate

highly recommended!",5,2019,04,23
32,Perfect in every way,"This hotel was what I fantasized about when imagining a boutique in Barcelona. Located on the Pla√ßa Reial, it‚Äôs an antique but updated with all the modern conveniences. Centrally located but just enough off Las Ramblas to avoid the noise, the hotel has has excellent food. The staff is friendly and helpful (a special shout-out to our waiter Ignacio), and the amenities are first rate. From the fluffy robes, fresh fruit left in the room, assorted Nespresso capsules, and super-comfortable bed, nothing was lacking. 

Our room had a private terrace with table, chairs, a banquette and small dipping pool. Just outside and around the corner was the rooftop pool and bar, with a view. 

It‚Äôs an easy walk to the cathedral, Picasso Museum, and all the other sights. I will stay here again for sure when I return to Barcelona. 

",5,2019,04,10
32,Exactly what I was hoping for,"We had three nights in Barcelona and Hotel Do was perfect -small, just 18 rooms, full of character, with beautifully decorated rooms, excellent service and located right on a beautiful square just off La Rambla. It was perfect both for exploring the Gothic city right on the doorstep, catching the underground to visit other sites further afield, or just sitting in the square watching the world go by. The staff were all very friendly and helpful. We would definitely return to Hotel Do again.",5,2019,04,07
32,Top Hotel.,"Gorgeous, modern rooms but with a charm. Location is in the old town of Barcelona right off of the Ramblas. Within walking distance of the cathedral, opera , market. Breakfast is included and served downstairs and one can have a gourmet dinner on the terrace. This is truly a luxury, unique boutique gem of a hotel. The only one we stay in when in Barcelona. When you check in, they give you a glass of wine in the intimate lobby. We have stayed here off season and the price tag is very attractive at that time for the quality one receives.",5,2019,02,17
32,Beautiful Barcelona,"Spent a fab 4 days in Barcelona, to celebrate  my birthday, We stayed in a fabulous boutique hotel right in the heart of Barcelona in the Placa Reial square. check in was swift and had a great welcome, with a glass of fizz. we were upgraded and our room was over looking the square, fabulous view. room was grear huge bed, great bathroom , hairdryer, all molton brown products  in bathroom. really stylish room. staff were excellent, [the guy from new York]  sorry forgot name and the girl who was on reception. 
Breakfast was superb, great selection of continental laid out, cappuccino, lattes, hot chocolate for drinks ,water, juices, full cooked breakfast also was included, great bacon, sasage, fried egg , poached, eggs, toast , waffles, crepes, smoked salmon, eggs benedict you had to pay for though which seemed strange. 
Hotel is situated in a fantastic place loads of bars, places to eat within seconds of stepping outside the hotel.
There was a bar on the roof with a little pool and seating , loved this hotel, and had a very romantic feel to it, highly recommended for a city beak.",5,2019,02,17
32,Little Gem!,"Calm, quiet environment. Spotless, with very comfortable and beautifully designed rooms, (choice of pillows was amazing,they even provide an explanation for each one of them).  We stayed in January so not the right time of year to take advantage of their little spa. Wonderful breakfast spread and not a coffee machine in site - bliss! We had an early departure so were given a little picnic to take with us!  Delightful Staff  who were knowledgeable and very helpful.

A perfect location, in the Gothic area, an easy walk to harbour and Plaza Catalunya if taking the bus tours (a must for seeing the city in a limited time), shopping or site seeing. Sorry to leave and would certainly stay here again.",5,2019,02,02
32,Loved it!,"I stayed at Hotel DO Placa Royale for 4 nights in late January. I picked it because I wanted to be in an interesting part of town and based on the great reviews. It sounded unique and interesting. I was not disappointed! I loved it here. I had no trouble finding it. It is literally 25 yards from La Rambla and the cab dropped me and pointed me to the hotel. Check in was easy and quick and after they showed me to my room, I threw open the doors to let in the sounds of the square. It was great. I was worried it would be noisy but it really wasn't, and I am a light sleeper. The room was great-grandfather spotless, high (like 20 feet) ceilings, beautiful hardwood floors, etc. All very unique and beautiful. Then a sweet lady showed up with some fruit. She came every day with something nice. And I assume she came again later with some little desserts...different each day, but always delicious. The breakfast was great and the room was very cool- it's built in an old Roman style and feels even older than the 150 odd years old that it is. But again, it was spotless and gorgeous. The guys working in breakfast were so cool and helpful. Wish I had gotten their names! What else? Not sure...everything was so unique. Comfy bed too. If you like standard hotels without character, then this may not be for you. But if you like amazingly clean, unique, comfy hotels that are truly unique and exceed every expectation you had, Hotel DO delivers. It might be my favorite hotel stay ever! (I'm a Hilton diamond member so have stayed in a few hotels...). I attached a few pictures- they aren't great but give you an idea. ",5,2019,02,01
32,Great stay for romantic weekend but for different purpose you may want to consider,"Overall this is a superb hotel, but it‚Äôs important your reason to be in this place. We had romantic weekend treat (in weekdays J) and for this reason the hotel is briliant - beautifully furnished room, very clean and comfortable with nice view over Pla√ßa Reial. Good amenities like champagne for welcome, pillows and room-aroma menus, afternoon fruits in the room, chocolates for good night, great bathroom with excellent bath products, free mini bar with soft drinks and good wifi. The hotel team in all levels is wonderful ‚Äì very friendly, attentive and professional!
Breakfast is OK, nothing special and remarkable. If you are happy with good coffee, croissant, jamon, cheese, basic eggs, fruits and glass of cava than you will not be disappointed. For more than that you have to pay a little extra and still not that many choices.
 
The locations I can imagine will not fit everyone. For our purpose was great - very romantic and central, all you need for short trip is on walking distance. But yes it‚Äôs very, very touristic, lively 24/7, at night seemed a bit dodgy, a lot of police presence around and while walking in the narrow streets you get offers for some illegal stuff. We didn‚Äôt find this dangerous, stressful or disappointing, but it really depends on your vibe ;)",5,2019,01,16
32,"Great location, rooms are really nice but small","This hotel is in a perfect Barcelona location, very central and walking distance to the Picasso museum and Familia Sagrada.  The rooms and the service are impeccable however a bit small as is expected in the heart of Barcelona.  The hotel is likewise on a very lively and louder square in the Placa Reial so get a room away from the square side of the hotel if you want to avoid the noise.",5,2019,01,15
32,"Exceptional room & service, but food & amenities were disappointing","Hotel DO is a beautiful, luxury hotel in the heart of Barcelona. The hotel door is right on La Ramblas and you're only a 5-10 minute walk into the Gothic Quarter or to the beach. The lobby, restaurants, and room were all beautifully decorated, perfectly clean, and very welcoming. The staff was attentive, spoke great English, and answered any questions I had. They brought complimentary treats to my room every day, deserts and fruit. I was also impressed that all the beverages (non-alcoholic) in the mini-fridge were complimentary, and they had a Nespresso in the room as well. I loved that there was an unlimited complimentary breakfast in their restaurant every morning, it was super convenient and let me be lazy when starting my day. The Junior Suite was gorgeous -- it was spacious, beautifully decorated, had great views and light, and the bathroom was like my own spa. The bathroom had a big bathtub, a huge double shower, double sink, and the toilet was had a sliding door that was all mirror and inside the walls were beautiful black tile. 

Now some of the let-downs... 

Personally, I didn't like their food. It seemed low quality and catered towards tourists. I ordered a seafood paella one night and it was burnt and only had four tiny, tiny shrimp in it. The deserts they brought to my room every day were beautiful but not good, I didn't even want to eat them. (Note: I stayed here during the holidays, so perhaps their normal chef wasn't working?) The complimentary breakfast had a lot of options, but was lackluster. However every morning I ended up ordering an eggs benedict (I think it was only 6 or 7 Euros) and it was delicious. This wasn't a huge issue since you're also a 5min walk from dozens of other food options. 

They made it sound like there was a spa in the hotel, but really there's only a sauna. I booked a massage and instead of going to the spa, the masseuse came to my room. The massage was good, but the masseuse was clearly sick. She was sniffling throughout and even had to blow her nose a few times. I was nervous the whole time she'd get me sick on my vacation. 

They made it sounds like the view from the rooftop was mind-blowing... but the rooftop is cramped and you can barely see anything. 

Finally, this is both a feature and a bug, but the location is a challenge for sleeping and keeping your wallet. While you have the benefit of being next to so much, that means all those people are drinking and being loud into the early morning -- and you can hear it through the room. I had to sleep with earplugs each night. Also, because you're right on La Ramblas, that means the picket pockets are right there too. If you decide to eat at the plaza, you have to keep attention on your purse/wallet at all times. This is true of anywhere in that location, but it was stressful that even at my hotel I had to be so vigilant. 

Overall, I was very happy with my stay at Hotel DO. However, now that I've stayed here once, I'm not sure if I'd say in this hotel or location again considering all the other options in Barcelona.",5,2019,01,06
32,Amazing place to stay,"Hotel Do is perfectly located just off the busy las ramblas but not remote from anything. My favourite thing about Hotel DO is that it has everything you would expect from a 5* hotel yet with all the little touches and d√©cor you get in an independent boutique. All staff were super friendly, breakfast was good and room/facilities were great.  I would recommend it to anyone.",5,2018,12,17
32,Perfect Hotel in Barcelona,"Hotel DO in Barcelona was an excellent hotel. The location could not be any better - overlooking the Place Real and with the Gothic Quarter and Las Rambla either side. The staff and attention to detail was amazing, a gorgeous room, turn down service, fruits and snacks brought to the room without asking for them. Would definitely go back to this hotel.",5,2018,12,03
32,"Understated, gorgeous rooms and attentive, kind staff in a fanatic location!","This boutique hotel offers a fantastic location in Pla√ßa Reial. With an understated elegance and a sultry vibe, we immediately felt at right at home. The staff was very attentive and delighted us with chocolates and a glass of cava upon arriving. From our room overlooking the beautiful courtyard and fountain, we were serenaded by various street musicians adding a unique flair to our stay! The only downside is that the square can get a bit noisy at times. Other than that this is a stellar place!",5,2018,11,20
32,Wheelchair in Barcelona Gothic quater,"The Hotel Do on the Placa Reial does not bill itself as wheelchair friendly. But my wife and I stayed there for three nights over two separate occassions in October 2018 and both times found the staff went out of their way to make us feel welcome. 
even with a wheelchair the rooms they provided on the first and second floors over the two occassionsworked well with the wheel chair. 
the rooms have high ceilings and are light, airy and relatively spacious. they are well appointed and for a change from many other hotels have a fully stocked minibar complementary for our stay. 
beds are comfortable but I like my pillows a bit more firm and like most hotels the Do offers slim ones. Not to my taste at all. 
The rooms have petite balconies that one can actually stand on which creates a loverly atmosphere when the double doors are open. Our rooms were on the alley that led into the Placa so we did not get too much of the noise from either the Los Ramblas nor the placa. 
the breakfast provided is tasty and plentiful. However the evening restaurant is expensive and not the best cuisine. Go into the Rambla for that. 
overall the Hotel Do is definetly a nice place to stay and we will stay their again.",4,2018,11,08
32,"Excellent staff, service, location, and accommodations","Extremely satisfied from check in to check out. Upon arrival, received complimentary drink at plaza bar. All non alcoholic drinks in room fridge were complimentary and replenished daily. Evening snack (fruit or pastry) brought to room every night. The complimentary breakfast offered a variety of delicious foods. The wifi was strong and complimentary.  Staff went above and beyond making out stay memorable and fantastic. Wish all hotels were this great. Thanks Hotel DO for a fabulous stay.",5,2018,11,06
32,"Understated elegance and class, excellent stay!","We recently stayed at the Hotel DO for a girls getaway to Barcelona to celebrate my mother in law's and 2 sister in-laws's milestone birthdays (75,50 and 40). We could not asked for a better stay, beautifully appointed rooms, large bathrooms with good lighting and nice bath amenities (heated towel rack, powerful blow dryer, Molton Brown products) plus the beds and pillows were extremely comfortable. The staff was relentless in providing excellent service and responded promptly to all requests. Our rooms each came with a complimentary welcome bottle of wine and several, large tapas plates. Was a very nice way to start the day upon arrival. Excellent location, accessible to all major sites right in center of Placa Reial. Only gripe I have are the ridiculously complicated lights in the room. There is a set of 3 switches at entry, by bed and in bathroom and even after a 4 night stay, it was a case of trail and error. There was a full page of instructions on how to use them. Really, it shouldn't be that difficult?!! On. Off. Done. But minor complaint in comparison to excellent stay. I'd be remiss to not mention the delicious full complimentary breakfast as well. Options included a full buffet of traditional tapas, meats, cheeses, pastries, etc. as well as a made to order (free) hot menu to order from. Would definitely recommend to all my friends and family.",5,2018,11,01
32,Amazing hotel!,"We‚Äôve travelled all over the world and stayed at countless top-rated hotels, but this is the FIRST review I‚Äôve ever felt compelled to write. Perfect customer service, impeccable room, luxury bedding, amazing view, outstanding breakfast, free non-alcoholic beverages in mini-bar(!!!), free drink on lovely rooftop deck...I could go on and on. Picked it for the location but was astounded at the quality and service. Incredible. Will be recommending to everyone I know. Thanks for a terrific experience!
The photo is the view from our room. Wow.üëç",5,2018,10,29
32,"Lovely place to stay, great find",I chose this hotel mainly due to its location but also the positive reviews. We were very happy to be on Placa de Reial and enjoyed being able to walk out to the Gothic Quarter and surrounding areas. We loved the narrow streets and abundance of eateries as well as the Boqueria market. The room we had was a junior suite on the third floor - if the window was open we could hear the bustle of the Square below but with the window shut the room was extremely quiet. The room was a good size and the bed a UK superking and very comfortable. The bathroom was luxurious. The staff were helpful and friendly and we enjoyed the gifts of fruit and biscuits and the free minibar. The breakfast had a reasonable choice and we would definitely stay here again. The rooftop pool was smaller than appears from the photos.,5,2018,10,25
32,Lovely stay for a week,"This is a lovely hotel, right off the Ramblas and Placa Real. The staff is understated and very professional.  We felt as if we were at an old fashioned hotel when they provided us with calling cards - what a delight! The breakfast was incredibly quiet and peaceful with fantastic spreads and a la carte items included. The neighborhood is central and very walkable. The mini bar was so nice as well! Our favorite restaurant, Vianna, is across the Placa and is open for lunch at times if you can't get in during the evening. We decided we were happier staying in the Gothic Quarter v. the Exiample. The concierge at the front was so very helpful - we had an early morning flight and she packed the nicest little breakfast for our journey to the airport. We would highly recommend this hotel to anyone! Thank you so much for a beautiful week in your incredible city! ",5,2018,10,18
32,Now our Go to Hotel in Barcelona,"This was our first stay at Hotel DO, our usual hotel had become just too expensive and I knew where this hotel was and liked the look & position,so thought we would stay there the night before our cruise. It was half the price of our normal hotel and was just as good with a larger room and fab shower room, (would love one like it at home). If I had to pick out just one of the many great things to say about this Hotel is the professional and friendly staff especially the front of house. They could not do enough for you and nothing was too much trouble, even helping with a badly damaged suitcase (thanks by the way BA for doing absolutely nothing for us) and disposing of it for us after we bought a replacement.

It is so refreshing to give a review that truly is 100% excellent. Well done DO Hotel I am sure we will be seeing you again soon.",5,2018,10,17
32,Wish I'd picked another hotel,"I picked this hotel based on the amazing reviews. Sadly i didnt experience what others have and came home sad at the thought of how much i had paid to stay there. They didnt cater for vegetarians, i asked for veggie sausages at breakfast and was told it would take 2 days (i was leaving in 2 days). As this was my first solo trip i booked the single room which has no windows..none! And part of a huge circular tank in the room, which was quite cramped. I could hear noises from the pipes at night, which meant i didnt get much sleep. I requested shower gel refills as i had run out and i was given a bottle that had clearly been re-filled so gave it back and asked for another. Whilst the pillow menu and sweet treats left at night were nice touches and of course its a great location, sadly I wouldnt stay here again.",2,2018,10,15
32,Extremely pleasant stay,"For whatever reason, upon booking I didn't realize until arrival just how boutique Hotel Do is, only 18 rooms. The hotel is very well appointed, luxury feel without any pretensions. Friendly and helpful staff.  Our double bed room, while small, was clean, comfortable, and chic. Love love love the Molton Brown toiletries. Plus the complimentatry mini bar that was restocked daily and the free nibbles (sometimes sweet, sometimes savory) that showed up in the room each evening.  The only watchouts are location. The hotel is in a great place for sight seeing, however there was audible street noise throughout the night (I'm talking 4am). Our room faced the street that connects Placa Reial to Las Ramblas. I was able to fall back asleep but if you're a super light sleeper this could be an issue, especially in warm weather when folks are partying all night long.  Secondly, the rooms had a weird lighting / electrical scheme. So complicated ""how to work the lights"" instructions are provided. I was also slightly annoyed that the charging stations by the bed were not 24 hour chargers. Phone had to be kept on the deck where the only 24 hour outlets were located. The outlets near the bed didn't work at night if the lights were off. A tad inconvenient in this day and age. The complimentary breakfast in the hotel's restaurant is another plus, although they could do with more staff. Service at breakfast was pleasant but a bit slow.",5,2018,09,25
32,Outstanding Service,"The location of the hotel is amazing, in the middle of Las Ramblas and on Plaza Reial.  The room was a bit small, like most in Europe, but outfitted in a luxurious manner.  Arriving from the airport tired and hot, we were so happy that the mini-refrigerator was stocked with included waters and juices.  The main distinction here is the truly outstanding service at all times.  We had to get an early start one morning, so went down to wait just a few minutes for breakfast to begin.  The waiters were so concerned to see us waiting that they sent for the manager to come talk to us and make sure that everything was alright.  Highly recommended.  ",5,2018,09,23
32,Highlight Hotel of Our Honeymoon,"Placa Reial was a surreal and incredibly romantic experience!  The location was perfect for traveling around Barcelona.  The moment we arrived (in the flurry of Catalan independence day), the friendly staff took the time to make us feel as comfortable as possible.  We were offered welcome drinks, and a friendly porter gave us a tour of our room and amenities.  The view of the plaza was lovely and private, and the staff added lovely touches to our room throughout the stay-- whether it was leaving fruit or tea out for us, a summary of the weather for the day, or refreshing our fridge.

The breakfast was delicious, and the beverage program impressive!  Room service was spot on and polite.  In particular, a service professional named William helped us to pick out several bottles of wine that we enjoyed immensely!  Everyone was patient and respectful, and we felt like we were truly taken care of.  The room was quiet throughout our entire stay, and we even had the pool all to ourselves one evening.

The perfect place to relax and feel like a million dollars!",5,2018,09,20
32,Excellent return visit,"We have stayed at the Hotel Do a few times before and enjoyed it. Our latest visit did not disappoint.

The hotel‚Äôs location on the Placa Reial, just off La Rambla , is close to much of the tourist are of the city . 

The hotel offers elegant, stylish accommodation with just 18 rooms. We booked a standard double room which was very spacious and comfortable with excellent decor, silent efficient air conditioning and high ceilings. Also, the bathroom was spacious and well appointed. 

The helpful and friendly staff were offered a warm welcome. When we departed they came on to La Rambla to help getting a taxi. 

The hotel appeared to have closed its fine dining restaurant but this did not matter as we wanted to eat in their tapas restaurant. This is on a terrace by Placa Reial, serves excellent, filling tapas and is great for people watching. 

Overall, a great place to stay in Barcelona offering a welcoming, personal experience.",5,2018,09,14
32,Wonderful Stay at Hotel DO Placa Reial,"We stayed at Hotel DO Placa Reial for two nights.  The service is excellent, starting with the first greeting and continuing through our stay.  We had the pleasure of eating delicious tapas at Hotel DO's restaurant right on the square after checkin, and then started to explore the city.  The hotel is well situated in the old city, making a number of landmarks, entertainment areas and shopping opportunities an easy walk.  The hotel provided a great breakfast each day, consisting of a good selection of pastries and cold dishes, along with the ability to order hot dishes from the kitchen, all with excellent service.  The rooms are spacious and clean.  

We look forward to staying here again on our next visit.  Every member of the hotel staff was pleasant and was quite focused on making our stay pleasurable and memorable.  Thanks!!",5,2018,09,14
32,Hotel DO The Full Five Stars,"This hotel gets the full Five Stars. Everything is great at this hotel, Location, Food, Service and atmosphere. If you want stay one of best hotel in town you should check out this place. Me and my wife really love it and we will come back.",5,2018,09,03
32,Exceptional Service and Hotel,"My wife and me stayed there for 4 nights. Right from walk in to the hotel we can feel the soul of Barcelona inside! Very authentic interior design. We were greeted with Cava and were offered early check in. 
I mentioned to hotel receptionist that my wife has a birthday next day and in the morning they delivered a bottle of champagne with chocolate cake completely complimentary even I offered to pay for it. 
Very clean, room cleaning was performed 2-3times a day.",5,2018,08,16
32,Great location,"We have been to Barcelona many times before but this is our first time at this hotel. It could not be better located if you want to walk around the old city centre. Las Ramblas is just around the corner and there are plenty of good restaurants close by.  The hotel staff will recommend. If you are going to eat in the square the hotel restaurant is one of the best. Try the anchovies ... delicious .... and the black rice. Other restaurants in the square are a bit touristy but the hotel restaurant was really great. Also they give priority to guests. We stayed in a superior room  (no 34) with views over the square. The room was large with plenty of cupboard space. Spacious bathroom too with a separate shower and bath.  Breakfast was really good too both a buffet plus a la carte.  The rolls and croissants were really nice. Every day there is a different local cake too. Mini bar was included in the room price. Every evening we got fresh fruit plus cake or savoury pastry plus free drinks. The staff were all really nice. I speak fluent Spanish but it was not needed as all of the staff spoke perfect English. Yes the pool is small, only a plunge pool, but sufficient to cool down. Not a problem for us as we do not visit a city to spend our time in the hotel pool. You can walk to La Sacrada Familia but it‚Äôs over an hours walk ... not a problem if you enjoy great architecture and you can visit one of the Gaud√≠ houses on the way too. We really enjoyed the hotel and would stay there again. ",5,2018,08,12
32,Wonderful Place,"Our stay at the Hotel Do was great.  The service, the amenities the atmosphere was terrific. The location is perfect to walk to all sites.  Everything is included in one price...parking, mini bar (non-alcholic), and full breakfast. The Square outside is a meeting spot for all and there is always some form of entertainment happen in the evening. Excellent beds with lots os pillows too.
Would definitely recommend!! 
SB from Toronto",5,2018,08,07
32,"Perfect location, friendly staff","The location of the DO was perfect. It is on the square. The staff at the hotel was extremely helpful and pleasant.
Unfortunately  there was a taxi strike while we were in Barcelona but the Metro was close by. Even though the square was full of people and noisy you could not here any of the noise in your room. The bed was very comfortable. If I retrun to Barcelona this is where I would stay.
",5,2018,08,03
32,Post Cruise Stay,"We stayed at this wonderful hotel after sailing on the wonderful Harmony of the Seas, the hotel was a mazing, near Las Ramblas and on Placa Reial, Everything about this boutique hotel was perfect. We stayed in a suite with a balcony and could hear and feel the culture every night. The room was huge, with Molton Brown products, the bed was very comfortable. We are a family of three whom enjoy traveling in style and had not one complaint about this hotel, we highly recommend it. We are the Healthyfitcouple and we approve this hotel :)",5,2018,08,03
32,"Great Breakfast, Great Location, Great Customer Relations","will come back if I stay in Barcelona again!""
Îàâ-No need to advertise for pool because it is really hot during this season and so small. Think of it as a jacuzzi for 8 people.
-La Rambla region is full of pickpockets, watch out for Romanians...
-But police are all around.
-They tried to steal my wallet from my purse, I caught him and took my wallet back and reported him to police.
-Thy can serve better coffee. 
-It would be nice to have a little window with a view but great AC System so that was not necessary.

Îàá-All the personnel is customer friendly, they are so helpful. They helped me to book online tickets for Park G√ºell and Sagrada Familia Basilica.
-Room is squeaky clean. (Especially bathrooms)
-Breakfast is a la carte and really tasty.
-Their home made pastries are amazing (croissant, pain au chocolat, bun with raisins). They bring them every day at breakfast before you even ask for them.
-I ate Eggs Benedict with Salmon &Spanish omelette& cheese platter&fresh tomatoes&wild berries&yogurt.
- As a foodie, breakfast is important for me. So it was really nice. Also you can order as much as you want all is included.
-Close to the beach (1.5 km)
-Close to Mercat de la Bouqeuria (fresh food market)
-Close to a nice ice cream place called Emilia 
-200 meters from Liceu station
-Easy access to El Prat Airport (Use Line 9 and Line 3 metro connection at Zona Universitara)
-Great touch of the hotel is cookies and fresh fruit they leave in your room during the day. When you come back to your room it is so nice to see little plate of fruit and cookies. (Loved madeleine like cookies but the other ones can be better though)",4,2018,08,02
32,Best hotel in the world ,I will never stay anywhere else as long as I have the luck to visit Barcelona.  The service exceeds all expectations.   It‚Äôs one of the more expensive places I stay but always worth it.  This really is my favorite hotel in the world.,5,2018,07,29
32,Stuart B,"Wonderful staff and great location. Although the plaza was busy at night the double glazing and shutters allowed a good night's sleep. Amenities were first class.

We found the staff to be most helpful to non Spanish speakers and clearly knew their city.

The central location meant that many of the sites of significance were within an hours walk.",5,2018,07,25
32,Unforgettable Stay,"Superb Service, Fast and attentive. Very friendly staff. We stayed at the junior suite with my family (2  kids, 2&5 years old) for one week and it was our first visit to Barcelona. It had an amazing view over the Pla√ßa reial. Le rambla is just few seconds away, the location is perfect between Pla√ßa catalunya and the pier. We had a fantastic and cant think of any further improvements. ",5,2018,07,24
32,Wonderful Small Hotel with Excellent Service,"Beautifully decorated small hotel with attention to detail.  Our room was larger than the normal Spanish hotel room with high ceilings and a transitional decor.  The heavy curtains did a good job of keeping the street noise down at night - located on the Rambla, so can be noisey.  And it was wonderful to be able to pick and choose from the mini bar which was complimentary with the room.  Be sure to visit the well appointed restaurant on the lower level -- beautiful, with brick vaulted arches and, not to  mention breakfast is made to order.  We, also enjoyed lunch at their plaza setting on Placa Reial -- great people watching and excellent tapas with sangria (I recommend the egg/shoestring potato/ham tapa).  Oh, don't miss the lovely rooftop pool area - beautiful and fun to  watch the activities in the plaza from the rooftop.",5,2018,07,20
32,Wonderful hotel in a perfect location!,"Hotel DO is the perfect combination of old world charm, modern amenities, exceptional service, and ideal location.  We stayed in the Junior Suite that overlooked Placa Reial.  Walking distance to EVERYTHING - great shopping, great food, and key tourist spots.  Only thing to be aware of is that at night - there is a nightlife.  While it wasn't an issue for us, if you are an early sleeper you might want to opt for white noise - or choose a different hotel.  Club hoppers from the nearby dance club might keep you up.",5,2018,07,18
32,Super boutique in main square,"Great location and service. Good for both family (if you get 2 rooms as they are smaller), and great for couples. In an active square in great part of Barcelona. Staff was awesome and attentive. Food/tapas were also very good.",5,2018,07,16
32,Incredible boutique hotel,"What an amazing hotel. Located in the Placa Reial, it is an incredible boutique hotel with only 15 rooms.  Rooms are spacious, with high ceilings and small balcony open to the placa. 

Food at breakfast and the hotel restaurant were very good, and the service was friendly.",5,2018,07,12
32,Absolutely Magnificent!,"Stayed in the junior suite. High ceilings, luxurious, details, detail, details everywhere! Two balconies. Incredible bathroom with double shower and best water pressure I‚Äôve ever experienced in my life. Couldn‚Äôt be better appointed or with more amenities. Amazing breakfast, espresso drinks (complimentary) and wonderful food in restaurant. We arrived super early and the made me a cold foam Irish coffee that I will never forget. Run here!",5,2018,07,09
32,Dr. Ali Alaiwi,"A 7 stars hospitality
Wonderful staff at this outstanding hotel.
Starting from the outstanding front office staff, the hygienic housekeeping, the restaurant professional staff and the high quality food.
They were all committed, active listener and problem solvers as well as an excellent hotel location.",5,2018,07,07
32,Maggie,"The DO is both quaint and luxurious. It is centrally located for lots of sight seeing in Barcelona, and the breakfast menu included in the stay is fresh and delicious. The rooms are very comfortable, stylish and clean, staff is friendly and helpful. The Plaza Real down below has a loud nightlife, so be prepared for some noise.",5,2018,07,04
32,Wonderful Staff & Lovely Room - Loved the small pool!,Right in the middle of everything.  The staff and service were wonderful and it was a great place to return after a day of touring to dip in the small rooftop pool and then sit in front for drinks on the Placa Reial.,4,2018,07,04
32,Excellent service .. great reception staff ,"Booked it on recommendation of a friend who stayed here two years ago. I arrived early and my room was ready exactly to my request    Firm matress and vegan tapas.  Refreshing cava to make a wonderful start to my vacation. I couldn‚Äôt complain a thing about the excellent spacious room with lovely view of placa reial except I didn‚Äôt get one with a balcony!   The restaurant could be better in breakfast literally nothing to serve, and in service which was rude. Shows in lack of customers.  Yet I would definitely come here again.  
I took a six hour small group city tour recommended by them which was ok and didn‚Äôt give good idea of city considering it was the only one I did in Barcelona. Suggest they find another option ",5,2018,07,04
32,"The Hotel DO. EXTRAORDINARY!!! Placa Reial, Barcelonia Spain","The location was perfect!! In the center of everything, food, shopping etc.
The service at the Hotel was extraordinary, from welcoming us to answering our every need, to a beautiful breakfast, Tapas & drinks late afternoon, fresh apricots to our room, 
and the staff was so anxious to please  us and to make sure we had everything we
needed. Can't wait to go back to Barcelonia and DO.Placa Raiel!!!!",5,2018,06,18
32,Wonderful Hotel; Great Location,"I spent four nights in a single room at Hotel DO, and was happy with my choice. No, there was no view, but I didn‚Äôt fly nearly 5,000 miles to look out a window! During the day, there was plenty of natural light via a frosted window; during the night, it was amazingly quiet, for being situated between La Rambla and Pla√ßa Reial.
The location is just blocks away from both the Liceu and the Drassenes metro stops, so it was easy to get to/from the airport and the Renfe train station. Most sites I wanted to visit were within walking distance.
The rooftop pool is small and shallow, but perfect for an afternoon cooling-off dip, around siesta time.
The breakfast menu was WONDERFUL, and I was offered a take-away breakfast the morning of my departure.
The hotel is beautiful, perfectly located, and every single staff member was helpful and very gracious. I would definitely stay here, again.",5,2018,06,17
32,Fantastic location and service!,"We stayed 2 nights at the Hotel Do and I would have loved to have stayed longer! The service was friendly and efficient. We felt welcomed from the moment we arrived until we checked out. Breakfast was lovely- the pastries and the salmon Benedict were delicious. The location is perfect- in the beautiful Plaza Reial- but surprisingly quiet rooms. (We had 2 rooms on the third floor). Easy walk to everything. We enjoyed the welcome drink and evening tapas. Comfy bed, nice and generous amenities. Highly recommend -Loved it! ",5,2018,06,17
32,Fading glory ,"I had done a huge amount of research before booking this hotel and the reviews were so positive 

We had the El Terrat room and the room itself is great. The amenities are plentiful and the bottle of cava as a welcome was thoughtful. The room was quiet and felt modern whilst mixed with history. You couldn‚Äôt hear the noise from the square. The terrace was an added bonus. One of the main reasons for booking this room was the pool and unfortunately we were let down in a big way. The pool itself was dirty with algae and pigeon droppings in the pool. I discovered this when I took a dip one afternoon - really off putting seeing droppings dissolve and green colour the water. In our week there, it had not been cleaned once. I did not have another dip. 

However we would perhaps consider staying again based on our experience of the room alone.

A real draw for me was the fact that this was a foodie hotel with great restaurants.  The food was disappointing with a real sense of a place which used to be great but is now on its last leg. There is a lot of service staff but very few customers. One evening we noted that every restaurant on the square was packed with some even having queues and yet there were only customers at three of the tables at DO terrace restaurant. Much has been written about the breakfast and it is unusual for such an extensive a la carte option for breakfast but personally I would would have a small number of awesome dishes rather than a spread of just ok-ish dishes. The omelette was tasteless, the waffle prepackaged and reheated. On a positive note, the eggs benedict was well made and presented. We had cocktails in the bar one evening and they were awful - the mixologist did not have the experience required to make an old fashioned or a margarita despite both being on the cocktail menu. 

",2,2018,06,15
32,Hotel Do is a done deal!,"You must book this hotel while in Barcelona. We are so glad we did. Everything seemed better than we even anticipated and there were little bonuses everywhere. Enjoy the surprise treats!
Location , comfort , service were all up there as previous reviews have mentioned - they are not exaggerating ; this boutique hotel provides it all with a personable smile and sincerity from all staff. 
 
We really like Barcelona and if we return,  Hotel Do would be our only place to stay.",5,2018,06,14
32,Deserves its rating; superb hotel a Las Ramblas ,"Had a fabulous couple of nights at the Do.

Lovely boutique hotel right on the nicest square in Barca, Pla√ßa Reial and central to everything that you‚Äôd want to see and a stones throw to Las Ramblas.

Staff are absolutely fantastic; friendly, welcoming and nothing too much to ask for. With our room package, we had a welcome drink on the terrace looking out onto the square and also a free bottle of wine and tapas (we had that the second night and we were sated). 

The room we had was perfectly comfortable and lots of amenities. The only thing missing was a kettle for a morning tea, but otherwise there was always a gift that came for you late in the day (some fruit or a chocolate) and the weather update for the next day. It‚Äôs little touches like that you remember and that‚Äôs what makes a great hotel; those small, but valued things.

Breakfast also included and you could eat as much as you liked from the menu. Before 9am you‚Äôre downstairs, but after 9am on the terrace where you can sit for hours and watch people and the world go by. There‚Äôs always something happening in Pla√ßa Reial. 

High quality, excellent value for money and in the best spot possible. If you‚Äôre in Barca for a few days and want a recommendation, stay here and nowhere else. The team at Do know what it is to run a great establishment. A pleasure to stay here. ",5,2018,06,12
32,Friendly boutique hotel but old ,"We stayed one night at Hotel DO before we headed back to SF. Here are some pros and cons per our experience: 

Pros:
1. Location is awesome. It's in the Placa Reil. 
2. Booked directly from hotel website could get welcome bottle of wine /cava and seasoned Tapas, breakfast included.
3. Hotel staff are very friendly and helpful. 
4.Love their huge double sink and remodeled tube and shower room.
5. Mini bar in the room is free! There are soft drinks, juices, bottle waters. Free wifi, safe box, vanity supplies and sleepers. 

Cons:
1. Lobby is small. Hotel interior and elevator are aged.
2. Room is small and over priced for that size of room. Standard room is only 23m. 

Some people worried about the noisy issue since it's in the busy plaza. But actually they have soundproof window (I guess), we didn't hear any noise during the sleep. We were at 3rd floor. ",4,2018,06,10
32,Excellent choice for short stay in Barcelona,"Wonderful location, very nice room, extremely helpful staff.  Used TripAdvisor reviews to book this lovely hotel and glad we did.  It was perfect for our short (3 night) stay prior to a cruise and the staff went out of its way to provide assistance and advice.  Highest recommendation from us!",5,2018,06,10
32,Excellent,Really really good cute hotel with great rooms and all the little luxury touches. Excellent breakfast included in room rate but a la carte menu. Perfect location in the gothic quarter but close to everything else. Will definitely go back! ,5,2018,06,10
32,Great boutique hotel in center of Barcelona,"I‚Äôm so glad we chose Hotel DO for our time in Barcelona. The location was perfect and we could walk to many sights. It‚Äôs next to a lovely and popular square with many tapas bars nearby, which is both good and bad because of the noise. 
Our room was superior, great bathroom and comfy beds. The staff really stood out for their helpfulness and friendliness. Oh and we loved the little ‚Äògifts‚Äù that were left in our room each night! They were such a nice touch. ",5,2018,06,07
32,Luxury on an intimate scale,"Stayed at this hotel with my mother and daughter for three nights. Everything was wonderful! It‚Äôs a relatively small boutique hotel so the staff take care of you like family. Fantastic location but be warned, there are people out in the square talking until the sun comes up. That wouldn‚Äôt deter me from staying here again though.",5,2018,06,06
32,Amazing Barcelona,This was our first visit to Barcelona and Hotel DO was the perfect place to stay. The location is on an active square where there were patio restaurants all around. We were within walking distance to the local market which is a must see for anyone visiting this area. Our room was quite comfortable and was attended to daily with a nice surprise. We would definitely book Hotel DO again. ,5,2018,06,05
32,Wow!,"We can't speak too highly of this little boutique hotel in such a fabulous location.  Simply beautiful room with every amenity catered for.  Best breakfast!  However the staff are superb - from check in, where the lady on the desk confirmed our tour later in the day and gave us a welcome coffee to Mariano who was so friendly & helpful with our bags.  Jean Claude recommended and booked our dinner and then walked us over to the restaurant which was close by and it was fabulous too.  You won't be disappointed!",5,2018,05,30
32,Great location!!,"We are so glad we chose Hotel DO for our recent 4 day trip to Barcelona. We loved the quaint feel, and our junior suite was spacious and beautiful. It was close to everything and we loved the convenience and beauty of the gothic quarter. Will warn you though- the Placa Reial is busy and lots of fun, but is noisy until the sun comes up. We didn‚Äôt mind but I would imagine some people would be bothered by the noise while trying to sleep.",5,2018,05,27
32,Fantastic hotel in a great location,"We stayed here for a long weekend and had a great team, lovely room with plenty of space and wonderful view over the Place Reial.  Lots of great touches that make the stay special, free non alcoholic mini bar, wonderful breakfast and the staff are wonderful.  We found the location ideal and walked pretty much everywhere from here.  Can't wait to go back.",5,2018,05,24
32,Extraordinary Experience!!!,"My husband and I spent 3 days here prior to boarding a Mediterranean cruise. We are 1 week into vacation and WISH we could be back in Barcelona it was so amazing! The staff is phenomenal! Especially a guy named Pedro Moreno! We learned more about Barcelona‚Äôs culture from Pedro than any guidebook. Pedro is an asset to this hotel and deserves a raise how special he made our stay! When you get caught up in Barcelona‚Äôs nightlife you‚Äôll learn that there‚Äôs nowhere to get food after 3am. Pedro took care of that too! Delicious late night snacks were prepared and delivered to our room, which he totally didn‚Äôt have to do. We can‚Äôt wait to come back and visit Pedro and the Hotel DO!!! The views from our room were breathtaking (junior suite overlooking Pla√ßa Reial). You open the windows and hear the energy from the square below! Can‚Äôt wait to come back! Thanks for everything Pedro!!!",5,2018,05,24
32,WOW FACTORS EVERYWHERE HERE!!!,Read all the TA reviews and decided to spend 1 night here ahead of cruise departure. Blown away - rooms were ready; all the finishes are amazing; amenities the best; shower and bathroom design the best; bed was wonderful; AC was great but not really needed. Ate dinner at restaurant and enjoyed all the people on the square.  Bell and wait staff very attentive. Exceeded all expectations. Did not want to leave. Noise at night on square not a significant issue for us.Only negative is learning how to use all the switches in the room that control lighting. RUN to this place!,5,2018,05,23
32,Wonderful Boutique Hotel,"Small luxe hotel in the best location in Barcelona. The rooms were quite spacious, modern and comfortable. We booked directly through the hotel so we were greeted with a tasteful Tapas lunch and a bottle of wine upon arrival. Fabulous",5,2018,05,20
32,Beautiful boutique hotel,"This is a small hotel that sits on the Placa Reial.  Nicely decorated with a stunning circular staircase that sits in the center of the building.  Upon arrival we were greeted by a gentleman who assisted us with our bags.  Daniel at the front desk was friendly and professional.  We were escorted to our room where we were shown how to use the lights, ac, tv etc.  The room was clean and comfortable, the bathroom had a separate shower, tub and water closet.  They also provided Molton Brown bath products.  The shower was amazing, it has a large waterfall shower head and the pressure was incredible.  The area around this hotel is very busy with restaurants and shops.  There is foot traffic and street noise that goes late into the night, however this is not the hotels fault, just a warning for light sleepers.  Complimentary breakfast and mini bar access were included with our deal.",5,2018,05,17
32,Delightful boutique hotel,"We stayed here for 4 nights in early May in  superior room with small balcony overlooking the Pla√ßa Real. The windows were double glazed and the room sound proofed as the Pla√ßa is noisy at night.
The room was immaculately clean and well equipped. The bathroom was spacious and well designed.
The staff were exemplary. They were helpful with advice about restaurants, how to use the metro, and with everything else. Their attitude was more than excellent. They made us feel very welcome both to the hotel and to Barcelona.
A nice touch was providing us with fruit and cake or biscuits in the evening.
I would place this at the top of good hotels. We have travelled extensively and know what we are talking about.",5,2018,05,14
32,Very nice hotel,"We stayed in this hotel for a week in April. We had a wonderful experience starting from our arrival and ending with our departure. The hotel is located on Placa Reial which is quite busy, to say the least. Even by Spain night life standards the noise level was a bit too much. There are people on the Plaza making all kind of noise 24/7. However, with a double pane windows we were very comfortable and looking out of the window during the day can be very entertaining. The hotel staff is fantastic and will satisfy all your reasonable needs. Room service is above reproach and daily treats left in the room (sweets, fruits, etc.) are heartwarming. The restaurant downstairs is fabulous and comfy. The only negative thing to mention was wifi which would become spotty after about 11 PM. Overall, it was absolutely great stay.",5,2018,05,07
32,Best hotel we've ever stayed at,"This hotel is absolutely phenomenal. The location is perfect, and more than convenient to everything you could want. Easy access to the metro, and is surrounded by fabulous restaurants. The hotel itself is small and intimate. Service was impeccable. We were greeted upon arrival with a glass of sangria. That evening, we received complimentary tapas and a bottle of cava. The view of Placa Reial is beautiful.

We stayed in El Terrat, and the private terrace was so worth it. The pool was cold, but after a long day of touring, it was very welcome. Every afternoon they brought a bowl of fruit, and every night left a dessert with turndown service. They also left a breakfast menu, which you could select your order and time of delivery for the following morning.

Every morning we were woken to beautiful and delicious coffees, fresh orange juice, pastries, crepes, and spanish omelettes.

This is the best hotel we've ever stayed at, and cannot wait to return.",5,2018,05,05
32,Attraction to the finest details ... looking forward to be back!,"Rooms are Fantastic! the staffs are genus and friendly, one of the best room services ! speedy and tasty.

32,"Fantastic Boutique Hotel, very friendly and helpful staff","I stayed here for 5 nights. The hotel is beautiful, the single room was small with no view, but was fine for me alone. It is in a perfect location to walk around and explore the Gothic Quarter. The staff was so friendly and helpful. I would definitely stay again if I make it back to Barcelona!",5,2018,05,01
32,Best hotel in central Barcelona!,"We recently staid at Hotel Do for the weekend with my family and had the best stay ever!
The hotel is beautifully decorated, super clean, very luxurious, the staff are so friendly and helpful and it is located in the best location in the center, walking distance to the nicest spots in town. I would recommend the hotel with no hesitation at all and will love to stay there again next time I am in Barcelona. Love hotel DO",5,2018,04,16
32,Awesome Boutique Hotel!,"Great hotel, awesome & helpful staff and perfect location!  We stayed here for 7 days for our kids' Spring Break in April, 2018 and had a very good experience.  Located off the Ramblas at the Placa Reial, the location is perfect for access to the hustle & bustle of town, the seaside promenade and the various sites (parks, Gaudi buildings, shopping, restaurants, etc).  I cannot say enough positive things about the hotel staff!  So very friendly & helpful!  All in all, a near perfect stay!",5,2018,04,09
32,Great hotel ,"This hotel is located on a loverly square with some great restaurants. The staff are helpful and they have very comfortable sofas. A good base to explore the city from, and see the delights of Barcelona. ",5,2018,03,11
32,Excellent boutique hotel in the heart of the Gothic District,"Do is as close to perfection you can come to for a small boutique hotel. It is a very small hotel - only 18 rooms. The service is impeccable and the staff are excellent in anticipating your needs. Jean-Claude, one of the front desk attendant, is one step above the rest - the perfect balance between professionalism and personal attention. The rooms are smaller but very comfortable and amenities top notch with lots of small details. The roof terrace with its diminutive pool (bath?) should be incredible during the summer. The breakfast is also excellent in its variety and quality. Not a buffet, but an all you can select a la carte. Even their small selection of spa services are incredible for such a small hotel. Location is unbeatable. One small thing is that you are on a plaza and noise can be loud if you keep the window open, but the proximity to all that is Barcelona Gothic makes up for any disturbance.",5,2018,03,09
32,Hotel Do Barcelona ,"Very nice, sweet and cute hotel. The best location ever. Very polite and helpful stuff. Rooms are spacious and very good decorated. Breakfast is amazing. You can order it in the room as well. Top service. Definitely I will stay there again. 10 points from 10 :) ",5,2018,03,02
32,Excellent Hotel and Staff,"Excellent experience, couldn't have found a better place to stay.  Location is terrific, rooms are large and well appointed. Hotel staff are very helpful, professional, friendly, etc.  We used the breakfast meal plan and the meals were great.  Can't say enough about the Hotel DO.  Recommend it without any hesitation whatsoever.",5,2018,02,26
32,Perfect in every way,"We couldn't have chosen a more perfect hotel to celebrate our wedding anniversary.  The warm & friendly welcome from Luis was the promising start of an exceptional stay in this lovely hotel.  We stayed in El Terrat and can definitely recommend this lovely room, with its private roof terrace (although it was too cold to use the pool), vast bed, sumptuous pillows & huge shower with a view over the rooftops.  Extras for booking direct with the hotel included a delicious selection of tapas and a bottle of cava, which we enjoyed in sitting under the heated awning of La Terrassa, watching the rain fall in the Pla√ßa Reial.  On returning to our room we found another bottle of cava and a divine chocolate mousse cake, served with the anniversary wishes & the compliments of the hotel.  Our room service meal, of beef burger (definitely an understatement given the quality of the meat) with truffled potatoes & saut√©ed artichokes, was delicious and was followed by more complimentary cake & grapes.  After a comfortable night‚Äôs sleep, we enjoyed a delicious breakfast of pastries, freshly cooked bacon and eggs, toast with homemade jam, fresh orange juice & coffee and then were able to leave our luggage & car to be collected that evening, after a day out in Barcelona.  Every member of staff, without exception, was friendly yet professional at all times and I cannot recommend the Hotel DO more highly.  We will certainly return when we next visit this beautiful city.",5,2018,02,08
32,Mrs,"Great location with an amazing staff. 
Highly recommend the hotel. Very small hotel but clean and very helpful with anything we needed. 
We keep kosher and they let us use their refrigerator for our own food and gave us a table to eat at whenever we needed it. Extremely accommodating ",5,2018,02,08
32,Simply Perfect,"I booked the hotel for a long weekend for our wedding anniversary, principally due to its great location, just off Las Ramblas.

Overall the hotel has 18 bedrooms, boutique in style, small spa, roof terrace with pool, bar, restaurant and cafe/outside seating.

I booked direct with the hotel, which meant cancellation with 24hour notice was a option, but it also mentioned a welcome drink. This turned out to be a complimentary bottle of Cava and a small taste of some great tapas prepared by the chef. This was a great little treat and only enhanced the overall service received.

Breakfast was also included and was great, full service with an extensive menu and as much as you wanted. The staff were great, with nothing too much trouble. Great coffee and we particularly loved the savoury cheese and ham buns.

In fact, all the staff, without exception, were fantastic, friendly, polite, attentive and professional. 

The room was beautiful, spacious, comfortable, light in colours contrasted with some dark furniture. Particular mention to the great shower. Everything you would expect in terms of amenities and complimentary soft drink mini bar. The one exception being tea/coffee making facilities.

This is not a cheap hotel, it‚Äôs a five star boutique hotel, but in my view worth every penny!

32,More than a hotel...we felt at home.,"Hotel DO is an 18-room boutique hotel right on La Rambla in the heart of Barcelona. You would be hard-pressed to find a hotel with a better location. My girlfriend and I stayed for 5 nights and had an absolute wonderful experience. The hotel and room itself was of classic style but with modern touches and all the amenities you could wish for. The staff were extremely helpful and always looking to serve their guests. Jean Claude and Christina were particularly kind and helpful when it came to recommendations for dinner and nightlife. We received sangria upon arrival and were escorted to our room. Breakfast and mini-fridge is all included which is a nice perk. You can even order breakfast to your room and have breakfast in bed at no additional cost! The view of the square from our private balcony was also a nice touch. Overall, I could not recommend Hotel DO any higher - absolute gem!",5,2018,02,03
32,Special haven on La Rambla,"Hotel Do is a cute boutique hotel in a quaint plaza off of Las Ramblas, within walking distance to La Broqueria and as well as the gothic quarter and the shopping on passieg de gracia. The service is spot on, the included a la carte breakfast is delicious, and if you book directly through the hotel, you get a selection of tapas and a bottle of wine or cava. The room itself was light and airy with a small Juliet balcony overlooking the square. Bathroom is huge, with a separate water closet, shower with rain shower and handheld nozzle, a big soaking tub and double sinks with Molton Brown products. Turn down service includes some seasonal fruit and scented room spray if you ask for it. All in all, I really enjoyed my stay here and all the little personal touches. There is some construction in the square currently, but it wasn't too noisy on the 3rd floor.",5,2018,01,27
32,Great location and great hotel.,"A lovely small boutique hotel with rooms with amazingly high ceilings. Wonderfully large double bathroom and great shower.  Great design. Location is really good and within walking distance to everywhere. Breakfast was provided in the downstairs basement with its vaulted brick ceilings.. lovely and the food yummy. Great staff, The food however, in the restaurant on the Plaza could be better for dinner. But we would return to the hotel. It had a good vibe.",5,2018,01,24
32,"Second time around, not so charming....","NOISY, NOISY, NOISY - What a deep disappointment, the last time we stayed here in 2014, we really enjoyed ourselves at this family owned hotel but this time, after being jet lagged, just wanting to unwind before a hectic trip ahead, we could not get a wink of sleep.  We had two rooms, on different ends of the floor, both were unbearable noisy with outside street happenings, drunks on the square until dawn.....The actual service of all the hotel staff was still spot-on but we both agreed that we would not return based on the noise level which is a shame.  I liked the little touches, of different food/fruit gifts each day and free mini bar.",4,2018,01,10

Had a wonderful stay at this hotel, would recommend.",5,2018,01,07
32,Perfect perfect perfect,"Barcelona is the last stop of our two week holiday and having stayed at 6 other five star properties around France, I must say that this is by far our favourite. The staff (I forgot the name of the lady that received us when we checked in) and Albert who was so helpful and welcoming to us during our stay, and the convenient location of the hotel, the plush pillows and amenities available in the hotel. They also give you fresh fruits and small biscuits daily, and we asked for a couple of ear plugs (after reading previous reviews here) and they gave them to us too. Maybe we were lucky but the ‚Äònoise‚Äô wasn‚Äôt loud enough to bother us despite being light sleepers! 

We loved the high ceilings in the rooms and how the hotel really goes the extra mile to make your stay so personalised and special. We can‚Äôt wait to come back! ",5,2017,12,29
32,Gastronomic Hotel in a wonderful location ,"Stayed in this lovely property in August. Our room was freshly renovated and was well thought out and done to a high standard. 

The rooftop deck/pool/bar was a wonderful place to relax and look out over the stunning gothic quarter. 

Breakfast was brilliant in every way and the staff were welcoming and efficient. 

My only complaint was that the hotel is located on an old square that is delightful by day, but filled with drunken British youths that partied all night (every night we were there). Not the hotels fault but you need to bring your ear plugs to get a reasonable nights sleep. 

That aside, I will definitely return to this lovely city and stay here again. ",5,2017,12,24
32,Amazing staff and beautiful Hotel,"The hotel was excellent in all departments, I cannot fault anything. Perfect location and a beautiful hotel. The best part of our stay at Hotel Do Placa Reial was how amazing the staff were, they were all brilliant especially the front of house staff. They helped us with anything we needed and did it with a smile and generosity. Honest, genuinely lovely people. I will recommend this hotel to everyone.",5,2017,12,12

The location is perfect just few steps from la rambla and there are a couple of train stations nearby.

Excellent food and room service which will make your stay even better",5,2017,12,11
32,Hidden Gem,"Hidden treasure in the center of the gothic quarter. Illuminated by the lights around at night, spectacular dining experience with exceptional service and daily delicacy surprises. The amazing inclusive breakfast of variety of pastries and delicious eggs Benedict is sure to knock your socks off and give your tastebuds a tour. If you want any to experience the Spanish culture and have a one in the lifetime experience, this is a place for you. ",5,2017,12,11
32,It was PERFECT!,"We like boutique hotels and Hotel DO is now a favorite! Located on Placa real in the heart of the city, it was a short walk to the Ramblas and all the shops and restaurants. Upon arrival, we were given an excellent overview of the hotel and amenities and then show our room. The room was lovely, the bed was very comfortable and the extra big tub was perfect for soaking after a long day. Breakfast was amazing! Great service and delicious selections daily. We tried the restaurant facing the plaza and found it lacking compared to the locals places we ate at during our stay. The only complaint would be that the hot water could have been hotter! Other than that it was an excellent hotel.",5,2017,12,04
32,Great Service.  Great Location.,Our family booked 3 rooms and stayed 6 nights.  Everything was great and the staff was exceptional.  The square outside the hotel was quite busy and loud well past midnight.  We are experienced travelers and used ear plugs to sleep eliminating the problem.,5,2017,11,29
32,Great Hotel,The staff at the Hotel amazing they cannot do enough to make your stay great!  Kudos to whoever does the hiring.  Awesome location on the Rambla! Stayed three nights and only Sat night seemed a little noisy outside at night but Barcelona rocks everywhere.  The rooms large incredibly clean and bed comfortable.   Breakfasts each morning outstanding.   Will definetly stay there again as Barcelona incredible city.  We had no issues with pick pockets but we were incredibly dilegent and went out of our way to avoid any situations where by anyone could get close enough to bump into us.,5,2017,11,18
32,Beautiful Boutique Hotel,"This hotel on Placa Reial was fabulous.  First, the staff treated us like family;  everyone was so nice and accommodating, even bringing us coffee and beignets prior to the restaurant opening on the morning we left for home.  Second, the hotel was so quaint, very clean, the rooms were extremely comfortable, and the food was delicious.  Unfortunately, the rooftop was closed for the winter, but the view was great.  the A/C worked well (always a plus!)  We will definitely return to Hotel DO Placa Reial.  Thank you everyone",5,2017,11,13
32,Wonderful Night at Hotel DO,"We spent 1 night post cruise at Hotel Do and wish we had more time there.  We were travelling with another couple and we both booked rooms at Hotel DO.  The hotel is located on Placa Reial and next to Las Ramblas.  The taxi driver dropped us off right outside the Square and it was a short quick walk to the hotel entrance.  Hotel DO is a boutique hotel and offers impeccable service.  Our rooms were ready and our luggage was brought up to our room.  The staff member showed us our room and how to operate everything.  He pointed out that the mini fridge containing a selection of beverages was included in our rate.  Our rate included a welcome bottle of wine and a  selection of tapas served in the outdoor restaurant on the square.  That is such a wonderful touch.   We requested a pitcher of sangria for each couple instead of wine.  The request was happily fulfilled and the sangria was light and wonderful and the tapas were excellent,   The rooms were spacious with very tall ceilings, small balconies with shutters, very comfortable beds, monogrammed towels and a fantastic shower.  A small plate of snacks was left in our room at the turn down service.  That evening we were able to order a cocktail from the hotel bar and take it up to the rooftop terrace to  enjoy the view over the Placa Reial.  While the terrace bar was closed for the off season, it was still a perfect place to relax and talk about our trip.  The shutters on our balcony (I believe it was room # 23) kept out the sounds of the square and we were able to get a great nights sleep.  The made to order breakfast in the cellar restaurant was wonderful.  The staff had arranged for a taxi to take us to the airport as requested.  Hotel DO was the perfect choice for us due not only to its great location, wonderfully appointed rooms, thoughtful extras but most of all the great service provided by all the staff members.  We highly recommend Hotel DO!",5,2017,11,13
32,Very crowd location,"We have chosen hotel do, following trip advisor suggestion, we were expecting more of a boutique hotel and were disappointed to be on the main crowd square of Barcelona with people selling beer and more... around you. The hotel itself its a bit old and we had few problem with the air conditioning. averall Average to be generous",3,2017,11,13
32,Old World Meets Modern Boutique Hotel,"This hotel was the perfect blend of old Spanish style construction and d√©cor and modernized amenities. The atmosphere of the lobby and rooms was spot on perfect. You really feel like you are in Europe, but you have a fully modernized (and beautiful!) bathroom, electrical outlets, Wi-Fi, cable TV, mini-fridge and safe. But you have old world shutters that look out onto the Plaza (Placa Reial) that is always buzzing. They were able to perfectly combine the shutters, a staple of European living, with double pane windows that block the sound, but are operable if you'd like to hear the spirit of the plaza. Their breakfast/dinner area in the plaza is fantastic, we had breakfast there each morning and dinner there the first night, and it was all wonderful. Being on the plaza is a great bonus. We didn't end up using their rooftop bar/pool area, we just ran out of time. But we did go up there really quick to check it out and it was a cool vibe. And the entire time, the service by staff was top notch. I would come back to this hotel over and over again.",5,2017,11,09
32,Wonderful! One Night was not Enough!,"We stayed one night at the DO Reial before our Med Cruise.  Here is a little about our experience. 
1- Location - Not far from the Port or Las Ramblas. Taxis are near by and very accessible.  You will have to walk to the square with your luggage  to enter the hotel.  Taxis are not able to provide door to door service.  Main entrance faces the Placa 
 Reial. Walk is not far, its worth it! Staff will help if you need it.
2- Checkin- Smooth, Welcoming, Friendly with a flute of Cava.  Need I say more!?
3- Room - LOVELY, High ceiling, Molton Brown toiletries, Shower is great bed is comfy. I wanted linger in the room, but I had to tour the beautiful city!! 
4- Breakfast - OMG!, Jamon, smoked salmon, coffee, espresso, chocolate croissants! 
They held our luggage so that we could explore Barcelona, returned for an easy pick up, we grabbed a taxi to the port. 
I would stay again!  The hotel is wonderful.",5,2017,10,30
32,Fantastic Place!!,"We spent 2 nights at the Hotel DO before our recent Mediterranean cruise and could not ask for anything better!  The room, amenities, location, wine and food were totally on point, but what made it very special was all the wonderful people who looked after us so very, very well - we felt like royalty!  A big thanks to Danny and Jean-Claude!  When we're back in Barcelona, this is where we'll stay without a second thought.",5,2017,10,30
32,Room with terrace facing placa,"It was really everything you can expect from a 5 star hotel.  The location is easy for walking the Rambla, the Gothic town, many restaurants and shopping.  Hotel services are prompt and your requests are not forgotten and taken care of as requested.  Our only issue is that since we faced the placa, late into the morning hours, and on Saturday until 6 am, there were men hanging out drinking all night long at the fountain. I don't understand why the police does not stop this practice.  I can't really blame the hotel, except they need to change to sound proof windows.  The 3 nights we stayed, we didn't get any sleep at all.  
The breakfast was good and you were able to selected anything on the menu.  Our last day, since we were checking out 8 am, we had breakfast in the room, which was nice.",4,2017,10,29
32,"""Just Wonerful""","This hotel has a brilliant location right in the centre, just off La Rambla and on the vibrant Placa Reial, could be a little noisy but as rooms have good double glazing we had no trouble sleeping, the fabulous bed also contributed!! Rooms are really well thought out very stylish and very comfortable. The hotel is immaculate and the staff are so friendly, helpful and attentive without being intrusive, add superb food and its well ""just wonderful"". 
This was our 4th visit to Barcelona and also my 50th birthday so decided to treat ourselves as this hotel is exactly as its says 'Boutique'...the staff  treated us to an unexpected birthday bottle of lovely Cava, cake and cards (my husbands birthday the week previous). 
If I have to look for a negative then it would have to be the hassle from people begging but as this is city wide the hotel can not be blamed, it is more a reflection on a wider social issue. The staff are watchful against the more aggressive persistent requests for money and do intervene. We will definitely be returning.",5,2017,10,29
32,Lovely gem in the heart of Barcelona,"I am a fanatic about doing research when I travel and I debated for weeks about where to stay in Barcelona with my husband for our anniversary trip.   I knew I didn't want a large chain hotel and I originally thought I didn't want to be in the Las Ramblas area of Barcelona as it sounded very touristy.  However after doing lots of research and looking at pictures, I found what proved to be the perfect hotel.  Although Hotel DO is right off of Las Ramblas, (which, while teaming with tourists, is also teeming with locals), it is a lovely boutique hotel with friendly and professional staff, (Alberto especially), and well-appointed and quiet rooms.  The hotel is connected to the Placa Reial, which is a large beautiful plaza with a large fountain, palm trees and lots of restaurants with outdoor seating.   I took the plunge and booked one of the two rooms on the top floor with a cute open air terrace and small pool, and it included a full a la carte breakfast (which we could have eaten in our room, on the plaza, in the full restaurant in the downstairs or on roof terrace each morning.  We loved eating breakfast on the plaza each morning, which would start with coffee, fresh orange juice and pastries before we even ordered our main dish.  The room stocked with everything we needed: a mini bar stocked with juices and water (no charge), fresh fruit or sweets that appeared every afternoon without asking and sweets that would show up at night while we were out exploring the city.  Not only did we love the hotel but the location couldn't be beat.  We were near multiple metro stations and either walked or took the metro to everything we wanted to see.   I hope to get back to Barcelona one day and I would absolutely stay in this hotel again!",5,2017,10,25
32,Barcelona Gem,"My wife and I stayed at Hotel Do for only a few days, but the experience was fantastic. The hotel is centrally located by La Rambla, which makes it an excellent location and convenient spot for getting around. The rooms were also beautiful, modern, and classic. In addition, the service at this hotel from the staff to the facilities was second to none. The staff found out that we were celebrating our 30th anniversary, and even surprised us with a bottle of cava and dessert at our door! We cannot say enough about this hotel. Without hesitation, we will be staying at this hotel again!",5,2017,10,24
32,Exceptional Service and Amenities,My sister and I stayed here for 2 nights following our cruise. Hotel is immaculate and in a great location for exploring Barcelona. The staff was very attentive and took extra time to help us with restaurant reservations and transportation. Bathrooms are very large and there was no noise from the outside despite being located in a busy area. We booked well in advance through the hotel website and were pleased with the communication from the hotel prior to our arrival.,5,2017,10,24
32,Couldn't be Better!!!,"Having never been to Barcelona, we wanted a hotel with a great location, but one with charm and without the trappings of larger ""full service"" hotels.  We could not have made a better choice.  From the moment we arrived, until we left six days later, we were well served by a professional staff who took great care of us.  Kudo's to Mark, Luis, Jean-Paul, Christine and all of the others who made the trip so special.  (Apologies for not remembering all the names.)  My wife and I both loved the incredible views from the room, the comfortable beds, the soundproof doors, great showers and great food.  Combine this with a genuinely great team of people and after six days our hotel became a beautiful home......one that we hated to leave.",5,2017,10,23
32,Hotel Do,"I can't say enough good things about this hotel. The food was wonderful,the location perfect and the staff simply marvellous. From Luis on reception to Marc who helped me to my room, they were fab. Which brings me to the room. Great facilities, wonderful bedding and great Molton Brown toiletries. I will go back and I would recommend this hotel to anyone!",5,2017,10,21
32,Good hotel,"Hotel in a very central location, small, only 15-20 rooms, we had a good stay, our room small but clean and good view in the central square. breakfast also good. the only issue we had a problem with the credit card upon check in that unfortunately was not resolved promptly",3,2017,10,20
32,Wonderful night,"My husband and I stayed for just one night after our cruise ended in Barcelona. We arrived very early and although our room was not yet ready Luis greeted us so warmly, checked us in, secured our bags, offered us tips on how to spend the day and reminded us that our welcome drink would be waiting for us! We had a wonderful morning touring Barcelona, came back to Hotel DO for tapas and wine and there still was cheerful Luis who brought us to our room (where our bags had already been delivered). Our room was extremely comfortable, the bathroom is exquisite and we had a lovely view of the square below. We ordered room service that evening and the food and wine was absolutely delicious.  The next morning Luis was back at his post, he secured a taxi for us and had breakfast packed and ready for us to take on the road! No detail was left unattended to, the staff, accommodations and food were stellar. We will spread the word that Hotel DO is THE place to stay in Barcelona. Thank you for everything!",5,2017,10,19
32,Can I give it 10 stars?,"What a classy hotel in the middle of all the action.  Stayed for one night (Sunday) and I couldn't say more about the staff, hotel and overall stay.  The room itself was HUGE and the bathroom was like none I have ever experienced (towel warmer, double sink, large soaking tub, and a HUGE shower with amazing water pressure).  The breakfast (included) was to die for and the ""welcome"" sangria drink was delicious.  My friend had a allergic reaction when staying at the hotel (food related) and the hotel has an MD on call to come to your room (nominal charge). Cannot say enjoy about this place.  Do not hesitate and stay here.",5,2017,10,13
32,Enjoyable stay!,"We stayed at this lovely boutique hotel for two nights prior to embarking on our Mediterranean cruise.  The room was well appointed, bed extremely comfortable, big spacious bathroom with Molton Brown toiletries! The breakfast was delicious and complimentary.  Hotel is so close to everything and within walking distance to Las Rambla, many interesting shops, restaurants and the hop on/hop off bus.  Staff 'bent over backwards' to accommodate us.  Looking forward to our final night stay at the end of our cruise before heading back to Toronto. ",5,2017,10,12
32,Wonderful experience ,"We stayed here for 2 nights, and have nothing but wonderful things to say. The location is perfect within the city, and the hotel amenities are hard to beat. Our room was modern and very nicely appointed, and we enjoyed the balcony. We highly recommend having breakfast on the roof! Beautiful, peaceful setting. We will definitely stay here again if we return to Barcelona!",5,2017,10,08
32,Best hotel staff and experience in all of Europe,"This hotel and the staff is amazing! The room are nicely appointed and a good size. They offer all non alcoholic drinks in the mini bar for free and refill them daily - which I really appreciated since our hotel in Madrid charged us 3.50 Euro for each bottle of water. They brought us a healthy fruit snack every afternoon ( a plate of apricots, then pears, then apples) and a sweet or savory snack each night - this was a very nice touch. The breakfast at the hotel was fantastic and coffee and cappuccinos and their watermelon and tomato gazpacho (cold) soup was so good I could have eaten it every day and I still crave it... this hotel helped make our trip to Barcelona even more special, fantastic and memorable!",5,2017,10,07
32,Nice Hotel,"We spent 3 nights at the hotel, and enjoyed our stay. The location is terrific, right off La Rambla at Pla√ßa Real. The staff is very friendly and accommodating. The room was small but well appointed, with a comfortable bed, and great bathroom with an awesome rainhead shower. The breakfast menu was varied and delicious, and the service was very good. The only small minor criticism is that the WIFI was very slow. But overall a great choice for your stay in Barcelona!",4,2017,10,07
32,Unfortunately Only Two Days at Hotel Do,"I hesitate to write this review because I do not want everyone to know about this hidden gem in the heart of Barcelona !  Arrived early off a cruise, room not ready, but I was seated on the patio to wait with a fresh brewed coffee in hand.  Then into my room by 10:30 - amazing.  Wonderful location, great breakfast provided, lovely dining patio with lovely views over the plaza.  But the really best thing is the amazing staff and caring service.  I will recommend to friends and return for sure for a longer stay.  Thank you again to the amazing staff who got me on my way to the airport at 4 a.m. with a breakfast bag !  So much more friendly and personal than  the big chain hotels.  Thank you again to everyone at Hotel Do, Placa Reial.",5,2017,10,06
32,Perfect .. Location and Service,"Arrived early in day to a modern hotel in a ancient building ,just off la Ramblas. Reception tried very hard to find us a early check in .. but not possible .. they did ring us about 1 hour later to say room was ready. So we were happy. A lovely Cafe/resturant fronts the Placa Reial. A great place to people watch . The room was amazing large bathrooms plenty of space and high ceilings . The interior design was exciting and wonderful .. could have just stayed in room .. But the call of Barcelona won..Definitely would highly recommend. Tip the Place gets noisy in early mornings when the clubs close and people spill into street .. Not a problem ,,very interesting to peek out window.",5,2017,10,04
32,Fantastic hotel with an excellent staff,"I will keep this short... 5-star hotel all the way; from the warm and caring staff, to the beautiful room, to the amazing food and location... Really can't say enough good things about this hotel in an incredibly vibrant city - We spent a week here and would easily stay here again!!",5,2017,10,02
32,Great stay,"Perfect location!! Awesome customer service.  I would highly recommend.  I‚Äôve never had 5 Star Service or attention at any chain hotel but from the start until the end this had been a great experience!  Firstly the location on the historic square and the Las rambles was a plus.  The front desk first sat us down and offered us free Spanish cava just because we were quest.  After about 30 minutes relaxing we were walked up to our room and explained everything and informed me that the mini bar was free, never heard that from any hotel.  The kind gentleman after walking us through made suggestions and made a reservation for us at Man√° and wrote down the directions for a taxi.  Overall the service the food and everything was top notch.  The balcony view of the square was a plus.  The only negative was that bed which was twins beds put together by pretty firm but that won‚Äôt spoil my stay here.  Overall I would stay here again ",5,2017,09,30
32,Best Hotel we Stayed at in Spain,"We stayed at 3 hotels across Spain on our trip and this hotel was the best!
* Friendliest staff
* Best food/breakfast
* Best view from our room
* Best welcome drink
* Best included room amenities
** No extra fees on mini bar/fridge
** Plenty of toiletries (some hotels we stayed in didn't even have facial tissue)
** Lots of storage room in the main room and the bathroom
* Most comfortable bed
The item that is keeping me from giving a 5-star review is the noise in the morning. About 9/10am all of the restaurants in the plaza receive their deliveries for the day so you hear A LOT of noise. The windows and shutters do a decent job of keeping the noise to a minimum in the room, but going down for breakfast wasn't too pleasant.",4,2017,09,29
32,The place to stay üëç,"We stayed here for 4 nights & can't recommend it highly enough. The service is impeccable, the rooms and dining are perfect and it's location is spot on. Do yourself a favor if in Barcelona stay here!",5,2017,09,29
32,Nothing to fault at all! Highly recommended!,"We stayed here for 2 nights and had a wonderful stay. The service was impeccable throughout our stay and the staff spoke perfect English! Aslan in particular was very attentive to our needs and very friendly. He even arranged a surprise cake for us in the room to wish us a happy honeymoon! Another lovely touch was the yummy pastries and fruits everyday during turndown service. The room included free mini bar fruit juices and soft drinks, free breakfast (which was the best we had in Barcelona!), free welcome drinks and free welcome tapas! The tapas at the restaurant was delicious. The room was relatively spacious and very nicely decorated, modern and elegant. Wooden floors, large 2 person basin, Molton Brown toiletries, comfortable bathrobes and a strong rain shower all added to the great hotel stay. The view from our room was an unobstructed view of Plaza Reial and it was great seeing the activities and people watching! Absolutely nothing to fault and one of the best hotels in Barcelona definitely!",5,2017,09,24
32,"Excellent, the highlight of our entire trip to Europe; a small hotel in size, but enormous in quality of services.","We were in Superior Double Room number 24. Cozy, Elegant, Comfortable, Clean and with very modern  amenities. Two balconies overlooking the Plaza Real, which is full of beauty and life. Noise protection windows which worked 100%.

Loved this HOTEL>  Breakfast A La Carte, is amazing. Mini bar included, free of charge,  without liquor, but with plenty of good things to drink.

Will love to have the privilege to go back. LOVED IT.",5,2017,09,23
32,Wonderful hotel,"We really enjoyed our stay at Hotel DO. Our room over looking the Placa was very nice and a good size. What really distinguished the service. Concierge made excellent suggestions. Front desk and bell staff also excellent. 
Recommend highly ",5,2017,09,23
32,Welcome Drinks & Tapas,This is our 3rd trip to Barcelona and as we have done on each occasion on arrival we headed for Plaza Real for welcome drinks and Tapas. Whilst the staff maybe different each time the service and food remains the same...very good. My wife reckons they make the best Sangria anywhere in Spain.....who am I to argue. Great location to watch the world go by I many interesting sights. Thoroughly recommend.,5,2017,09,20
32,One night in Barcelona ,"We arrived by taxi on a Saturday night at this lovely boutique hotel in downtown Barcelona.  We were immediately checked in by two young gentlemen.  One insisted on taking us to the room and showing us our amenities.  Free mini bar soft drinks,free breakfast, free welcoming beverages, free wi-if.  Someone delivered four fresh figs to our room and later 3 tiny pastries for bedtime.
The room is nicely decorated, modern and elegant.  Wood floors, large 2 person basin, delicious toiletries, bathrobes and the best of all was a magnificent rain shower.  The shower has shampoo, conditioner and two kinds of high end  body washes from London.  Smells great!
We had a Cava and beer sitting on the square watching everyone enjoy the night.
In the morning we had a delicious breakfast with a pastry basket, fresh pressed orange juice and cappuccinos.  My husband had a Spanish omelette and I had a crepe with ham and cheese.  Everything including all services were first class.
The only draw back was the noise level from the street on a Saturday night.  There was never ending chatter from the people in the square.
Might have been because it was a Saturday night.",5,2017,09,17
32,Very charming boutique hotel!,"We had just come from the Hotel Alfonso in Seville, which is pretty hard for any hotel to top, but Hotel DO really tried. This hotel is very well decorated, and charming. A great choice for Barcelona! 

The staff was exceptionally professional. They offered us a welcome drink, and we got an additional bottle of wine and tapas sample for booking directly with the hotel. The two gentlemen that manned the front-desk were very helpful and remembered us each time we saw them. A huge selling point for this hotel was the charming staff. 

Our room was well decorated but small, however, we had a personal terrace with a pool, which increased our room size a lot. Without the terrace, the room size would have been way too small for the price, but we were happy with the terrace. The private terrace was amazing because we smoke, so it was wonderful not to have to go down to the lobby to exit for smoke, especially later at night. The pool was very clean and well maintained. Unfortunately, when we were there it was raining a lot, and a bit cooler. We didn't get as much use out of the pool as we would have liked. If you plan a trip for July/August though, that pool would be godsend because it does get very hot in the city during the day walking around. Also the mini-bar was free, which was a nice bonus, and they leave little samples of desserts each night when they turn down the beds. 

The real selling feature of this hotel is the location. We were right in Placa Reial, a beautiful open square with a fountain that leads into the gothic area with tiny old 'walking only' streets in each direction. On the other side, the hotel is right off of La Rambla, a major touristy walking street. The square has tons of restaurants along the perimeter (including Hotel DO's restaurant) and buskers/street performers come and go through out the day putting on impromptu shows. The square was always filled with people, and you could easily spend the day drinking and eating while people watching. It was a great starting point for walking around the city. We stayed at another hotel after this one, and we really missed the area. We ended up coming back to the Placa Reial our last night just because we missed the atmosphere of the square. 

Hotel DO's restaurant was quite good. We ate a couple meals there and found the food to be some of the best we had while in Barcelona.  

The only negative thing I can say about our stay, was that we were under the impression (perhaps mistakenly) that our terrace was private. When we first arrived, we thought we were on the top floor, so nothing above us and it has quite high walls around it. At one point I was sunbathing and looked up to find several people staring down at me from a higher point on the roof. I was quite shocked and realized that there must be a way to get to a higher vantage point through the public pool area on the roof, and it would be have been polite for the staff to let us know that the terrace is not actually private, and you could be seen by other guests. Luckily it wasn't the end of the world as I was wearing my suit, but I can imagine that many people might want to know that, and it should be stated by the staff upon arrival to avoid unpleasant situations.",5,2017,09,11
32,Such a great boutique hotel! ," My wife and I had the pleasure to stay here on our honeymoon. The room upstairs on the fourth floor was one of the best rooms we have ever stayed in anywhere. We had our own private pool in downtown Barcelona with views of the city. The staff was so nice and welcoming. The restaurant was great too and you have the option of eating outside in the square or upstairs on the roof. They have a great wine list too. Be sure to check out their wine cellar downstairs. Thank you staff for making our last night in Barcelona such a memorable one. We can't wait to return! ",5,2017,09,10
32,Wonderful hotel!,"We stayed at Hotel DO for three nights and it was wonderful in every way.   A delicious breakfast is included - not a stale buffet but made to order off a wonderful menu - and served at tables on the square, under the shade of the umbrellas.  Our room was large and airy, the bed was comfortable, and turn-down service was provided each night, complete with a sweet snack.  Everything is scrupulously clean and the service was top-notch.  This hotel is a treasure.",5,2017,09,03
32,Very nice boutique hotel located just off La Rambla,"Our rooms were very nice, modern with good amenities, comfortable beds, & good wi-fi.  The window in the rooms are soundproofed, but close the bathroom door as the windows in the bathrooms are not soundproofed. The plaza outside is busy every minute of the day/night. La Rambla is about 10 feet away - it is a very busy touristy boulevard - very cheesy, very Times Square-ish. I wish this hotel was in a different location. The rooftop pool is small but decent. The hotel has a restaurant which is what you notice when you 1st enter. The ""lobby"" is a small area that could use some sprucing up. Breakfast (included in the room rate) was very good, as was the dinner we had on the rooftop. This is a family owned boutique hotel. Fresh fruit was sent up to the room every late afternoon. The owners of the hotel were very kind to us during our stay & provided very good services.",4,2017,09,01
32,Terrific Experience ,"This hotel is located in a central location which on its own is worth it and is surpassed only by the service provided in every detail.  Stayed there for three nights and each was made memorable.  Top marks to the whole package for this hotel, location and service. ",5,2017,08,29
32,Position Perfect,"We stayed in Hotel DO for 3 nights, located in Placa Reial one of the prettiest squares in Barcelona. This also attracts many people at all hours of the night. Our room overlooked the Placa with 2 balconies. The room was a good size for Europe, well appointed with all that you would require, clean and comfortable plus complimentary soft drinks and water replenished daily for your use. If you are a light sleeper you might wish for a room not overlooking the Placa due to noise. We found it fine.This family owned hotel was excellent and very well maintained plus positioned perfect for all surrounding tourists sites. Gothic city very close plus the busy Las Ramblas just a few meters away. Breakfast was also very nice with lots to choose from in the menu. highly recommend this hotel it's well worth it.",5,2017,08,19
32,Very nice small hotel,"Very nice, clean, well located hotel. Beautiful rooms. Centrally located on a historic and busy  square within walking distance to most attractions. Helpful and polite staff. Excellent breakfast with wonderful coffee and fresh fruit.",5,2017,08,16
32,Exceptional Hotel! Do not hesitate to book,"I travel a lot and barely ever take the time to post a review, even at many great hotels. I am at Hotel DO right now and am impressed to the point that I have to post. This boutique hotel is in a perfect location, I have a junior suite (21) that has two balconies one over looking a bustling square filled with vendors, restaurants and people and just outside your door is an amazing street with shops and vendors till late night.

Truly exceptional 5 star boutique gem hotel.  If it's available book it. Junior suite worth the price too...",5,2017,08,14
32,Great Hotel.  Great Staff.  Great Experience!,"I arrived at this small boutique hotel in the Placa Reial and was immediately felt pampered... before I was even able to check into my room (since I arrived at 9am and check-in wasn't until 2pm) the wonderful staff immediately began taking care of me.

I was offered a welcome drink - a beautifully prepared coffee... and when I asked whether I could purchase a pastry from their restaurant, they immediately brought my wife and I croissants FREE OF CHARGE as well.

The room was beautiful, with a perfect Juliette balcony overlooking the Placa.  The bathroom was divine - with the best shower I've ever experienced in a hotel ever.  What a great shower and shower pressure!

Then, when it was time to leave... they offered to pack my wife a take-away breakfast.  Again, I assumed I'd be charged for this lovely breakfast (coffee, 2 croissants, 6 small pastries, 2 ham and cheese sandwiches, and two apples)... but again, NO CHARGE!

Also, a fully stocked FREE mini-bar, to boot.

So, beautiful room.  Beautiful service.  Wonderful people.  And the cutest little roof-top pool!

I didn't have time to try the restaurant... but I definitely will do it next time I'm back!",5,2017,08,07
32,Great service; beautiful hotel,"This was our third trip to Barcelona, but our first visit to the Hotel DO - it won't be our last.  From the moment we checked in, the staff were wonderful.  The hotel, as others have mentioned, is in a great location - near the subway, Bario Gotica, La Boqueria, etc.  The room was great - best shower of our two week vacation in Europe!  Contrary to what others have said, we had a room looking directly on the Placa Reial, and had no issue with noise.  The restaurant is very good - we had dinner there one night, and breakfast every morning.  Usually I try to provide some suggestions to hotels, even the ones where I give 5 stars - but for the Hotel DO - no suggestions...just keep doing what you are doing.  I would recommend the hotel without any hesitation.",5,2017,08,06
32,great hotel with high hospitality !,"great experience - top !  people were great - top location - service  was  very good - good breakfast 
it was  very nice  to receive in advance  an e mail with information about the  strike taxi  drivers  so the hotel give  us  an alternative - thx for  that !",5,2017,08,05
32,Great Location,"The Hotel is in a great location  , we could see the Palau Guel from the room. Breakfast is special and sets a high standard for the food. A wide choice and it is all inclusive....covers lunch as well. Just have Tapas for the rest.",5,2017,08,04
32,Great Hotel,"We had the best service all around from check in to check out.  Room view, Location, and service was the best.  Very good restaurants close to the hotel.  Thanks again for making this a great vacation.  My grandson loved the mini fridge because everything in the mini fridge were included in the price, it was nice to have a cold Coke at the end of long day walking.  ",5,2017,07,31
32,Service AAA++++,"My husband and I spent our last four nights in Barcelona at this excellent hotel. We could not have been any happier with our beautiful room and the service provided by Mayre and the rest of the Hotel DO staff.  We've stayed at five-star hotels all over the world, and the level of service provided by the Hotel DO: Plaƒáa Reial exceeds almost all.  

If one is a light sleeper or prefers peace and quiet, it is imperative to have ear plugs and perhaps even noise-canceling headphones. The first night I went to bed without using these, and I was awake at 4 a.m. scouting around the room to equip myself so that I could go back to sleep.  People party on the Pla√ßa Reial all night long! It is kind of strange that such a refined hotel would be on a plaza that is so much like the Latin Quarter in Paris, but there you have it. So go equipped, and you'll be okay. Once I used BOTH ear plugs, AND my Bose headphones, AND took a melatonin, I was fine -- but it truly required all three of these things to be able to get sleep.

That said, the hotel provides so many lovely touches, such as complimentary tapas and wine (really, dinner!) the first night, fresh fruit every afternoon, delicious breakfast every morning, Nespresso in the room, complimentary drinks in the refrigerator -- these really do compensate for the crazy Plaƒáa Reial -- and the location could not be more convenient for getting around Barcelona. In addition, the staff went the second and third and maybe even fourth mile getting our purchases shipped back to the U.S. to us. They even offered to have someone traveling to the U.S. bring us some souvenirs that couldn't be mailed overseas due to shipping restrictions. 

Our room was light, airy, restful, and beautiful. I would stay there again.",5,2017,07,31
32,Gorgeous Hotel Room in the heart of Gothic,"High ceilings, spacious room, excellent quality finishes, fabulous staff.   Hotel DO is situated in the bustling Placa Reial where musicians, performers and restaurants abound.   Overlooking the action, but without the noise from below, our room was a tranquil oasis in this fabulous city.   Very clean (a little short on wardrobe space) and contemporary, we loved the wooden floors and furniture. Breakfast was superb and the roof top pool, while small was adequate.  The wireless internet was excellent.   A shout out to Albert for his friendly nature and obliging service.   Highly recommended.",5,2017,07,30
32,Vem50,"Beautiful food- and a lot less expensive than we thought it would be, even though I was jibbed for finding the most pricey place on the block- definitely will be back. Cold cannelloni a treat and best chocolate cake I can remember.The street acrobats were cool also.",5,2017,07,30
32,One of the best hotels ever stayed at,"Although I love to read reviews, I have to be honest that i hardly ever write one.  And if I do, it is usually because I had a bad experience and want to warn people.  That being said, I had such a positive experience at this hotel that I felt compelled to write a review.  I typically stay at 4 - 5 star hotels and this is honestly one of the best hotels I have ever stayed at.  Mostly due to the service.  The rooms are very nice, but not over the top.  They are spacious and it is a boutique hotel, so take that into account.  The location of the hotel is perfect.  I can't imagine a better place to be in Barcelona, unless you want an ocean view (but we live near the beach so we did not need that).  The hotel is right in the center of the beautiful gothic part of town, next to La Rambla, and in a beautiful traditional square with lots of cafes and shops.  My wife and I sat out and read on the square for an hour each day because it was so nice.  The staff take such good care of you and they don't try to nickle and dime you.  A huge, tasty breakfast is included and drinks in the room are included.  Very nice perks.  There are only 18 rooms in the hotel and they treat you like you are staying in their home.  I can't say enough great things.  Highly highly recommend.",5,2017,07,30
32,Gem Right in the Heart of Everything,"Beautiful room overlooking the Placa, Food was excellent there and they went out of their way to find us other restaurants nearby that we could eat in as we are both lactose intolerant. Would stay there again.",5,2017,07,29
32,A fantastic boutique hotel.,"This was our fourth stay at The Hotel Do and it is still a fantastic place to stay in Barcelona.  The staff are very friendly and helpful and the hotel is well situated for all the sights in the city.  The breakfast is great and the afternoon fruit and evening chocolates are nice touches.  There is also a free mini bar of soft drinks, another nice extra.  We'd definitely recommend this hotel to friends and stay here again if we visit Barcelona.  Many thanks to all the staff for another memorable stay.",4,2017,07,25
32,Perfection!,"This place is perfect location, Placa Reial is great atmosphere. It is 5* service! Staff were wonderful, and all the added extras such as welcome drink, bottle of wine and tapas was great. Highly recommended!!!",5,2017,07,25
32,Restaurant is superb,"We came for dinner here in the Pla√ßa Reial for what was by a mile the best meal we've had during our holiday. The steak was wonderful, and the area provided a great atmosphere. All came for a bit of a price, but nothing too much more than we paid elsewhere in Barcelona. We would highly recommend a visit. ",5,2017,07,21
32,Barcelona Beauty,"One of the highlights of our stay in Barcelona was the Beautiful Hotel DO..  it was in the perfect location for our sightseeing.  The staff was warm and friendly, helping us locate a tour for the same day that we arrived.  The included full breakfast was absolutely delicious and really made the price seem even more of a great value.  Our room was clean, modern and comfortable.  Every detail was excellent and we will most certainly return if we ever have the chance to visit Barcelona again.",5,2017,07,17
32,WHAT IS THE FUSS ALL ABOUT?,"A quirky little hotel, small rooms, tiny lift, average service, pleasant breakfast with good coffee. I booked on the strength of the opinions I read of the hotel on tripadvisor. Alas, I could not find the reason for such raving reviews! A just above average hotel, not the 5 star establishment I was expecting.",3,2017,07,17
32,Beautiful hotel in beautiful city!,"This hotel is well located,  beautifully and tastefully  renovated , with great big bathroom and storage space in the room , comfortable bed, and the beautiful floor!!. Although the hotel is located in a noisy area double glazed  windows worked very well, and the staff were always eager to help!  They even packed a breakfast for our early flight out of Barcelona!  Love to go back soon, love from Sydney Australia!",5,2017,07,15
32,Understated Elegance,"One of the features that mark a good hotel is how seamlessly it operates. The Hotel Do meets this criterion in spades, with the courteous and attentive staff all singing from the same hymn sheet to provide excellent customer service. The hotel is elegance personified, with superbly spacious and comfortable rooms and an excellent kitchen which serves imaginative and fresh food in a variety of settings from rooftop evening dining to all-day al fresco dining facing onto the pedestrianised Placa Reial. My partner, Jen, and I stayed there in June this year as part of her 80th birthday celebration. It was expensive for our pockets, but it proved worth it - a special place to mark a special occasion.",5,2017,07,14
32,Fabulous hotel,"We had a fabulous experience at this hotel.  From the fantastic breakfasts in the morning, the wonderful staff and the really nice rooms. It was perfect.  We stayed in a room overlooking the plaza and had no problem whatsoever with noise at night.
Location is perfect, we walked everywhere.  Can not say one bad thing about this hotel.  Enjoyable.",5,2017,07,14
32,Elegant hotel,"Loved this boutique hotel. Stayed two nights in a room overlooking the placa. So much fun to people watch from your private terrace. A bit noisy but that's part of the experience. The restaurant has great food and great service. The concierge was very attentive, loaned us a converter for our phones. Booked us at a superb flamenco club just one minute away (highly recommend, you will not be disappointed, opt for drink and show only, eat dinner elsewhere). Will definitely return one day. Many thanks to all the staff for their hard work and being so friendly.",5,2017,07,14
32,Splendid hotel with superb staff!,"We recently stayed for a week in a very spacious and beautifully decorated Junior Suite, overlooking the Placa Reial. This is a historic building, sensitively renovated into a Boutique Gourmet Hotel. It is owned by one family who own no other hotels. Therefore, the staff's attention to its guests to ensure their every comfort is excellent. There is a wonderful feeling of camaraderie throughout. It begins at the Front Desk with check-in, right through to thrice daily Housekeeping. The restaurant staff were terrific, remembering who we were from day one, including our quirky food preferences at breakfast. The food was superb with an accompanying comprehensive wine list.  It was a delight to sit outside for meals, watching the activity on the Placa. We appreciated that breakfast was available on the Terrace from 9 - 11 am, altho one could have eaten inside from 7am. We also had room service breakfast on our last morning. It was as good as going down to the restaurant so full marks there as well. The location was perfect, and a cab rank just outside on the Ramblas. Within easy walking distance of most everything, from the port up through to La Pedrera etc. Staff were wonderfully helpful recommending and making reservations for us to dine in the evenings, altho we did have dinner twice at the hotel and it could not be faulted. The garlic anchovies and beef carpaccio were magnificent!",5,2017,07,13
32,Great Location.  Five Star Rooms,"We stayed at the Hotel Do for two nights last week.  The location is great for people watching and shopping.  The rooms were first-class, and the staff was extremely helpful and knowledgeable about the local area.  We have no complaints at all, except for one that may not be the hotel's fault:  Every morning and night when we left and returned to the hotel, we were greeted by a painted swastika on a post outside the hotel.",4,2017,07,12
32,Fantastic hotel with great food and customer service,Felt very welcome and cared for. The food was excellent and staff extremely attentive. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who really wants to spoil themselves. The best place to enjoy Barclona and Placa Reial.,5,2017,07,11
32,Hotel DO Stay Here,"Charming hotel in the center of all the action. Having stayed earlier in the week at the Mandarin Oriental, this was a welcoming homey place. From the great front desk staff, well appointed rooms and excellent food. This hotel will not disappoint. ",5,2017,07,08
32,Just Wonderful,"We loved everything about this hotel. The location, the rooms. The service was terrific. They were pleasant and helped us with all of our requests and made great suggestions for dinner, etc. Loved the free minibar and that we could order whatever we wanted for breakfast in the inclusive price. Would definitely stay here again.",5,2017,07,06
32,Great Stay!,"We stayed here two nights in a room overlooking the Placa.  It is a wonderful hotel.  The room was large by Europe standards.  The bathroom was very well appointed with good toiletries.  The bed was very comfortable in our room.  After reading reviews about the noise from the Placa, I was concerned.  But this was not a problem at all.  I always travel with earplugs, but could barely hear any noise even without them.  The staff closes the shutters, windows, and heavy drapes every night with your turn down service.  It sufficiently blocked the sound.  We had breakfast delivered both mornings to our room.  It was great and more than we could eat.  The hotel's tapas restaurant was also very good.  The hotel is very conveniently located.  We were able to walk to everything or use the hop on hop off bus to get around.  Highly recommend this hotel!",5,2017,06,30
32,Wonderful !!!! Slept like babies!,"My Husband and I came here for 5 days Wed-Sun for a very special celebration. 
We had been in contact after we had booked to see if there was anything that they could help us with, which we asked them for a view over the square, they said that they would try and they delivered! On arrival the front of house team were so very friendly and offered us a welcome drink. Much appreciated after our journey. 
Nothing was too much trouble here, the rooms are wonderful and airy. We opted to stay overlooking the square so we could fling open the doors and enjoy the life. 
Don‚Äôt be put off of staying on a lower floor as the double glazing is great and teamed with the beds (which are HUGE) we slept like babies. 
Everything is spotless and extremely comfortable.
Our breakfast each time was beautiful and ample.
Don‚Äôt forget to try the restaurant on the roof either, the tapas are to die for! Not to mention the Paella.
If there was anything we needed it was there. Mini soft drinks fridge in the room has lots of choice and if you need more just ring down.
Staff were professional and friendly, just a really lovely atmosphere.
Can‚Äôt wait to go back!
We would both like to say thank you to ALL the staff, we had such a wonderful time!",5,2017,06,28
32,Very Nice Hotel,"We just returned from Barcelona and stayed at Hotel Ho, on Place Reial. It is very nice and is located on the Placa. The Placa can be a bit noisy at night. Our room overlooked the Placa. The location is great as it is on the edge of the old quarter. You can walk all over from this location. 
The people are very helpful at the front desk. We used them many times for assistance and they were very nice and courteous. They genuinely liked to help you.
The complimentary breakfast was terrific. The menu items were many and you could choose any of them. You can sit out on the terasse after 9am, which is on the Placa.
They had complimentary water in the frig every day.
They had fresh fruit every afternoon in the room.
Every evening there was a little desert candy or cakey type of thing in the room. Nice touches for a very pleasant stay.
We were there when they had the St. John Festival, so the Placa was very noisy during the night. Fireworks were going off all the time.
It is a very clean hotel and would rate it highly.",5,2017,06,26
32,Fantastic staff,"I stayed for 5 nights while in Barcelona for a conference and I am very glad I chose this hotel.  The room was beautiful with a high ceiling and a view over the Placa Reial.  The bathroom was lovely with nice bath products. The breakfast was fantastic each day and there is no extra charge if you have it in your room.  The best aspect of the hotel, however, is the staff. Everyone was very helpful and friendly.  A special thank you to Luiz who arranged a taxi to get me to a meeting and then to wait for me to take me to the next meeting. As most of the taxi drivers do not speak English he made sure that the driver understood what was required.  

The one potential downside to the hotel would be for people who are sensitive to noise. I arrived on a Saturday night and I can confirm that they do indeed party all night long in Barcelona.  I could hear noise from the Placa below all night and the last of the revellers didn't leave until the stall holders came to set up their stalls at about 7am the next morning. Having said that, I would still return and stay again.  It is a fabulous hotel.",5,2017,06,24
32,A delightful experience,"My wife and I Stayed at the Do for one night towards the end of May. We would happily have stayed longer had this been possible. The reception staff were very helpful, the bed was one of the most comfortable we have ever slept in and the bathroom was excellent. We had a very good breakfast on the terrace overlooking the Square. The location is central. 
We have no hesitation in recommending Hotel Do to anyone looking for a boutique hotel in Barcelona",5,2017,06,21
32,Wonderful stay at Hotel Do,"What a gem of a hotel, close to everything, stayed here for 4 nights. Extremely friendly and helpful staff especially Adrianna at breakfast. Spacious room with complimentary cold drinks and fruit every day plus a surprise treat each evening, such a lovely comfortable place to stay, can be a tad noisy at night due to being So close to placa reial placa and La Rambla but not too bad and is all part of being close to the action. Lovely roof top pool and bar to cool off after sightseeing",4,2017,06,15
32,Great hotel,"We stayed here for 5 nights. First time to Barcelona, and we found the hotel and service were great. Very comfortable and modern rooms, and the breakfast was amazing. Noise was fine if you shut the doors, not a problem. Would definitely stay again!",5,2017,06,14
32,Outstanding Hotel in Barcelona,"Our first visit to Barcelona.  We stayed over 3 nights following a cruise.  I wanted a hotel that was close to the port, close to the historic area, and safe.  Hotel Do was a perfect choice.  

We walked from the cruise terminal, maybe 15 minutes with big roller suitcases.  An easy shaded walk.  The location was excellent and easy to find. Literally steps off of La Ramblas and facing a big square (Placa Reial). The square was surrounded with higher end, tourist focused cafes.   Crossing the square led to the Latin Quarter, returning to La Ramblas provided easy taxi access and plenty of activity.  Less touristy local restaurants were a short walk away.

The Hotel itself was excellent.  Small building, big room, elevator, fantastic breakfast, clean, modern with good wifi.  We received complementary tapas, drinks, and a bottle of wine.  The staff was exceptional.  They welcomed us with big smiles every time we returned after a day of sightseeing and answered every silly tourist question I could dream up.  

While we enjoyed the sights of Barcelona, Sagrada Familia( a must), Park Guell, Picasso Museum, Montjuic, The Beach, the city remains just that...  a big city with the crowds, the hustlers and scams ever present.  When in the city, I always felt defensive and on guard based on stories and actual attempts to get our money.  I can't thank the staff of Hotel Do enough for providing us a wonderful sanctuary in the midst of the chaos.

If you can afford this hotel, don't hesitate, you will not regret it.",5,2017,06,12
32,Fantastic again,"We are lucky enough to have room 47 again. I loved this place so much in 2015, I booked this room as soon as I could. Large bedroom, great bed and linens and wonderful toiletries. It is the staff who make it-helpful and they each go out of their way to make you feel welcome. I suppose the adjoining Placa could annoy some but we don't hear it. Our room has a private pool and deck. Breakfast is terrific as is the location. If I can travel in the future I'll be back. Nothing bad to say. Housekeeping is excellent on the whole. Highly recommended.",5,2017,06,11
32,Very nice ,"We spent the last 3 days of our vacation in Barcelona. We had never been there before and Hotel Do got good reviews so decided to stay there. It is located on the Placa Reial which is a very busy tourist spot off the La Rambla. The staff at the hotel were very accommodating and the mini frig was stocked full of free refreshments. The room was very large and clean. It over looked the plaza. Every once in a while you can hear the noise from the plaza but it's not bad. The hotel even put together a to go basket with coffee and a small breakfast when we had to leave early for the airport. The only negative thing was when you sit outside at the restaurant on the plaza , the homeless people are constantly coming up to your table begging for money. ",5,2017,06,07
32,Loved it!,"My partner and I stayed here. The staff made us feel welcomed and appreciated. The room was swell with a mini fridge, excellent bathroom with molten brown products, yummy breakfasts included, great location, nice roof top area. There are stores, shops, and all kinds of restaurants close by. The only things I didn't like as much was the bed--it was two singles pushed together. That said I slept fine. The roof top pool is really just for your feet and hanging out. I would stay here again if I ever go back to Barcelona.",5,2017,06,03
32,Last day,"We were a week in Barcelona and decided to spend some extra luxury on ourselves the last day-we checked in at hotel DO.
It was fantastic!
Best breakfast in my life. Nicest hotel room in my life.
Don't order drinks to the very nice roof top pool- they are also nice but too expensive .
If you want a high quality hotel experience - go here...its just soo nice!
",5,2017,05,31
32,Just Perfect,"We absolutely loved the Hotel DO. From the moment we arrived until our 4 am checkout we were blown away by this small but wondeful hotel. The Hotel Do is an oasis in a beautiful but busy city.We had a lovely arrival cocktail on the house while taking in the sights of the square. We loved to walk through the door and each time get greeted by name. This gem is right  on the Placa Reial  off of the busy La Rambla. If you have enough of the square, go up to your room for a bit, swing open the french doors and stand on your balcony and observe from afar. Nothing like it! We were even serenaded by a violinist from the balcony!
Each member of the staff we encountered went out of their way for us. They all seem to love their job.  We felt so comfortable and at home. We ran into two of the staff members in a nearby shopping square and we were greeted by name and had a nice chat, like meeting a friend on the corner! 
 We appreciated all of the small touches. Complimentary breakfast started  with a plate of croissants, and fresh baked goods along with coffee and delicious fresh squeezed OJ.  Then you get to order anything off the menu. Everything is cooked to order.
Our room faced the Place Reial which is very lively late into the night. However once we closed the windows and shutters we heard hardly a thing. Double glazed windows eliminate all  noise. The room was beautiful. The bed is incredibly comfortable and the sheets excellent. The bathroom was wonderful and the shower large with good water pressure. 
Fresh fruit was left each day. Also upon returning each night, little chocolates or treat were waiting. They were s appreciated. In addition the mini bar of juices, water and soda is complimentary. Also greatly appreciated.  Small details which make your stay memorable and special. 
The rooftop pool is wonderful after a long day. It is tiny, but so welcoming and refreshing. We usually were the only ones on the rooftop. They do have dinner and bar service there in the evening. Also, the spa was another tiny but perfect gem. We used the sauna and shower before heading out for an evening of exploring Barca! There were refreshments, robes and a stockpile of towels. It seems as though they only let one party use it at a time as the lobby keeps the key. So private and relaxing!
We had an early-4am taxi pick up to the airport. We were greeted with a to go bag of fruit, pastries, water and juice. The had also made us hot toasted ham and cheese sandwiches to go. How much more personal can that get? I hope to return to the Hotel Do!",5,2017,05,30
32,"Great location, cleaning rooms needs improvement, good breakfast less service","Great location,
Nice rooms
Cleaning must be improve. We stay 5 days, and only after 3 days my wife was needed to complain in order to change the sheets.   
The hotel restaurant operate as public restaurant in Placa Real,
We was served as all other tourist that set for breakfast and it was bad.
For 5 stars hotel and 400 euro a night, I was expected much better service, and better room cleanliness",4,2017,05,30
32,"Charming, elegant and stylish","The Hotel Do is well positioned on the Placa Reial, just off La Rambla , close to much of  what  Barcelona has to offer. 

The building has been recently renovated and offers elegant, stylish accommodation with, I think just 18 rooms. We booked a standard double room which was very spacious and comfortable with excellent decor, silent efficient air conditioning and high ceilings. Also, the bathroom was spacious and well appointed. 

The staff were always very helpful and friendly from the warm welcome to departure when they came on to La Rambla to make sure we got a taxi in the right direction. 

We ate in the hotels tapas restaurant each evening. This is on a terrace by Placa Reial, serves excellent, filling tapas and is great for people watching. 

Overall, a great place to stay in Barcelona offering a welcoming, personal experience. We will definitely stay here again when we return to Barcelona.",5,2017,05,26
32,Most memorable hotel,"There are not enough superlatives to describe this hotel. It has a fabulous location, great rooms, spacious and modern bathrooms and so many nice amenities; a la carte breakfast,daily fruit and a lovely wine and tapas. I
The best feature of all is the friendly and accommodating service. The front desk straightened out a nightmare error with our air reservations which we would never been able to do without their help. The entire staff is extremely personable.",5,2017,05,24
32,Why a way to commence my Spanish sojourn,"My first time in Barcelona. Hands down, the best hotel I have experienced anywhere in the world. Just my style, small, luxurious, personable,  exquisite comfort, design and detail - service second to none !!! Location perfect, the artwork in the rooms divine, the comfort of the bed and pillows out of this world felt like I was sleeping on a heavenly cloud, the quality of the bed linen, towels, bathroom toiletries 5 star. The thoughtfulness of having one's own bar fridge filled with beverages, afternoon fruit and delectable post supper treats delivered daily to one's room...and what a way to start your day with breakfast served in the beautiful Placa Reial. I simply cannot wait to return to this enticing boutique hotel. A heartfelt thank you to all of the staff who made my stay such a memorable one in organising tickets to a fabulous love jazz venue nearby, recommendations to restaurants,'organising transport and generally making me feel so welcomed and looked after. Love Barcelona...love Hotel DO even more.",5,2017,05,23
32,Stunning! A must book,"My friend and I stayed here Sunday night and it was perfect. Real luxury and outstanding service from every staff member that we encountered. Welcome drinks and tapas on the terrace to start our stay and then a complimentary bottle of cava on the roof terrace at sunset where we also had dinner and the food was wonderful, reasonably priced and very tasty. Breakfast was lovely (included in my room cost). The room was beautiful (we had a twin standard) and the bathroom was really luxurious. The only set back was the twin beds were a little narrow. Everything else perfect. Location was also fantastic. I will most definitely be coming back to Hotel Do with my husband as it was very romantic! Thank you all for a wonderful stay.",5,2017,05,23
32,Don't Hesitate To Book This Hotel !,"I needed to stay just one night in Barcelona with my 21 yr old daughter prior to a cruise.  I consulted Trip Advisor and read practically every review of this hotel since I had never been to Barcelona and wanted to make sure the hotel was not only going to be clean and safe and comfortable, but in an area where we could make the most of our 24 hours in the City.  I booked this hotel based only on the other Trip Advisor reviews and I am SO HAPPY I did !  
Honestly, I have nothing but GREAT things to say, this was probably one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in.
Location - Location- Location to start !
It is in the absolute most PRIME location ... half a block off the main drag of Las Ramblas, just trust me, this is exactly where you want to be!
The staff goes above and beyond from the moment you open the front door to check in, until the time you check out and they not only call you a cab and help load your luggage into the said cab, they make sure the cab driver knows exactly where you need to go and tells you the price.
The free breakfast,  order anything off the menu....
The free tapas and bottle of champagne in the evening...
The cute slippers in the room you can take home ...
The awesome shower and Molton Brown toiletries...
The lovely balcony...
The very comfortable beds...
The smiling faces of EVERY SINGLE staff member, from bell hop to waiter...
I wish I had more time there!
This hotel is run seamlessly, with every comfort for the guest in mind.
This hotel sets the standard for the way ALL hotels should be run...
They value their guests business and it shows.
Thank you, Hotel DO, for a lovely stay.
If I ever find myself in Barcelona again I would not think of staying anywhere else !",5,2017,05,19
32,Lovely ,Stayed here 2 nights and wish I could have stayed longer. The service from everyone was amazing and was truly world class. I loved the breakfast choice and the waitress was so lovely. Helped my day to start well. Didn't have time to visit the pool or spa but next time. This hotel is small and does book quickly so late check outs are difficult but understand perfectly that so many people would like to stay here!,5,2017,05,19
32,Hotel Do Reial Exceptional really better than 5 Star Service,"Just returned from Barcelona where we stayed at the Hotel Do Reial which is located right off Las Ramblas...this is the first hotel I have ever stayed at where the amenities in the refrigerator are free...that's right ""Free"". The room was spacious, the bathroom shower had great water pressure, the air conditioning was great, the 1st night they provided cookies for the turn down service; however, on the 2nd night they provided chocolates and when my husband asked about the cookies the reply was ""let me see what I can do""...15 minutes later there was a knock on our door and we were given freshly baked warm cookies. Even though the hotel does not have a spa on site arrangements were made so my husband and I could have massages in another suite instead of our room. On our last day we were scheduled to depart before their breakfast service so the hotel packed us a picnic to take with us. To top this off our friends who were with us missed packing a couple of their clothing. I received an email from the hotel wanting to know what address they should send the clothing to. I have stayed in several 5 star hotels in Europe, Asia and the USA and this 18 room boutique's service, attention to detail, desire to make your stay an outstanding experience it is my opinion they  should be rated as a 6 not a 5 star!",5,2017,05,18
32,Incredible staff!!!,"Ahhhh, if only I could go back instead of writing this review at work.  Me, my mom, my sister, my best friend & my mom's best friend, all stayed two nights at DO in Barcelona before getting on our 7-day Western Mediterranean Cruise.  The morning we got there our rooms were not yet ready, but they offered us seating outside & surprised us with a complimentary bottle of champagne & PLATES of delicious pastries and a cake.  This was all because they had looked at my passport and noticed that it was my birthday the day before.  Incredible!!!  

The concierge service was state of the art.  They managed to secure us five tickets to the evening tour of La Pedrera (which was sold out) and found us discounted tickets to the Flamenco show across the street.  Additionally, they booked our car to take us to the cruise, which was no small feat.  

We were served Veuve wine by the glass, but not charged a Veuve price.  We were in heaven.

The beds were exceptionally comfortable, and the room was a decent size for European standards.  One thing to note, which is not the fault of the hotel at all....the Plaza is a party site for sure.  It was filled with boisterous happy people who did like to drink & talk loudly.  That being said, it didn't bother any of us or kept us up, but I could see how it would be disturbing to someone who preferred more quiet or had difficulty sleeping.  Solution - use ear plugs!  

Highly recommend.  And book early!  It fills up fast!",5,2017,05,17
32,"Great location, great place.","The room is quite lovely, especially the bathroom with both shower and tub. The amenities were good, including a loofa, hairbrush, etc. The bed was very comfortable. The best part was that the room looked over the square and the small balcony made for perfect people-watching. There were loud evenings in the square, but the windows and shutters kept the room quiet enough to sleep well. I was traveling long enough that I needed a laundry. While the hotel prices were predictably too high (they are everywhere I've ever been) the concierge pointed me to a laundry within a five minute walk. (A rolling luggage made a convenient laundry cart ;-)) The hotel restaurant was very good as well as the separate breakfast area. I would happily stay here again. It's so near to La Rambla that there are endless choices of other activities, including a reasonable walk to the marina.",5,2017,05,17
32,Fantastic Hotel,"We have just spent 5 days in Barcelona, Unfortunately we didn't stay in the hotel but we had breakfast here everyday, we had drinks most evenings and we had a late lunch on our last day. All the staff were amazingly helpful nothing was to much trouble. Its a fantastic little hotel in a really great location. The outside seating on the terrace is a perfect way to spend the afternoon which we did on serval days after walking around the city it was avery welcomed stop.",5,2017,05,15
32,Only hotel to stay in Barcelona,Having stayed at the Arts Hotel in Barcelona years ago I found Hotel DO to be better in every way. The staff was perfection and truly cared about our stay. Because there were 5 of us traveling together the hotel booked taxis for us whenever we needed a taxi. Truly wonderful location and staff.,5,2017,05,15
32,Amazing,"We are visiting Barcelona again in June & we will be staying here for the third time, we absolutely love this hotel, 
 it makes our special child free anniversary break away even more special, most definitely the only place I wanna stay at in Barcelona.",5,2017,05,14
32,Outstanding hotel with superb staff,"As soon as we walked through the door, we were greeted with a heart warming welcome from Dayana, Augustine and Luis. And this top level of friendliness and service remained throughout our weekend from all staff. A huge thanks to Yuri, Benjamin, Reynald and Alba for all the great service, banter and laughs you gave us at all our meal (and simply drink) times.

We were luckily enough to be staying in the El Terrat suite, which was amazing....just a pity it was tad too cold to use our private swimming pool...next time. The standard of finish, furnishings and cleanliness throughout the whole hotel is equal to that of a top 5 star establishment.

Breakfast definitely one of the best I've ever had in Europe, the choice is unbelievable. We enjoyed the restaurant so much that we dined there on both nights of our stay. The terrace which faces into Placa Reial can get a touch noisy at times, but a great place for people watching lol

I would have no hesitations recommending Hotel DO and really look forward to returning.

Thank you x",5,2017,05,12
32,"Excellent Hotel, But Shady Neighborhood","The hotel was very comfortable, clean, and our room had an exceptional bathroom area with a stall shower and separately located tub, two basis, and a private toilet area. The hotel staff was extremely helpful, cheerful, and accommodating to our needs. The breakfasts in the hotel restaurant were outstanding and delicious. After 9 am the breakfast was outside on the Placa Reial and it was wonderful given our good weather. However, lunch and dinner at the DO restaurant did not compare well with all of the other restaurants we ate at (many suggested by the hotel concierge).  The one downside was the La Rambla crime environment. The hotel is very close to La Rambla (walk out the front door and turn right for 20 steps). About 2 hours after we checked in our ATM card and its pin was stolen while using a close by ATM machine by a very friendly, well dressed, and good looking man who offered to help us when we showed some confusion due to the vagaries of the machine we were using. A well practiced and skilled con-man. Pick pockets are also a constant concern in this neighborhood. However, the hotel is well placed otherwise.",4,2017,05,08
32,only wish we had stayed longer!,"we stayed at Hotel DO for one night before leaving Barcelona and only wish we'd had more time! the hotel is beautifully and thoughtfully appointed and the service is on point.  we had to leave at 4:30 AM to catch a taxi to the airport; when we came downstairs, the staff had called our cab, had our bill printed and waiting for signature, and had packed a picnic breakfast for us to take with us! the location in the bustling Gothic Quarter is great and we didn't hear any noise in our room on the second floor. definitely recommend!",5,2017,05,06
32,Wonderful hotel,"Pros:
Great location--placa-reial- central location in old city. Central to all locations.  Can walk from here to anywhere.  Small and very personal hotel--the service from the staff is excellent and very personal--Luis, Jean Claude and Nelson in particular were excellent. Anything you need, they can provide or find those who can. Rooms are modern, breakfast included--not cheap continental breakfast, but full breakfast, snacks in room delivered daily--fruit or such.  Bar drinks are exceptional.  Food is great, but you will only eat here once since so many other places are around. Showers in rooms are SUBERB--non regulated water rain shower from above with odd restriction on soap products (you'll see). Room fridge refreshed daily--no charge-- with fruit juice, soda, water.
Cons:
Your location is one of the most popular in BCN.  Always will have a big crowd, late night parties--noise is an issue for placa facing rooms if your windows are open at all--and sometimes when your windows are sealed.  Beds are firm--may or may not be your thing.

Would totally stay here again for the location, BCN party and personal service of the hotel staff.",5,2017,05,06
32,Lovely and great service,"The artwork, the food, the staff---everything was amazing.  Beautiful room overlooking the square.  Treats in the evening, amazing breakfast pastries and food.  Perfect location for seeing Barcelona.  We could not have been more happy with the choice of this hotel.",5,2017,05,05
32,Excellent hotel in a great location ,"The Hotel DO is a lovely boutique hotel located in a great area of Barcelona.  The staff is very friendly and helpful. The food is wonderful and breakfast is amazing. The room is very nice and cozy.   Definitely would go back. 

The only item of note is the noise late at night from La Ramblas. ",5,2017,05,04
32,Top notch and perfect location,"Week end with friends. This hotel has it all; ambience, great service, perfect location, great food and so comfortable in all aspects. rooms are small, but everything you need is there. A lovely bed, top notch toiletries, well stocked free minibar (non alcohol). The breakfast service is among the best I have experienced around the World: simply choose whatever you want from the extensive meny, all inclusive! Loved it, and will return. In the evening (or day) enjoy the view and the life at Place Real from the private terrace on the top floor or on the ground floor.",5,2017,05,01
32,Booked in by another hotel,"Before Christmas I booked into the Wittmore and paid in full.
Two weeks before I was due to fly out in March they phoned me to say their had been a computer error and had double booked me. After some heated  discussion they booked me into Hotel DO.
Really a silly mistake as I had stayed at the Wittmore on several occasions , in business look after your regular clients.
I found the Hotel DO delightful. I only stay in boutique or design hotels where the service is personal. The service, rooms and position in the Placa Reial ideal. Yes there is a little noise from the square but what do you expect to be in the midst of the vibe.
In no ways did it disturb me.
Food wise I found the Duck Canneloni super and had Snapper on another occasion was tasty. 
On leaving the hotel I booked for my next trip in three weeks. A return customer gained.",5,2017,05,01
32,Incredible hotel,"We booked 2 junior suites at Hotel DO and they were amazing! We were so happy to have booked this hotel. The staffs were very friendly and helpful right from check-in. In particular, thanks to Jean-Claude for his friendliness, it really made a huge difference especially this being our first time in Barcelona. There was welcome drinks and tapas. And believe me, the hotel was very generous with their portion. Breakfast was simply superb. Despite being a small hotel, we really felt that they were really going the extra mile to ensure we had the most decent stay.  From the quality of the room, the free minibar, the shower, the towels ... I would give this hotel 10 stars if I could!",5,2017,04,29
32,Absolutely wonderful!!! We'd give it 10 stars out of 5 if we could!,"The location is perfect. A block from The Ramblas on a large, beautiful, and  very active square, but close your French doors and it's quiet. The room was not large but lovely, and very comfortable. The staff was so helpful and friendly. When you arrive you are truly welcomed, not just checked in. The free breakfast on the square every morning was such a treat. If you like to walk it is walking distance to almost everything you'd want to see in Barcelona. Do yourself a very big favor if you travel there and stay at this hotel. We can't wait to get back.",5,2017,04,26
32,Fabulous hotel,"We had a superior room and it was just that! Superior. A little deck off the room was quaint and the upgrades to the interior were excellent. The amenities even included a hairbrush and body loofah. Overall, one of the nicest properties I've stayed in. One caveat though: it is extremely noisy at night and while the hotel can't do anything about it, outside partiers are noisy until 6am and kept us up all night.",5,2017,04,26
32,Absolutely Wonderful,"My husband and I stayed at Hotel DO for 3 nights last week and we couldn't have been happier.  The hotel is in a perfect location for sightseeing and located on a the beautiful Placa Reial square.  The staff was over the top in terms of friendliness and helpfulness.  They truly make your stay special with special touches like fruit and treats placed in the room and over the top customer service.  The room was spacious, comfortable and super clean.  We will definitely stay here again next time we are in Barcelona.  Very romantic and a true gem of a hotel.",5,2017,04,25
32,Best Hotel in Barcelona!,"I had an absolutely wonderful experience at Hotel DO. This is a tiny boutique hotel, integrated with a restaurant (the reception is actually in the restaurant, which can be a bit confusing at first). The hotel itself is beautiful and stylish, but the experience is really made by the fantastic service. From check-in to check-out, everyone is helpful and gracious, going above and beyond to make sure you enjoy your stay. I was offered a drink the moment I checked in, was able to store my bags both before and after my stay with no problem, and had one of the most amazing breakfasts I've ever had delivered straight to my room. The room itself was a little on the small side, but everything was exceptionally comfortable, from the linens to the waterfall shower. And the location is perfect--in the middle of everything, within easy walking distance to anywhere you'd want to go and surrounded by bars and restaurants (but still exceptionally quiet). I would stay here again in a heartbeat, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a hotel in Barcelona.",5,2017,04,24
32,Excellent Stay,My fiance and I stayed at Hotel DO for two nights and had an incredible and relaxing stay! The hotel is in a great location for walking to great restaurants as well as sight seeing. It is also situated in close proximity to the metro. The staff was very accommodating to any needs and/or questions we had and overall the service was excellent. The rooms were clean and comfortable. We would happily stay here again!,5,2017,04,24
32,Wonderful Stay,We celebrated 35 years of marriage in four Hotels.  Hotel DO was head and shoulders the best.  The service was superb from everyone.  The meals on the patio were delightful and delicious.  This is a gem.  I am coming back.,5,2017,04,23
32,Nothing short of Incredible.,"Wow! After a 14 day cruise from Florida we ended in Barcelona. I spent many hours reviewing hotels and areas that we wanted to stay. I wanted to be close to the Gothic Quarter, The Beach and Las Ramblas. This hotel was perfect for that. 

We arrived around 9:30 am and our room was not ready, which is totally fine. We were able to drop our bags off. We were offered a complimentary drink which we had a bottle of water. After exploring the city we came back to the hotel at around 2:00 PM. The Room was ready. We were escorted up to our room and were giving a tour of all the features. We were also given a personalized booklet of the hotel and features. 

The room was incredible! The room overlooked the Plaza, which was great for People Watching. The Bathroom was outstanding! The shower offered the best water pressure I have had EVER! The bath products were amazing! 

We had Breakfast each morning and it was Delicious! You are handed the menu and you select what you want and it's included in your room.

I think many hotels should observe Hotel Do on their customer service as this hotel exceeded our expectations.",5,2017,04,20
32,Top Notch Hotel,"I just got back from staying at Hotel DO. I cant say enough good things about this small boutique  hotel. The service has top notch. The free breakfast was the highlight of our trip. The location is close to everything you want to see. The room was perfect.....this hotel would be $700/night
 in the US......",5,2017,04,18
32,Wonderful Stay,"We loved our stay here. The hotel was top notch in all departments. Highly recommend staying here. 

The rooms are immaculate and well designed. It was perfect after a long day exploring the city. 

We also enjoyed the gourmet complimentary breakfast every day. ",5,2017,04,15
32,Excellent Small Hotel,We loved Hotel Do right on Placa Reial and Las Ramblas ... The hotel is privately owned so the service and staff couldn't be more helpful ... the food was excellent and the hotel is right in the middle of all the action and easy walking to most of the highlights or take a taxi (which is very reasonable ... about 10 Euro to Sagrada Familia) where the taxi rank is right outside on Las Ramblas ... we stayed in the El Terrat with has it's own plunge pool on the roof ... there is only one room like this so book in advance. We'll be staying there again next time we're in Barcelona.,5,2017,04,11
32,Wow!,"My wife and I just returned from our week in Barca. Hotel DO and staff were amazing from start to finish! We arrived in Barcelona before our room was ready, but they kept our luggage safe and gave us a welcome drink. While we explore the areas around our hotel (so many great things in walking distance) they prepared our room and called us when it was ready. The staff, especially Jean Claude and Dennis, were very nice, helpful, and attentive. We LOVED the daily breakfast that was brought to our room when we specified. It was fun to try all the breakfast items throughout the week (too many options to list)! Fresh fruit and a evening treat every day. It was also so nice to have a constantly re-stocked mini fridge with sodas, waters, and juices...all free! 

I, unfortunately, got a stomach bug one day during our trip. The staff was concerned and made sure I had tea to help and the chef even prepared an special soup (not on the menu) to help me feel better. 

On top of everything, our flight out was cancelled and delayed until the next day, they made sure to accommodate us, packed us a picnic for our travels and made sure a taxi was ready and waiting to get us to the airport. 

When (not ""if"") we return to Barca, we will definitely be staying at Hotel Do again. Not only is the location perfect, walking distance to everything, the staff and rooms were top notch. We have already recommended it to all of our friends. 

Keep up the good work! We already miss Barca and Hotel DO!",5,2017,04,10
32,Great Service Team - Best Location,"We spent 6 days at this property and the staff could not have been better.  They arranged for great football/soccer tickets; outstanding restaurants and were very accommodating during our stay with great turn down service, late breakfasts, arranging taxi service and arranging for a car and driver tour.  The location is fabulous.  Right in the heart of old Barcelona.  On the square where Gaudi did his first public design (lampposts fro the city).  One block from Gaudi's first private design for a residence.  From this square (the hotel), there were 'free tours' of the Gaudi buildings and Sagrada Familia in English and the guides were superb.  Sitting at the cafe on the square, you see many activities - jugglers, musicians, acrobats, etc....The room was a bit small, but it had all the best of linens, and accoutrements. again, the staff was wonderful ...............please be sure to treat them well !",4,2017,04,09
32,Amazing Staff,"We stayed at this hotel while in Barcelona and were very impressed with the staff and the cleanliness of the rooms. We did not encounter a single problem here and found the beds to be super comfortable! The rooms, at no fault to the hotel, can be a bit noisy but most of that can be shut out with the shutters and curtains. I would recommend this hotel to anyone!",5,2017,04,07
32,Great Hotel in a fantastic location!,"Very nice boutique hotel in the center of Barcelona.  Walking distance from basically everything that you will ever want to visit.  We were very happy with the hotel quality and the professionalism of the staff.  The breakfast was also very good.

The only problem was with the slow Wi-Fi and this is the reason we give it 4 stars and not 5.  It was actually so slow that it was practically unusable.  We had to go to the local Starbucks every afternoon to browse the Internet and plan our activities for the next day (places to visit, reservations, etc.) It would be great if we could do that from our room.",4,2017,04,06
32,A wonderful stay,"If you want to enjoy a 5 star boutique hotel without pretence this is the the place to stay.Very welcoming. Attentive but unintrusive  staff, breakfast was lovely and fresh with lots of choice.
Great location for everything, I couldn't fault it and thank you for making my birthday special with fizz and cake nice touch.
We will be back.",5,2017,04,06
32,Loved the location and free made to order breakfast!,"Friendly staff, well appointed room, and free (alchohol free) minibar made this a very pleasant stay.  Even with our room overlooking the Placa Reial the noise level was minimal especially with the wooden shutters in place.  The made to order breakfast was absolutely fabulous.  The staff bent over backwards to help us with all requests.  We will return!

btw.....easy walk from the upper end of the Ramblas with our suitcases.  We took the AeroBus from the Airport to Placa Catalunya then walked 10 minutes with our roller suitcases to the hotel.  Cheap, fast, simple.",5,2017,04,04
32,Excellent hotel,"We had stayed at this hotel for the second time. As in the previous trip (January 2016), the impressions from the hotel and the staff are very pleasant.
The hotel‚Äôs location is very convenient for walking around the city. It is a few steps from La Rambla, between Placa de Catalunya (1 km) and the Columbus Monument (600m). There is a taxi stop nearby.
Upon arrival, you can have welcome drinks-water, juices, cava.
We lived in a Superior room, the room has a small balcony, the window overlooks the picturesque Placa Reial square. The room is well insulated, the street noise is not audible if the window is closed.
The room price includes free soft drinks (drinking water with gas and without, a variety of juices, coca cola, etc.). Mini bar is updated daily.
There is a delicious breakfast, which is also included in the price, menu choice (very tasty pastries, cava, freshly squeezed orange juice, fried eggs, scrambled eggs with choice, Benedict eggs, jamon, salmon, fresh seasonal fruits and wild berries, natural yoghurt and
etc.).
Every day there are fresh fruit and sweets in the room before bedtime. 
Very friendly, always smiling, professional staff at breakfast and at the reception, which always be ready to help you.
Excellent Wi Fi.
During your stay the hotel blocks money (100 euros per room per day), funds had been unlocked immediately, we had not even have time to get to the taxi stop, which is only 2 minutes by foot from the hotel. Very often the unlocking funds process takes from several days to one month.

Dear management!
Thank You very much for our enjoyable time with you.
Thank You for the birthday gift. The cake and cava were delicious.
We hope to see you again at your excellent Hotel DO.
With best regards,Marina&Natalia,20.03-28.03.2017,Moscow.",5,2017,03,31
32,Best boutique hotel,"The hotel has a perfect location on Placa Reial next to the Rambla. Wonderful restaurants and shops are all around every corner in the gothic and el born areas, and the Barceloneta is only 1 km away. We stayed 4 nights in the el terrat room on the top floor. The room is quite small, but with a nice terrace with its own small pool which is great on warm days. The hotel served cava in the room the first day, and met every expectation. Friendly welcoming service and hospitality. We had breakfast in the hotel restaurant, but wished we had also tried breakfast on the terrace which is probably very nice on nice mornings. We would love to come back to Hotel DO.",5,2017,03,30
32,"5 stars, if you have earplugs...","We love small hotels, so 18 rooms hotel in the finest location just off La Rambla is exactly what we were looking for.
The rooms are spacious, elegant with a very comfortable bathroom. Cleanliness was impeccable, even comparing to other 5 stars hotel around the globe. The staff is very nice and the service is perfect. They all give you the feeling that they really appreciate the fact you are staying with them.
Breakfast is served as opposed to many self service buffets and the choice is more than enough.
All in all, it would have been a perfect 5 out of 5, but for the noise. This is sometimes intolerable. And I mean at 2 AM, and 4AM and even 6. Only at around 6:30 it get's quite. Insulation is bad, so the noise in the room is not something we envisioned when we reserved this 5 star hotel. We really had to use ear plugs to get some sleep.
Definitely go there if you are insensitive to noise and do not approach the hotel if you are sensitive. No grey area, it's black and white.
",5,2017,03,27
32,New favorite hotel!!,"Perfect retreat if you want to stay in the lively Placa Reial area and are a fan of exquisite design and attention to detail. Our room was perfectly lovely and spacious with a gorgeous view of the Placa and we enjoyed the exceptional quality linens, bathroom amenities and turndown service with fresh fruit and local treats. Breakfast options are plentiful and everything including the service was excellent. Front desk staff are exceptionally helpful and were quick to make suggestions to make our stay more comfortable (when we asked for assistance to secure a taxi for our early am flight, they were quick to offer a wake-up call followed by delivery of coffee and a packaged breakfast). Understated elegance seemed to be the mode of the hotel and, while we spent most of the time enjoying the best of the city, we were delighted to return to the hotel every evening.",5,2017,03,26
32,Blown away,"Let me start by saying i'm from nyc so hubby and i are a little pretentious when it comes to hotels...if it's not a lot nicer than our home then it's a ""no"". Also, my posts don't have pics of rooms for a few reasons: everyone else posts pics, i love the element of surprise.
The GREAT: 
*Centrally located
*Very very VERY clean
*Architecture and desigb are beautiful. It's a personal preference that i like my hotels to fit the area I'm in but still have a modern flare. This hotel did just that, beautiful Spanish style with a modern feel...no terracotta tiles on the floor (as authentic as the may look, the just don'tfeel clean to me).
*Hotel staff is very accommodating, friendly, genuine and knowledgeable. Many people can't rate this if the never speak to the staff. 
*Full of surprises: complimentary fruit at night (may have been because we were in a suite room), complimentary mini bar access fully stocked with juices (you'll have more than your fair share of alcohol while out, lol). 

The not so great: 
*As this hotel is centrally located, there is a noise factor for you to consider if you're a light sleeper. Yes there are balcony doors but even when shut you can hear the liveliness of your area. We are from a quiet part of NYC so i appreciated the sounds, found it pretty soothing. We also do lots of tours so are pretty tired and fall right to sleep not bothered by it. 

This is a wonderful boutique hotel where you won't feel like just another number. Stayed here 3 nights during our 2nd Euro trip which included Milan and Rome. Couldn't be happier!
",5,2017,03,26
32,Excellent choice if looking to splurge a little,"Fantastic hotel overall with helpful & friendly staff, delicious food, very comfortable beds, cool & unique room interior, and prime location. No real negatives, as long as you're prepared to pay up a little for the quality.",5,2017,03,26
32,Terrific food,"We were there for lunch this past weekend and had the Potato Brava, cheese plate, veggie croquettes and, of course, Sangria. Great service and very good food,  right in the heart of the square. Loved it. ",5,2017,03,24
32,Fantastic hotel,"First time to Barcelona. The hotel was recommended by a friend who has stayed here several times. We loved our room, the location and the staff. It couldn't have been a nicer stay. Will gladly recommend this hotel and look forward to staying here again.
Aloha",5,2017,03,21
32,We loved everything about the Hotel DO!,"The hotel was centrally located, walking distance from many attractions.  Our room overlooked the scenic Pl. Reial, and had the benefit of providing a pretty view, but thanks to excellent soundproofing, was not problematic at all.  The room was spacious, beautifully decorated, and well appointed, offering both a shower (with an oversized shower head) and a bath tub.  The service was OUTSTANDING!  Not only was the staff attentive and helpful, but they went above and beyond.  The breakfast was lovely, and the pastries exceptionally delicious.  Because our departing flight required our leaving at 5:30 a.m. (before the dining room opened), the hotel offered to provide us with a ""picnic"" breakfast, which generously included a sandwich apiece, fruit, juice, and several delicious pastries.  I heartily recommend the Hotel DO.",5,2017,03,19
32,Wonderful stay in Barcelona,"Hotel DO is a wonderful hotel with gracious rooms and excellent staff.  Located in the Placa Reial, Hotel DO is just next to La Rambla and a short walk from the water.  The hotel was renovated about 5 years ago and they have done a great job.  With a terrace on the Placa Reial, this is a great place to people watch.  Finally, the staff, particularly Aslan at the front desk, was incredibly helpful and friendly.  This is a great place to stay.",5,2017,03,19
32,Lovely property for a business trip,"This property is great, its small, centrally located with lovely service. The views from the roof are gorgeous and there's a small pool for very hot days.  I stayed for a night whilst on a business trip.  I booked a single room, which despite being windowless (I intended to spend all waking hours outside of the room) was really quite nice.  They've made the most of the space available, comfy bed, regular sized bathroom, efficient storage, useful desk (including stapler, paper clips, pens, pad etc).  By staying in a smaller room I got all the benefits of a great hotel, in a great location without paying a high price. They also include a fabulous breakfast in the price.  Id definitely stay here again.",4,2017,03,16
32,Great stay. Beautiful Hotel,"Very classy and clean, central and  Catalan stylish, at Hotel DO is awesome. Our room, is high ceilings with balcony with full views over Placa Real, nice bath and comfy bed.
Staff is very kind and,  the roof top terrace with a small swimming pool gives views of the city. Would highly recommend.",5,2017,03,15
32,What a fantastic Hotel !,"Wow is the first thing that springs to mind : If only the standards in all hotels were as good as this. Yes, the hotel is pricey, but you get what you pay for. Upon arrival, a complimentary drink accompanies check in and then, when you are ready, staff are on hand to take you to your rooms. The staff are exceptional : genuinely friendly, knowledgeable welcoming and attentive. We had a twin room overlooking the calle colon on the first floor. Very high ceilings, very comfortable bed, good tv and tv selection, lovely wooden floors, plenty of storage space, in room safe, lighting and plug sockets a plenty. The bathroom was large with a fabulous shower, spacious, amazing water pressure and temperature and loads of complimentary bits and pieces. Cleaning was excellent.

Breakfast was just to die for. A lovely ambiance to dine in in the basement restaurant  along with fantastic service and amazing food really set us up for the day. You must try the crepes - they were divine ! We also tried the restaurant on the plaza for dinner one night : Again, you get what you pay for (just over 100 for a bottle of wine and three courses each) but the food, setting etc were worth every penny.

Location wise, the hotel is ideal for visiting all the sites in Barcelona. The only thing that must be mentioned is that because of the location just on Placa Reial, it can be noisy at night. The Spanish don't really start heading out before 10pm so expect a bit of noise till about 5am. Having said that with the shutters closed and the curtains drawn, it dims a lot of the noise. I would recommend taking some ear plugs though as after the first night I popped some in and experienced no disruption from the drunken revellers going home :)

All in all, a fantastic hotel that sets the bench mark for others to follow !",5,2017,03,12
32,Fabulous experience: I'd live at Hotel DO if I could!,"I stayed at Hotel DO for 4 nights in the middle of a two-week business trip and my stay was the highlight not only of this trip but also of all my travel over the last few years. This gem is located on the Placa Reial, right off of the busy La Rambla. Rather than feel like a part of the ""noise"", the hotel served as a magnificent oasis from the craziness, with a hint of liveliness from the activity taking place in the square. The staff is among the friendliest I've met anywhere around the globe, and the lobby/bar/restaurant were cozy and inviting. My room was exquisite: both modern and with touches of character. Fabulous bed, beautiful furniture and art, wonderful bathroom. The only watchout is the noise that comes from the Placa Reial at all hours, but I found it charming rather than annoying given the wonderful nature of the hotel & staff. If there were a Hotel DO in every city, it would be my first choice.",5,2017,03,11
32,Wonderful little gem!!,"This small boutique hotel was fabulous from start to finish. The location is prime, the service was impeccable, the food was so fresh, great quality and delicious and the wine selection perfect! We thought the roof top terrace was relaxing (even though restaurant only open in summer) we couple still relax in peace with a glass of wine in evenings, the bath products are all Molton Brown which I love, the WONDERFUL shower (best ""rain shower"" water pressure I have ever had in a hotel EVER), the multi bed pillow selection was comfy.  Room also had balcony which was wonderful and not easy to find in the heart of the gothic district. Another one of my favorite things about this place is the complimentary full menu ""order whatever you want"" breakfast (even served to your room if you wish).  I looked forward to that every morning! All of these are just a few of the reasons why I thought this boutique hotel was FABULOUS.  This was my second time to Barcelona, but when I return again someday this WILL be where I stay. If I had to give any negatives, I would say the ONLY down side is because the location of hotel is so perfect, the placa is very popular and can get a bit noisy at night...this was nothing that kept us from sleeping but if you're sensitive to noise you may want to bring ear plugs or ask for a side building room. All rooms do have sound shutters on them and we found it to be fine. I miss this hotel already! Bravo Hotel DO and thank you for making my trip with my niece so wonderful !!",5,2017,03,11
32,Absolutely Fabulous!!!!,Three couples were blown away by this hotel!  We stayed with them four nights and could have made it a month!!!  It is a super place to stay...perfect location.  The staff is incredible and the rooms wonderful.  It is only about five years old so every thing is relatively new.  When we arrived we were offered welcome drinks and to top it off...when we left we had a very early morning flight and they sent us off with a picnic...amazing.  YOU CANNOT GO WRONG STAYING AT THE HOTEL DO!!!!,5,2017,03,10
32,Great!,"Everything is high class and solid, typically Catalan and Spanish, at Hotel DO Reial; a family owned, 18 room hotel perfectly located in Barcelona: I saw all room cathegories and must say that no 24, our room, is my favourite: hiiiigh ceilings with visible beams, ancient ironworks protecting the balcony with full views over Placa Reial, egg shell white and dark brown colours, perfect lighting, white marble and dark oak in the bathroom‚Ä¶pure joy. 
Food is simply fantastic with all imaginable local dishes and tapas and the outside terrace gives great views over the vivid square. Staff i genuinly kind and, maybe best of all: the roof top terrace with a small swimminy pool gives views of the city: Gaudi, the gothic cathedral and again the high palm trees as Placa Reial.

32,Our Spain ,Vert lovely welcome with Cava in our room .Lovely boutique hotel. Lovely rooms spacious and very clean . Beautiful beds with crisp linen. Staff are great very attentive offering any help you need . Location is good but can tend to be noisy as there is a night club in the square .I loved the nightly turn down service and nightly treats to welcome us home . Large beds and large roomy bathrooms  very high ceilings lots of air . We had a room on the third floor facing the square so we could open the windows and look out. I recommend this hotel but it is a busy area .We will remember our stay üá®üá¶‚ù§,5,2017,02,23
32,Fabulous staff,"The room was a good size for a city hotel, beautiful white crisp bed linen, but the bed size was rather small. The bathroom was very well equipped, with Morton Brown products, fantastic towels, bathrobe and great shower. Every night we had fresh fruit, and chocolates. 
The only down side to the hotel was it was in a busy square so quiet noisey at night. I suggest asking for a room on the 3rd or 4th floor.
Breakfast was fantastic, and really good coffee.
The bar area has a great atmosphere.
Staff were outstanding, nothing was too much trouble.",5,2017,02,12
32,"Fantastic Hotel, Perfect Location, Impeccable Service ","Me and my husband just came back from 2 nights stay at Hotel Do, this is our second stay there. We frequently visit Barcelona for holiday and business, stayed in various five star hotel, until my husband find Hotel DO, this will be the only hotel we will stay for our future visit to Barcelona. 

It's in one of the most beautiful historical part of Barcelona, the location is just so perfect, 10 minutes walk to the harbour, 10 minutes walk to the city centre, you can just walk everywhere. 

The room is spacious, we stayed in one of suite which has a balcony facing the plaza, you can just sit on the balcony, have a coffee watching people passing by. The bed is absolutely huge. The only minus problem is the noise from the square in the middle of the night, you can still hear it even you close the shutter, but you can't have everything. 

I have to mention the hotel staff are just so friendly, from front desk to waiting staff at restaurant, they just can't do enough for their guest. 

It's not your normal chain hotel, but a beautifully decorated boutique hotel, highly recommend for its location, room and staff.  

",5,2017,02,10
32,Lovely,"Wonderful staff, exquisite rooms.  Quiet even though our room faced the square. Loved the location. We could run down the street and then run along the beach. There is not one bad thing to say about this wonderful hotel. Would 100% go back. ",5,2017,02,09
32,Wonderful place to stay in Barcelona,"We had a great stay at the Hotel DO for 5 days in January. The room was lovely.  It had all the space we needed and was cleverly designed. The washroom was clean and large. We had a big lovely bed with a whole array of pillows from which to choose. 

The staff was incredibly helpful.  Everyone went all out to make certain we had what we needed or to answer our every question.  But I never had that over bearing feel some hotel staff at large hotels can give one.  Just friendly, genuinely interested in helping us have a great time. The hotel is small and intimate without feeling at all tight for space.

I am a vegetarian and that can be difficult in Spain, but the staff all joined in in offering us suggestions of where to eat and all were wonderful!  We so appreciated this help and they followed up to see if we liked it.  I loved their enthusiasm.

I have to be honest, the Placa Reial is noisy at night.  The windows in the room worked very well to block the sound, but sometimes we wanted to crack them for coolness and then I just used earplugs.  If you want super quiet and out of the way, this isn't the place for you. 

But if you want to walk everywhere, have easy access to transport, and stroll La Rambla, wander up to Placa Catalunya, explore the Gothic Quarter, it's the best!

The little touches of some special snack or treat left in our room every evening, or the free tapas and drink when we arrived (this was in the package we bought, I think, or maybe it's for everyone - it was right on our reservation).  And all the bottled water we wanted for free and umbrellas to borrow when it rained, as it did our first 2 days. The complimentary breakfast had everything you would want - a full breakfast with great service.  

I would absolutely return and hope I can very soon!",5,2017,02,08
32,Travel allows you to experience all of life's hidden treasures. Here is one of them: Hotel DO,"I knew I wanted to celebrate my birthday this year in Barcelona. So after months of research, Hotel DO captured my idea of where I wanted to stay in Barcelona. I have to say that after staying at this boutique hotel, it is one of the best I've ever experienced. It starts off with the location of the hotel, it is one of several establishments in Placa Reial, off the popular La Ramblas street, extremely close to a lot of shopping & dinning. Also, it isn't far from any of the major attractions like Casa Batllo, La Pedrera, & La Sagrada Familia, all within fair walking distance. Tip: you don't need to spend on taxi rides to go to these & other attractions. Hotel DO will provide you with a map of the area that will easy guide you. Walking to these areas was fun because you got to run into other cool sites, like Mercado La Boqueria, that will attract you to come on in & have a look. Just make sure you bring good walking shoes. Places like Park Guell & Monjuic Hill, you may need a ride. Continuing on, once I arrived at the hotel, I was greeted by some of the friendliest people I've ever met internationally. Dayana & Luis greeted me with a very warm welcome, assisting me with my check in, offering me a drink, thoroughly answering all my questions; I mean I was just beyond impressed with their service. Every morning, at the time that you requested, delicious breakfast of your choice was brought to your room. They were on point. The lounge area on the first floor is beautifully decorated, very nice to sit back, relax, enjoy a drink, which brings me to the bartender who made me some very tasteful margaritas, so good I have to applaud him for his techniques. As far as the room goes, I have read comments about the noise level coming from Placa Reial; however, I did not experience any sort of noise level in the room that I was given. I slept very comfortable in a very cozy king size bed. The room is very clean, very comfortable, with a unique design to it. Overall, I said it before, & I'll say it again, my experience at Hotel DO was beyond amazing.  Some of my highlights include, from them helping me book train tickets to/from Madrid, to calling a taxi for me to quickly get me to Santz Station, to them bringing me an excellent bottle of Cava to my room for my birthday courtesy of the hotel (see picture), the entire staff that I ran into were amazing, so kind, so eager to help you in any way. Just good people that wanted to make sure my stay was pleasant; and they met that goal, going beyond to make sure I had a great time at the hotel. So, would I ever stay at Hotel DO again? What was that saying that Stone Cold Steve Austin once said? ""Hell Yeah""! Until next time, Viva Hotel Do!",5,2017,01,20
32,Wonderful Boutique Hotel with Exceptional Service,"Just returned from a week long stay in Barcelona and had the pleasure of staying at Hotel DO for most of the trip.  The hotel is located right off La Rambla in the very popular Gothic Quarter.  It is centrally located and walking distance to many tourist attractions including the Picasso Museum, La Rambla, Port Vell, and much much more.  The hotel is a small, family owned and operated hotel right in the center of the very popular Placa Reial.  The rooms are well appointed.  We initially booked a Superior Double.  However, the room we booked was not available for our dates and the hotel upgraded us at no extra cost to a Junior Suite.  The room was very nice with two balconies facing the square on the 4th floor.  The room was contained original artwork and modern style yet comfortable furnishings, including a sitting area with a couch and table and a large and comfortable four poster bed.  Breakfast was brought to our room each morning and included in the room charge.  We had a seemingly endless menu of options to choose from and the service was promptly delivered each morning at the requested time. The hotel was under a bit of construction at the time of our stay and the restaurant located in the basement was not open.  However, the outdoor patio was open and the food and sangria were wonderful!  The hotel staff were exceedingly friendly and helped us with whatever we needed.

The only complaint I have was the noise level at night.  Placa Reial is a very lively square at night with multiple restaurants, bars and clubs.  This is great for those in search of nightlife.  However, my travel partner and I were more interested in sightseeing during the day and sleeping at night.  The noise level in our room coming from the square was high and our sleep was disrupted a few times during the stay.  I do not fault the hotel or staff in any way for this, but highly suggest requesting a room which does not face the square if you are looking for a quiet night.  Overall, the stay was wonderful and I highly recommend this hotel.",4,2017,01,17
32,Fantastic location ,"Wow absolutely amazing place fantastic location not noisy at all amazing staircase what lovely staff very very helpful the room was outstanding very nice upto date very clean so was the bathroom had a good pool area

Will recommend to friends and family and will definitely be visiting again in the future ",5,2017,01,14
32,"Excellent hotel , they make you feel very special","Although at first look you might think this is a small old hotel, but you will be amazed by the great service, the luxury rooms with big attention to details, friendly staff who rush to help at first glimpse. The location is perfect, unlimited shopping and dining options ..,.. one of my best stays in Barcelona ",5,2017,01,11
32,"Have to give a five star for the service, but...","Hotel DO is absolutely impeccable.  Perfect location, nice rooms, and a wonderful staff.  However, wouldn't be truthful if I didn't mention our stay was a Friday - Saturday night and we slept very little, wish we had ear plugs.  Placa Reial is, to my understanding, a very happening night life spot and as such, lots of drunken yelling from about 2:00 - 5:00 AM.  Nonetheless, absolutely in love with everything else about the hotel.  Would recommend requesting a room that doesn't face the public square and also (just guessing) staying during the week would result in less nightly noises :)",5,2017,01,09
32,New year visit,"We arrived on 30th December for 4 nights.  The rooms were lovely....but the area is very noisy....and the nights we were there it was still loud at 6am....
The staff were excellent and helpful at all times. From a location point of view it was great in terms of getting around and eating....definitely worth a stay but pack your ear plugs!!!",4,2017,01,03
32,Fantastic location and Fantastic staff,"3 night stay in Mid November. Our deluxe room was on the 3rd floor facing the Plaza. Perhaps a little smaller that I was expecting  but very comfortable and with a great bathroom. Others have commented on the noise from the Plaza but we heard nothing from our room. As winter time the breakfast was served in the cellar restaurant, lovely room, great choice and quality of breakfast. 
The best points of the hotel are it's location and it's staff, We spent more than a few hours on the Plaza terrace with tapa's and wine with fantastic service from the waiting staff - a credit to the hotel",5,2016,12,30
32,Great hotel,"The hotel was fantastic. The service excellent. The staff couldn't do enough for us. We do not usually stay in small boutique hotels, so we did not know what to expect.The level of service  far surpasses that at most large luxury hotels.From the moment we checked in to the moment we left, our every need was taken care of.  
We had a junior suite overlooking the plaza. The room was large and tastefully decorated. Mini bar restocked (free!) daily. Shower amazing. Breakfast over the top! The plaza can be noisy at night, but is actually quite beautiful to look at both during the day and the night. 
The location is great, convenient to many sites in Barcelona, with most sites within walking distance.
Definitely recommend.",5,2016,12,22
32,60th birthday visit with husband and family,We've just returned from a three night stay at Hotel Do.   The location is fabulous - right off Ramblas and on Placa Reial. I've stayed before in February and wanted to share experience with my family. All three rooms we booked were lovely and added touches like treats in the room were lovely. Breakfast was very good. The weather let us down but it was December. We had a great trip and enjoyed our stay at the Do hotel.,4,2016,12,20
32,Best Location in Barcelona ,"We booked Hotel Do based on reviews, location but mostly on its boutique status as service is normally better and personalised. And we weren't wrong! 
From the time we walked in and given local cava sparkling wine to enjoy during our check in the service was impeccable. The cost was very reasonable for a large luxurious suite as it included the delicious breakfast each morning; the drinks in the minibar and one free evening of drinks and tapas! The experience was great. We had a corner suite with connecting room for our two teenage kids with balconies opening onto the beautiful Placa Reial plaza below which were so enjoyable to watch the crowds at night with a glass of wine. It was a bit noisy at times but with the shutters and curtains closed, for us it was fine.
The rooms were very well presented, beautifully decorated and clean with very comfortable beds and high quality bathroom products. The concierge was also very helpful in suggesting and organising some local sites and restaurants to try.
An excellent hotel with impressive service in a great location just metres from the La Rambla strip in the heart of Barcelona. We happily recommend this beautiful hotel and we will definitely be back one day!",5,2016,12,11
32,Too Noisy for my Taste,"It is my first time in Barcelona, and I did not know what is a good area to stay. I booked this hotel without knowing what to expect. The first impression is not good. The taxi driver dropped me at the La Rumbla and into a sea of people, and pointed a small street, and yelled ""plaza royal"", where the hotel located.   I was completely disoriented at night and thought where was I.  But I got in the plaza and found the hotel.

The hotel is nice, with everything you need. The mini bar is free, and you can have all the soda, juice and drinks as you want. But my only complaint is that it is so noisy, even after closing all windows. Funny thing is at midnight, I can hear people downstairs singing John Denver's Country Road--""Almost heaven, West Virginia...."". People kicking bear cans 4 o'clock in the morning. Not just weekend, every night.

It is not the hotel's fault. I also think it might not be fair to complain about the noise that they have no control over. But I just want to let people know, if you want a quiet night after a day of exploring Barcelona, this may not be the hotel for you.",4,2016,12,10
32,Gorgeous Boutique Hotel in the Heart of Barcelona,"Hotel DO: Pla√ßa Reial is a gorgeous boutique hotel that sits right in the middle of Las Ramblas on Pla√ßa Reial (if you want a quiet hotel, this is not it). With 18 luxury rooms, two incredible restaurants, and a decor that included hard wood floors, lush dark leather sofas, mirrored ceilings, and blush colored florals, the hotel was romantic, yet modern. My husband and I were welcomed with a bottle of bubbly and a chocolate tart to say congratulations on how honeymoon/wedding. It was really nice. Their rooms are also energy efficient and you can't turn on lights or the AC without your room card. They have a turndown service with yummy cookies and chocolates, along with mid afternoon snacks of fruits brought to your room. We had to make an early 5 am flight and they even packed up a breakfast for us to go since we would miss the breakfast that was included in our package. The details and attention were not over looked!",5,2016,11,28
32,Beautiful ,This hotel is beautiful. I stayed on the roof top top which had our own pool on the terrace. The room was well equipped with dressing gowns slippers etc...the mini fridge was stocked up everyday. We had breakfast in our room which was amazing the choice was fantastic. The staff are very friendly and make us feel very welcome. On arrival we were given a complimentary drink and shown to and around our room. The mussels I would highly recommend these were delicious. ,5,2016,11,28
32,Our experience,"This is a very nice hotel, the location is OK.  If you are looking for a quiet place to stay this is not the place.  The noise from the plaza goes until 5 to 6 a.m. The rooms are very nice, but small, the staff is very helpful.",4,2016,11,26
32,Warm and nice good location ,"The hotel is small . 18 rooms. Nicely new design. Warm atmosphere.
Staff is very nice.
Rooms are very small. Bear in mind. 
Bathroom us very nice.
Breakfast is not a buffet , served .
Food is excellent.
Location is fantastic. Just in the middle of the ramblas.
",4,2016,11,24
32,Highly recommended,"Superb service and ambiance.  Small hotel located between Plaza Reial and La Rambla.  Super clean rooms of typical European proportions (read 'small') with high ceilings (about 13 feet on first floor), and very modern fixtures.  Shower is heavenly.  Hotel includes breakfast which is possibly the best hotel breakfast we had, including crispy croissants and jamon iberico. Breakfast is in what is essentially a cellar with vaulted ceiling - very pretty.  Front desk staff is excellent and will print boarding passes or tickets to Gaudi buildings.  
Hotel is very centrally located for meandering in Gothic Quarter or Barri Berne.  There are two grocery stores with decent selection of wine within 3 minutes - one on de Rauric,and a better one on de Ferran (turn right on it).  
If there is one downside its the outside noise.  Hotel has double plate windows, but they are insufficient to block ALL noise from Plaza Reial where festivities continue well past midnight.",5,2016,11,20
32,My 1st Choice,"My only recommendation is sincere and I hope the hotel would consider please putting in 2 sun parasols at the pool for shade (just 1 at each pair of chairs). 

This hotel is lovely. I wanted to be comfortable after such a long fight and so it was a great choice. Looking back, I probably ""shouldn't"" have spent so much considering Barcelona is not an expensive city, but I needed to be Incredibly Comfortable you see. And now I couldn't imagine having to stay elsewhere on that trip. If that is what you are looking for you I would highly recommend the property. Let's be honest, I would recommend it to everyone if I could get away with it. But for whatever reason, a lot of people just don't see value in luxury accommodations, where as I feel budget hotels can be a waste of money. Not always, but some cheap hotels can be a huge rip off because you Always get what you pay for. For me, I need to have Good Service, Attention to Detail and Prime Location. If I can meet these requirements without staying at a luxury hotel, great! But very often this criteria eliminates lower end hotels from consideration. The Hotel DO very much meets my requirements and I am so pleased with them.  

The staff are friendly and professional. Certainly not over the top. They're great. 

Location is 5*; walking distance to everything including shopping, galleries and dining as well as all stations, really giving you easy access to absolutely everything within the region and beyond. 

Breakfast is absolutely delicious. I was dining while I was out and about for all my other meals so did not have lunch or dinner at the hotel but would not hesitate. The sweets and fruit daily they mention on their website FYI is just turn down so something you expect to be included if you are often staying in hotels like these. Don't get me wrong, they're very good and I do enjoy and appreciate this amenity very much. The wording fruit and sweets just sounds plural to me for some reason so they can't over delivery with these single serving scrumptious treats. The turn down treats are scrumptious indeed!

Clientele are wonderful; only down people stay at this joint. Definitely no riffraff. Everyone I talked to was well traveled, cool and cultured. And no pretentious people either :)",5,2016,11,16
32,Highly recommended,"A very comfortable boutique hotel in a fantastic location. With large well appointed rooms, a relaxing but fashionable ambience and great service. Not cheap but worth the tariff.

The hotel faces one of the prettiest squares in Barcelona, in  the gothic quarter and a stones throw (more of a toss really) from Las Rambla. In true European style it has a shaded cafe on the square that's served great coffee. Good for breakfast, or a drink in the evening. 

The hotel also has a restaurant in the basement which also serves breakfast, which we enjoyed. Some evenings dinner is served on the roof and that makes for a wonderful setting for a delightful meal. The staff suggested some great places to visit for other meals - so be sure to ask. 

Service is friendly and attentive reflecting the small size of the hotel. The architecture is that old world modern that Europe does so well. 

We have stayed in Barcelona before and in good hotels but when I return it will be to this one.",5,2016,11,14
32,Prime location,"Great hotel ,made welcome ,and was offered a refreshing drink when signing in ,staff where all friendly ,hotel was clean and had a nice atmosphere ,like other reviews on this hotel say the breakfast was great ,anything off the menu,the room we had was small ,but most boutique hotels are,so no boggy there,free non alcoholic mini bar was a nice touch ,also the chocolate and fruit that was brought to the room ,thank you for that, location you can not beat ,this is my 4th time to Barcelona ,we have stayed at the W ,the Marriott ,they are chain hotels ,nice but it's different when you stop at a well run  small hotel like this one ,the only reason why I never gave 5 points was the noise late night into early morning from the square ,it seems everybody heads there to party ,this is no fault of the hotel ,we where there Friday and Saturday night which I guess was the worst nights to be there for the noise ,I think they where still at it 5am in the morning ,but if you can join in ,or you are a heavy sleeper you will not have a problem .would I stay again ,yes ,you can not beat where it stands to look around the city.",4,2016,11,14
32,It's All True!,"This hotel is a gem. Right off Las Ramblas, overlooking a beautiful plaza, the location can't be beat.  The plaza has a water fountain, tens of restaurants, constant entertainment from street performers and outdoor fairs.  

Despite all of the activity, we slept well each night.  The hotel itself is an oasis.  The staff greets you by name as you enter.  They fill your mini fridge with complimentary drinks and come around each evening with fresh fruit or treats.  

The breakfast is luxurious and filling.  The spa area, which can only be used by one room at a time, is an added bonus.  The bathroom and it's amenities (with separate toilet room, shower and tub) is sleek in design.  While the bedroom is small, the ceilings are high, and the room is well laid out.  

Overall, we were very happy with our choice and agree with the many positive reviews.  ",5,2016,11,14
32,Excellence at a price,"About as central a location as possible with the inevitable price tag and, certainly true of the first floor, a lot of street noise!

The staff are friendly, professional and welcoming and the hotel tries very hard with a range of little extras. 

A pleasant but not large room with limited storage. Nice bathroom. 

Would like a bit more soundproofing, a kettle and an iron!

Breakfast was OK, slow because served rather than buffet. Scrambled eggs very salty, nice ham.",5,2016,11,09
32,Awesome HoneyMoon Boutique Hotel,"We stayed for 3 nights for a honeymoon trip on Spain.  The service was superb, Jean Claude received us and gave us a tour of the hotel and all the amenities we had.  They received us with a wine and tapas at the terrace and then some gifts throughout are stayed.  The view towards the terrace at night full of life until very late, but being able to just sit and have some wine is great.  Location of the hotel is right beside La Rambla, La boqueria, gotic quarter with the port in a comfortable walking distance.  Hotel is noisy but is expected from the area but they do a very good job in the rooms with the quality of the windows to isolate the room.  I highly recommend this boutique",5,2016,11,08
32,Best service in the world!,"I have never been impressed with hotel customer service until I stayed at this hotel. The staff was nice and friendly and always a step ahead of one's needs. Food, location, and amenities were excellent. The hotel at night could get a little loud because of the location but I didn't mind at all as it was very festive and the crowd noise just beckoned one to come out for one last drink. If quiet is what you prefer then ask for a room on the upper floors.",5,2016,11,07
32,Classy Autumn Break,"This lovely boutique hotel is perfectly situated for exploring Barcelona in the attractive Placa Reial (just off La Rambla and a 5 min. walk from La Boqueria). The original building has been sensitively and elegantly restored and our large, airy room overlooked the square, where there was always something going on.The restaurants (a vaulted cellar or rooftop tables for breakfast, tables fronting the square for anytime) were very good and the food was delicious, especially their tapas! The staff were very friendly, going out of their way to be helpful. We will definitely go back on our return to Barcelona.",5,2016,11,02
32,Love this Boutique Hotel !,"We stayed three nights at the Hotel DO and wished it was more.  The hotel is immaculately maintained, with contemporary, tasteful furnishings.  The design of the rooms is well thought out; nothing is missing.  The bathroom was large, well lighted, with a very good hair dryer and plenty of towels and toiletries.  The hotel provided a complimentary glass of wine for us, as well as a complimentary tapas meal with a bottle of wine.  Location is central in the Placa Reial - right off La Rambla.  The staff goes out of their way to please.  Can't wait to go back to this hotel.",5,2016,11,01
32,Incredible hotel,"My mother and I stayed here for 3 nights, Oct 28 -31, 2016. This is an incredible hotel. Lovely rooms and good restaurant, but they earn 5 stars due to their impeccable service. I have traveled the world and never had such incredible service at a hotel. I wish I could give 6 stars!",5,2016,10,31
32,Perfect hotel,"Perfect hotel for staying in Barcelona. Extra friendly staff, very good food, nice and small hotel. Pleasant surprises every day- fruits, candies or bisquits in room. Next time when visiting Barcelona- I will definately stay also in the same hotel.",5,2016,10,29
32,No place else.,"We usually stay in chain hotels like the Ritz-Carlton and the Mandarin Oriental. Choosing a boutique hotel was a risk. With all the reviews of this hotel and it's rating of #4 in the city, I booked it! And we were not disappointed.

Location: Right off La Rambla (short walk from the street) we were able to pop into the hotel pretty quickly. Unlike a lot of hotels that are on pedestrianized streets, this was not far from the actual car road so we did't have to haul our luggage too far. La Ramble is busy at all hours and lined with a lot of tourist shops. But because of the location, you always have somewhere to go either to eat and drink or just to browse. That's a plus if you have jet lag. 

It's across the street from the Guell Palace (Gaudi's creation), near the opera house (amazing inside), and adjacent to the Gothic Quarter (pedestrianized streets that are great to walk through).

The Placa Reial (where our room opened out onto with two balconies) was loud at night. So bring earplugs. But it was totally worth it just to feel like part of the city.

Hotel itself: The hotel is an older building that's been completely overhauled. The room (a junior suite) was a one-bedroom with a sitting area. There was a large closet and a very large bathroom (even by an American's standards). The bed was very comfortable. The sheet count must've been at least 600. And of course, the hotel has a pillow menu. Aside from the pillows they stock your bed with, you can choose from five additional options. We chose to try the Aloe pillows made of some foam that is also used in space (not the tempurpedic ones, although they have those too). And you can have your room sprayed down with a choice of 4 scents each night while they do turn-down service.

Breakfast: It was an all-inclusive meal that you can have (1) in the restaurant in an amazing lower level, (2) on the terrace on the top floor overlooking the city, (3) in the outer patio on the Placa Reial, or (4) in your room. Despite the other great choices, we opted for room service everyday of our 5-day stay. And it was amazing. The choices are amazing. Crepes, omelets, eggs any way you like including benedict, fresh fruit, fresh yogurt (with jam or fresh fruit), coffee and its compatriots, fresh squeezed juices, bacon, Iberian ham, mushrooms, broiled tomatoes, and a whole load of other stuff that we didn't try. Breakfast became our main meal of the day. Weird. And I woke up early waiting for breakfast--I've never done that before.

Service: It's a boutique hotel and of course you usually get good service at smaller hotels. But this was staffed like a large hotel. They had the same staff on duty for most days so they got to know us and what we liked. And it was nice for us to see a friendly face each time we went out and came back. They checked on how we liked each suggestion they made for places for us to go and restaurants to try. And as locals, where they would eat in the area. 

The hotel is like an experience in itself. I browsed through this little binder they provided us with about the hotel to see what the amenities were. And what I didn't expect was that the entire thing was personalized for us. From a welcome letter to details about our own stay. And there were even three business cards with the hotel's name and information on it with my husband's name (since the reservation was under his name). This was helpful since we would go out to meet people for business and if they had to drop things by the hotel, we could just give them a card rather than looking up the information online and getting it down to them. And a life saver when it came to giving the cabbies our destination. We learned quickly just to say Placa Reial since the hotel was at the main entrance for the square. 

There's a cab line right outside the hotel -- big help.",5,2016,10,28
32,A Wonderful Hotel on the Placa Reial,"My wife and I recently stayed three nights at the Hotel DO. Since our visit to  Barcelona was at the end of our European vacation, we splurged on a junior suite at this wonderful boutique hotel on the Placa Reial. The Placa Reial is one of Barcelona's finest plazas and it has its own incredible vibe.  The location of the hotel is ideal for exploring central Barcelona and, with a Metro stop a short walk away, the hotel is also perfectly located for visiting all of Barcelona's other sights.   The amenities of the Hotel DO are 5-star level and the staff are personable and incredibly attentive.  While the plaza is always bustling with activity, the hotel is very quiet and intimate.  There are a number of good restaurants with outdoor seating on the Placa Reial, but the Hotel DO's restaurant is clearly superior to all of them, in terms of menu selections, quality of food and wine and service of wait staff. Hotel DO is simply a jewel of a hotel.",5,2016,10,23
32,Luxurious and Pampering,"This is a small and highly attentive property which is expensive, but you get what you pay for.  The location was ideal for us, 20 minutes from the airport and 10 minutes from the cruise port.  The neighborhood is great (although maybe a little too noisy with some students in the Placa singing late into the night). From the moment we came toward the door we were pampered by the staff.
The  well-maintained room was large with 10-foot ceilings, a comfortable king bed, two small balconies facing the Placa, a giant bathroom with a tub and luxury shower.  There was a stocked mini-bar with the selections inside all complimentary.
There was also a complimentary ala-carte breakfast, which was excellent.
My only regret is that we booked this hotel for only one night before a Mediterranean cruise that we were taking.",5,2016,10,17
32,A must stay in Barcelona,Ditto every single review that gives this hotel 5 stars and an excellent rating.  Hotel DO made our stay in Barcelona as fabulous as the city itself.  Everything about it was first rate.  Don't think twice...just book it!!!,5,2016,10,17
32,Exceeded my expectations,"Hotel Do is a boutique hotel located on Placa Reial. It's central location make it the ideal base for a stay in Barcelona. You can walk to just about everywhere and if you need to go a bit further afield, there's a metro stop just around the corner. The included breakfast offers a wide array of choice off the menu. Each day treats such as fruit/biscuits are left in your room. Water/juice are free from the room's minibar. I needed tickets printed out and within minutes they were delivered to my room. The staff are excellent. It would be difficult to find fault with any aspect of our stay. Definitely recommended.",5,2016,10,15
32,Don't book anywhere else! ,"If you're looking for a very special and attentive hotel this is the one. The star rating is accurate, especially for such a centrally located hotel.

I was only here one night, to explain my personal experience. 

Every staff member does above and beyond, with what seems genuine want (without being intrusive).  

This is not a hotel with a view but rather a beautifully ""local"" feeling venue with the edge of quality and luxury.

Free breakfast, free sauna and a restaurant right downstairs, which on its own was excellent and fairly priced. Balcony eating space outside too.

If you want a special place to stay right on las ramblas stay here! Taxis right there, easy access to all the sights and just the atmosphere alone is a wonderful contrast to bustling Barcelona. 

A stylish, clean and decent sized room for the location with touches of subtle luxuries to make you feel very special..fresh macaroons, a fully stocked mini bar of water, juices and sodas etc.  I heard no street noise at all which was very surprising.

Good free wifi, a small safe (which you definitely need here!) big bottles of Molton Brown products so don't bring any of your own at all. A really good hairdryer so don't bother to bring that either!! 

So close to the main street that taking big luggage is not a problem and, as stated, taxis right there for an easy ride to the airport, just remember the rush hours.

A lovely surprise right off this famous street. Lots of different types of people and all staff speak English very well. Great wine list too! I definitely want to visit again. ",5,2016,10,14
32,Amazing Amazing Amazing,"We arrived here today from Paris and are so blown away already. The hotel staff is so attentive and helpful from showing you your room details to giving you recommendations for food. Only 18 rooms so you are the focus of their attention. We had complementary arrival drinks and complementary drinks in our room's mini fridge. The bathrooms are lovely and the lights and design of the room is remarkable. 

I've spent a lot of time in Bali Indonesia and the hotel almost reminds me of a Balinese spa. So nice.

Obviously it will be a bit loud-you're in Barcelona in he middle of a square :) but the amenities, the rooms, and luxury will make up for that! 

Thank you for making our first day here so special, Hotel DO!",5,2016,10,12
32,Absolutely Perfect,"This place is perfect. The perfect location ‚Äî right on La Rambla, in a the beautiful Reial plaza, surrounded by gothic Barcelona. Convenient for taxis, walking and exploring all the best neighborhoods. The perfect service ‚Äî everything was included, the most amazing breakfast every day available any time in the morning in your room or on the private rooftop. The perfect room ‚Äî perfectly designed, neat, clean and luxurious. Tall ceilings, a modern waterfall shower, Molton Brown amenities. Stay here.",5,2016,10,11
32,Five Star Excellence in La Ramblas,"My wife and I spent 5 days great days in Barcelona, staying at a gem of a property, Hotel DO.  From our initial reservation through our departure, the staff and service couldn't have been more customer-centric and personal, yet professional.  This small 18 room property is right on Plaza Real and absolutely sound proof.  Rooms are exceptional and the ambiance fits in with the old city location.  It's in the heart of La Ramblas, providing local Barcelona color and convenience to many of the sights and experiences the city has to offer.  We stayed in a Junior Suite which was spacious and overlooked Plaza Real.  You couldn't ask for a better hotel considering location and ambiance.",5,2016,10,09
32,The pampering...,We've staying here 3 nights... impeccable.... friendly... excellent service... old dog situated in a extremely busy Plaza where people visit until the wee hours of the Knights apparel the room is soundproof because we did not hear about pin drop once the antique balcony doors were closed...well recommended and strategically situated . We will definitely come back again and hopefully again,5,2016,09,29
32,Excellent hotel in great location,"Pros:  wonderful location, excellent included breakfast, one complimentary dinner and wine, fresh fruit daily, spacious room (superior double), very friendly and helpful staff, comfortable bed.  Placa Reial can be noisy all night but the double-pane windows muffled the sound.  Excellent A/C.
Cons:  The shower, which is essentially a large marble & tile room, has a slippery floor without a mat and without any grab bars.  We considered it dangerous.  Also the water is so hot that only the lowest setting was comfortable.  This is the only reason I did not give five stars to the hotel.",4,2016,09,26
32,World class,"We checked into this most popular area of Barcelona near EVERYTHING! and were instantly enthralled in so much culture and delight just by virtue of the hotel, staff and neighborhood.  Totally unique and not something a chain could ever provide.  The hotel was totally remodeled with state of the art rooms and baths.  The service was impeccable and authentic which you could never buy.  So much personality.  Loved it and will never forget this unique gem and our Barcelona experience all created from this perfect home base.
",5,2016,09,25
32,Perfect Location & Great Hotel!,"We stayed here for only two nights on the beginning of a bike trip and it is the PERFECT location for anyone who wants to be able to walk to everything on La Rambla.  We arrived very early around 9am and had requested an early check in but realized that was asking a lot. We grabbed a breakfast on the patio which was delicious and our room was ready before we were even finished. Just what the doctor ordered to catch up on lack of sleep from long flight!
The room was lovely, overlooking Placa Reial and had wonderful modern styling/amenities. Part of our special package included free tapas and champagne and also full breakfast. We enjoyed the tapas on their rooftop terrace and the breakfasts were delicious. The staff was wonderful and very accommodating. I would look no further if I were going back and would definitely recommend staying there! 5 Star service and stay.",5,2016,09,25
32,Lives up to the hype,"What an awesome hotel!  Booked a junior suite on the 3rd (top) floor.  High-end furnishings and fixtures.  Shutters and thick drapes did a good job of blocking most noise. I was there for 3 nights mid-week - the plaza was busy/noisy, but not insane.  I imagine it gets worse over the weekend.  It's surreal how peaceful this place is given it's location directly on a busy plaza - you walk in the door and immediately feel at ease.  The staff is incredibly friendly and attentive.  The breakfast was very good (get the eggs benedict at least once).  The location is excellent - everything you'd want to see in Barcelona is within walking distance.  Being on a Placa Reial makes it easy to find the hotel after exploring the city - given how incredibly confusing the streets are in the gothic quarter, this a good thing.  The hotel restaurant is good, but none of the others in the plaza are worth visiting.  There are some homeless/gypsies that hang out in the plaza, however, a firm ""no"" will send them on their way (no different than San Francisco).  The regular rooms are very small, so I would only stay in one of those if I was traveling solo.  The junior suite was perfect for two.  This place is not cheap, but you definitely get what you pay for.",5,2016,09,24
32,"excellent service, great location","Couldn't ask for a better location, close to everything!
Take breakfast outdoors and people-watch at Pla√ßa Reial.

Lovely rooms with very high ceiling (but no luggage rack provided in room). complimentary mini-bar. personalized business cards (your name with Hotel DO contact details) provided at check-in a nice touch.

Only glitch was wifi not working due to a big storm(?), and was not available in our room during our stay (supposedly was fixed and usable in the lobby, but we did not try)",5,2016,09,23
32,Outstanding Stay On La Rambla,"This Historic, yet trendy, hotel has the perfect character for a deluxe stay in the heart of the gothic quarter.

With under 20 rooms, this charmer delivers big with soaring ceilings, handsome wood counters in the gorgeous bathrooms, and quaint public areas that have the perfect mix of trend and comfort.

The rooms also feature a fully stocked mini bar which was a perfect touch!

Breakfast on the rooftop patio was also memorable and the selection outstanding.

The staff was amazing and welcoming with help whenever you need it. The hotel restaurant was also confident and offered fantastic service.

I can't imagine a more charming and wonderful place to stay in all of Barcelona.

",5,2016,09,20
32,"Nice hotel, but bad experience","The hotel is located at a quite noisy , but very atmospheric historic place in city center. You cannot sleep with open windows, masses of people are noisy till far later than midnight. Nice brakfast room, no buffet. Nice restaurant with terasse at the place, excellent servants. Room is not very spacious, but well designed.
My bad experience: By a mistake my room was booked one day earlier than I actually came (to stay for one night only). As I was not aware of the mistake, 300 Euro for the night which I did not stay were taken from my booking which i had made via booking com. I asked that this money should be taken for the night which I actually was there -  no way, they did not give in to this request. I had to pay 300 Euro for the night before I came, and 240 Euro for the night which I stayed (there they have at least made a discount of 60 Euro). Nevertheless I found the attitude of the hotel management extremely hard and unconvenient. In sum I paid 540 Euro for one  -single nght!! it is clear, that I cannot recommend such a hotel - which, by the way, was not fully booked.",1,2016,09,19
32,"Anniversary in Venice, Greece, and Barcelona 2016","We LOVED this hotel! Outstanding location.  Outstanding room. Outstanding food.  Outstanding SERVICE.  Francesca, Dayana, and Geolanhn, provided the very best customer assistance and support we have ever received from a hotel.  We would definitely stay here again.  My only comment would be you will hear sometimes very loud noise outside your window especially during the weekend by partiers.  Otherwise perfect Anniversary celebration.",5,2016,09,17
32,Top marks! No wonder they have won awards!,"I stayed here for 7 nights wth my husband for our honeymoon and can honestly say this was the best decision we made! As soon as we got there we were treated like royalty. We had a complimentary welcome drink and when we got to our room there was a beautiful chocolate dessert, free bottle of cava and a welcome card from the hotel. The room was beautiful with all the amenities you could hope for. We were given complimentary tapas and another free bottle of wine to enjoy with it which we chose to have on our first night which was majic on the terrace. The food was so lovely, we chose to have our last meal back at the hotel which was divine. The hotel is in a great location with easy access to the ramblas walking distance from the beach, shops and easy to get to all the major sites. Breakfast was brilliant. Each morning you get a basket of pastries and fresh juice and can pick whatever you like from the menu which is a lovely change from being in hotels where there is the same buffet breakfast every day. The staff were absolute stars! The front desk, resturant staff and housekeeping were so warm friendly and accomodating from start to finish and couldnt do enough for you. If you want 5 star service without the snobbery Hotel Do is the best place to stay. I will, without a doubt return to Barcelona and will not hessitate to book this dream of a hotel! Thank you for making our honeymoon so special.",5,2016,09,15
32,Almost perfect!,"We recently stayed for 8 days at the Do Reial and must say that the hotel is in an ideal location for sightseeing around Barcelona. As with all city centre hotels there are pros and cons but all in all I would stay again (room only) although I think 8 days in the Barcelona was too long.

Pros:-

Walking distance to beach, shops, market, theatres, Sagrada Familia, restaurants etc
Lovely air conditioned comfortable rooms, super beds,  great shower, quality bed linen, terrace on plaza for breakfast/meals 
Very friendly accommodating staff, nothing too much trouble
Very quiet at night once shutters/windows closed

Cons

Lots of homeless, drunks, beggars around the area and constantly approached by hawkers when on hotel terrace
Pool on roof is only a small plunge pool with four loungers
Food OKish but expensive and you can dine much better elsewhere away from the area
No lounge/bar area inside hotel apart from reception area

Tip - order your breakfast one stage at a time or it may all come at once - this also applies to eating lunch/dinner on the terrace - we ordered a selection of starters to share followed by a main course each - the main course arrived while we were still eating the starters. It was sent away and when brought back ten minutes later, it was the same food (fish) but cold!! Needless to say we continued our meal elsewhere.",4,2016,09,14
32,Easily the best hotel ever. ,"Stayed here on our honeymoon and it is easily the best hotel I've ever stayed at anywhere in the world. 
The location is very central on La Rambla which makes it really easy to explore the area on foot and saves a fortune on taxis. 
We found the staff to be very helpful with suggestions of what to see and where to eat in the local area (although we mostly ate in the hotel terrace because the food is beautiful and great for people watching!).
Because there are so few rooms the staff recognise you which does away with the usual faf which which we've come to expect. 
We found the treats left in the room every evening to be a very welcome snack before heading out for dinner. 
The rooms are well laid out with a few individual touches which set it apart from the larger hotel chains, making it feel more homely. 
When we go to Barcelona again we will definitely be staying here. ",5,2016,09,13
32,"Thank you, DO, for a wonderful stay!","My husband and I were impressed right away as soon as our taxi dropped us off at the hotel DO.  We were greeted by the employee gentleman named Jean Claude.  He escorted us and took our luggage to our room and gave us a review of the room (lights, safe box, etc.),  The room came with a small refrigerator with drinks in which we were invited to have without paying for them, this came in handy especially when you are stepping out on big tourist walks.  In addition, when we would return to the room mid day and pleasantly surprised with delicious fruits and chocolates, perfect for a mid day snack.  Breakfast was included and the pastry was hard to resist.  The breakfast was a full menu not just continental, it was very filling and delicious.  When it came to the hotel bed, I personally found the bed, pillows and sheets very comfortable.  The location was perfect as we could go anywhere of interest by walking and if not, taxi's were available right out the door plus the subway system.  If we had any questions on a tourist attraction, the staff would answer and give us suggestions and they were also able to get us tickets for museum entrances, etc.  Jean Claude was of exceptional assistance with the hotel and the area.  We also enjoyed just stepping right out of our hotel and having dinner or entertainment in the hotel or square.  We found that dinner at the DO was a sure winner with wonderful service.  There was a jazz club in the square and it also was very cool.  I added a few photos in which I have many of the fabulous time we had at the DO.  We hope to come again.",5,2016,09,12
32,One more Great Review,"Well after such praise from the other reviewers you don't need my 2 cents but here goes: 
We arrived from the US tired, hot and very Jet Lagged. The English speaking staff saw this,  immediately asked us to sit down in the cozy lobby and offered us a complementary cold drink. A cold beer was the perfect antidote to what ailed us and in a matter of a few minutes the staff had our luggage in our room, had fully completed the paperwork and presented us with our keys. I hadn't even finished my beer yet. 

This type of treatment carried on throughout our stay. The bellman remembering our names, the breakfast staff being so friendly, other equally attentive staff and many other helpful remarks, reservations, directions and in - room niceties. 

We have stayed in similar nice hotels but this level of service, attention to detail and genuine hospitality has this hotel on our ""must stay"" list. 

This hotel deserves all the nice compliments it gets and its 5 stars. You will not be disappointed. 

Jack Waghorn",5,2016,09,12
32,Great hotel in Barcelona!,"This hotel is located right off the Ramblas on the Placa Reial, making its location excellent. Windows sound proof so no noise from the busy plaza. The staff is incredibly friendly and helpful, the service great, and treated like VIPs with a drink of cava upon check-in. By booking directly through their website, we were treated to a free tapas dinner and a bottle of wine/cava served on their rooftop terrace. The breakfast was amazing - a full basket of pastries, fresh juice and anything you wanted off their full menu. Would definitely stay here any time we are in Barcelona!",5,2016,09,12
32,wonderful boutique hotel,"We highly recommend this wonderful hotel!!!  We stayed 2 nights after a cruise.

All staff were friendly and helpful.
Our room was large and very clean.
The location perfect for walking to many sites, restaurants and shopping.

We were celebrating our 25th anniversary and were pleasantly surprised with a bottle of champagne, greeting card and homemade chocolate cake.  A great experience.",5,2016,09,12
32,Lovely weekend break,"We fancied a weekend city break in Barcelona and wanted a luxury central hotel within walking distance of all the main attractions. Hotel Do delivered on all fronts. Right on the main square and two min walk to the excellent metro system or the hop on hop off bus stops meant we could go everywhere on foot or further afield as we pleased. 
The hotel itself was nicely appointed and the staff were very friendly and helpful with local advice. It's a boutique hotel so don't expect the usual massive lobbies and spa, gyms and all those other things. The square itself is very busy all night so if you are a light sleeper you might struggle. The hotel restaurant is open to the public on the square and the food is good enough to make it popular so the serving staff don't really get the chance to recognise you as a hotel guest which is a shame. 
Breakfast a la Carte was lovely. ",5,2016,09,12
32,Classy boutique hotel in prime location,"This hotel is in a great spot on Placa Reial with easy access to Ramblas, food markets and the Gothic quarter. It is beautifully appointed, has very sizeable rooms, a private roof terrace and a lovely restaurant on the square. Staff were incredibly friendly. The only note of caution is the local youth like to party all night in Placa Reial so it can be noisy some nights.",5,2016,09,11
32,Lovely hotel in the gothic quarter,"We recently enjoyed a lovely stay at Hotel DO.  The service and attention to detail in the rooms made our stay particularly memorable. Free mini bar and amenities with turn down service were lovely touches. We had a Placa facing room with cute balcony. The room and bathroom were well renovated, the bathroom was huge with a separate bath and well pressurised shower! We walked everywhere from the hotel - all around the gothic quarter, to the beach and to the cute neighbouring suburbs. The gothic quarter definitely offers a lot of lovely restaurants and bars and has a great vibe until all hours of the morning. That being said, we had no noise concerns from our room (even though it faced the lively Placa Reial) and would definitely recommend this area for its unique Barcelona vibe and proximity to everything. To sum up, Hotel DO was well located, had a lovely breakfast and excellent service. We will be back! ",5,2016,09,10
32,Boutique Hotel on La Ramblas,"Good hotel right in the middle of La Ramblas, with fine square off the main road offering bars and open air restaurants. Beautiful comfortable rooms with fine added touches of fruit and cakes and confectionery left each evening, and a free minibar of water and soft drinks. Staff were friendly and helpful, and the breakfasts on the terrace hit the spot . A good hotel in a great location.",5,2016,09,07
32,Central location and 5 Star plus service,"We stayed at this boutique hotel in Barcelona for 4 nights prior to our Mediterranean Cruise. The hotel is located in the Gothic Quarter just of La Rambla & fronts onto the popular Plaza Reial. This modern hotel only has 18 rooms, and is set in an 1856 building. On the first night we had a beautiful room on the first floor, high ceilings and fantastic views of the Plaza. Unfortunately, we found it a little noisy despite the windows being specially treated to reduce the noise level coming up from the plaza ... which goes all night. Having mentioned the noise concern to the reception staff in the morning, they immediately offered to move us up to a room on the 3rd floor away from the noise, but still overlooking the plaza. The new room was exactly of the same, except our sleep quality for the next few nights was brilliant & interrupted. The service from this hotel was first class ... friendly, caring & helpful. The breakfast was fantastic (including providing ""gluten free"" options), and you could have it in your room, in the restaurant, or up on the roof where the pool is located. Highly recommended.",5,2016,09,06
32,Superb,"Just stayed last night in this fantastic hotel having arrived from a med cruise. From the moment we arrived the staff were amazing, room on 1st floor was perfect, attention to detail on every count could not be better, dream bed, location excellent, delicious breakfast, highly recommend, 5 star & they deserve every one plus. Best boutique hotel we have ever stayed in, thank you to all for such a wonderful experience ",5,2016,09,05
32,Gorgeous Five Star Boutique Hotel in Barcelona,"We came to Barcelona to go on a cruise, and I picked Hotel DO due to its close proximity to major Barcelona attractions that we could visit before the cruise.  What a lovely hotel!  It's small, yet so elegant and classy.  The hotel opens up to a beautiful courtyard called Placa Reial full of restaurants with outdoor sitting and shops.  We had a nice clean room with the balcony on the second floor.  The staff was very pleasant.  I especially would like to say thank you to Francesca at the Front Desk and Jean Claude, the Bellhop for making our stay so nice.  They made the reservations for us at the museums, hand delivered tickets to our room, and really cared about making our stay as pleasant as possible.  I would absolutely recommend this hotel.",5,2016,09,04
32,Say Yes!  To Everything about this Hotel,"The location, the building, the staff, the view.  Odd as it may sound, I especially loved the smell of this hotel... something about the hardwood floors.  The character of the hotel and the rooms is strong - high ceilings, solidly built, the shutters on the windows.   The good news is that it is in the heart of the Action of the plaza.  The bad news is that it is in the heart of all the action in the plaza.  One night we could still hear people out and about till 5:30 AM.  A tad loud.  We had a nice corner room that allowed for two windows overlooking the plaza.    The rooftop terrace and ""pool"" are not to be missed, and are truly an oasis in the midst of all the craziness surrounding the hotel.",5,2016,08,29
32,A little gem near La Rambla,"I am not an hotel client, but I usually enjoy the restaurant of this amazing and unique small Hotel in Barcelona. I am living in Barcelona and I enjoy walking around the old part of my City. Having breakfast in the terrace of the DO Hotel is splendid. Excellent toasted bread, jam, butter and perfect coffee. You may also taste other delicious menu they offer, with eggs, fresh pastry, fresh fruit, bacon. Before lunch it's an excellent idea to taste the tapas. Good beer and wines. Calamares, humus, patatas bravas, anchovies. I have no doubt that the room accommodation is of a high standard. High quality and professional staff.",5,2016,08,28
32,Best hotel EVER,The bar staff. The hotel staff. Our breakfast service on the roof. The view. The location. The bed. The shower...I could go on and on! The best place ever! We are going back and not soon enough! Thank you for an amazing experience. This is the most first class groups that we have ever stayed with. We have been to almost 20 countries and most more than once. ,5,2016,08,28
32,Hotel Do made our last night of our honeymoon in Barcelona AMAZING!!!,"My husband and I had a wonderful honeymoon in Barcelona/Girona/Costa Brava!!! I booked our last night in Barcelona at the Hotel Do. Hotel staff made us feel very welcomed from the moment we walked in. They treated us like honeymooners and we appreciated this tremendously! Cava and tapas, bottle of Cava and delicious dessert delivered to our room, cookies and fruit when we returned to our room after dinner, and a wonderful breakfast the next morning. The view of Plaza Reial from our room was amazing! Our room had everything we needed and more! Complimentary mini bar stocked with water, juice and soft drinks. The bed mattress, linens and pillows were the perfect recipe for a great night's sleep! I highly recommend this hotel for a honeymoon or any other occasion. ",5,2016,08,27
32,AN EXCELLANT HOTEL IN A GREAT LOCATION,"We stayed at HOTEL DO from August 16-August 21, 2016.

The hotel is in a fantastic location. Its right next to the southern end of Las Ramblas on Placa Reial square.

There were cabs always present within 25 yards of the hotel entrance. So getting around town was a snap. Incidentally, cabs in Barcelona are very reasonable compared to other major cities. Also, the cabbies are friendly! A pleasant surprise.

The hotel has only 18 rooms. The reception area is basically a chair and desk in front of the main door. This is a minimalist hotel. It is not a grand hotel like the Waldorf Astoria or Pierre in New York. Yet, despite its simplicity it works and it works very well.

We stayed in room 22 on the second floor. The elevator to the room is also small, it only holds 4 people, but is handsome and there was never a long wait.  The room itself was simple but elegant. We had a balcony which overlooked Placa Reial. The view was great. Watching the young people party into the night was interesting. They usually stayed by the fountain in the center of the Plaza until dawn.

The room was exceptionally quiet. I believe the windows were soundproof. At least they certainly kept the noisiness of the square out of our room. The bedding is simple but very comfortable. The ceilings are vaulted and must be 20, yes 20 feet high. The bathroom was also understated. The shower had fantastic water pressure.

The hotel advertises free breakfast. However, this isn't your typical free breakfast of coffee, cereal and stale doughnuts. You are formally seated and provided with an extensive breakfast menu. Freshly baked croissants (baked by the hotel staff) and other pastries are immediately served at your table. Coffee, juices and a variety of teas are also available for breakfast. Eggs are prepared a number of ways. Crepes are also available on the breakfast menu. My point is the breakfast was first class and would have cost us almost 50 euros every morning to get a comparable breakfast somewhere else. 

There is a pool on the top (4th floor). However, its not much bigger than a hot tub. I didn't really see the point of it. 

You can also eat breakfast and dinner on the top floor which we did not experience because we were perfectly happy to have breakfast with great service on the lower floor. 

You can also eat breakfast, lunch and dinner directly on the square which is a lovely shaded area with a cool breeze. Great for people watching and lots of local entertainment. Try the Cava sangria. Delicious and refreshing.

In sum, again this is a minimalist hotel. However, our stay at this lovely hotel was most enjoyable and I will certainly stay at Hotel Do when we return to beautiful Barcelona.",5,2016,08,24
32,Really bad experience,"Very disappointed. Not sure how this hotel has made it to #4 unless there are fake reviews on here. Please save yourself and don't book this hotel. There are great alternatives for ""high end"" hotels such as Alma and the Ritz Carlton and we wished we would've stayed at one of those hotels instead. 

First off we were on our 2 week honeymoon in Europe and this by far was our worst stop. We were so excited to go to Barcelona, but this hotel really ruined our experience in Barcelona. 

Even though the location is ""good"" because it is central, we wouldn't recommend staying in this area. This area is great to pass by one day, but you don't want your hotel here as it is extremely dirty, smelly and surrounded by drug dealers at the corners of the hotel. We would've much rather walked 2 blocks and not been in such a dirty/smelly part of town. We have never had so many drug dealers approach us at night (at the corner of the hotel.)

Breakfast outside on the terrace was disgusting because the floors smelled like piss. The food was good but we lost our appetite and couldn't finish our breakfast. We asked to move to the rooftop to have be, and they said we have to pre-book it.

In the room, there was dust and small little hairs in the corners of the room, which was disgusting.

By our second day we raised our concerns that it is our honeymoon and we want early checkout and would even pay one night penalty, and they said no. They told us that management doesn't like early checkout, and told us we could pay 170 euros to go into a bigger room. Are you kidding me?! On top of it all, we asked to talk to the manager, and she was out, so she was supposed to call us when she came to the hotel, but surprise surprise we never got a call from her.

All in all, horrible experience. The staff has attitude (except for one guy who brought up our bag and showed us around the facilities).  The only positive is the food quality (both breakfast and room service).

Don't get fooled by the positive reviews on here. 

We usually do our research and don't complain, but this was def our worst hotel owe have stayed in along time.

32,Incredible experience,Coming to Barcelona?  Stay here.  I am in the hospitality business and was continually impressed by the staff.  They went above and beyond in every instance to make our stay enjoyable.  Rooms were modern and clean.  Some of the best restaurants in town are just a short walk away.  What's not to like.  Value for the dollar is exceptional.  Don't miss an opportunity to stay here if you are in the city.,5,2016,08,19
32,Chic and convenient,"I have stayed at a number of hotels and private apartment rentals in Barcelona and this has become my favorite spot. I had an absolutely wonderful stay at this gorgeous boutique hotel. I was immediately struck by the chic and unique decor and received impeccable service throughout my stay. There lots of incredibly helpful and thoughtful amenities, with the in room mini fridge of beverages being particularly crucial after an epic night out. The restaurant was great for both breakfast and dinner. Very much plan on staying again.",5,2016,08,18
32,Perfect way to start a vacation!!,"I stayed in this beautiful hotel last June, it was great to be able to get to a delicious bed after an intercontinental flight! Friendly staff , the best, and I mean the best breakfast in Spain! and I travel for a month in this beautiful country... Great location, in las Ramblas!
highly recommended.",5,2016,08,12
32,Such a lovely hotel!,"We enjoyed 3 nights in this charming hotel on the Placa Reial. All the staff were extremely helpful and accommodating. The location was right off Las Ramblas, which was great. Awesome breakfast was included... Great dinner on the rooftop terrace. We loved the free drinks in the minibar, the sweets and fresh fruit which arrived daily, the pillow menu and even a choice of room fragrance! Amazing attention to detail. Excellent shower and great amenities... Highly recommend Hotel Do for your next visit to Barcelona!",5,2016,08,11
32,Lovely Rooftop Meal,"Popped in to this hotel seeking food.  The very courteous staff found us a table where we enjoyed superb tapas and cocktails.  The terrace had a wonderful atmosphere.  Subtle lighting, and understated decor. Not the cheapest, but certainly the best food we had in Barcelona",5,2016,08,11
32,One of the best. I highly recommend a stay here,"A great boutique hotel with a central and exiting location. We stayed for two nights. Already by check-in we felt welcome and comfortable. As we arrived late we tried the restaurant as it looked good and was convenient. It was great. Both food, service and wines were to our liking. Not to mention the buzzing life at the Placa Reial which forms a great show.

Room was big and bed was comfortable. And for me being a seasoned business traveler, the little extra in the shape of business cards, printed up with my name and the hotel's address and contact details stood out from all the rest.

We recommend this hotel and hope to come back soon.",5,2016,08,11
32,Boutique Hotel Extraordinaire!,"This is one of those very special hotels that makes you feel so at home, so comfortable and well-taken care of that you actually think about planning another visit to the city just so you can stay here again. 
Although they have just 18 rooms, this hotel doesn't feel cramped or small; the high ceilings and huge windows make it seem like a much larger space, yet with a sense of calm and intimacy that will sooth any weary traveller. They even have a small rooftop pool (don't expect much, it's tiny but hey, you're in the city in an historic building), a bar at the top with gorgeous views and a Spa with massage and facial services.
The hotel is located in an old historic building and rooms have beautiful hardwood floors and the original ceiling beams and details. But the hotel is just four years old so everything was refurbished and renovated and very clean and luxurious. The bathrooms are wonderful‚Äîdouble sinks; great lighting (a detail so important and yet so often overlooked in hotels); a full bathtub AND a full separate shower stall; commode with its own full door so more than one person can use the bathroom at the same time; Molton Brown toiletries; huge thick and soft monogrammed towels; and a heated towel rack. 
In the room, the beds are terrific and they even have a pillow menu so you can choose the sort of pillow you want, and a room scent menu as well. Drinks in the minibar are all complimentary so you can refresh yourself without spending a fortune. And a sign of the exceptional service was shown when I left the room and came back in the evening to find that the exact same drinks I had consumed that afternoon has been restocked.
The hotel has an excellent location, right off the Las Ramblas pedestrian mall and just steps away (and overlooking) the beautiful and popular Pla√ßa Reial. 
I just wish that more hotels would be like the Do and offer such fantastic facilities and service.",5,2016,08,10
32,Best hotel experience!,"Hotel DO is a small boutique hotel in a perfect location. The staff is incredibly attentive. They helped us get tickets to attractions and even assisted my friend when her luggage was lost by an airline. The breakfast included with our room was delicious and could be eaten in the room, on the plaza or upstairs on the terrace overlooking the city. The room was very comfortable and the bathroom was a treat!  I would go back in a heartbeat!!!",5,2016,08,05
32,Wonderful Stay,"The service is great in the hotel, as I also stayed in Arts Hotel the club level . The staff weren't as  helpful and nice as DQ hotel. The staff are the most amazing.The location is in center of town everything is walking distance. I loved how cozy it was. The only thing is that the rooms are a bit small specially the 1 person room. Would recommend the bigger room even for 1 person. The rest was great.. Thanks to the amazing staff. ",5,2016,08,05
32,Elegant Hotel,"Wonderful stay at this Elegant Hotel. Romantic setting.  Beautiful rooms which are well appointed. Very responsive staff.  Very nice extras to make sure stay more enjoyable. Excellent restaurant here at the hotel.  Great breakfast, great tapas bar,  and excellent room service. The  location is close to local nightclubs, bars and various restaurants and scenic attractions.  Would highly recommend to anyone.",5,2016,08,04
32,Perfect hotel for sightseeing!,"Beautifully decorated boutique hotel in the heart of many of the popular tourist destinations.  Very good service and beautiful room.  A bit loud outside at night on the weekends, from all the activity.  Although it didn't bother me, this is not the hotel for someone looking for silence at night.  I would definitely stay again.",5,2016,08,04
32,Beautiful Boutique Hotel in Perfect Location,"My husband and I spent one night at the Hotel DO during our honeymoon, and we could not have been more pleased with our experience.  From the moment that we checked in, we were given the warmest welcome and treated with the utmost care.  

This was our first trip to Barcelona, and after narrowing down the hotel search to the Gothic Quarter, I happened upon the Hotel DO website. Everything seemed to fit what we wanted - an intimate hotel, modern amenities, excellent location. It truly turned out to be the most delightful place!

The location of Hotel DO is fantastic, just on the corner of Pla√ßa Reial, and steps from Barcelona landmarks like the Palau G√ºell. It is possible to walk to other popular sites like Sagrada Fam√≠lia and Park G√ºell, but there is also a taxi stand just outside of the hotel which makes it very easy to catch a quick ride. 

The dining at the hotel is also excellent. We were greeted with welcome cocktails and tapas which we enjoyed on the hotel's terrace overlooking Pla√ßa Reial. The breakfast was divine with an extensive menu of delicious options. We also enjoyed a bottle of cava on the rooftop which was the perfect way to end our 24 hours in Barcelona. 

We stayed in an 'individual room' which was, as the hotel confirmed upon booking, very small. If we had stayed for more than one evening, I would have certainly upgraded to a higher room category. For our purposes, however, the room was perfect. The bathroom was much larger than I expected, with an excellent rain shower and Molton Brown amenities. The minibar was also complimentary, stocked with water, sodas and juice.

We will certainly be back to Hotel DO and can't recommend them enough to future travelers looking for a nice, convenient and charming hotel in the Gothic Quarter.",5,2016,08,02
32,A luxury retreat in the busy gothic area,"Hotel Do was the perfect place for me as a woman traveling sola in a busy city. The location was perfect for walking the city, right on the most beautiful historic Plaza Reial. My room was comfortable with touches of extras that showed just what true hospitality and care means; fresh fruit and sweets in the room each day, an amazing breakfast, cava and tapas on the patio and the roof top pool to cool off. There is noise from the street, but the closed shutters reduce it to white noise at night and it lulls you to sleep unless there are too many kids singing at the fountain in the square.",5,2016,07,30
32,City break ,"Excellent boutique hotel. Romantic and ideal for couples. Fantastic location right on placa reial off la rambla, within walking distance of all sights. Hotel restaurant offered a good choice of food, breakfast was amazing too. Plenty of good restaurants close by as well as bars and clubs with live jazz and dancing. Hotel staff were also able to help us with getting tickets to go to see a football match. ",5,2016,07,30
32,A superb hotel in a fantastic location ,"We have just had a most wonderful week in Barcelona staying at Hotel DO.

I can't imagine there are many better hotels in Barcelona, it was a wonderful position just off La Rambla on Parca Reial only a short walk from all the attractions around the Port Vell area.

It is a truly 5* experience too, the rooms are not massive but very well appointed and well sound proofed (important given how busy the square gets).  The beds are very comfortable too and we all slept very well.

Try to get rooms on the 3rd floor as they are quieter.

The neatest part is the free mini bar for soft drinks.  A nice touch.

The staff are amazing, very friendly and helpful.

When we return to Barcelona we will definitely stay here again.

",5,2016,07,30
32,"Good Deal, Good DO.","Our stay at the Hotel DO, was a fine and awesome stay! -- very glad we had a discount for it that my wife found at: bit.do/hottlr

Impressive service along our stay, great room & staff, very helpful and willingfully amicable.

Fod was good and depletable, with much choices available to us.

Our room was fine and comfy, clea, and tidy.

In a word, it was a great deal for all of us.",4,2016,07,28
32,Wonderful Boutique Hotel,"Hotel DO was perfectly located.  The Placa Reial, one of the prettiest in Barcelona,  was at the doorstep of the hotel and shared a terrace.  The Las Ramblas-on the other side, was touristy and would avoid.  The Hotel Staff including Sara, Francesca and Guille were extremely helpful, cheerful and made our stay that much more enjoyable.  The rooms were well appointed, and very comfortable. The breakfast choices were tasty and the tapas and drinks were perfect after a day of walking Barcelona. Love the charming atmosphere of this hotel.  Would definitely stay again.",5,2016,07,28
32,Great hotel - perfect staff!,"Simply put, Hotel DO may be the best hotel I've ever stayed in.  The location is great - a bit noisy, but that's what you get when you're in the middle of everything.  The rooms are comfortable, bright, and provide everything a traveler may need including plenty of space in the bathroom.  

Breakfast is complimentary, and that offers anything on the breakfast menu - no upcharges for beverages, side items, etc.  It is served in the hotel restaurant which is also open to the public, but the staff is so attuned to their guests that there is no hassle with signing for breakfast, providing a room number, etc.

The room offers a mini bar where everything is complimentary - water, juices, soft drinks.  In addition, each room is brought an afternoon snack each day - again, complimentary.  

All of these perks would be enough, but the staff is what makes Hotel DO truly special.  They don't approach their job as accommodating guests, but rather as hosting them.  They anticipate needs and take care of them before asked.  Simply outstanding!",5,2016,07,28
32,Our stay at Hotel Do,"What  a wonderful hotel! 5 star all the way. Guest room was beautiful, excellent quality of amenities in room. Beds were great, linens so luxurious and great selections of pillows. Staff were very kind and helpful  Breakfast served on the square was very good and made to order. Placa Reil was very crowded and a lot going on till all hours of nite, but when shutters and drapes were drawn noise not a factor. Bathroom was designed so well, shower and toiletries top notch. Overall a wonderful stay, well worth the price!",5,2016,07,28
32,A wonderful place to stay,"We recently spent a long weekend in Barcelona and decided on Hotel DO. We were very happy with our stay! The hotel staff was excellent. Reception was perfect at every moment of the day. They accommodated our early morning arrival by checking us in quickly and efficiently, taking our bags and then delivering them later in the day when our room was ready, and seating us for a much needed breakfast. The politeness and courtesy of the staff was perfect, they always had a smile and were always helpful with anything we asked. 

Our room was real nice, we were on the top floor across from the rooftop bar. It had a little pool on the patio that was real nice. The room itself was clean and well attended to during our visit. 

The restaurant was ""good"". The food was fine, the service was mostly good. Some of the servers were excellent, a few weren't quite in prime time yet. But overall, it was fine.

I would definitely stay here again, and I strongly recommend it for others.",5,2016,07,21
32,Great Time,Highly recommended if you want to be in the center of things. Hotel appointed beautifully and staff was excellent. Had the suite with the private pool on balcony which was nice. Would definitely stay again next time in Barcelona.,5,2016,07,21
32,"Very interesting Place, Great Location","Lovely Hotel very clean with nice bedroom, friendly and helpfull  staff, we ate dinner in different restaurants in the Plaza for the couple of nights, we were there but would not recommend any, the hotel breakfast was very good we had a room overlooking the plaza which was a very busy spot day and night but the great window they had keeped any noise out ,if you wanted to hear the music you just opened the window",5,2016,07,19
32,A diamond in Barcelona.,"Every nice thing said about this hotel previously is true.
We stayed two nights pre a cruise and one night after. The hotel is located near by La Rambla at Placa Reial. Nice spacious rooms with a free minibar stocked with non alcoholic bottles. Every night there were small nice treats as fresh fruit and chocolate. Nice bathroom with good amenities, separate shower and wonderful fluffy towels.
The reservation included a welcome bottle of wine, tapas and a wonderful breakfast. The staff is Incredible, we were treated as royalties - nothing was too much trouble. 
We will definately come back and recommend the hotel to others.",5,2016,07,18
32,Outstanding location for a chic hotel!,"There are many hotel options in Barcelona and location is one of the most important considerations when selecting a place to stay.  Hotel DO directly on Placa Reial is hard to beat.  The building itself is very old, as is the entire Placa, only one block from la rambla.  The inside, including the rooms have been expertly remodeled in a contemporary but classic style.  The rooms themselves are very roomy with large luxurious bathrooms, furnishings and amenities.  Given the location on a rather busy square I was surprised at how quit our room was in the evening.  The rooftop bar offers a nice view of the square and all of the surrounding area.  I would recommend Hotel DO for anyone looking for a unique luxury experience in Barcelona instead of the normal luxury chain hotel experience.",5,2016,07,15
32,Amazing hotel,"We stayed 4 nights with our 13yr old son. The staff were incredibly helpful & divine. The room was beautiful, beds superb & they even sent up a bottle of champagne & cake for my birthday - very thoughtful! Great area to explore from - walk, train, bus. We would stay there again anytime.",5,2016,07,14
32,Wonderful short stay ,We spent three nights is a very comfortable well appointed room overlooking the square. The staff was superb and quick to satisfy. The complementary breakfast was full continental and prepared to order. Roof top dining and late sunsets made this a place to return too. ,5,2016,07,14
32,Best shower in 6-week trip in Europe,"I've wanted to stay here for years because my husband and I really like eating in their restaurants.  Since it's right on Placa Reial it can be a little noisy if you leave your windows open. Great service and location, terrific food in all restaurants, really affordable and extensive wine list.   And the best shower ever!!  Our traveling companions agreed. Not inexpensive but worth the price.",5,2016,07,13
32,Really great and well located,"This hotel is a boutique 5-star in a very bustling central part of the city. It only has 18 rooms and we stay in the least expensive - it was really great. Soaring 14 ft ceilings, great bed and i must say an awesome powerful shower ;)

Our reservation included a welcome drink (awesome) and breakfast.  The breakfast was lovely and your prime seating facing the main square is great. 

Service was great. Free (good) internet was included.

The ""spa"" is a sauna, not a full spa with massage, etc.....

Feedback to management:  Loved your hotel but felt the terrace wasn't used well. I think it's because you can't really sit and look out if you eat. It's prime real estate and I think you could get a lot more out of it.",5,2016,07,13
32,Incredible hotel...but don't go on these days,"The service and the location of this hotel is absolutely top notch. The entire staff was incredible and we will definitely stay here again.  Breakfast is exceptional.  The little extra touches from the turn-down service with sweets, the welcome drink, the birthday cake delivered to the room make this one of my favorite hotels in Europe.

My only advice is to avoid Barcelona on June 24th (The Feast of St. John) as the entire city is launching fireworks all through the day and night and no amount of soundproofing will help.  Additionally we happened to be in town the same time as a Rugby Championship match was being played and all the fan support were partying, chanting, singing in Placa Reial until the wee hours of the morning (5am).  Needless to say a good night's sleep was a bit difficult during these days.  But still, even with the the noise, we were extremely happy with the hotel.

One recommendation for the hotel is to start outside breakfast service earlier than 9am.",5,2016,07,09
32,Boutique Luxury Done Right.,"Hotel DO: Pla√ßa Reial is outstanding. Local: ideally situated in Ciutat Vella (old town) Barcelona, this hotel and our room overlook the
Pla√ßa Reial. Friendly, courteous, and professional staff treated us as if we were royalty. Rooms were outstandingly appointed: 5-pillow menu in the room, loaded (complementary) fridge full of juices, waters, and soda. Attentive staff responded to all the requests. 24 hour parking 200m from hotel (not included, but very convenient). Walking distance to most old town attractions. Picture cannot to the atmosphere and ambiance justice!",5,2016,07,09
32,Gloria H.,"Awesome staff! Beautiful hotel, delicious complimentary breakfast. Great location, conveniently located near all sights in the heart of La Rambles. Easy access to public transportation. Would definitely stay again. Room was spacious, well appointed and included a free mini bar.",5,2016,07,06
32,A wonderful place to stay!,"Hotel DO has a wonderful staff. They do everything to make your stay there as comfortable and enjoyable as possible. The modern fixtures, rooftop wading pool, views, terrace cafe, restaurant, and all the amenities make this a wonderful place to stay. The location couldn't be better and we'll definitely return!",5,2016,06,30
32,Amazing hotel right in the middle of it all,"This is a brilliant hotel. We can't rave enough about it. Everything is right about it from the rooftop wading pool overlooking the Placa Reial, down to the basement restaurant and large local wine list. Location is right on the Placa Reial - yes it's touristy - but it's a perfect base for exploration into the Barri Gotic and beyond. 10 min walk to Picasso museum, 5 min walk to Liceu. The staff are very helpful, polite and genuinely interested in your stay. From the time we checked in and were led to our room (overlooking the square) through to our departure when they stamped and mailed our postcards as we were running late, nothing was too much trouble. I should point out that although it overlooks the square, the soundproofing is top notch.  We didn't hear anything when the windows were closed.

Our room was decent size and tastefully done, with comfortable bed. The non-alcoholic minibar is re-stocked twice a day, as well as the room service staff undertaking turn-down in the late afternoons, along with either fruit or pastries. For us, everything in the minibar was included in the price, which makes a pleasant change from being bilked $8 for a water at a lot of places. 

The shower is AMAZING. It's huge, and includes a bath (but they're still separate). Rainfall shower head plus hand-held, and extremely good water pressure. Bathroom is spacious too actually with a big sink and two faucets.

We had breakfast on the square each morning and it's a comprehensive menu, coffees are skillfully made, croissants especially light and delicate. There's a restaurant downstairs too but we did everything outside as it was summer. The rooftop (it's only about 6 stories high, same as everything in the Placa) turns into a restaurant in the evenings, and there's also four deck chairs and a small wading pool. Really great as we seemed to be the only people using it in the late afternoons when the sun was overhead. They'll gladly bring up a bottle of wine in an ice bucket too.

Overall - thanks for a wonderful stay, we can't wait to come back.",5,2016,06,28
32,Beautiful hotel with great location and super friendly staff,"We were only able to book for one night at Hotel Do (we didn't realize it was the San Joan festival and almost all hotels in Barcelona were fully booked).

It's on Las Ramblas, the busiest street in the city, many restaurants and shops close by and in walking distance to the Gothic Quarter. The hotel itself is very cute, staff is super friendly and helpful.

I wish we were able to stay a few more days at the hotel. I will definitely stay there again next time I visit Barcelona.",5,2016,06,28
32,I Don't Want to Leave,"The Hotel DO is a fantastic boutique hotel located in the heart of old Barcelona. I love this hotel and everything about it.  The room was wonderful (we splurged and got a room with a balcony). The staff we enthusiastic and helpful.  Every night we trusted them for dinner reservations and we had all hits!  Breakfast was good and included.  To me, this was an oasis in the middle of a great city.  Honestly, it deserves a sixth star.  This hotel for me is why I like to travel. ",5,2016,06,28
32,Wonderful stay,"The hotel is very well situated, right on the Placa Reial. We stayed in a double room on the 2nd floor, with a window overlooking the pedestrian side street. Even though we were there over a weekend, we were never disturbed by any street noise. The room included the amenities as described on their website, and the room was spacious, light, and well appointed. A fruit treat (apricots, pears, and peaches) was left in the room every afternoon and a sweet treat was left for us every evening. The breakfast was included in our rate and included a menu with just about everything you might want. We also booked through the hotel website and had tapas and a bottle of wine included (both of which were a nice treat). The hotel is also a few feet from the taxi line. But most of all, the staff were fabulous! Everyone was friendly, helpful, and very professional.",5,2016,06,24
32,Perfect place to stay in Barcelona,"This is a great hotel in the heart of the Old City, located on an amazing square or placa.  The service was great, the room was extremely comfortable, and the roof top setting for swimming and breakfast was perfect.  If you want to stay in the Old City, this hotel is perfect.",5,2016,06,20
32,Ultimate Luxury Boutique Hotel,"Location on the Placa Reail, steps away from Gothic Quarter and Las Ramblas. Hotel DO provides a level of service I've never seen in the U.S. Beautiful historic building, renovated for comfort and convenience. We will return to this property! Loved it!",5,2016,06,20
32,Hotel Do....WOW,"My partner and i have just returned to the UK after a Spanish trip that included, as a treat, one night in Hotel DO in there El Terrat room. From the moment we arrived we could not have wanted for more. The staff were friendly and attentive with nothing been too much trouble. The building itself was very impressive in a great location been just off Las Ramblas and overlooking Placa Reial a location we had visited previously. The room was fantastic....very modern and very well equipped with a free minibar for non alcoholic drinks, great coffee machine and a fantastic large bed. Even the bathroom didn't disappoint with a great shower, Molten Brown accessories and great fluffy robes & slippers. As we went on the balcony to the room things got even better.....our own plunge pool, sunbeds with fresh towels and seating area, everything you could want and great for watching the night sky whilst the world goes by just below you. When we returned to the room after a night in Barcelona we found fresh fruit and chocolates waiting for us as well as the following days weather forecast....a very pleasant surprise. The massive bed gave us both one of the best nights sleep we have had and we both woke up fresh for a busy day in Barcelona which of course starts with breakfast. Included in the room price was a treat of a breakfast.....fresh orange juice, pastries, ham, cooked breakfast (great quality fresh ingredients), all topped off with tea and coffee...superb, all served in the beautiful placa reial square watching the world go by. What more can we say this place was amazing and we can't wait to return.",5,2016,06,19
32,Perfect small hotel in  good location,I chose this Hotel as it is near to the Liceu theatre ( 2 minutes walk away) It is just off Las Ramblas in a lovely square  and with easy walking distance of the Gothic Quarter and the inner harbour.  Very welcoming helpful and efficient staff  and a comfortable if fairly small room but with a great view over the square. Breakfast cooked to order rather than milling around a buffet . Apart from breakfast We didn't try the restaurant which is downstairs in the basement but the terrace bar is a nice place for a drink some tapas and people watching. Not cheap but excellent value for money.,5,2016,06,17
32,Luxury in an ideal location,"My partner and I stayed here for three nights recently.  On check in you are given a file with all the information you could possibly need about the hotel and which included business cards with your name printed on!  We had a double room which looked onto Calle Colon and we could see Placa Reial from the lovely, shuttered balcony.  The hotel was originally a grain store and has been sympathetically restored by the owners so there are many original features. Our room had an extremely high, beamed ceiling - our bathroom door must have been twelve feet high! Luxurious furnishings and Molten Brown toiletries.  The shower was very powerful and the towels white and fluffy.  There was a mini fridge stocked with non alcoholic bottles of coke, orange etc, which was topped up daily.  After a day's sightseeing we came back to fruit in our room and then after dinner came back to chocolates, sweets or biscuits, a lovely touch.  What makes this hotel outstanding is the roof terrace, where you can have breakfast or dinner or just a drink and listen to the hustle and bustle of the square below.  We loved the small pool where we sat for an hour soaking up the sun in the evening.  There is also a sauna/spa which we didn't visit. Every evening you get a weather forecast left in your room for the following day.  Breakfast is served in the restaurant on the ground floor before 9am or after 9am it is on the outside terrace.  Breakfast is superb, a full menu and you can order as much as you want - ours was included in the room rate.  We had three lovely leisurely breakfasts watching the world go by the the square.  The pastries especially were delicious.  All staff were welcoming, friendly and helpful as well as English speaking.   Placa Reial is full of restaurant and bars and as has been mentioned in previous reviews, there is some noise late at night.  We were so exhausted this didn't really bother us but if you are a very light sleeper it could be a problem.  We tried a couple of the restaurants in the square which to be honest were mediocre.  The best evening meal we had was at the hotel where we sat outside, fantastic food so do try it.

We took the sightseeing bus one day which starts at Placa Catalunya, a 15 minute walk up La Rambla from the hotel, a good way to see the city.  A 20 minute walk in the other direction takes you to the harbour.  We found the Metro system very easy to navigate.

We would definitely like to visit Hotel Do again one day, for us there is no where else to stay in Barcelona!",5,2016,06,16
32,Lovely Hotel in Great Location,"We stayed at Hotel DO for 6 nights during our Barcelona vacation. The location is fantastic, very centrally located. They offered many amenities including daily fresh fruit and free mini bar non-alcoholic beverages. The patatas bravas are the most delicious in all of Barcelona. Many people have commented on the noise. I will say that we were on the 2nd floor facing Placa Reial and it was a bit loud, but not unbearable. We recommend this hotel.",4,2016,06,15
32,Truly a five star hotel.,"My wife and I stayed five nights at the Hotel DO in June, 2016.  The staff were warm and welcoming but without any pretense. The food at breakfast was outstanding, as was the dinner we had in the restaurant.  Their pastry chef produces croissants and other baked goods which are incredible. The location is perfect. Hotel DO Placa Reial is recommended without enthusiastically as a truly outstanding hotel. It has our highest recommendation.",5,2016,06,15
32,just DO it!,"This is a great boutique property. Full length wndows offering great views of the square. Loved that the fridge was restocked each day, unlike other hotels which offer full mini bar fridges full of over priced items which don't get drunk. If you can, include breakfast, as it is simply amazing, Quality and quantity.",5,2016,06,10
32,Boutique Hotel Central to Everything,"The rooms are quite nice with a comfy bed and luxury linens. The bathroom is almost as large as the room with a rain shower and separate bath tub. The mini bar is well stocked with lots of non-alcoholic beverages and is fully complementary.  The location is central to Barcelona's many attractions, especially nightlife, just steps from the Ramblas, one of the most ""happening"", if albeit touristy, boulevards in Barcelona. The other edge of this sword is that it can be busy, and noisy, into the wee hours of the morning. TIP- closing the shudders will block out most of the noise. The staff and service is excellent. They also have a small roof top deck and pool for hotel quests only.",4,2016,06,10
32,We Love This Hotel,"This is our second visit, with a 3rd already planned. I travel to Barca often & have stayed in 6-7 other hotels. But this is my favorite, esp when we travel together. The staff is the best, the location is the best, the rooms are lovely, and the shower has amazing water pressure!  
",5,2016,06,05
32,wrong location,"the hotel its a small boutique with clean room. we left pretty much upset because of the incredible noise at night and day. you are in the centre of rambla and in a square where people dance and sell beer all night long. too much noise all night long. i have been attacked one day but they didn't manage to steal anything. this is not fault of the hotel obviously. the staff its good but have been waiting more than 10minutes for a map information, they should add moe staff. overall good/normal",3,2016,06,01
32,elegant hotel in great area,"We loved every aspect of this hotel.  We had the junior suite, which was awesome.  specious room, comfy bed, great bathrood (2 shower heads), nice treats on your pillow after a full day of touring the city.  Great breakfast.  And very centrally located.",5,2016,05,29
32,Great hotel bad location,"This is a jewel of a hotel for anyone like me that hates large hotels. The service is impeccable. The staff especially at front desk are wonderful. The b'fast on the terrace weather permitting is more than enjoyable before starting the day. The Nespresso in the bedroom is wonderful and the mini bar is complimentary. I cannot say anything bad about the hotel itself.

Unfortunately the hotel is in Plaza Reial and the noise from the plaza is a nightmare till 4:30 am during the week and till 7 am during weekends. If you are ready to party go for it. If you need a good night sleep take ear plugs and you will enjoy your stay.
",4,2016,05,28
32,Birthday treat,"A lovely hotel in the middle of the old town that made a fantastic base to explore the city and experience Barcelona. A beautiful room over looking the square in which we enjoyed a welcoming glass of cava while we went through a useful welcome pack before setting off on our first walk around the old city. Food was great, and the staff very helpful. A complementary cake and bottle of cava on the birthday in question really made for a memorable break. Would thoroughly recommend this hotel and we look forward to going back.",5,2016,05,28
32,SUPERB IN EVERY WAY!,"Our first time to Barcelona.  Stayed in many high end hotels - but this Boutique Hotel exceeded any place we've stayed in.   Staff are exceptional at customer service.  Coming back to the hotel after a day out was like coming home.  The hotel is so clean, nicely appointed rooms and very charming.  Breakfasts included are excellent....so many choices.  Location is wonderful. When we come back to Barcelona - we will see you!  Thank you Hotel DO and many wishes for continued and well deserved success!!  The Rutherfords from Canada",5,2016,05,25
32,Fabulous Boutique Hotel,"We stayed at Hotel DO at the end of April for two nights - if only we had been able to stay for a week.  You are made to feel so welcome from your very first moment and the hassle of travelling is forgotten as soon as you arrive.

The room we had was tremendously comfortable with full length windows which looked out over Placa Reial.  Luxuriously high quality of bathroom essentials along with lovely touches in the bedroom including wonderful cakes and fruit delivered for an evening snack, what more could you want?  Do eat in their restaurant whilst people watching in the square as the food is incredible.

The staff really make this small hotel extra special and nothing is ever too much trouble. I would be very disappointed if we could not return one day.",5,2016,05,20
32,The DO is OMG Great!,"Luxuriously appointed, spacious room, great linens and bedding, smart rooms with adequate air conditioning.  These all scratch the surface, dig deeper and you find unparalleled service, kind and helpful staff, and amenities and even more amenities.  A restocked beverage fridge that's complimentary, a full breakfast and I mean full, complimentary wine and tapas on the terrace on our first night as a welcome.  

The rooftop has a small wading pool and an oasis for laying out or cuddling up with a book.  

I couldn't recommend more highly.  ",5,2016,05,19
32,"Wow. Simply, WOW!!!","First time in Barcelona, with the love of my life, and wanted a really good place. Expectations were high, but DO managed to top them by a great margin. We stayed on the second floor, with a small balcony to the side street (noise was never an issue).
Everything was perfect; the reception, the in-house bar, the restaurant (had great dinner there one evening) and breakfast.
After this visit there is only one place for us to stay in Barcelona. Hotel DO.",5,2016,05,12
32,Gorgeous Boutique Hotel,"This is a gorgeous boutique hotel with only 18 rooms. We stayed in what I think was there smallest room as we were only there for 2 nights prior to joining our Mediterranean cruise. 
The hotel is in a fab location right on The beautiful Placa (plaza) Reial and also a step from La Ramblas. You can not pick a better spot for all the action. 
The only downside was the nightclubs blouse close at 6am, so the noise of patrons leaving is a wake up call. Maybe reinforce the glass to ensure its soundproof. 
Otherwise this is a perfect hotel. ",4,2016,05,09
32,Ideal Weekend Break,"Lovely hotel and seems to have retained an Old-world charm. A little unexpected upon arrival as no reception just a small desk in the corner but staffed by very helpful and friendly people who suggested some walking routes and restaurants as we had arrived a few hours early and our room was still being cleaned. However, once we did get in to the room (suite 2nd floor) it was ideal, spacious, clean, well stocked with `quality` bathroom products and with a min-bar with free (never had that before) soft drinks. Only had breakfast in the hotel, once in the basement restaurant and then in the outside dining area, both times the food, choice and service were faultless. They really know how to deliver quality here.  

The adjoining square, Placa Reial, has numerous (average) restaurants and a couple of small (and numerous really BAD `Oirish` bars) nearby and the area does get noisy. The square remains noisy from late at night until the following morning and does get irritating. In hindsight, we would have preferred (recommended) a room on a higher floor away from the noise of late night / early morning revelry. 

Nothing to do with the hotel, but you really have to watch your pockets in Barcelona. Pick pockets and scammers abound!

Overall, the hotel location is great and just far enough away from busy Les Ramblas main street. Spotlessly clean hotel, great service and excellent breakfast, fairly good for a drink outside in the evening too. My wife can recommend the Mojito!",4,2016,05,09
32,Really Reial or Royalty treatment for Real? ,"So, Gaudi lives in this square ( see the lamps in the square  ) but inside DO, YOU are royalty. Room 321 faced the square, was more than adequate in space and offered a large bathroom. It was quiet with Windows closed and offered nightlife noise when opened.
Impeccable taste went into this now 4 year old, 18 room hotel renovation. Killer beds. The restaurant on the lower floor is stunning. While the 4th floor was closed due to spring season the summer months will make this a go to spot to cool off in the small pool.  We did not use the spa. Food on the square was adequate and tasty but the breakfast was perfecto. We booked directly and received the inclusive breakfast which was essentially what ever you want. Impressive. Also, Unlike US hotels mini bar was included for soft drinks. Great after long walks in the Gothic area which where you are. Rambla is outside  your door ( skip it really ) with all the main areas of old city within footsteps. 
But, the best part about DO is the staff. Attentive and always willing. Could not be more impressed with a staff, especially in this size facility. GO DO? DA......you will be treated like royalty in the place that is royalty. Worth the price. ",5,2016,05,03
32,Tiny room with no view.,"Hotel very well located on the Placa Reial. Well decorated, helpful & friendly staff. Food is good & the service is excellent. On the downside was my room, it was tiny & clostrophobic (a few square metres)  & definately unsuitable for 2 people. The room has a frosted widow overlooking a small courtyard used for stocking beer barrels & crates of bottles! There is no space for your luggage & just  a small  workspace just large enough for a laptop. The bathroom is spacious & nicely decorated.",3,2016,04,28
32,"Fabulous breakfast, service and location","I loved my stay at Hotel DO. Service was personal and exceptional. Nice touches like a piece of fruit in the room each day when returning from sightseeing, and a sweet treat at night on the return from dinner. The breakfasts are cooked fresh for each guest; there is a terrific plate of homemade croissants to start.

Make sure you book a room overlooking the plaza; for two people. I was in a single which looked onto an air shaft. The room was small but perfect in its details, but the air shaft meant I never opened the frosted window and did my emails in the lobby -- which is small but richly appointed. I saw into a few rooms facing the square, however; they were bright and airy and I would certainly come back and book one next time.",5,2016,04,27
32,Great location,"Overlooking a lively square,but close the windows and the rooms are wonderfully quiet.The lovely touches made us feel most welcome including hand made chocolates,pastries or fresh fruit delivered each evening.The included breakfast was delicious with plenty of variety.Close to all of the major attractions and close to train stations for day trips.",5,2016,04,21
32,My single best hotel experience,"The staff were delightful and responsive. The square is off the Ramblas and a perfect location. Despite the chaos of the Ramblas Hotel Do is a peaceful haven with the most beautiful rooms, extraordinary staff, and comfortable accommodations. There seemed to be no request that could not be met, and done so quickly. I do advise the top floor if possible. Others have commented on the noise and I did not find this to be an issue despite being very sensitive to noise (though I do typically sleep with earplugs). The free breakfast was lavish and comprehensive including cava, meats, cheeses, egg dishes, and delicious pastries.",5,2016,04,18
32,First class all the way!,"I have stayed in several 5 star hotels, this is the best so far and that says a lot. Each evening we were treated to fruit or homemade cookies or chocolate covered strawberries or truffles! The breakfast was incredible, you can have anything you want from the menu, it is all included. This morning I had the eggs Benedict and yummy! The hotel staff is friendly and very helpful. The location can't be beat, close enough to stop by during the day for a drink from the free minibar. Molten Brown amenities to boot! I will give the sleep quality a lower score because, the outside area is alive until early morning and the noise was a bit much.",5,2016,04,17
32,Amazing hotel,"Just off La Rambla on a lovely square is Hotel Do.  The team on reception , in the restaurant/bar, the porters and housekeeping are all brilliant. Very friendly and helpful , nothing was too much trouble. Our room overlooked the square which was great to people watch and the shutters helped block out any noise. The room was spacious with enough wardrobe and drawer space, the bed very comfortable and the power shower very good.It was my husbands birthday ( a special one) the day we arrived and treats to celebrate had been delivered to our room when we got back that evening - a lovely gesture. The hotels location is great providing easy access to many of the cities attractions and you don't need to leave the area for some great restaurants ( including the hotels). Ask the hotel for recommendations and they will help with ticket bookings which is worth doing as we wouldn't have been able to visit Sagrada Familia and Parc Guell if we hadn't booked. I agree with all the positive comments about breakfast. A great city and a perfect hotel.",5,2016,04,17
32,"Awesome Hotel, Perfect Location and Welcoming Staff","Having never been to Barcelona before, I looked at many hotels and reviews and picked the Hotel DO. A decision that turned out to be perfect. The Hotel is right off of las Ramblas, so you literally walk out the door and you are there. The Placa Reial was great - ton of restaurants with outside tables where you can eat and people watch.  The Hotel itself is so beautiful - the room looked smaller on line than it actually is.  The bathroom just knocks you out. Bed was amazingly comfortable (I am picky about beds due to back issues).  The staff was so warm and friendly - just going out of their way to assist you in any way they could. I bought some tickets on line but did not have a printer and they immediately printed them out for me and delivered them to the room within minutes.  The food there was great as well - the breakfast was beyond amazing!!  And you could order it and they brought it to the room, so you could take your time in the morning while getting ready to head out.  Honestly when I go back to Barcelona, I will not even think twice - it will be the Hotel DO for me!!   Francesca, Sara, Guille - all of the staff were just beyond friendly and helpful. They made you feel so welcomed and seemed just waiting to assist you in any way possible!  Some previous reviewers said it was loud, but honestly, with the windows closed, we did not hear a thing. The Placa is a happening place during the day and night, but it did not bother us in the least and the first night we were on the 2nd floor and had absolutely no issues with any noise.  The Hotel is first class, but not snobby at all.  I wholeheartedly recommend this hotel and hope to have the opportunity to stay there again in the future!",5,2016,04,14
32,Divinely Decadent Do!,"Step inside Hotel Do and you are immediately transported back to the early days of Hollywood glamour!  You expect to catch a glimpse of a sashaying Hollywood Starlet dripping in jewels, or Fred Astaire himself sauntering through the lobby!  It has the most decadent lift which surely comes straight from the movies!  The staff are all wonderfully courteous and helpful. The breakfast menu is never ending and superb. The food here is amazing.  As for comments I have just read about the place being ""noisy"".... Hotel Do IS right in the heart of Barcelona.  There is NOWHERE in Barcelona that is NOT noisy!!!!  I cannot recommend Hotel Do highly enough! It is sheer luxury and has the ""Wow Factor"" in gold bucket fulls!!",5,2016,04,14
32,"Fantastic, but noisy, hotel","We just visited the Hotel Do and having never been to Barcelona, I relied on reviews to pick this hotel.  It is a beautiful hotel.  The rooms a modern and lovely.  The staff couldn't have been nicer and the included breakfast was amazing. The included, stocked in room mini bar was a nice feature. But what amazes me is that not one review mentioned the noise!  It was the noisiest place I've stayed.  Having never been to Barcelona I wasn't familiar with this area and I now realize it is the center of the action.  That is fun and great, but it would be a wonderful added feature if the hotel would add soundproof windows!  With the nonstop action of the Spaniards this was a noisy spot round the clock.
So if that is not an issue for you, than this is a fantastic place.",4,2016,04,13
32,"Perfect location, fabulous service!","First and foremost the staff is absolutely wonderful! The location is perfect for getting around the city. I just got a standard inside room and it was great for me. The bed is very comfortable ... the rain shower magnificent ... the bathroom spacious. Complimentary breakfast that is magnificent. I didn't see until I was leaving that there is a complimentary drink at night on the plaza. 

They leave a piece of fruit and sweet treat in your room every night which is a delight. Free juice and water and soft drink refrigerator in the room. 

They also leave something that tells you the weather for the next day.

Something very nice ... in the packet of information in your room you get several hotel business cards with YOUR name on it. Take it with you if you need to get back via taxi. I walked or took the subway everywhere though.

I highly recommend this hotel and will stay there the next time I am in Barcelona.",5,2016,04,13
32,Fantastic Hotel....Fantastic Location!!,"My family and I just left the Hotel DO and all I can say is what an amazing place!  If you like smaller, boutique hotels, it is the place to stay.  We had a Junior Suite over looking the Plaza and our room was superb!!!  Words can't accurately describe how modern, yet cozy, yet beautiful it was.  Free breakfast was delicious...especially Eggs Benedict.  Free mini bar and wifi was a nice touch as well.  The hotel staff was very friendly and accommodating. On our last night there, they kept the kitchen open past hours and served us a delicious meal.  Location of hotel is excellent...walking distance to many things.  Without second thought, I would stay here again upon returning to Lisbon...Loved it here!!!",5,2016,04,10
32,Pricey but well worth it,"Booked in for two nights. The situation is superb with easy access to transport and right next to La Rambla. Double glazing in the bedroom minimised the late night noise from the Placa Reial. Staff very helpful. The room, overlooking the Placa, was superb with all amenities you would need. Our breakfast was included as well as a ""free' minibar. Would certainly stay there again",5,2016,04,10
32,City break getaway for 30th birthday ,"Excellent location, breakfast was amazing - can chose what ever you want from a great menu. Had eggs Benedict 3 times (though eggs are a little runnier than normal so asked for well done=normal runny egg at home!). Staff so friendly, requested a bottle of wine and cake on arrival for boyfriends birthday at no extra charge. I booked the room
with terrace and pool, weather was too cold to use pool and they had their own pool right next door so no need, terrace was perfect though. Only negative is they don't have a jacuzzi, sauna is very small only 2 people in at a time. Full proper spa facilities, bigger pool and sunbathing area would make this a 5 star rating from us! 
Great stay, Jean Claude is a gentleman! ",4,2016,04,07
32,Room for improvement,"Centrally located, ideal for the Liceu (the reason why we were in Barcelona) or the lively Ramblas and Boquer√≠a Market. The hotel is in a converted old building, on the lovely Plaza Real. Unfortunately the end results of the conversion are far from pleasing. Narrow entrance, small lift, dubious decor. The size of our room was adequate, but the chunky, modern, rustic, uncomfortable furniture was totally unsuited and made poor use of the space. Horrible ""art"" on the walls in our room, marginally less horrible in public spaces. The bathroom, long and narrow, had a large sheep trough in lieu of washbasin (certainly not user-friendly!) and to use the (dark) shower one needed to have the lights on. Unfortunately it was then necessary to close the shutters of the window, as there were only flimsy net curtains and one was in full view of the people in the office opposite, a short distance away. Free wi-fi and mini bar and a decent breakfast were good points, as was the good service in general.",3,2016,04,01
32,One of the best hotels we've ever stayed at,"From the minute we walked into Hotel DO, we felt welcomed and pampered.  Barcelona was our second stop on a 5 city adventure through Spain and Hotel DO was far and away the best hotel we stayed at along the way (which included other 5 star hotels...)  

The front desk was always present and helpful; I try to speak Spanish whenever I can, but when things break down, they all were able to speak fluent English.  Breakfast was AMAZING and included in the rate. 

Our room was beautifully appointed, comfortable and the bathroom was very large and modern.  Water pressure was great and turndown included snacks and treats with bottled water, etc.

We also received massages the day before leaving and the service they use is professional and courteous.   

The hotel is located well and walkable to most large attractions, including La Rambla, Pedrera, Casa Batllo and Sagrada Familia (if you're a big walker like we are).   

When we return to barcelona, we'll be sure to visit our friends at Hotel DO!",5,2016,03,28
32,Perfect Hotel,"My daughter and I stayed here during her spring break.  The hotel was great!  We had awesome view of the square and the room was very spacious.  The staff was very attentive. Each morning we were greeted warmly by the wait staff in the breakfast room.  On the second day they knew who we were and eagarly seated us. The reception staff helped me purchase and print tickets to the Sagrada Familia and helped me with an issue I had with my flight tickets. They were able to translate my ticket for me and help with questions I had regarding translating my paperwork. We had a early flight and they even packed a small breakfast for us to enjoy on our way to the airport.  Every member of the Hotel staff always greeted us with a smile and were very accomidating.Each night we returned to our room we had a special treat waiting for us, fruits and chocolates.  I will stay here when I return and will tell all my friends to stay here too!",5,2016,03,24
32,Barcelona Anniversay week,"Really great Hotel room with a balcony overlooking Placa Reial, could listen to the hustle & bustle or shut the windows and enjoy the peace in the room.
Great service and we had breakfast included which was a joy to sit in the sun in the morning and have a made to order breakfast everyday.
everything was within easy walking or metro distance, couldnt have been better.",5,2016,03,20
32,Probably the best hotel in Barcelona,"We staid for a long weekend and loved every second of it.
 
The location, the service and the room, was all e Outstanding! 

The hotel itself located in a beautiful old structure, on the main boulevard (Las Ramblas)  and has a roof top over viewing the city.",5,2016,03,14
32,Excellent boutique hotel in the heart of Barcelona,"We stayed 2 nights and we rated this boutique hotel very highly. The staff are a highlight - very friendly and competent. Could not be faulted-so good that we decided to eat in the hotel restaurant which was very good. The room #15 was excellent, great large bathroom, TV, some amazing touches including a personalised business card. Really well located on the Placa Reial and thus so close to all the gothic attractions. Only downside was some late night noise from the square as patrons left in the early hours. So many small touches - this family run hotel has really thought it through. ",5,2016,03,06
32,Super location,Have been to Barcelona many times and without doubt this is the best hotel we have stayed in there.  The location is perfect.  While there is noise from the square this is expected as you are in the heart of the tourist area.  Staff very friendly and super breakfast each day with lots of choice from a full menu.  Room was lovely with some lovely touches.  We did not have a small balcony which was a disappointment and I will make sure to request this if booking again.  Lovely terrace and plunge pool on the roof which must be lovely in the summer.  Hope to return again.,5,2016,03,05
32,Wonderful ,"My husband and I have just returned from a 3 night stay at this hotel . Boutique at its best ! Lovely touches, very helpful staff , beautiful location and a real treat . We enjoyed breakfast in our room over looking the square on 2 mornings ...at no extra charge !
Would thoroughly recommend ",5,2016,03,02
32,Wonderful ,"Such a beautiful hotel, centrally located. Staff are incredibly helpful. 
The rooms are beautiful too with lovely views across the square. The breakfast is amazing and was wonderful in the room.i highly recommend having breakfast in the room. 
A lot of lovely little touches around the hotel, the use of the sauna, the Molton brown samples, the room pillow menus, the aroma menu, the mini bar and fresh fruit/chocolates in the room each night were lovely touches. 
 My only issue with this hotel is the noise. We were staying underneath a room which was being refurbished and the hotel started work on the room from 8am, which when you're on a lesuirely break is not what you want. We did call down on the first day and were told the noise was coming from next door and they would request the noise to stop, which it did. On the second day we tried to call but the noise continued.
Despite this I would stay here again other than the noise issues it was one of the best hotels I've stayed in. ",5,2016,02,28
32,Lovely hotel in very central location,"Made very welcome by very friendly staff.  Welcome drink while we checked in. Loved the central location and while the square is noisy, this is to be expected and once the window was closed the room was quiet.  Very nice touches with chocolate treats and fresh fruit left daily.  The free minibar although we only used the water was also nice.  I was disappointed with our 3rd floor room as there was no small balcony only a small window.  The website gives the impression that all rooms have a small balcony.  We did enquire but the only other room available was a suite which was priced out of our range.  One other little annoyance was that the 2 small miniatures of Molton Brown had already been used and were only half full - however there was a plentiful supply in the large fixed bottles in the shower.  Breakfast was excellent and overall we had a lovely experience and would return and will make sure I request a balcony!",4,2016,02,22
32,Beautiful hotel in a great location with a long long list of thoughtful amenities!,"We just left our week long stay at Hotel DO. The entire trip we felt we had won the lottery, going at an off time of year, we got so much for our money. The highlights listed below:

-Free mini bar with juices, soda, and bottled water
-Free breakfast-- not buffet style but a la carte off of a two page menu. Hot items, fresh fruits, fresh orange juice, coffees, etc. 
-Free Wifi
-There is a pillow menu!
-In-shower designer toiletries (Molton Brown shampoo, conditioner and two body washes attached to the wall)
-Beautiful bathroom with VERY strong water pressure from an awesome shower head
-Fresh fruit left in the room every afternoon
-Turn down service including closing the shutters on the balcony to block the light, various delicious sweets like truffles, marshmallows, chocolate covered strawberries, cocoa dusted nuts EVERY NIGHT! :) Definitely the highlight of our day to see what goodies they left us haha
-Helpful staff-- at the last minute we realized we hadn't printed tickets to something and called down to see if they had a printer. They did not but they said if we emailed the PDF to them they would print. We headed down five minutes later and they were already on their way up to us with an envelope of our tickets. 
-Wonderfully convenient to the gothic quarter, Born, and the waterfront. A subway is nearby for those going to Barca football games (as we did!) and a taxi stand is right outside. 

We walked around the entire city, almost every neighborhood. And there wasn't a single hotel that we thought ""oh this is in such a nice location and looks beautiful, we should've stayed there"". Everytime we saw another hotel we thought ""we're so lucky we chose Hotel DO""

The catch:
The Placa Reial is beautiful. But it can be noisy. We weren't bothered 5 out of the 6 nights and slept totally fine. There was one night that we were already having trouble sleeping and some drunkards decided to make a whole lot of noise at 5am. We're not super heavy sleepers and I actually usually need a noise machine to sleep which we obviously didn't have. But if you're already prone to not being able to sleep or are a particularly light sleeper then I guess proceed with caution because obviously there is nothing hotel staff can do other than being apologetic. It is the nature of city living and could likely happen anywhere in a lively city (we would know being from Brooklyn). 

We highly recommend the hotel to anyone looking for a beautifully appointed hotel with great amenities.",5,2016,02,21
32,Barcelonas hidden gem,"What a fantastic hotel, excellent service. Nothing was to much trouble. I was travelling with my sisters to celebrate my mother 80th Birthday. The hotel is full of charm located in a fantastic square off Las Ramblas. Its within easy walking distance to the harbour, the bus stops and plenty of good shops. The food at the  Hotel Do is superb and they have a very well stocked bar. I will be returning again.",5,2016,02,21
32,Great experience,"A cute, cosy and modern hotel. It's so charming, yet elegant. It's located in a great spot- short walk to most places or a short train ride. Best of all is its impressive service. You feel at home. I couldn't recommend it enough. It added to the great experience of being in Barcelona. ",5,2016,02,20
32,Birthday Trip,We stayed at Hotel Do to celebrate my mother's 80 th birthday. Nothing was too much trouble for the caring staff. We had a wonderful time. The hotel is fabulous as is the location and food was wonderful. Location is just offals rambles in a lovely square with a fountain and lots of restaurants/bars. Our double room was lovely with a large bathroom with a walkin shower and separate bath. Free minibar with soft drinks which was appreciated after a day out in Barcelona. Lovely building and square and a great place for a special stay -loved it.,5,2016,02,19
32,Couldn't ask for more!,"From the moment we arrived to the moment we left we couldn't have had a better experience at a hotel. It has gone straight to the top of my favourite hotels in the world, a large part because of its amazing location so unbelievably convenient, it's beautiful decor and charming rooms, but most importantly the staff. Such great service from the moment we arrived, many hours earlier than we expected to be greeted with warm smiles, a great cup coffee and the surprise of being checked in early, we really felt at home for the all too brief time we stayed here. I would give it 6 stars if it was option. A real pleasure and many thanks for having us Hotel DO!",5,2016,02,15
32,Great hotel for the weary traveler,"We stayed here on our first and again our last night in Europe and I have only good things to say about the hotel. Staff are very helpful and speak good English, free breakfast is convenient and tasty, and we enjoyed the free beverage upon arrival on the outdoor seating right on Placa Reial.  The king bed felt extra large and was very comfortable, the room spotless and free wifi was available throughout the hotel.  Front desk staff are happy to call you a cab and assist with your bags, recommend restaurants and direct you to anywhere you want to go. The location is very central to many sights, including a wonderful food market.  It's a bit pricey but you are in a world class city.",5,2016,02,06
32,Exceptionally Beautiful  ,"We stayed in the superior double-room 12. Conveniently right next to the lift on the first floor. We were taken to our room and shown around and given a personalised book with all the information needed. We had a small balcony that looked out onto Placa Reial. Although a bustling square, the shutters and doors keep the sound out of the room. 
Every evening we were delivered fruit and one day we had marshmallows left on the bed. Every evening we were left a menu and the weather for the next day. The menu is only if you want to eat in your room, don't fill out if going to restaurant. We needed a wake up call and bang on 7am the phone rang. Everything I needed to know I got the answers to, including maps, the best pizza place for my son, best shops, meeting points for activities etc. We also got a welcome drink. 
Couldn't have asked for a better service, the gentlemen in reception were exceptional and all the staff were friendly and kind, even down to the housekeeper.
The breakfast included in the price was amazing, pastries and fresh orange juice standard, plus a wide range of breakfast to suit everyone, from Cereal to Eggs Benedict. 
The features in the hotel are exceptional, from the drum tables, the lift, staircase, lights, seats. Very quaint reception, heated seating outside, the waiters and waitresses looked very professional. The free mini bar was a god send for my teenage son. The free toiletries means you only need your toothbrush and toothpaste. Overall we had an incredible experience, thank you all for making it a wonderful memory!",5,2016,02,01
32,Best hotel on our 3 week journey through Spain!,"Although this hotel is on the busy Placa Reial square, you would never know with how incredibly quiet it is while inside this hotel.  We were greeted with two glasses of Cava as we were rolling our suit cases up to the hotel after a very long travel day from Phoenix.  Now, that's the way to start a vacation!  We found our room spacious, beautifully decorated and we both slept very well on the comfortable bed.  We also enjoyed the goodies that were left each night for us to enjoy.  The staff was extremely helpful, accommodating and genuinely nice.  The location is superb.  Across the street from the La Rambla and right in the Gothic quarter.  Close to fantastic restaurants.  One other great benefit to staying here is the superb breakfast we enjoyed each morning, included in the price of our stay.  We will be back!",5,2016,01,27
32,What an Amazing Experience!,"Staying at this hotel was the best choice I've had during my last trip to BCN, the rooms are amazingly need and cozy and spacious at the same time, all the small details about their hotel is amazing, starting from a gift dish everyday from different  fruits, and sweets. till offering the breakfast to be delivered to the room without extra charges. also everything in the fridge was included in the room fare, and refilled upon request. In addition to that they were understanding when I had a mistake in my reservation and helped me so much.  I really loved this hotel and I'll never choose any other hotel if I came back to BCN again. That's all nothing compared to the amazing location of the hotel, near the Catalonia square and Elcorte Engles which is the best place for shopping. and near the Hop-on-Hop-Pff busses. In general, it's all what you can hope for in a Hotel.",5,2016,01,26
32,Fantastic hotel,"Hotel Do is a fantastic hotel and we recommend it highly. The location is perfect for walking throughout this vibrant section of Barcelona.  The hotel interior is brilliantly styled. Our room #24 was a Superior Double and was very nice, very spacious and overlooks the courtyard. On the weekends there is a great deal of partying by young people in the courtyard which does produce some noise, but the shutters and doors to our terrace did a great job minimizing the noise. Could be an issue for light sleepers, but it was not offensive to us. The Hotel Do staff were wonderful, especially the front desk team that went out of their way to help with visitor information and purchasing of tickets for local attractions on our behalf. The restaurant downstairs offers a great breakfast that was included in our room rate with many different options to choose from on their menu. The restaurant also offers room service and with a simple phone call brought coffee to our room each morning. Restaurant servers were excellent.",5,2016,01,25
32,Wonderful hotel,"My husband and I stayed at the Hotel Do for 4 nights in January. There was not one thing about the hotel that we could find fault with   The hotel,and the room were outstanding, the food particularly the breakfasts were amazing. The little extra surprises in the room at night were great  Thank you to the staff who went out of their way to be helpful and friendly - David, Ruth, Reynald and Galin.",5,2016,01,18
32,"Great service, great location","Room was great!!! Spa Bathroom, everything is top of the line. We just got off Viking Cruise and was spoiled to the top...This hotel was an excellent choice. B'fast was unbelievable!! Service was excellent!!I'm going back to this place",5,2016,01,16
32,"Excellent Food, Excellent Staff and Very Comfortable","The Hotel Do is right by La Rambla. We had a window that opened to the outside with a view. It was a little noisy because there was a holiday that day/night. It really didn't bother us, though. The location couldn't be better. Just a 10 minute cab to Sagrada Familia and Gaudi Park. You're right at the Gothic Quarter, which is a great place to stroll. The beach is nearby. I walked. It's right on Placa Real. Very easy to get to and the cab ride is about $25-$30. There is no shuttle, which is too bad. We arrived close to midnight and there was no problem getting a cab from the airport to the hotel. The room was very nice, but not big. The bed was extremely comfortable. The bathroom was a very good size, the water pressure and hot/cold worked perfectly. The front desk and everyone in the hotel was very nice. Breakfast was included‚Ä¶ I had the best chocolate croissant in all of Italy and Spain. So good! So was the rest of the food. I didn't go in the pool because it was December. Close to public transportation. There is a bar and WiFi is free. When I go back, I will stay here and try the pool! I highly recommend staying here.",5,2016,01,08
32,Great Location Great Service,"We stayed for 4 nights this past week. Everything was excellent. The staff was very attentive to all of our needs. Whenever we needed something, from getting museum tickets, train tickets, etc they responded immediately. The breakfasts included everything. On the final day we were leaving early and they prepared a meal with lots of items for us to take on the train.

The place was visually appealing and very conveniently location in Placa Reial right off of La Rambla.

32,"Yes, do the Hotel DO, if noise doesn't both you","So tantalizingly perfect, it aches me not to give Hotel DO the 5 star rating I so very much wish to give, and which it deserves on so many aspects. The room, the ambiance, the staff, and the food - some of the best you can find in Barcelona (or anywhere else, for that matter). The many excellent reviews by my fellow former inhabitants of this fine property give detailed testimony on all of the wonderful qualities you will find here, and they are all true, so I won't waste your time and mine with additional flowery adjectives. The unfortunate aspect of a stay at Hotel DO is the noise. The outside noise, from the 24/7 revelers who congregate in Placa Reial is a well known issue that has been pointed out by many previous reviewers. This, we were prepared for. However, what hasn't been adequately highlighted, and what we weren't prepared for, is the issue with internal noise from adjacent rooms and the hallway. The walls/floor/ceiling are surprisingly thin. You will hear, fairly clearly, the residents and hotel staff going about their businesses on the other side of your room's walls. While we knew we could deal with the relatively monotonous background noise that comes from a mass of people socializing outdoors, the intermittent and jarring noise of individuals moving around, opening/closing doors, and dropping things on wood flooring is a different story. I believe that telling residents to wear earplugs, as one reviewer suggested, is not a valid way of shifting responsibility to the patron for a deficiency inherent in a ""product."" Who goes on vacation so that they can wear earplugs to bed? That's silly. Be aware that there is significant noise, from multiple sources, that will affect sleep quantity and quality for most people. If you're ok with that, I urge you to stay at Hotel DO.",4,2016,01,07
32,Honeymoon,"By far the best Hotel Experience ever. Wonderful staff who are helpful, friendly and always available for a chat. The location is awesome, very central and vibrant. Worth every cent. If you get a chance for a swim and meal on the roof I highly recommend it. Breathtaking view and an unmatched photo opportunity. Fresh pastries for breakfast are hard to top.  ",5,2016,01,06
32,Wonderful Staff and Hotel,"We stay from the 23rd to the 29 of December 2015. The entire staff was terrific and always with a smile with genuine interest in our comfort and well being. The airline lost our luggage and for 2 days they are very helpful and accommodating in helping retrieve our luggage. The room was very nice, comfortable and well appointed.  Location perfect right on La Rambla but very tranquil .  Some of the best meals we had in Barcelona were at Hotel Do. I highly recommend.  Having been all over the world this is the first time I cared to write a review.",5,2016,01,04
32,New Year,"Outstanding hotel with personal service. This small hotel is situated in a great location for exploring Barcelona. The room and all amenities were as expected in a 5 star hotel, however what sets this hotel apart is the service. Bravo - Hotel DO , we appreciated all that you did for us.",5,2016,01,04
32,Wonderful Boutique Hotel,"We stayed as a New Year break, having read the excellent Trip Advisor reviews. The hotel lives up to the reputation which it has gained with superb service and excellent attention to detail. It is in an ideal location for exploring key sights and the waterfront. ",5,2016,01,01
32,Great hotel,"Amazing hotel with attention to details. Staff was great, rooms were awesome, and location is perfect. Breakfast buffet was good and neighboring square gives plenty of dining options. This is an amazing hotel and we would highly recommend it.",5,2016,01,01
32,Wonderful!,"Perfect location.  Terrace restaurant is ideal for sipping wine and watching the world go by   Friendly, efficient and attentive staff.  Ideally located, you couldn't wish for a better location.  Placa Reial is a welcoming oasis from the hustle and bustle.  On Sunday's there is a antique coin collectors market which was lovely.",5,2015,12,28
32,Loved it!,"I stayed here for 2 nights over the weekend with my husband. I was already in Barca for a work trip (and have been here previously) so on the Friday evening the client dropped me off on Ramblas and I trotted into the hotel lobby. This hotel only has a few rooms so booking ahead is an absolute must, but its location on the Plaza Real is absolutely perfect. Close to all the sights and the beach but away from the crazy. 

Our room was on the 3rd floor and although it didn't have any outside space, it was large and extremely comfortable. The minibar was well stocked and the bathroom was huge with a great shower. 

At breakfast you can go downstairs onto the square or eat in the rooftop area - if you want the rooftop you need to tell them the evening before so they can have it all ready for you. We did this on the second evening and had it to ourselves. It's an a la carte breakfast and the cheese and ham toasties are an absolute must! 

As we were there at end of September it wasn't quite hot enough to go in the pool so I was glad I hadn't paid the extra for the room with the plunge pool (which I had been considering) but I imagine this would be have been ideal in high summer. 

If you want to go to the beach at Barcelonetta it's about a 15 minute walk round by the port. Likewise the market is 5 minutes and the metro also about the same, and from there you can easily get up to Parc Guell. We did try to walk all the way back from the Parc but had to metro the last couple of stops as we'd been walking for ages (it's all downhill in a straightline but well over an hour to get back). 

Overall this is a stylish and classy hotel with fabulous service to match - I would highly recommend. ",5,2015,12,23
32,l love this hotel ,perfect view .. wonderful breakfast.. relaxing atmosphere.. high quality bed sheets.. you can have your breakfast in room .. free suna for 45 minutes.. the staff help you .. free mini bar for every day .. nice doctorate.. warm ac .. they have trace in each room ,5,2015,12,10
32,Lovely Hotel Do,"My husband and I stayed for 5 nights at this family-owned hotel. We loved everything about it--the location, the aesthetic, the comfort, and the warm and helpful staff.  We were out and about in the city for the majority of our time in Barcelona, but coming back to the hotel was always a pleasure.  There were so many special touches we enjoyed: a bed so comfortable that my husband with back issues approved; lovely toiletries; a special treat waiting for us in the room each night--cookies, figs, candy; the minibar was always stocked and included in the room price.  There are also myriad good restaurants close by, and the location is a really good base for walking the whole city.  We loved it!",5,2015,12,10
32,"Location, location, location.","I think most reviewers have covered the salient points for this hotel.  So the points that mattered to us:  The security is excellent, you cannot access the hotel rooms unless you have a room card to operate the lift and the staff make it their business to get to know and recognise you.  The location cannot be beaten.  Situated in between La Rambla and Placa Reial, it makes it the ideal place for the metro, taxis almost outside the door and several of the Walking Tours start in the square. The Terrace restaurant is situated on the square and the food is the best in the area.  What better place to eat and enjoy the free nightly entertainment.  In the rooms, I even had a choice of pillows, to ease my neck problem and give me a comfortable night's sleep.  Barcelona is a vibrant city with people enjoying themselves until the early hours, so if you are a light sleeper, take earplugs.  If not, go out and party with them.  A special mention for the staff, Jean Claude, Raquel, Antonio and all the others who made our stay a very special way to celebrate our anniversary weekend.",5,2015,12,09
32,Gem in Barcelona,"The staff at this hotel are all professional and provide excellent service to ensure your stay is perfect. And this is quite an accomplishment considering there are a lot less staff than in large hotel chains. The rooms are nicely decorated and spacious and make you feel as if you were in your own room at home. The beds are super comfortable and have high quality linens - perfect for after a long day walking about Barcelona The bathrooms are large and offer Molton Brown toiletries.  WiFi is free in the room and so was the breakfast, which was really good.  You can order off a menu that provides everything you could possibly want for breakfast instead of having rubbery eggs from a not so warm buffet dish as found at other chain hotels.
Plus, the hotel location is in a safe neighborhood and close to shopping, quality restaurants, and most sightseeing.",5,2015,12,01
32,excellent hotel,"We had excellent service from arriving to departing, the room was excellent, the location was so central and easy to access everywhere.

Could not fault the staff, very friendly, family run hotel, nothing was too much trouble. We ate breakfast in the hotel which had a very varied menu and had an evening meal which was excellent and lovely sat on the outside of the hotel looking onto the square which was buzzing.

We will definateley recommend to family and friends and will return again when we get the chance as there is so much to see and do.

32,Very special place,Very convenient boutique hotel at the Plaza Real. Convenient location to many of the city‚Äôs neat attractions and restaurants.  The staff was very cordial and interested in service and that includes the basement restaurant staff where we had a daily included breakfast.,5,2015,11,13
32,Absolutely Excellent,"What can I add to what has already been written?  In addition to everything on the breakfast menu being included in the price, so was WIFI and the contents of the minibar plus fruit and dessert delivered to our room every afternoon.  The Eggs Benedict were the best I have had anywhere.  The concierge booked tickets to the Flamenco dancing for us - same day - and we had excellent seats second row centre stage.We loved everything about our room, the staff, the location.  Book it if you can!",5,2015,11,11
32,Great Hotel in Barcelona,"Lovely older, but up dated hotel right on Las Ramblas. Great location. The bathroom was awesome! Very modern and quite large by European standards. Our room was also quite large with a flat screen tv, desk & chair. We also had a safe & mini fridge. 
Breakfast is included in the room rate, & ordered from a breakfast menu, with lots of choices. And the staff were really wonderful. The cafe faces Pla√ßa Reial, & you have a choice of the outside cafe, or the inside, very "" Old country"" looking restaurant. 
I give 5 stars to the hotel and the hotel staff!",5,2015,11,07
32,Wonderful boutique hotel,"Stayed 5 nights in mid-October, and had a suite on the corner overlooking Placa Real.  The room was comfortable, the bath was great and the room was quiet even though the plaza is busy all evening.  The staff was very helpful and the food (breakfast was included) was very good.  The location can't be beat...just steps away from La Rambla, a few blocks from the waterfront, just beside the Gothic Quarter, and there are another 10 restaurants right on the plaza.  It is not cheap, but received good value for the $.  Would stay there again.",5,2015,11,07
32,Visited for a conference at Barcelona university for 4 nights.,"The staff are very friendly; the hotel is clean and the breakfast there (which is included with your stay) is excellent!  Very nice touches like a turn down service where you get chocolate truffles and fruit; pillow menu ensures you get a comfortable pillow to go with the super comfortable bed; very high ceilings and artistic decor.  Nice outdoor restaurant/patio to enjoy meals, coffee or wine.  Lively neighbourhood with lots of shopping, cafes and bars in the vicinity.  A little expensive in my opinion but worth it.  A friend of mine who was originally staying at a ""4 star"" hotel nearby did not spend one night there and ended up staying at this hotel as well.  I paid about 300 dollars a night but I think it might have been expensive because of the conference I was attending.  Might be better at other ties in the year.  I will stay here again for sure if I ever visit Barcelona again.",5,2015,11,04
32,Beautiful boutique hotel,"Hotel is located in the heart of Barcelona.  The staff was so wonderful, helpful and friendly!  Our room was fantastic!  Especially loved the shower!  The restaurant on the terrace was delicious!!  The homemade pastries for breakfast were excellent!  This is a small family owned hotel with lots of special touches! We loved everything about our stay at Hotel Do!!  And we hope to return again in the future!!",5,2015,11,03
32,Excellent boutique hotel,"Fantastic hotel located in the heart of Barcelona. All the staff are helpful, respectful and friendly. Book direct as we did and enjoy the additional benefits provided. The breakfast is superb and our room (21) was immaculate every day of our stay. ",5,2015,10,31
32,Wonderful Barcelona hotel located in a great area of the city!!!,"My husband and I booked the Junior Suite for our honeymoon and were blown away! It was stunning. The hotel was boutique-like, but they used their space wisely. The food in the restaurants were good, and the hotel staff was incredibly nice. You are right next door to Las Ramblas (tons of shops and restaurants) and in the middle of Placa Reial (restaurants, bars, etc.). Great hotel in a great location!",5,2015,10,30
32,THE place to be - in THE place to be,"We stayed for the weekend 23/24 October having chosen Hotel Do primarily because of its location in the Gothic Quarter. Within a few hours of arrival we realised that neither the photos nor the Reviews did adequate justice to this perfect gem of a boutique hotel.

We were taken to our room and shown how to work all the gadgets - we probably wouldn't have found the Nespresso machine otherwise!! The array of 'additional items' was staggering - I was impressed that there was a pencil, a sharpener and a stapler but that was completely superceded by the Hotel Do business cards with my name printed on them !! - a fantastic 'touch'.

All aspects of the hotel were suberb, the food, the decor, the service and the genuine pride shown by all staff - it was a truely excellent weekend and we will certainly return in July.",5,2015,10,27
32,Fantastic!,"My husband and I had a fabulous trip staying in Hotel Do. 
The location was perfect from us: we had hesitated with a hotel by the beach but Placa Reial was the perfect place form us to ""hand around"" late evening (sipping a sangria, eating a paella while sitting across the hotel) after long days of walking around different attractions.
The staff were so friendly and helpful. My husband had a problem charging his phone on the USB connection on the wall: staff could see what the problem was but promptly found a charger plug for us to borrow for the duration of our trip.
They noticed that my birthday was during the stay and back from a long day of sighting, they had a little cake and drink ready for my to celebrate in style! They brought it on the rooftop (1 candle on the cake :): with a lovely weather, pefect location and such nice personal attention, I blew my candle and enjoyed my cake blissfully. Thank you again!
I enjoyed the fact that it was near the Gothic quarter, off La Rambla: we enjoyed all the little narrow streets, La Rambla but were also able to enjoy very good sleep -noise free.
The bedding was the best I slept in.",5,2015,10,26
32,A Gem in the Placa Reial - the romance of Barcelona,"Situated in the centre of the Gothic Quarter, with its restaurant looking out onto the Placa Reial, Hotel Do is the perfect place to stay to experience the old world romance of Barcelona. The restaurant was wonderful, the service impeccable and the rooms were luxurious and spacious with great facilities. Hotel Do is located just off La Rambla, so shops, restaurants, historical and contemporary sights are within walking distance. I would highly recommend it for travellers seeking the European Grand Tour experience of times gone by.",5,2015,10,23
32,Wonderful place to stay in the gothic quarters,"My husband and I spent 3 nights at this beautiful small botique hotel. The location is directly on the bustling placa reial,the heart of the gothic quarters. The staff was very helpful,the room was quiet, well furnished with very comfortable beds, and the bathroom was very lovely. The breakfast was included and the menu was extensive with the meal being served in  the beautiful hotel dining room. The frigerator in the room was amply stocked with complimentary bottles of fruit juices and water. Fruit and candies were provided daily. La rambla was 30 feet away. ",5,2015,10,18
32,"Great stay in a lovely place, just a tiny bit noisy","I only stayed for one night in the very nice corner suite. The furnishing is tasteful and the bathroom extraordinary. Breakfast is good and included, staff friendly and helpful. Only thing I found was that as my room was directly adjacent to the Plaza it was a bit noise until around 2 am, even with closed windows and blinds.
Also it would be great, if they would have some video on demand service.",5,2015,10,17
32,"Best Hotel for Service, Ambience, Location, Food, Room Amenities, and More!","As you can tell from the title, we absolutely loved Hotel DO! The service and friendliness of the staff were outstanding in all regards. Upon checking in, the bell captain seemed to take great delight in pointing out the amenities of the room. It was clear that he took pride in his work and the hotel. 

The staff went to great lengths to see that our room was ready as soon as possible and we were able to gain access before 10 AM. I know they worked hard to meet this request and they did it with warm smiles. 

After we checked in, they told us we would receive some tapas and a welcome glass of Cava (Spain's version of Champaign). We had not anticipated the spread that was delivered to our room on a well appointed table a white tablecloth! It was enough for a full meal--Iberian ham croquettes, mushroom croquettes, cheese, fruit, open faced ham sandwiches, desserts, a full bottle of wine along with that glass of Cava. And, it was all exceptionally prepared--excellent in all regards. Each day of our stay, a fruit snack was delivered to our room late afternoon and a sweet treat late at night with turn-down service. And, breakfast, off the menu cooked to order, was fully included--delicious and served by cheerful and delightful staff between 7 and 9 AM each morning. 

I'm not sure when the hotel was renovated, but the decor and bathroom were beautiful. Best shower ever in a hotel with great water pressure! The bed was exceedingly comfortable. Due to my negligence, I failed to tell them about my husband's allergy to bird feathers, so we needed to request that the pillows be changed. Apparently, the comforter was also down. The staff was so gracious about changing everything out and did so with smiles, even though this must have been a big nuisance for them. Their exceptional service was deeply appreciated. 

Some reviews on Trip Advisor mentioned the noise from Place Reial as being bothersome. However, we found the thermal paned windows, the heavy drapes when closed, and the external shutters that were shut each night by staff kept all noise out of our room. We loved the location of this hotel. The room was quiet, but the Placa always vibrant and exciting. Right off of Las Ramblas with the Market nearby, next to the Gothic Quarter with its many twisty streets and squares, the many street performers and people watching available made this location absolutely perfect. 

We would stay here again if we are ever lucky enough to come back to Barcelona. It is worth a trip.",5,2015,10,16
32,GREAT LOCATION AND STAFF,"We spent three nights in Barcelona before returning home.  This is a small boutique hotel with only 18 rooms.  We had a room with small balconies facing the Placa Reial. The staff here is fantastic, they do everything possible to make your stay enjoyable.  They were able to get us tickets to a show and restaurant reservations with less than a days notice.  The room was beautiful with many amenities.",5,2015,10,15
32,All the superlatives!,"Looking for somewhere to stay near the Liceu, I had no plans to stay in a 5-star hotel until I saw the uniformly excellent reviews and a fantastic deal on the hotel's own website, thanks to a very favourable exchange rate.  The hotel was extremely easy to find after a short walk from the Placa de Catalunya, and from the moment I arrived it was an oasis of calm and elegance, despite being so close to Las Ramblas.  Without exception, the staff were friendly, hospitable and helpful throughout my stay, with everyone speaking perfect English so that I did not have to rely on my rusty Spanish.  On arrival I was offered a complimentary glass of Cava but, as it was too early in the day for me, I opted for a glass of delicious orange juice which was so fresh I presume it was squeezed especially for me.  It was a very nice touch to have a member of the reception staff (the charming Danny) show me to my room and explain all the gadgets and amenities to me.  My ""individual"" room was exactly as it appears in the website photos and I was prepared for the fact that it did not have a view (or rather it had a view of the windows next door if I opened the opaque floor-to-ceiling window). The room was immaculately clean and stylishly decorated, as was the whole hotel, and had a range of features including a blissfully uncomplicated walk-in shower with excellent water pressure.  It was also lovely to have a plethora of towels as well as two bathrobes, two pairs of slippers and a choice of fragranced shower gel as well as plenty of other toiletries.  The only thing missing was a bath to have a good soak in after walking for hours each day round the city.  The bed was a good-sized double, and probably the most comfortable I have ever had in a hotel, with lots of pillows. Despite the extensive pillow 'menu', I stuck with the ones supplied which were lovely feather ones.  The air conditioning in the room was very efficient and made for a very comfortable night's sleep.  In fact, the only thing that disturbed me at night was other guests returning late and inconsiderately letting their room doors slam shut instead of closing them quietly.  One of the features of this generous hotel is the complimentary 'mini-bar' stocked with water, juices and soft drinks which was replenished every day so that I did not have to buy any cold drinks for my entire stay.
The complimentary breakfast menu is extensive and delicious.  On three mornings I had mine on the beautiful and peaceful rooftop terrace overlooking Placa Reial with panoramic views of the city and beyond.  Whether it is because other people do not like choosing their breakfast items the night before, I do not know, but on two mornings I found I had the luxury of the terrace all to myself.  I had dinner at the hotel on one night, also on the rooftop terrace, and the food was superb with excellent, attentive service at a surprisingly modest cost.
Security is excellent at the hotel, with access to the guest floors by keycard only.
I doubt it would be possible to find a 5-star hotel in any major UK city offering such luxury at such a reasonable price.  In summary, I cannot praise this hotel highly enough and would visit Barcelona again purely to stay at Hotel Do and perhaps 'upgrade' to a room with bath!
Tourist tip:  For a relatively authentic flamenco experience, the Tablao Cordobes just south of the hotel on Las Ramblas is well worth a visit.",5,2015,10,15
32,Lunch at the Hotel Do,"We stayed at the Hotel Do last year and decided to go back there this time around for lunch. We were not disappointed.

If there is one place for lunch, make it here. You can sit outside and watch the world go by as you are eating and drinking, set within a lovely plazza.

First of all try one of their amazing Gin & Tonics using Brockmans Gin served with blackberries - absolutely gorgeous. 

Then the tapas: we had mushroom croquettes, chicken croquettes, plus a few other choices, but one of the best things the restaurant does is tomato bread. It may sound simple and basic, but until you've tried it, you'll just keep wanting more. We ordered several portions of it because it is soooooo good!!!

The staff are warm and friendly. It's not the cheapest, but really worth it. Take a look at the menu which is outside, so you can make your own mind up before you go in, but do try. A great place to go.",5,2015,10,14
32,An amazing stay!!!,"What an amazing hotel. Gorgeous room, very clean and beautifully presented. Lovely big bathroom and everything that you could need. Fantastic breakfast included and the most friendly, attentive and wonderful staff. I loved it and didn't want to leave!!",5,2015,10,13

32,Best Hotel In 3 Weeks Of Travel,This was a full service pampering hotel.  We loved it.  Not a kids or pet hotel.  We had a room just for our kids.  It was worth every penny.  At the end of the day it was not very pricey compared to hotels in Paris and Nice or Florida USA.  Best hotel in 3 weeks though Europe!!! Thanks!,5,2015,10,12
32,"Great service & food, nice room ","The staff were very friendly. Shout out to Arkady (guessing at the spelling), waiter you'll often find on the terrace. We were greeted with cava on the patio before taking a much needed siesta. Our room was beautiful and clean. New fruit and sweets left each night. The bar fridge water and juice are free and topped up multiple times a day. A very nice touch in a city where you pay for everything. I wouldn't recommend this place to families, but great for couples who like to eat late and take in the night life. We had to get used to the smaller beds and the funky light switch arrangement. As with most boutique hotels, you can hear people opening doors at night. Also, the noise from the Pla√ßa Reial can be overwhelming at times, but louder on the weekends. We arrived after Barcelona won their footie match, so loud into the wee hours. ",5,2015,10,05
32,A real treat!,"Hotel Do was our last stop on a 2-week long honeymoon, where we stayed for three wonderful days. We found it to be extremely charming right off the bat and loved the boutique-hotel approach. This definitely showed in their service which was top-notch with friendly and informative staff, all very personable and welcoming from reception to the restaurants. As it was our last leg of the trip, eating in the hotel and room service were definitely came in handy as we were exhausted, and Hotel Do took good care of us. We were especially appreciative that the kitchen staff took note of our dietary needs and were consistent in providing us with sound alternatives each time without having to be reminded. All of the meals we've had with them were great and definitely stood up to a tough market of quality gastro's in the city. Rooms were impeccable, very spacious and beautifully designed. Location was great, easily within reach of the high street and main sights. For those who like to people watch from the window as well, the hotel has some interesting views of the Placa Reial which is home to all sorts of characters and places in Barcelona. Definitely exceeded expectations and gave us a relaxed",5,2015,10,05
32,Finest Service I Have Ever Seen,"This hotel location is as good as it gets for the Gothic Quarter of Barcelona and just off La Rambla. It faces into La Placa Reial that has a great nighttime energy. It's just a fabulous location. On top of that, the rooms are wonderful and individually designed. But the real highlight is the hotel staff. I have NEVER had better service at a hotel. You will feel like the king (or queen) of Spain after your stay there. Yes, this hotel is not cheap, but you will not be disappointed.",5,2015,10,01
32,What a delightful place to stay in Barcelona.,"Hotel DO is a boutique hotel on Placa Real just off La Rambla and so is ideally situated for a visit to Barcelona. The staff are friendly and professional and our accommodation was first class - a beautifully appointed and spacious set of rooms. The first night we stayed we didn't close our shutters properly and the noise overnight from the revellers in the Placa was disturbing but subsequently we were able to shut it out by closing the shutters and the door to the bathroom. We have no complaints but the hotel itself. The terrace restaurant serves the most delicious food and wine and we felt the prices were really reasonable. If you want breakfast the choice is splendid and the serves are generous. It's easy walking to various sites and not at all difficult to get to Place Catalunya to catch a ""hop on hop off"" bus which is a great way to get orientated to the city.",5,2015,09,29
32,"Gracious Room, Outstanding Service","I had a superior double room on the third floor  with a small balcony overlooking the Caller de Colom, between the Pla√ßa Reial and La Rambla. It was a modern, spacious room with a desk, a table, and two comfortable chairs in addition to a queen sized bed and two night tables. The bathroom was also large and modern with a closed off toilet, a standing shower, and a bathtub (and there was a balcony off the bathroom as well). Not only was the room spacious, but the ceilings were high, making it seem even more so. And the bed (and pillows!) were comfy as could be. Because the lobby of the hotel is quite small and a bit cramped, I was entirely surprised by what I discovered upstairs.

The kids can get pretty rambunctious in the Pla√ßa Reial, drinking and even skateboarding until dawn. But the hotel does everything possible to minimize the noise with heavy locking shutters, seemingly noise-proof glass in heavy doors, and heavy velveteen floor to ceiling drapes. Of six nights there, I was only awakened once, and that was during La Merc√® when firecrackers were being set off.

The staff, from the housekeepers to the waiters to the busboys to the concierges, were all friendly and helpful. Really top notch. I had asked for a small chair to be brought up to my balcony, and it was there when I arrived back later in the afternoon. What a pleasure to sit there with a glass of sherry and watch the hustle and bustle below. 

Breakfasts on the hotel terrace on the Pla√ßa were very, very good with freshly-squeezed orange juice, delectable pastries, and excellent coffee. And little treats were brought to your room twice a day, usually some fruit in late afternoon and something sweet in the evening. Oh. And everything in the non-alcoholic mini bar was free and replenished daily: juice, soda, water--both still and sparkling.

Although the hotel is right on the gritty southern edge of The Rambla, I never felt less than completely safe. It helps that there's a taxi stand right outside the hotel and the Liceu metro station is less than a block away.

All in all, a very pleasurable experience, one I would not hesitate to repeat.",5,2015,09,29
32,Upmarket treat!,"We only went to the restaurant and ate outside in the Placa Reial. It was excellent food, very tasty, bit pricey but this did include a lovely view and well presented food! There had nice toilets inside, downstairs. Traditional tapas with a twist, made to orderI recommend! ",4,2015,09,26
32,What a fabulous hotel,"Had an amazing 3 night stay at this hotel. Could not fault the staff or experience in any way. The staff could not have been any more helpful or kind. Food was fab, room superb - all in all would recommend without hesitation and if I am ever in Barcelona again would be privileged to stay here again.",5,2015,09,25
32,Excellent Hotel & El Terrat Room,"Loved Hotel Do- we stayed in the El Terrat room and it was one of the highlights of our trip to Barcelona.  We were expecting the room to be small from photos but it was bigger than we expected, with very large shower, separate toilet, and a private patio and pool area that doubles the size of the room.  The room is isolated on the roof so is very quiet and relaxing.  From the pool you can see the surrounding hills and city, which is beautiful at night.  The room is right across the hall from the hotel's rooftop bar though you never hear noise.  

Amenities were excellent- we were very impressed with the quality of the a la carte breakfast, sweets, and fruits that we received every night.  

Staff were very helpful and very friendly, always making it feel exciting to return from chaotic city.  

Excellent location close to Gothic Quarter, Museums, Restaurants, Waterfront, Ramblas, Eixample, etc.  Walking distance to most places of interest.  Will stay here again if we  return to Barcelona.",5,2015,09,25
32,Awesome stay,"Just returned from an 8 night stay at the hotel.  I was in a Jr Suite on the 3rd level.  The hotel is nicely designed and small enough that you never feel like you are staying at a large tourist hotel.

The reception is small, but there was always someone at the desk.  They were more than happy to make dinner reservations and suggestions at several local restaurants.  (Pla was awesome).  There is no business center or PC to print anything, you have to ask the desk person, which was awkward but worked.

The outside terrace and the upstairs terrace were great spots to have some Tapas, a very nice menu ordered breakfast or just grab a nice glass of Cava before heading out.  The bar downstairs made the largest Manhattan I've ever had.  Sadly the fine dining restaurant was the least favorite meal I had while in Barcelona.  But this doesn't reflect poorly on the hotel.

The room had a very comfortable but firm bed with nice linens.  The furniture was stylish and comfortable.  I loved the extra space the Jr Suite gave us, awesome closet space.  The bath had a nice shower with 2 shower heads, great pressure and very hot water.  The AC worked great, it was so nice to come back to a cool room after a day of being out and about.  I will say that the lighting switches were needlessly complicated.  Even after a week I don't think we had figured out what each switch really did.  There were plenty of outlets in the room, including bedside, which I appreciate.  The TV even allowed you to hook up your own device to stream movies.  I did this with my iPad, you just need the HDMI connector/cable.  The wifi worked but could be faster.  I tested it and was getting about 5mbps.

Don't go to this hotel if you are looking for a calm peaceful retreat.  It's location on the square and close to the Rambla make it a very active and noisy spot the moment you leave the hotel.  In the room it was always quiet with just a few exceptions.

I liked that it was close to the metro, which we used a lot.  My partner did get pick pocketed, but luckily a local saw what was happening and snatched his wallet from the woman before she got off the car.  This is our 3rd visit to Barcelona and the first time we have had any issues.  Again, not a reflection on the hotel.

In summary, a great hotel and awesome top notch staff.",5,2015,09,23
32,Fabulous Hotel ,We had an amazing stay in this small but perfectly formed boutique hotel.  The views from our room were amazing. The location can't be beaten if you want to experience Barcelona from its heart.  The tapas served at the Hotel is simply amazing! The staff were really helpful and there are some really nice extras which make the difference such as a fridge full of soft drinks at no extra cost.  I could go on but I think if you are reading this you should just book this hotel - you won't be disappointed!  ,5,2015,09,19
32,All the other great reviews were right...,"Loved everything about this boutique hotel and the incredibly attentive and friendly staff. the location is energized by its surroundings, yet I was able to ""escape""into my beautifully furnished junior suite and have all the comforts of home.  Impeccably designed, well laid out.  My balconies overlooked the plaza and restaurants below.  So fun.  Only regret is that i had only one night to stay!",5,2015,09,16
32,Honeymoon Stay ,"By far the best hotel we stayed for our four week honeymoon across Europe. The hotel is beautiful and charming, the rooms are the perfect mixture of modern decor and beautiful old history. The staff went above and beyond to make our stay amazing. Great shower, fresh fruit delivered to the room each afternoon & sweet treats left in the room as part of the turn down service. Complimentary mini bar (non alcoholic) which was a nice touch. So many beautiful personalized touches throughout ! The restaurant downstairs was mind blowing, despite being very quiet on the night we dined there we had an amazing experience, can't commend the chef and waiter enough. I could go on all day about this hotel, brilliant!! ",5,2015,09,15
32,A Barcelona Gem,"Very warm welcome at this boutique hotel in the midst of Barcelona's vibrant restaurant and nightlife area. Staff were polite and helpful, breakfast delicious and plentiful and our room was very tastefully decorated and comfortable with a huge choice of pillows and a luxuriant ensuite. Lovely touches with classy bathroom products and a free non alcohilic minibar.
Best Gin and Tonic ever at the ground floor bar, the rooftop terrace however was a bit of a let down with a very small plunge pool. All in all an excellent hotel",4,2015,09,15
32,Impressive,"Location is perfect, very central on La Rambla, convenient walking distance to all transport, near market and adjoining placa surrounded by restaurants.  Room overlooks courtyard - very well equipped with unlimited mini bar access.  Service - all out to please.",5,2015,09,14
32,Could not have asked for more!,A stunning hotel in the perfect location. So many little touches to make it stand out above other hotels we have stayed at. Nothing was too much trouble. We really could not have asked for a better place to stay in Barcelona for our romantic break.,5,2015,09,10
32,2 day trip,"Very impressed with the service at the restaurant, the front desk.  The room was small but totally adequate.  Huge bathtub, clean.  Would definitely stay here again.relatively close to the airports.  Close to the cruise ships .  Many little shops all over.  Entertainment all through the square",5,2015,09,05
32,An absolute delight,"Wonderful small hotel (18 rooms) in the centre of Barcelona, where you can easily get anywhere and everywhere. The staff are some of the friendliest people I've ever met in an hotel - really lovely! The rooms are big with high ceilings and the bathrooms are fabulous (the mirrored toilet door was the tallest I've ever seen) with a great shower. You can choose your pillow from a menu but you can also choose your room fragrance!!!! Breakfast was a highlight as the Eggs Benedict were delicious - I had them every morning - but there is plenty to choose from on the menu. You can eat in the main restaurant in the basement or outside or on the roof terrace!!! I will be back (and I don't say that very often!)",5,2015,09,01
32,horrible tourist trap,pretentious lame place. walked in and tried to talk to the manager and visit the place before i checked in.  the pseudo security people said it was completo altough that was not what booking stated. being a genius customer i felt deceived by a false 5 star hotel which seemed in person more like a trashy tourist trap than a real 5 star hotel. another tourist trap downtown.,1,2015,09,01
32,Great hotel,"We stayed at hotel Do for 2 nights, and loved it. 

Nice touches from the complimentary glass of cava on arrival to complimentary wine and tapas on our first evening made our stay very pleasant. 

The staff are excellent English speakers and are really helpful. 

The room was very comfortable - all the facilities we wanted and more. Great spacious bathroom with bath and separate shower.

The rooftop pool was a bit disappointing - very shallow, and a plunge pool rather than a swimming pool.

The location of the hotel is exceptional - between Las Ramblas and the Placa Reial. You can eat outside on the Placa, which is a perfect place for people watching and long lazy meals. The tapas was great, with friendly staff.

Thoroughly impressed with Hotel Do. We will definitely be returning to Barcelona and won't be staying anywhere else.",5,2015,08,30
32,A very brilliant hotel!,"Loved every thing about our stay, the location, the staff, the clean room, the hotel itself. 
It is a family owned business and therefore has a unique touch to it, you are a guest not a customer in this hotel!",5,2015,08,21
32,Perfect Blend of Classic and Modern Design,"The staff is a class act!! It felt as if everyone was the concierge. The view over the plaza from our room and while having my Spanish omelet with the Rosemary roasted tomato was ""authentic""!! Booked 2 rooms by mistake so stayed in the private terrace pool room the first night. Perfect Honeymoon feeling but the Junior suite with 2 balconies (plaƒáa reial and la rambla) views was grand!!! The lower level restaurant and the staircase that leads there are marvels in their design. I can't wait to stay again. Thank you for all of the special touches. It was a glorious Honeymoon. #freshfruitwasalovelytouch!!",5,2015,08,18
32,Perfect stay,"Spent 5 days here with my wife, 2 children and mother. We were initially a little disappointed with the lobby area and our first impressions were somewhat coloured by that, however it soon became apparent to all of us that we had made the perfect choice - not always easy with a wide age range (12 - 87). The hotel staff were first class from the cheery doorman to the restaurant staff and the room staff. The front desk were always willing to help and provided some great recommendations. The location is perfect for people watching and general access to the old town and sea front.
This is an excellent Hotel set in a perfect location to access this wonderful city.",5,2015,08,17
32,"Wonderful service, great hotel","First, a big thank you to Dayana and Jean Claude for their warmth and hospitality.  The staff were almost all really good. ( outdoor dining a step below). Dayana and Jean Claude were helpful, knowledgeable, and attentive.   The breakfasts were always wonderful.  Our Junior suite was very nice.  The noise is the only negative about this hotel.  Our white noise machine broke, so we purchased a good loud fan to diminish the noise at night so we could sleep.   The minibar, fruit, and sweets daily were a very nice touch.  We are a family of 3 and the room and location worked very well for us.  We stayed 8 nights and felt that we made the right choice for accommodations. It deserves the 5 star rating.  ",5,2015,08,16
32,Great hotel with a wonderful staff,"This is a great boutique hotel in the middle of Barcelona.  It's not what most people would think of when picturing a 5-star hotel because it's a small boutique hotel without tons of amenities but it's one of the most pleasant hotel experiences I've had and I've stayed in many traditional 5-star hotels/resorts.  Being a boutique hotel, the lobby is small but it is comfortable. The rooms are pretty big by European standards and nice and homey feeling with exposed wood beams and wood finishes.  The bathrooms are really big and very nice.  The staff/service is fantastic.  One example (of many): When we asked the concierge if she could get us a cab at 5:30am the following morning to fly out, she asked if we wanted breakfast delivered to our room before we had to leave.  We were not expecting to be able to eat before leaving but sure enough a delicious breakfast was delivered to our room at 5am.  There aren't a lot of hotels that will do that for you.  

The food at the hotel is excellent.  We had breakfast (included) every morning and thoroughly enjoyed it.  We also had lunch on our first day on the terrace on the Placa Reial - it was delicious and the atmosphere was really nice. 

The location is great - right on the Placa Reial.  This is a great spot in the middle of the Gothic Quarter with lots of bars, restaurants, shops within a very short walk and a lot of great energy in the Placa Reial itself.  There can be some unwanted noise from the plaza at night - it didn't bother us as we're used to it living in Manhattan but those who need it super quiet may not find this location as ideal as we did.  

The staff was always very pleasant and super helpful with all the questions we had and there were a lot of nice little extras, like a pillow menu, multiple turndowns each day, and a small snack and dessert left in the room each day.  We also were left with a surprise bottle of Cava in our room on our first day after they found out we were there on our honeymoon.  

Our experience at Hotel Do was so great and I can't recommend this hotel enough.",5,2015,08,14
32,Too bad - could have exceeded expectations,"So on our last night in Barcelona we decided to sit on the plaza Reial and enjoy a bottle of wine. We choose a nice Spanish Rioja at 90 Euros. My drinking partner decided to go the route of a sangria. So the problem became one of my having to drink a whole bottle on my own. Well the task was too much for me. So I asked to take the bottle with me . No problem . What I also asked for was to take a wine glass with me . I promised to return the glass in the morning. The waitress felt the request was beyond her so she brought  a manager out.  The manager steadfastly refused to accommodate me. 
Wrong choice.  The possible cost to them was a glass at $2 or $5 . It wouldn't have cost anything as I would have returned the glass. However, the actual cost is thousands of euros as I won't be staying here next time. The idea of a 5* hotel should be whatever we can do to accommodate our guests we will do. If a simple (although unusual) request can't be accommodated what does that say about the service philosophy.",3,2015,08,10
32,This Is A Lovely Hotel,"This is a lovely boutique hotel.  There are many things to recommend it.  The location is excellent.  It is a half-block off The Ramblas and faces the Placa Reial.  The building itself is charming.  The room we stayed in, although small, was lovely.  It was comfortable, quiet and very clean.  Our only criticism is that there was no chair in the room, making the bed the only place where one could sit.  Excellent bathroom and shower with very nice bath amenities.  

We spent two nights at the Hotel DO in June 2015.  We ate breakfast one day on the patio and one day in the restaurant -- both were great as was the service.  Food choices were excellent and the food was fresh and delicious.  Breakfast both days was a lovely experience.

The hotel is on the Placa Reial.  This square can be noisy and busy.  During the day there are a lot of delivery trucks and at night there are a lot of busy restaurants facing the square.  Our room faced the side street and we found it to be perfectly quiet.  I don't know how quiet a room directly facing the Placa would be.

One of the biggest pluses for this hotel was the staff.  Every single person with whom we interacted was fantastic.  They were so genuinely helpful, cheerful and nice, and they were more than willing to assist with any request.  They really have assembled an amazing staff at this hotel.  We would stay at this hotel again in a heartbeat.  There is no reason to look further.",5,2015,08,07
32,Stunning hotel,"We came for a Birthday treat weekend to get away. Even better in the flesh, this hotel looked good on the website, it was outstanding. Service is excellent and done with finesse.

Our room was small but perfect. Very clean, comfortable and luxurious. Breakfast was a feast and we both over did it. Would be happy to move in. Wonderful weekend.",5,2015,08,01
32,Best hotel in barcelona,"We were a Family from 79 to 6 years old (4 generation). Everyone like this hotel. Super service, great rooms, good food (but pls. make a kid menu). Even a 20 yrs birthsday party was set up in no time on roof top. Expensive, but value for Money. ",5,2015,07,30
32,A truly wonderful experience in the heart of Barcelona,"This lovely boutique hotel is a gem.  It's in a great location in the Gothic District, but gives you a sense of ""getting away from it all"".  In addition to the beautiful rooms with lovely linens and bath products, they also do special things.  Free soft drinks in the mini bar.  Lovely fruit appears in your room in the afternoon.  Sweets before bed.  The staff is attentive and helpful.  The food was great.  We loved it and count it as one of our favorite hotels in all of our travels. 

The Plaza outside is loud--but didn't bother us.  However, if hearing the sound of late-night revelers is difficult for you, I suspect downtown Barcelona may not be a great location, since it is a wild place in the summer.",5,2015,07,28
32,An oasis of calm and relax in the middle of the tourist section of town!,"The excellent service started even before we arrived with e-mails back and forth about a few questions I had.  From the moment we arrived, the staff all took very good care of us and made sure we were content.  They helped with lots of recommendations and even arranged a private tour guide for us for Sagrada Familia (which was excellent).  The room was great and comfortable.  There was some noise in the plaza and above is, but it wasn't really a big deal.  The food in the restaurant was quite good too. If you want to stay in the Gothic, give this place a try.",5,2015,07,27
32,Outstanding Hidden Gem,"I travel all over the world and don't usually write reviews, but this hotel and staff definitely deserve 5-stars.  Location is A++.  Beautiful design throughout the building.   Staff were truly the nicest I've come across in a long time.  Hotel sits right in the middle of the action, yet just step inside and its like arriving in your own private Barcelona residence.  Absolutely no noise intrusion whatsoever from the Plaza or La Rambla. We barely saw any other guests during our entire stay because the building has such a boutique feel and layout.

Tip:  Be sure to try the sangria on the rooftop lounge/pool overlooking the plaza!

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!",5,2015,07,27
32,Great Address - highly recommended,"A very generous hotel; one which genuinely tries to make their customers feel welcome and happy. We were covered with nice stuff: glass of cava, tapas etc. and they were all excellent. 
Great location, very nice room, functionning wifi, al good.
Do ask for a room high up: my room was quite noisy, the only issue with my stay.",5,2015,07,25
32,So well looked after,"A real pleasure to stay here. Only downside was my visit was too short!

Lovely staff, well fitted rooms, gorgeous food, and the terraces (on the square, and on the roof) offer some great places to relax and watch the world go by. 

Some lovely little surprises too, and the hotel even smelt delicious! I really enjoyed some time in the sauna as well, very refreshing.

I will certainly  be back , this time for pleasure rather than business so I can spend more time enjoying the hotel and the excellent city location.",5,2015,07,23
32,A Gem of a Hotel Smack in the Middle of the Barcelona Action,"From our arrival to our departure the personal attention and inclusives in this artful decor boutique hotel made us feel so comfortable and welcome.  We were given a welcome drink on the terrace on arrival where we instantly came to understand the vibes of the city looking out on the busy palazzo from our tasteful, shady, relaxing vantage point with cool drinks on a hot humid summer day.  The staff was extremely helpful with directions and tips for tourist activities and we immensely enjoyed being in the middle of the crazy vibe going on in this city 24 hours a day.  Although our room was on the second floor and looked out with french shuttered doors onto the palazzo it was extremely quiet when we closed them up and had no problem sleeping.  But if one were to get up at 3 AM and open the doors the sounds and beat of the city pours in the room, reminding you of where you are at!  All of our drinks in the room and our breakfast - in room or dining room or even the terrace were included as well as nightly fruit and pastries brought to our room.  The breakfast was tasty and individually prepared with a full selection of hot and cold items and fueled us up for our busy days in Barcelona. The juice was fresh squeezed and irresistible.  The ceilings were high giving an airy feeling to the space and the bathroom was lovely and modern with rain shower head and separate bath where we were provided with bath salts and loofah.  And then there was the bed with crisp white high thread count sheets and multiple soft down pillows providing us some of the best sleep we had on our 3 week tour of Europe. Fresh linens were put on the floor next to the bed to step on before we got in. What a wonderful and refreshing retreat to come back to after a day of intense and wonderful tourist explorations in this city of art.  There is so much to see and soak in here that one would need weeks.  We thoroughly enjoyed our short 2 days and nights here and would recommend this fine renovated hotel in a centuries old building.  Thank you Hotel Do - you created a boutique hotel venue fit for royalty and appropriate for the setting of Barcelona.",5,2015,07,20
32,Room is small but very nice.,"The service is excellent, staff is very nice. The room feels like your staying in a little palace. Right on the Plaza Reial, very touristy and busy but nice. I would stay here again...bed is super comfy too. So many great little restaurants on the little side streets off the Plaza. Tapas Galore!",5,2015,07,20
32,Nicest Boutique Hotel I stayed in!,Just spent one night here post cruise in July. We had 2 rooms as there were 3 of us and they only have double rooms. Location was fantastic. However because location was so good I was up a lot that night because of partying in the plaza (I am a light sleeper- my son slept through it). My mothers room did not have a view and she slept through the night soundly. That being said I would keep the room I had and just consider the party as part of the adventure. I have so many good things to say about this hotel that I don't know where to begin. From complimentary drinks at check in to all the little details this hotel offers they are unmatched in my traveling experience.  Rooftop bar was a nice area and I wish I had time to spend there. One night at this hotel was not enough if I am ever lucky enough to return to Barcelona I wouldn't consider staying anywhere but the Hotel DO.,5,2015,07,18
32,"The perfect, boutique hotel!!","My husband and I recently spent 4 wonderful nights in this special hotel.  The staff was warm, welcoming and helpful.  The room was lovely, clean and comfortable.  The exceptional attention to making a guest feel comfortable was exceptional.  We especially enjoyed the fresh fruit daily and the special treat we found in our room each night as we returned from dinner.   It was always some delectable sweet.  Their outside terrace overlooking the Placa Reial was a great place to have a glass of cava and watch the world go by.  I recommend this hotel highly.",5,2015,07,18
32,Fine Boutique Hotel,"Great small hotel.  Staff was very attentive and helpful; design and quality were impeccable, Highly recommend the hotel. Great base to explore Barcelona. Enjoyed a nice meal on the plaza and their full breakfast (included) was great.",5,2015,07,16
32,Excellent Allround,"Location is undoubtably the most ideal location, they have extremely friendly and helpful which staff makes the hotel buzz. With a limited capacity (18 guest rooms) the hotel is not over run even with the restaurant and bar open to the general public. The rooftop bar is a really excellent venue to wine & dine. My wife and I spent 8 fantastic nights stay in a suite which was really scrumtiously comfortable. Needless to say if we return to Barcelona, we will certainly do it all again in this htel.",5,2015,07,14
32,Great setting and service,"Great location, quality facilities, great setting on the square for breakfast lunch or dinner or just drinks.  We wold return. The rooms are outsized. The service is like that of a family, very helpful and friendly.",5,2015,07,12
32,barcelona done right,"this little botique hotel in the heart of pla√ßa reial is anything but litttle. it is big on location, big on customer service, big on attention to detail, and big on gastronomy. the rooms are smaller but very well appointed and the bathroom with the rain shower and tub is wonderful after of full day of enjoying the great city. the restaurant inside and downstaris offers a huge menu that is easily 5star and the wine selection is top notch. we we directed to a superb bottle of spanish red wine by the very knowledgeable waiter. everyone was very nice and we had a most spectacular stay. if you want peace and quiet then this might not be for you as this is right in the middle of the best action. personally i embraced the activity and took part myself and wasnt bothered for a single moment. i would stay here again and again and tell all my friends to do the same. thanks hotel DO!",5,2015,07,11
32,"Amazing Hotel, Amazing Location","What a wonderful hotel! Our stay at the Hotel DO was the perfect conclusion to our Mediterranean vacation. It is very luxurious, with beautiful appointments and attention to detail. The staff was terrific, assisting us whenever we asked. The food in the restaurants was a culinary delight. We were able to try many local favorites. The only thing that was not quite perfect was the air conditioning in our rooms. Barcelona was having a heat wave and the a/c struggled to keep our room cool. Other than that everything was more than we could ask for and I would definitely stay there again.",5,2015,07,11
32,First time in Barcelona,"my husband & I stayed here for four days in mid June.  It's a lovely hotel.  Our room was spacious and pretty, the staff was very helpful in assisting us with planning our excursions. The food was good and we loved having breakfast outside in Placa Reial every morning. The location is great if you want to be part of all the activity and tourists that visit the square and La Rambla, which is the front of the hotel.  The only slight downside is that it can be loud even late at night if you're on the first floor as we were.  But overall great & we'd go back.",5,2015,07,11
32,"Great night in a perfect location, but not perfect.","I stayed at Hotel DO in Placa Reial for 1 night at the start of July after spotting an excellent deal on lastminute.com just a few days before my stay. After gazing for a few moments at the wonderful and lively square where the hotel is located and realising how perfect its location is, I entered the hotel at around midday, half expecting my room to not yet be ready. However, I was told my room had already been cleaned, checked in and went up to the room. My first impression of the room was that it was well decorated, but a tad smaller than I had been anticipating. However, the bathroom made up for this, being of a decent size, along with a truly excellent shower.  The television in the rooms had all the usual European and financial news channels, but lacked Canal+ meaning I couldn't watch any of Wimbledon or highlights in the handful of minutes of time spent relaxing in my room.

Before leaving for an evening out, I ventured to the roof to find the bar and small swimming pool (which I didn't have a chance to try) along with an outstanding view of the evening lights of Placa Reial, bustling with people. Sadly though, the wall on the roof level was too high for me standing (or of course anyone sitting on a table) to see over properly without being on tiptoes, although I appreciate they may have health and safety concerns.

When arriving back at the hotel at night I was provided with some fruit and small cookies, perfect for a midnight snack! Unlike some reviewers I found the room to be very quiet and I had an uninterrupted night's sleep, although this may have been because my room's window looked out onto a small courtyard, a view (or lack thereof) which meant my curtains remained firmly drawn.

Breakfast was included in my rate, and from 9 to 11am it is served outside in the square. There was a wide variety of options available along with some excellent coffee! A selection of small pastries were brought to my table straight away and I only had a couple of these. I requested that the rest were put in a bag or container for me to nibble at later, but the hotel staff seemed to struggle with this seemingly simple request, dillydallying around for a while before eventually finding a suitable box.

Overall, I enjoyed my single night at Hotel DO and would recommend staying here, although it was not without fault. For instance, the in-room wifi didn't seem to function on any of my devices (despite working perfectly downstairs), although I didn't draw this to the attention of the staff, instead opting to use my phone's included data plan. Furthermore, I found the toilets in the downstairs restaurant to be indeed of a good clean, which I found to be surprising in an otherwise spotless hotel.",4,2015,07,10
32,Beautiful Family-Owned Boutique with Amazing Detail,"We were tremendously impressed with the incredible attention to detail at this boutique hotel! 

The whole hotel is just beautiful. It appears to be a historic building with the high ceilings and everything that was completed remodeled recently with a very stylish, high-end, modern yet comfortable design.

Our junior suite was gorgeous with two balconies overlooking the Placa Reial. Really stylish and comfortable, cool furniture, art work and lighting. With vaulted ceilings, the room was quite spacious with tons of closet and storage space. It was beautifully appointed, obviously by an interior designer with great tastes. Had a very luxurious feel.

Bathroom was nice and modern and large enough for our big Californian tastes. It had two sinks, large shower with dual shower heads, full bath tub, etc., nice towels and robes.

The multilingual staff were very professional, friendly and helpful. During our stay, we unfortunately needed a doctor because of a bronchial infection/flu. The hotel front desk arranged for a doctor come to our room, which was so convenient, and we were really grateful. By the way, there's a nice pharmacy right across the way if you need it.

Upon arrival, you receive a voucher for complimentary Champagne to be enjoyed on the Placa or in the downstairs restaurant or on the rooftop. We had a nice lunch as well as a dinner on the Placa. Very fun people watching, and the food is really quite good. We had an aperitif on the rooftop, which also was really cool, romantic. Breakfast, which was in the downstairs restaurant, was included in our hotel fare, and you could order anything off the menu - eggs any style, pastries, fruit, yoghurt, pretty much anything.

Going back to the attention to detail, it has all the hallmarks of old world elegance as luxury hotels used to do things and you don't see much anymore. They bring fresh fruit to your room. We were surprised that everything in the stocked mini bar was complimentary! First time we'd ever seen that in a hotel. The bed comes with a boatload of pillows, and there's this 'pillow menu' which describes each pillow. There's also a 'room spray menu' from which you can select various pleasant fragrances.

Be sure to flip through the welcome booklet they give you upon arrival, and you will appreciate what I mean about attention to detail. It even included calling cards with my name printed on them! It was in the welcome book that I learned that the hotel was family owned, which made it all the more likable.

One thing I should note: we were there on a weekend, and the revelers in the Placa were out all night and partying up until 7:00 a.m. If you are sensitive to noise, ask the hotel if they have any quieter rooms that are not facing the Placa. Otherwise, enjoy the people watching from the balcony and be happy to be in such a fun, vibrant city.

The hotel is in a perfect central location, easy walk to the Picasso Museum and other attractions. Long walk or short, cheap taxi ride to Sagrada Familia.

I HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend this hotel. I wished we had booked more days in Barcelona. I guess we'll just have to go back. Cannot wait!",5,2015,07,10
32,Holiday,"Great boutique hotel. Staff are fabulous, friendly and we had great service. Small problem with air conditioning on our room was fixed quickly and with a free meal to boot!
Great location, on Placa Reial, off La Ramblas....highly recommend ",5,2015,07,10
32,Barcelona Beauty!,"We loved this hotel. From the attentive staff to the wonderful food and the the location-we couldn't ask for more. The plaza is lively every day. On the weekend we were there, there were crafts people on Saturday selling beautiful jewelry and on Sunday, collectors took over with their wares.  Our room was beautifully appointed and while we were disappointed that our room did not overlook the plaza, we were delighted that the room we were in was a bit quieter We ate breakfast and dinner during our stay and the food was presented beautifully and was delicious..",5,2015,07,08
32,Awesome stay,"This hotel was super nice. 
We arrived after midnight and got a warm welcome with smiles and cava. 

The room was veery nice with a high ceiling. Our overall impression was flawless, we highly recommend it.",5,2015,07,07
32,Unbelievable,"How anyone could give this less than 5 stars is beyond me. We stayed 4 nights and it was everything a boutique hotel should be. If you want to get a good night sleep, then don't stay on Las Ramblas. We had the Terrat suite and at 5:30 in the am one morning we heard people coming out of the bars. The hotel cannot control people on the street. Otherwise it was quiet and lived up to every 5 star review I read before booking. Don't hesitate, just book it.",5,2015,07,06
32,Honeymoon Stay,"Everything about this hotel, location, design, service, staff is TOP score. It is a 5 star place without a doubt!
Our room was upgraded as the place was double booked. Complimentary tapas and cava definitely made our stay a million times more exciting.
The best place I ever stayed in. ",5,2015,07,06
32,Fantastic Hotel... But worst night of sleep,"Everything about this hotel was fantastic from the free tapas and cava included with our room (junior suite) and amazing breakfast on the terrace on the plaza to the decor of the room, amazing water pressure in the shower and impeccable service/friendly staff. I absolutely loved the hotel, but it was the worst night of sleep I have ever had at a hotel. The junior suite has stunning views over the plaza but since we booked this as a one night stay post cruise we were hoping to get some sleep but you hear every word and noise from the plaza below. We could hear individual conservations and you also have noise coming from la rambla on the other side of the room. It felt like we were sleeping in the middle of the plaza. I believe the windows were double glazed too so maybe if the hotel has a higher up room ( ours was on the first floor) it would be better or if there is a room that doesn't face the square you could try that as well but otherwise if you are looking to get some sleep this isn't the room or hotel possibly to stay in. Other than that though everything was fantastic so if they can find a way to better isolate the room from the noise it would be one of my favorite boutique hotels I have ever stayed in.",3,2015,07,05
32,Espectacular hotel and Perfect location,"Beautiful and ROMANTIC hotel. 
Lovely terrace to enjoy the breakfast and perfect views of Ciutat Vella, the Cathedral‚Ä¶ We spend 4 days around the city but we had dinner 2 nights at the restaurant of the hotel, La Cuina, we loved Arroz de Gambas de Palam√≥s (typical spanish rice with incredible prawns).
The location is perfect, you are in the centre and very well connected.
We fall in Love of Barcelona and also of that Boutique Hotel. Thank you to Ruth, one of the managers, she is lovely.
100% recommended for couples and for business (good service and good restaurant).",5,2015,07,04
32,One of the better hotels I've stayed in around the world,I had a weeks' business in Barcelona. The hotel made me feel like I was at home. Impeccable service has it's price anywhere and the DO: didn't not disappoint. The Degustation Menu individually chosen and cooked by the chef on the first evening was one of the best meals I have ever eaten. The bakery is second to none. Well done. Will return privately for an extended visit.,5,2015,07,02
32,Never felt compelled to write a review before...,"Until we stayed at Hotel Do. Hands down, one of the best places we have ever stayed at. The staff are amazingly helpful and nice -- customer service is clearly one of their key drivers. The hotel location is ideal, and despite some of the other reviews, is very quiet. We will definitely come back to Hotel Do. Do yourself a favor and look no further for a great place to stay with every amenity you could ever need.",5,2015,07,01
32,Fantastic hotel - excellent experience,"We stayed at Hotel DO for a one-night honeymoon stopover in Barcelona on our way to Corsica. We wanted a really luxurious and special hotel for our first night to celebrate the start of our holiday, and Hotel DO definitely ticked all of the boxes.

Location - perfect, just off La Ramblas in bustling square (although peaceful in the evening). ‚Ç¨25 taxi from the airport

Staff - very friendly and accommodating. Porters to help with the bags appeared out of nowhere, always on hand to help.

Facilities - limited, although this is city centre. There was a lovely little roof terrace bar and (plunge) pool.

Room - fantastic!! Excellent bed, lovely furnishings throughout, big bathroom with large sink and walk in shower. Balcony overlooking the square.

The staff knew it was our honeymoon stay, and we came back into the room to a surprise of chilled cava and cakes - a lovely touch.

First class - five star.",5,2015,06,29
32,Hotel DO is THE BEST!,"We loved our stay at this little boutique hotel. From the friendly check-in to the fond farewell, everything was wonderfully done!  The rooms are very comfortable and we had a lovely view of the square. It was very well situated, an easy walk to the beach and all the major sites. The little lobby is a fun place to relax, as was the rooftop bar. We enjoyed breakfast and dinner overlooking the plaza with the best people watching, particularly at sunset. Dayana and Ruth were supreme hosts and helped us with purchasing museum tickets and dinner reservations. We will make sure our friends visiting Barcelona stay HERE!",5,2015,06,27
32,Lively Barcelona,"Fantastic stay!  The service and staff were amazing.  The location was ideal for exploring the city on foot.  There is some noise at night due to all of the clubs/restaurants on the square, but worth it.",5,2015,06,24
32,Great Find with EXCEPTIONAL service  but... there is noise,"I found this hotel on Trip Advisor and needed a 1 night stay post cruise. We used 3 rooms for family of 5. Remember rooms in Europe are smaller and typically you can't squeeze a third person in a room. The hotel is BEAUTIFUL. All the decor is high end. The beds are extremely comfortable and the location is Fantastic if you want to be in the heart of Las Ramblas this is IT. You are in the center. The minibar is entirely free which is a nice added touch. What I loved was their service. It is without a doubt exceptional. My only complaint was the noise. We were exhausted after a 2 week cruise and eager to have a big bathroom, shower and large comfy bed to get a good nights sleep. I guess I forgot to think about the late partying in Spain. People were leaving Las Ramblas at 5:30 am. We stayed on the first floor and could hear them all night. It was finally silent at 6 am. My kids stayed on second floor and didn't notice the sound. But they are also teenagers. Overall I would highly recommend this hotel.The location and service simply can't be beat. metro is within a 3 min walk! Just keep in mind that you may need ear plugs or stay higher up.",5,2015,06,19
32,Great hotel in a spectacular location,"The hotel was everything we had hoped it would be (and we can be very demanding travellers).  The staff were wonderfully helpful, the breakfast was both filling and very tasty, and the rooftop sitting area/pool were beautiful

But by far the most wonderful thing about our stay was the location of the hotel.  Right on Placa Reial, with lots of seating (especially for hotel guests), it was a great place to relax with a glass of wine or cava before and/or after dinner.  And it was such a central location. 

There are comments about noise...and yes, one the weekend nights you could hear (drunk) people yelling in the courtyard, but it didn't affect us for more than a second or two and then we were both back asleep.

We would definitely consider staying here in the future...and we will definitely be coming back to Barcelona!",5,2015,06,19
32,Luxury in the heart of Barcelona,"An excellent hotel in the best location. We stayed 3 nights. The staff were all most helpful and the room was magnificent. The decor throughout is a clever blend of old style Spanish with a modern and stylish twist. Furniture and Fittings are all of the highest standard and design and the en suite bathroom was amazing. Additional nice touches were the daily delivery of fresh fruit to the room and creations from the pastry chef. The Nespresso machine is another welcome feature and the minibar of soft drinks is all 'free'. 
  Breakfasts were first class and available on the terrace on Pla√ßa Reial until 11:00. We also sampled the fine cuisine in the main restaurant which really was top quality though very reasonably priced. We felt like judges in an episode of Masterchef! Another really good point about this hotel is that there is a roof-top sun deck with very comfortable loungers and a (small but refreshing) pool. A great way to unwind in the late afternoon after strolling the sites during the day. 
  The only criticisms we had was that there was a failure of hot water throughout the hotel on the first day. There was only an apologetic note delivered to the room - perhaps a complimentary bottle of wine if you chose to eat in the main restaurant would have been a nicer touch - because a cold shower after a day's travel wasn't quite what we expected! Also there was a mess-up with our booking which was through a 3rd party, fully paid in advance. The hotel were not expecting us - but fortunately the junior suite we had booked was available and the situation was quickly sorted and put down to an IT glitch. Pla√ßa Reial is also a place where folks congregate all day - and pretty much all night, but we didn't find the noise to be a problem.
  However these negatives were vastly outweighed by all the positives of this hotel - which is without doubt one of the best we have ever stayed in. I would give this hotel my highest recommendation and if you want luxury, service, value and location combined in Barcelona, look no further!",5,2015,06,16
32,Great Boutique Hotel,"We stopped here for one night in Barcelona on the way to the Costa Brava for a family vacation.  It's  beautiful, well located find centrally located in the old district with easy walk to the gothic area and the waterfron, and well positioned on Las Ramblas.
Family run with extremely friendly and helpful staff.  Breakfast was phenomenal.",5,2015,06,14
32,Outstanding,"We stayed 4 nights. Here's an extensive breakdown:

Parking: We drove from London. The Rambler parking lot, a few meters from the hotel, is not easy to find but can be found in your GPS or google it. It's secure. The hotel sent a valet (David, who was superb throughout our stay) with a wagon down there to collect our luggage. I tipped but I definitely did not feel he expected it. The garage is located on La Rambler and yes, it is a pedestrian street but you ARE legally allowed to drive down it including cabs. In fact, there is a space owned by the hotel on it to unload luggage. Rates are 30 euro a day, negotiated by the hotel and charged on your bill.

Hotel restaurant: breakfast, included, is superb. The acorn fed jamon is superb. We also had dinner there which I felt was just average. Service is good. Prices are high. Drinks on the roof top terrace were nothing special and it was the only time we received poor service.

Check -in: smooth. Offered a welcome drink while reservations for a table at the restaurant were arranged. We had the best table. All staff speak English.

The room:  wow. We stay in the best. Not bragging. Just giving a base line. I've been to over 45 countries and I'll actually remember this hotel. Very comfortable. We had a room, third floor, overlooking the placa. I booked very late, just a few days before. The soundproofing of this hotel is Amazing. Zero noise. Zero light. The bathroom is beautiful, the shower room contains a bath, marble power shower and full size Molten Brown products. High quality linens on the very comfortable bed. Floor to ceiling artwork. Complimentary minibar always restocked (juice, water still and sparking, selection of sodas). Fruits and sweets in the evening. Slippers in women's sizes for once. Immaculate wooden floors. The room was large by Euro standards. Powerful hairdryer and ample outlets provided.

Room drawbacks: two: wifi in the rooms is not strong. It gets better in the reception. Secondly, I had a cold for the first part of my trip and there were no bin liners in the trash can. I was very worried that the housekeeper would come in contact with the Kleenex I had disposed of in the trash can overnight from my copious nose blowing bedside and thus catch my cold! For the protection of staff I would suggest bin liners.

Concierge: Ruth was very professional with booking restaurant reservations. I also found a superb place on my own Sensi Tapas, about 10 minutes by foot, that was the best. Pedro, on checkout was also great.

Lastly, one of the other great things about the DO is that they don't nickel and dime you like other hotels. We will be back and I'll stay no place else. Location is excellent and a taxi stand is right outside the door. The archaeological museum, Bari gothic neighbourhood, la rambler neighbourhood and placa reial are right on your doorstep. Great hotel, outstanding staff. Worth the price.",5,2015,06,14
32,Beautiful hotel in a busy spot,"The Hotel DO is right on the Placa Reial.  When we told the cab driver the address, she was very expressive about it being a pedestrian spot, not a place she could drive to  She also made it very clear that we should protect our belongings (but you will hear that from anyone about Barcelona).  She spoke no English, we spoke no Spanish, but we got the point.
Turns out that the hotel is on the Placa, and you have to get out on La Rambla and walk a very short distance.  The entrance is a bit confusing as it looks like a restaurant with menus on pedestals outside the door (they do have both an inside and outside restaurant).  Apparently enough people are confused by the entrance that if you pass by slowly with a suitcase, someone will come out to ask you if you are looking for the hotel.
The hotel is a boutiques hotel, meaning that there is no real lobby, just a small desk with a person to check you in, the elevator is big enough for two, and the rooms are going to be unique.  Service and attentiveness of the staff was outstanding, and the room was wonderful.  
The rooms are adjacent to the Placa and we happened to be staying the night FC Barcelona played Juventus for the European championship.  The partying after went pretty much all night and a lot of people hang around the Placa.  Despite that, the room was relatively quiet and we really weren't too disturbed.
The location right on La Rambla is perfect for shopping and the Gothic Quarter is nearby.  However, for seeing the sights, plan to take a cab or one of the hop on/hop off base services.  The buses are about a half mile or so up the avenue.
The restaurant at the hotel was excellent for dinner and reasonable.  Sitting out on the Placa is a very enjoyable way to spend the evening.  Expect a wait though, as it is a very busy place on weekends.  Breakfast was included in our room rate and was also very good.
This was the end of a long vacation trip for us, and I wish we had more time to see the city, but the Hotel DO Placa Reial is definitely worth saving up for.",5,2015,06,10
32,Charming hotel in great location,"I truly enjoyed my stay at the hotel. 
The location is fantastic on plaza reial. The single room while small 18sqm is smartly designed and the high ceiling make it feel much more spacious. The staff is very friendly and helpful. The breakfast (include do) and the restaurant are very good.
Wifi was a bit slow. It was very quiet despite the central location   ",5,2015,06,09
32,Another amazing stay,"An amazing stay at this beautiful hotel.  We stayed with our friends at the hotel over New Year  2014 and had the most wonderful time.  So wonderful that within a week we had all booked a return visit.  We all have very busy working lives and couldn't wait to return to the city, the hotel and the sun.  We booked through the hotel website and had cava and tapas on arrival on the roof terrace.  It was a lovely start to our 5 day break.  The staff, service and food were faultless.  The food is amongst the best I have ever had.  It was my birthday during our stay and we had breakfast on the roof terrace which was amazing and a large piece of birthday cake was brought to our table too.  I cannot recommend this hotel enough.  It really is a 5 star luxury experience.  There are reviews which say it is noisy at night.  We didn't find that an issue. To stay in the bustle of this lovely square for us was part of the experience and not a negative.  We stayed in room 24 overlooking the square the room was beautifully furnished with a huge double bed.  Cannot wait to plan our next trip !!",5,2015,06,07
32,Hotel DO,"Absolutely wonderful hotel centrally located on the Placa Reial.  Easy to walk to many places in Barcelona.  The staff was extremely accommodating and helpful.  When I requested reservations on the rooftop terrace for a light dinner for a group of 7, I was informed the terrace did not open for guests until June, but they would be happy to arrange a private  dinner there  for us if I would like them to do so.  The 7 of us had a wonderful evening with great food and wine and great service.  Will recommend to anyone staying in Barcelona.",5,2015,06,05
32,Our Hotel for Life in Barcelona,"First of all, book through the Hotels web-site and you get a lot of offers, like Welcome drink, free parking (we got it !!) etc etc. 
The staff was really friendly and ensured we got the best service possible.
Due to us being Hotel guests, they gave us priority for seating at the outside terrace for dinner.
We stayed in Room 35 (Superior Double Room), it wasn't facing the Plaza, but it was very soundproof and we could not hear any noise and slept well all 3 nights. The room comes with the free mini-bar (so you don't have to keep buying water bottles for the night). Every evening they provide fresh fruits in room and a pack of sugary treats (marsh mellows or chocolate or candies).
Very neat and clean, the housekeeping staff is very discreet. Every evening we came back to the room with the blinds closed, the slippers laid out and if  you come back in the room after breakfast, the blinds are opened up and the room is all fresh and airy :-)
The Tapas bar terrace on the Plaza Reial is a lovely place to sit, drink, eat and people watch. We spent lovely hours there relaxing and chilling out.
The complimentary breakfast is awesome. One of the best hotel breakfasts ever, with a lovely basket of fresh baked bread varieties and orange juice, and then you order from the menu for whatever you want.
The staff, especially Valentina on the bar, Magnus and Christhian at the service, Galin and Albert at the reception, were really fantastic.

Please do go there for your stay and you won't be disappointed.",5,2015,06,05
32,The best,"My husband and I have travelled extensively over the past 15 years and always stay at GOOD hotels-this was simply the best. The staff all speak/understand English which is unusual in Spain. The location is great but it is the staff and amenities that make it. Breakfast is fantastic, a full hot and cold selection, fresh coffee and juices. The place is spotlessly clean and the little things I could go on and on about. Personalised information folders, welcome drink and tapas, complimentary fruit each afternoon and something sweet at night. There is a lot of love and pride in this hotel and it shows. The staff are polite, helpful and not in the least arrogant. This is a true joy. We had room 47 which was a mini suite. Large comfortable bed, great toiletries, large shower-no tub, separate toilet. Spotless and attentive to detail. We also had our own lap pool. I am so impressed with this place we might fly from Australia just for the hotel-not Barcelona. I will see if our room is available for two weeks in June 2016 and we could very well be back. GO THERE, you will not regret it",5,2015,06,02
32,Gastronomic 5-star boutique with great service,"My wife and I stayed 3 nights at the DO Placa Reial on a weekend visit to Barcelona. This is a small boutique hotel located at the nice and lively Placa Reial and I must say that it's difficult to find anything but positives to write about the DO. All other positive Trip Advisor reviews give a correct picture of this lovely hotel. 
The hotel itself is of high quality with nice, modern rooms. Our room had a large fantastic bathroom with a walk in rain shower and bath tub. Similar to many other hotels in Barcelona, on the hotel roof overlooking the Placa Reial, there's a small swimming and bar/restaurant. The bar was closed when we stayed there, but the hotel staff still brought food and drinks to the roof on our request and we had our lunch up there every day in the sun. 
I have to highlight the service and the quality of the food at the hotel, which is really good. There was never a 'no' from the staff and they always did their best to meet our requests. In addition they also have these 'little' extra amenities like a free welcome drink, free bottle of wine and a tapas meal since we booked directly with the hotel, free minibar (no alcohol in the minibar), free breakfast with a very good selection to choose from, chocolate and fruit put in the room every day, free WiFi etc.
 
PS - recommend to try the lunch or dinner menu at the hotel. 

I highly recommend the DO Placa Reial.",5,2015,05,30
32,Little Treasure,"There is nothing like a warm welcome after a long journey. That is just what we got when we arrived at the DO. We darted through the courtyard and entered the world of the DO. Ilaria greeted us and we knew we were in good hands. The lobby is welcoming and offers a quiet spot to sit and plan an excursion. The rooms are lovely with an endless supply of cold drinks. The linens are exquisite both in the bedroom and the bath. Indecision may strike as one decides whether to take a soaking bath or a rain shower. In either case, there are wonderful amenities to use. The breakfast is superb and one can eat on the terrace and both savor the perfectly prepared food and watch the people stream by. One can easily walk to the harbor, through the old town and up to the Cathedral and see other Gaudi buildings. We know we will be welcomed back when we return.",5,2015,05,27
32,No review could do justice,"We stayed for 6 nights and found it hard to tear ourselves away from this hotel. Firstly, the staff cannot be faulted. They are friendly, unobtrusive when necessary and all do their jobs to such a high standard we salute them. Nothing is too much trouble to the staff and their number one priority is their guests.
Our room faced the lane connecting the square to La Rambla...occasionally noisy but with double glazed windows and shutters, hardly a problem. Our bed was very comfortable, the bathroom was wonderful. My husband's only suggestion for improvement was the need for a comfortable chair (a stool was provided though)..but that was a bit picky!
Cleanliness is important to us, and the room was clean and kept clean every day of our stay..and special treats appeared like fruit every day, and other sweet treats. 
Breakfast was excellent with a great menu choice and could be eaten in the peaceful downstairs room, or on the terrace onto the square.
The square can be noisy, and the performers ever present, but this is what visiting Barcelona should be like. The hotel is situated close to La Rambla, an incredible array of great restaurants and a hidden treasure Palau Guell within meters (a don't miss Gaudi construction). 
Don't miss a chance to stay here if you travel to Barcelona.",5,2015,05,25
32,"Excellent, excellent, excellent!","This elegant boutique hotel right off La Rambla over-looking Place Reial is a gem!  From the location, the wonderful amenities offered, the wonderful staff and service - this hotel is it!  And did I mention the bathroom and the shower?  OMG!  Fresh fruit each afternoon and a special sweet treat each evening.  Food wonderful and the breakfast exceptional!  This will be our hotel for Barcelona!",5,2015,05,25
32,Just SO,"With consistent and exquisite attention to detail this boutique hotel is just so! Quality design throughout ranging from Bang & Olufsen phones, to Loewe TVs to elegant art, to beautiful joinery finishes. And so DO goes.
And then there is the location. Just great to gaze out over the square with its constant parade of pedestrians, performers and prancers.
And the food is of a par. Quality. Ambience and attentive, informed but never intrusive or overbearing.
Just a great all round show at DO. ",5,2015,05,25
32,Excellent,"The hotel is smaller than what we expected from the photos but it's at a great location (we walked everywhere from the hotel without taking a metro), staff are wonderful, the room has nice furniture and generous closet space, the security is excellent, and the foods are absolutely fantastic (compliments to the chef!!). We stayed there two nights after a month cruise in the Mediterranean and this was a very nice ending to our vacation. We really come to love Barcelona (we'd been there a few times before but didn't feel the same way). Thank you very much for the wonderful experience. We highly recommend this hotel to the travelers who come to Barcelona.",5,2015,05,24
32,Fabulous,"This hotel is a small boutique hotel just off Las Ramblas and overlooking the Placa Reial.  The location is excellent, there are lots of restaurants nearby, the metro is a stones throw away and if you are happy to walk, you can walk all the way up to Ave Diagonal or down to Barceloneta and the beach front.
We had a Superior Double room and it was well equipped with comfortable bed, lots of storage, in room safe, bath, double sink, shower with good water pressure and good wifi.  
For breakfast you could choose anything on the breakfast menu and at night we would get a treat to eat, left in the room each night.
The hotel is situated on a busy square, but once the shutters and windows are closed and the heavy curtains are drawn, there is no light and no noise. We had no problems sleeping at all.
I would definitely stay here again if I am ever lucky enough to return to Barcelona, thank you DO Placa Reial for the very enjoyable stay.",5,2015,05,20
32,Just perfect!,"A small boutique hotel in the gothic district right off the Rambas. It's an easy walk to so many places. The staff was so helpful with directions maps etc. The room was so comfortable, a great bed!!!!!!Wait til you see the bathroom!!!! The bathroom gets a 10 out of 5 . This is way boutique hotels are the way to go. We loved it",5,2015,05,19
32,"Staff, Service and Property were excellent!",This was the best place to stay at while visiting the Gothic district. When you walk in to this hotel you feel like you've found an obvious little secret right in front of the Plaza Reial.  The hotel has so much character. The view from the top of the terrace was beautiful. The breakfast that is included was excellent. We loved the coffee. The plaza is very busy at night and a bit loud but once you close your windows the sound is drowned out. We will definitely be returning to this hotel and we would definitely recommend it.,5,2015,05,18
32,Perfect boutique hotel in a perfect location,"This is the kind of hotel we search for everywhere - a small boutique hotel in a great location with excellent staff and a great breakfast. There are connecting rooms to allow a family of five to book and stay together, which is important when I come back with my wife and kids.

I only stayed one night, arriving around 7pm from Tortosa and leaving for the airport at 8am. Check-in was perfect, with a welcome drink of local cava. The room was gorgeous, with eight (I think) pillows, a huge bathroom and a great view overlooking the Placa Reial. Sleep quality was excellent. I was never aware of the noise in the square (from room 24) that others have mentioned. Traveling solo, the double room was easily large enough, and the wifi was the best that I had at any of my hotels in Spain. 

I walked around the city taking photos at sunset and then ended up back at the hotel for dinner. Great tapas and wine, sitting right on the square, for about 24 Euros. Breakfast in the morning was in the basement, since I had to eat early before heading to the airport. Great fresh-squeezed juice, and my omelet was excellent. Really nice to have that included. The mini-bar in the room was great too. With kids it's nice to have (free) juice options available anytime. 

Usually in my reviews I list the positives and negatives everywhere I stay. I honestly saw no negatives. It's now on my short list of my favorite boutique hotels in Europe and I can't wait to come back.",5,2015,05,08
32,Amazing Hotel in the City Centre,"Hotel Do - would I go again, absolutely.  This is a beautiful boutique hotel in the middle of Barcelona.  I know many people have complained about the noise during the night, but this did not impact our stay.

The quality of the rooms is 2nd to none, and if you can I would suggest you get a room on the 1st floor.  Our room had a living room area, bedroom area, amazing bathroom with molton brown products, big fluffy towels and dressing gowns, and 2 balconies.  One of the balconies overlooked Placa Reial.

The service and attention to detail is excellent and on my last night I returned to my room to find a bottle of Cava and cakes and a note to wish me happy birthday.

We did not have time to try the Spa or rooftop pool, but it will definitely be on our agenda during our next visit.

The location is fabulous, close to La Rambla, Gothic quarter, Bocedera Market, and the Metro.

The breakfasts are fabulous and you can just sit outside on the terrace and eat your breakfast as you watch the world go by.

All in all a fabulous short break (which I would have liked to have been longer).",5,2015,05,06
32,Perfect Stay!,"My only regret about the Do is that I could not stay longer! The hotel is a stylish, refined oasis set in the bustling and lively Placa Reial. The location is perfect for those who want to explore the Ramblas and the Gothic Quarter. The service was warm and seamless, with many extras such as a glass of cava at check in, fruit delivered in the afternoon and warm cookies at turn down. Our room was spotless and the bed heavenly. I highly recommend if you like small boutique hotels with personalized service.",5,2015,05,04
32,"Great location, brilliant service","We booked the hotel due to its great location just off La Rambla.  Our room had a balcony over looking the main square, which was great when eating our breakfast fast each morning.  The staff were extremely helpfully and service was faultless.  Had everything we wanted.",5,2015,04,28
32,Great Hotel,"Just got back from 7 night stay. We were thrilled with all aspects of our stay. The double superior room on the second floor was a good size, it was cleaned daily to an excellent standard. The staff were brilliant, very helpful, friendly and professional. Our room overlooked the square and whilst it is lively all night we were not troubled by disturbing noise once the shutters and double glazed doors were shut.  I have experienced a lot more noise in London hotels. 
We would definitely stay here again. Great location in a great city.",5,2015,04,27
32,good not great,"I thought that from TripAdvisor reviews that we had booked somewhere really special
Although the location is excellant just off the Ramblas, the ""pedestrianised"" Placa Reial is very busy.
Our room faced onto the Placa and the double glazing kept most of the noise out, but not the sound of the scraping of the restaurant chairs as they closed around midnight. We were woken every morning by the sound of pavement cleaning machines and many lorries making deliveries to the multitude of restaurants around the Placa.
Despite booking a Superior Double we found it small and not a room you would want to sit and relax in. The hotel doesn't have a lounge, only a couple of settees in the reception/bar area which isn't condusive to say sit and read for an hour or so.

Breakfast menu sounded good, but our eggs were often cold when they were served. I sent my poached eggs back twice as they were virtually uncooked. 

The redeeming feature for us was the staff who were very friendly and helpful.",3,2015,04,25
32,"Good hotel, great staff","Boutique hotel on Placa Reial, very handy for many attractions and Metro etc. the room was very clean and comfortable, if a little small. Breakfast was good and the staff were very helpful especially when they became used to our requests.
All the staff were very pleasant, nothing was too much trouble. If we were to return to Barcelona we would stay there again, I guess that says it all!",3,2015,04,24
32,Hotel deserving of a top rating,"We stayed in this hotel for 8 days. The room and service were first class. Our room was made up every time we left the hotel. Our room was facing the square, which is lovely with lots of people and restaurants. The windows and wooden shutters give you enough privacy at night.  It can get noisy but not to the point that it is disruptive. The all-inclusive breakfast was lovely -- freshly squeezed orange juice, omelettes, crepes, and daily baked croissants.  

The hotel is centrally located just behind of La Rambla. It is a short walk to beautiful areas such as the Gothic area and El Born. If you want to stay in a boutique hotel with first class service in the heart of La Rambla - I highly recommend this hotel.",5,2015,04,19
32,Amazing food....uncomfortable room,"We stayed 4 nights in this hotel...a standard twin bed room...so thus critique is based on our experience in this size room...I cannot speak for the larger rooms. 

The service and every aspect of the food and beverage is absolutely incredible...everything appeared to be homemade and was delicious. 

They went out of their way to help us find food for our baby to eat...

The room was the source of all bad experiences during our stay...long hairs on stuck to bottom of our feet from walking on the floor after checkin...not our hairs...the lighting us insane....there are switches everywhere...unmarked so you do not know what they control...if you go to bathroom at night you unknowingly turn on the main bedroom lights from inside the bathroom...and there are switches that cut power to the entire room..so if you leave room and have it switched off nothing charges.... And our baby pressed the switch and it put us all I complete darkness and we stumbled around hunting for buttons to turn lights and power back on. The worst is at night when you turn lights on accidentally and wake everyone up...this happened three times per night in our room. 

The bedside tables are actually ceramic glazed plant stands and the top is size of a dinner plate and us not flat..rounded slightly...so anything up put onto it(there is a lamp consuming most of the space) slips of...iPads...phones...they don't fit and they slide off onto floor. Small issue but its a pain when you are looking for somewhere to rest your phone or water.

The ac did not work...it would only cool for a minute and turn off. This went on all day and night and we had to get up every 20 minutes to reactivate it after we woke up sweating. Terrible.

The noise penetrated the windows...it went on all night...we were on 3rd floor...must be really bad on lower floors. If you book this hotel you have to understand that they cannot fix the noise...

The last night we arrived back after room had been cleaned and I stepped on a shard of glass...it was small so I overlooked it.... Then I started packing and checked edge of bed for things to pack and found a huge chunk from the base of a glass bottle....liking around I then noticed so many shards of glass shining in the light and I collected at least 20 before housekeeping came to clean the floor....my baby had a piece in her foot also after I checked her. The cleaner was only using a shaggy mop broom to remove the glass..I had to insist that they vacuum....obviously there housekeeping policy is to sweep not vaccum otherwise there would be no hair of glass in my room. My baby could have been hurt badly if she stepped on the glass or found the chink and put it in her mouth. 

I complained to the manager when we checked out but she did little to make me feel like she cared... She was happy to see us get unto the taxi. In a situation like this the hotel should have been more apologetic and should have compensat end us for the discomfort and lack of cleaning in our room.

The owner needs to spend a night in the room is was in...33... To understand where they can improve the guest experience.",1,2015,04,19
32,Enchanting hotel in lovely setting,"We spent a night in Barcelona between arriving on a trans-Atlantic cruise and flying home and based on reviews on TA we chose the Hotel DO at the Pla√ßa Reial.  We loved it (with one minor hesitation...)

We arrived early and were lucky to find that our room was ready.  It was a Junior Suite on the first floor with lovely view onto the Pla√ßa and the little street beside the hotel.  The room had incredibly high ceilings and was well furnished and spacious.  The bathroom was beautiful with a huge shower with room for two to shower together!   The bed was very comfortable - loads of pillows to choose from - and the room was impeccably clean.  I cannot say enough great things about the staff.  They are a delight.  Friendly, English speaking (we don't speak Spanish unfortunately) and could not do enough to make us feel at home.

We had both lunch and dinner at the hotel, sitting on the terrace and watching all the ""action"" on the square.  The food was excellent and service prompt and friendly.  Breakfast was included in the room rate and we could choose anything from the menu.  Most hotels just have buffets but here you simply order what you want.

The roof terrace is very pretty, with a small plunge pool.  Had it been summer an ap√©ro up there before dinner would have been great.

The free WiFi is very fast and we could both logon to it at the same time.

My only hesitation is the noise from the square.  It went on till very early in the morning and though we shut the shutters and the windows (AC is excellent by the way so no problem there) it did bother my husband.  I sleep with earplugs anyway and perhaps this is the simple solution - the hotel could supply individually wrapped earplugs for guests to use and discard.  Or one can just bring one's own.   It would be really worth it because this hotel is a gem and Spain being Spain there is not a whole lot that can be done to make the square any quieter at night!

I would stay there again in a flash - and bring earplugs for my husband!",5,2015,04,17
32,Wonderful Time and Great Hotel,My wife and I recently spent 3 days at this hotel recently and we had a great time.  We had a room over the square and we had zero issues with noise.  I would highly recommend staying at this hotel if you are in Barcelona.,5,2015,04,16
32,Great central hotel,"This was our first visit to Barcelona and therefore we did not really know what we were letting ourselves in for!
We chose the hotel based on its proximity to the main touristic street in Barcelona La Rambla. It is set on the corner of a pretty square Pla√ßa Reial and we had room 25 on the second floor which looked out on the entrance to the square. You could stand on the balcony and look left on to the square or right to La Rambla. The d√©cor is modern contemporary, a large comfortable double bed high ceilings and modern bathroom with both bath and shower and separate toilet ‚Äì the shower was amazing and was stocked with Molton Brown toiletries!
We had the ‚Äúpleasure‚Äù of being in Barcelona when there was football match between Manchester City and Barcelona ‚Äì The MC fans congregated in the square and to say they were noisy was an understatement! That said the hotel had good sound proofing as unless you opened the window you could not hear them in the bedroom. It was a testament to the Spanish authorities that in the morning there were no signs of the activities of the night before!
The restaurant La Cuina del DO was in the vaulted basement and served a delicious menu inspired by the local cuisine. We were well looked after by the Pere & Magnus in the restaurant in the evening and had a lovely breakfast served by other waiter/waitress whose names I did not get.
If like us and had not planned anything or booked any tickets online before you left home then we found Elena on reception very helpful in guiding us in the right direction.
Overall the experience here was great for going off the beaten track and wandering around the back streets of the Gothic Quarter.",5,2015,04,16
32,Intimate luxury and no attention spared,"We had the pleasure of staying four nights at Hotel Do (Room 22) and enjoyed each and every one!  Our beautiful accommodations overlooked Placa Reial with a mini balcony and French doors which cancelled all noise when closed and locked, or let the lively sounds of the square waft in when open.  The bathroom was superb with double vanity; full rain shower and bathtub, each with a handheld sprayer; towel warmer; separate water closet; and complimentary Molton Brown toiletries.  The bedding was sumptuous with a pillow menu designed to cater to your specific needs, and a selection of room scents to choose from for the extra personall touch.

We enjoyed the spa/sauna only briefly, but it too was an additional available indulgence.

The staff was engaging, thoughtful and highly efficient! We became especially fond of Ingrid, who made wonderful recommendations from food and wine choices to interesting locales to visit in Barcelona.  However, all of the staff was fantastic with each member providing exceptional service individually and collectively working together as a smooth and seamless team!  

The food was wonderful both at breakfast in the restaurant and tapas on the terrace.  I had perhaps the best scallops ever, which practically melted in my mouth, and the fish puffs were divine!  We did not choose to have dinner in the restaurant this trip, but expect it is similarly excellent.  

All in all, our stay at Hotel Do was a little slice of heaven and we long for the day we can return!",5,2015,04,14
32,A gem amidst La Rambla!,"I found myself here for a quick weekend break  to relax and soak up a little of Barcelona. I was extremely anxious about the potential of being stuck in the noisy, tourist district. However I knew from the minute that we checked in that we would be well looked after. Staff did everything they could to accommodate us during our stay. 

The room was fantastic, we were in 31 which overlooked Placa Reial, the view was great and lively. Having worried about the noise, the turndown service certainly came in handy; shutters and windows were shut, curtains drawn and you were in your own little cocoon. As a light sleeper, I only struggled to sleep when the window was open. Otherwise, the room itself was beautiful, the bed, quirky art, the beams, the bathroom... it was all of such a high standard. We loved the Molton Brown products, all inclusive minibar, Nespresso machine and afternoon fruit and turndown treats. It was so nice to get a weather forecast printed and left for us each evening, we found these little touches made our stay even better than we imagined.

The best thing however has to be the breakfast. We were given a menu to fill out each night which we filled to our heart's content, chose a breakfast time and awaited a feast in our room. The food was fantastic; eggs, pastries, toast, fruit, yoghurt, salmon, sausages, bacon - whatever tickles your fancy! The orange juice was fresh, the coffee was smooth, the Cava was lovely and the hot chocolate - divine! 

We can't wait to come back someday. This was a truly divine experience, definitely one of the best hotels I've ever had the luxury of staying at. Thank you Pedro, for looking after us during our time at Hotel DO Placa Reial.",5,2015,04,13
32,best location with great light,"This hotel is right in the middle of the gothic quarter madness and overlooks the Pla√ßa Reial. Hotel staff are friendly and efficient. Shower is very nice, linens are good, bed is comfortable. Wifi is very slow. Nice style, extremely high ceilings. Our visit was too short (only about 16 hours) to comment on other amenities.",5,2015,04,11
32,DO NOT STAY HERE-PLEASE hear my warning!!,"My family and I came to this hotel and paid $600 a night for a Junior suite. The junior suite is a room which is about 14 x 14'. The service is horrible, the concierge was rude and basically did not look up. We got charged extra for a rollaway bed to the tune of $133 a night. And worst of all we could not sleep because the sound of the courtyard was deafening until 630 AM. Your better off staying in the youth hostel. Do not waste your money on this hotel! We have traveled throughout Italy throughout Portugal and throughout spayed and have never stated a hotel this bad.  You literally not get to sleep until 6:30 AM.  The only person I could recommend this too is a college kid that wants to stay up all night and all day and has $600 to burn onto A sub par hotel room. Warning stay away!  I will be calling both trip advisor and Expedia to get a full refund on this hotel.  Additionally this restaurant have the only hotel in the courtyard with an empty restaurant. When we ask the locals why they said the prices were astronomical and the food was less than good.",1,2015,04,11
32,Boutique hotel at the center of the Old City,"Hotel Do reminded me of the no. 1 TA hotel in Kyoto - Hotel Mume.  This hotel at the center of Barcelona's Old City area, right at the corner of the Placa Reial.

Once I booked the hotel, I started to read about comments to advise tourists to stay out of the Las Ramblas area because of the high pick-pocketing rate.  Worried in the beginning but decided to stick to our original choice.  It turned out not to be a wrong one.  It was very fine and the hotel location is quite convenient as a base to visit the Port Vell, Market La Boqueria, Gotic and Born area (all within walking distance).  

The hotel is very small and only has 18 rooms and we stayed in a twin bed room.  The building itself must be renovated from a building with history.  The room's ceiling is super high (actually highest among the hotels I've ever stayed in) with very nice European old style window shades and balcony.  Even though the building is very old aged, the interior design is very modern on the contrary and decorated in a stylish way.  The toilet and shower area is out of proportion large compared to the sleeping area.  Unfortunately I have to say the design is a little bit user unfriendly especially the beds are very small even to Asian people.  My blanket kept falling off to the ground at night. The side bed tables were tiny and one side does not have desk lamps (even small one) so a bit inconvenient at night for one party. Another down side is the lack of storage space - we can hardly find a spot to put our luggage so it was a little bit inconvenient especially we stayed for four consecutive nights.

Some comments mentioned about the noise downstairs at the Placa Reial.. not really a trouble to us at all.  May be I was just too tired every night after the packed visit of the city.

The hotel does come with a lot of nice add-in service - e.g. daily a la carte breakfast (can choose between serve in-room or in the restaurants downstairs), free daily replenished mini bar, fruits and snacks, welcome drinks when check-in, etc.  I must also mention their great help in restaurant reservations ever since we made the reservation months ago.  This is indeed very important especially some local restaurants never picked up emails or calls.  It's their help to get us tables at high-ranking TA restaurants such as Tast-ller and Petit Pau.

Overall, I have to say it was indeed a very comfortable stay and Hotel Do really made me feel like home.  Thanks to all their staff's help and lovely smile all the time.",4,2015,04,07
32,Within walking distance of nearly everything one wishes to see.,"Beautiful, spacious and comfortable rooms over looking the Placa Reial. Great breakfast served at the hotel restaurant right on the Placa. Close to the beach, the Picasso museum, fresh markets, Gaudi houses and much more.",5,2015,04,04
32,A hotel with everything..,"We were only in Barcelona for the one night on this trip, but I can't say quite how happy I am these it was Hotel DO that we ended up in.

From the moment of arrival right up to checking out, we really couldn't have been treated better. We arrived 4 hours before check-in but thought we'd be cheeky and turn up on the off-chance that our room was ready. We were asked to take a seat and offered a complimentary drink. In the time it took us to polish of an espresso, we were told that our room was ready. 

The room we booked was a junior suite. For a boutique hotel, the room size were excellent. Whilst it was a junior suite, there was nothing junior about it. The room had a large window that could be opened that looked out over Placa Reial. The room itself had lots of space, a nice big sofa and a gigantic bathroom. The things that really stood out at Hotel DO was their attention to detail and quality. Rather than a kettle there was a coffee machine.  Rather a cheap stereo there was Bang and Olufsen. We received a welcome pack from concierge which even had some personalised business cards with my name on!! Every detail had clearly been carefully thought about.

After heading out and getting some lunch at a local bar, we returned to find a small platter of chocolate covered strawberries in our room which made the perfect dessert. 

Everyone at Hotel DO did everything they could to make our stay as easy as possible. From the door staff, to front desk, to concierge and bar the bar staff.  Being the useless but eager linguist that I am, I even asked someone at front desk forms couple of phrases which they happily obliged.

Finally, food and drink. As seems to be the trend with this hotel, it was fantastic. The nice change of pace was the fact that it was a la carte instead of buffet. Whilst you can be lucky with buffet breakfasts; late risers like us can often end up with the tail end. We came downstairs at around 10 and were handed the menu and asked for drinks. A pot of tea, a cup of fresh coffee and a couple of glasses of fresh juice arrived shortly after. The breakfast was excellent. Eggs Benedict and hash both came out quickly and hot. 

I'm still disappointed that we only had the one night at Hotel DO and am still looking forward to going back. It was the 5th time that I've stayed in Barcelona and it was definitely the first time anywhere had stood out. 

To all the staff that we encountered on our night at your hotel ‚Äì thank you!! :)

PS. If you stay here don't be tempted by the restaurants on the Placa. Look only 100 yards further afield and you'll find some real gems, which we most definitely didn't find on the Placa.",5,2015,04,03
32,Luxury and privacy in the heart of Las Ramblas,"This hotel is superb. From the moment we arrived the staff were professional, polite and attentive. The location is perfect in the centre of Las Ramblas but you would never know this once inside. The hotel is an oasis of peace and quiet and the perfect contrast to the hustle and bustle of the streets outside. The building, rooms and decor are gorgeous. Breakfast is superb with lots of interesting and homemade choices. The private steam room and sauna is perfect for relaxing. There is a very small dip pool and nice roof terrace as well as a lovely terrace overlooking the Placa Reial square. The metro is 2 minutes walk and taxi's are just outside. This real is the perfect choice if you want to enjoy the City yet also be able to relax at the same time. ",5,2015,04,03
32,The place to stay in Barcelona,"Perfect small hotel with perfect location, friendly staff who made us feel at home. Cant wait until next visit, when we also will enjoy the roof terrace. The food is very good and you can walk anywhere.",5,2015,04,01
32,OMG - One of our best hotel stays ever!!!,"My wife and I recently visited Barcelona for the first time and booked a 4 night stay at the Hotel DO based on the positive reviews here on TA - sooooo glad we did.  This is a small boutique hotel - 18 rooms - but the service and attention to detail is 2nd to none.  Rooms are spacious and clean - and the hotel staff will do anything to make your stay more enjoyable.  The mid-afternoon snack is perfect - one day fruit, the next day chocolate covered strawberries, the next day chocolate truffle balls, etc.  A full bar and 2 restaurants in the hotel.  We didn't eat in the Cucina (except for breakfast each morning which was included with our booking) - but we did eat at the Terrassa tapas restaurant twice (the best potatoes brava in town).  Our booking (because we booked directly thru the hotel website) also came with a free bottle of wine that they delivered to our room, several free tapas, and a welcome glass of champagne.  The hotel is right in the middle of everything - very touristy - can be loud outside at night or during the day before Barca soccer games (but with the windows closed we heard nothing) - but so much going on at Placa Reial - great place to have a sangria or vermut and just people watch.  One of our favorite hotels ever.",5,2015,03,30
32,"A lovely hotel, can't fault it.","Great hotel, very old-styley and lovely. There are only 16 rooms so you're really made to feel welcome by the staff, they were so friendly, spoke perfect English, and were very accommodating, they let us check in a few hours early AND kept our bags for us on the last day so we wouldn't have to lug them around Barcelona until our flight. 
We had breakfast in bed on the Sunday, which was great as well. It's located just off La Rambla but inside the hotel it wasn't noisy at all, it was great that inside the hotel we could hardly hear anything, but as soon as we stepped outside it was all bustle and traffic. The Place Do Reial (the square) was lovely as well, some great bars to just sit and watch the world go by as well as the many school trips and buskers!
I would definitely stay there again, a lovely place.",5,2015,03,30
32,DO stay here!,My 22 year old daughter and I just took a quick trip to Barcelona and stayed at the Hotel DO for 3 nights. Neither of us had been to the city before and the location of the hotel was the perfect introduction. It sits on a picturesque square with Gaudi light posts and a fountain in addition to a plethora of bars and restaurants. We had a great time people watching while having drinks on the square. When we wanted to see more we walked a block away to Las Ramblas or continued to stroll through the Gothic quarter which is right there. A taxi stand and the Metro are very close as well. We joined a free walking tour our first morning that left at 11am daily right on the square. Our room was beautiful and the bathroom was great with a gorgeous sink that i would like to have at home. The free mini bar was a great touch as were the complimentary room service deliveries with sweets and fruit daily! On occasion we could hear street noise from our room but that's life in a city and a reminder that you're in the heart of it all. The highlight each morning was the breakfast that was included in our room rate. Upon sitting down you are served terrific coffee and a basket of pastries and it just gets better from there. It's all off menu..no cold ageing buffet here!! If you're looking for a big name hotel with all the whistles and bells or a beach vacation this place is not for you but if you want the best location in town along with great food and service and a luxurious and stylish room that has everything you need..it's here!,5,2015,03,29
32,Overated!!,"This hotel could not be rated 5 star. It is well located - if you want to be downtown - but the area around the hotel is a bit overcrowded and too touristic.
The hotel is very small and cramped, starting with the front desk.
The staff is good and they do try their best.
Beware of room 16! It is so small you hardly fit in, just a bed with 50cm around it, no place for luggage, window opening to a smelly aisle.
You can certainly find better hotel in Barcelona for similar value. Not worth it.",2,2015,03,24
32,Perfect Location!,"Our family stayed for 3 nights (4 rooms) and loved this hotel. 

The rooms are gorgeous- the bathrooms are really top notch for Europe, air conditioning works perfectly, and the staff is super friendly. 

We loved the breakfast on the terrace and the Spanish ham is to die for. It melts in your mouth and I'd easily have two plates of it every morning! Location is sooo key- right in the middle of everything, I'd stay here again in a heartbeat. All of us (ages 25 - 65) equally loved it.",5,2015,03,24
32,Loved the D.O.,"We really loved our stay at Hotel DO - the reviews below really capture all that we would say about location, quality, cleanliness, and comfort.  We just want to add another shout out to the staff, all of whom go above and beyond to make ones stay even better!  Thanks so much  for a great stay.",5,2015,03,16
32,"""A gem of a hotel""","This hotel is a gem! Every last detail in terms of aesthetics and practicality has been carefully considered in the impeccable restoration of this beautiful old building (18 rooms) located just off La Rambla on a beautiful square in the heart of the old city not far from the waterfront. A delicious full breakfast is included in the room rate and may be enjoyed in the hotel's restaurant, on the terrasse, or, weather permitting, by the pool on the roof of the hotel. The service from all of the staff, without exception, meets the highest standard that one might expect in a top quality hotel. Our stay was a joy.

32,Lovely boutique hotel,"Hotel Do is a small hotel (18 rooms) positioned on the corner of Las Ramblas and Placa Reial, so it really is in the heart of Barcelona. The rooms (our ours at least) were excellent, with tasteful decoration, high ceilings, lovely bathroom and balcony overlooking the street. The free soft drink mini bar is also a welcome bonus. The staff were also excellent, and all spoke good English.

The only warning I would make, is that due to the central location, you will get some street noise from the restaraunts and bars in the square below, until the early hours. Personally I wasn't particularly bothered by this, it added too the ambience (except for the drunken english voices, of which there were a few!) But if you are a light sleeper I would recommend some ear plugs.",4,2015,03,15
32,amazing experience,"great location,great room with a patio. staff is amazing they did all they can to keep us happy. very personal service, we were there for 4 nights and every night we would come to the room and find a new surprise. asked for a hair salon they found a great place and booked the appointment for me, they got my husbands clothes dry cleaned in less than 24 hours. this is the only place i would stay at in Barcelona. if you are planning on going there this is the place but book early",5,2015,03,11

Just go, you wont regret it.",5,2015,03,04
32,Very well hospitality in the heart of Barcelona,"This is great hotel with very well built rooms and serves with quality products. The only problem could be, for some people, the noisy Rambla and very aqustic Placa Reial. We did not suffer a lot though time to time I woke up and heard the noises despite the very good isolated windows.",5,2015,02,25
32,Fabulous Boutique Hotel in Barri Gotic,"Attention to detail in this intimate family-run hotel made our stay perfect. Everyone was extremely friendly and helpful and couldn't do enough for us. The bedroom was beautifully appointed with flat screen television and Molton Brown toiletries in the large bathroom. The complimentary mini-bar (non-alcoholic), fruit and sweets provided daily in the room were a nice touch. Breakfast was included, and you could choose anything from the a la carte menu. There is a small swimming pool on the roof terrace. In the summer this would be a lovely place to relax with a drink - in February it gave good views of Placa Reial. At the end of a busy day sightseeing in Barcelona we took advantage of the private sauna, making use of the dressing gowns and slippers provided. Would definitely recommend this hotel.

Placa Reial is a lively, noisy square with many restaurants and bars. It is well located, just off La Rambla in the Barri Gotic and a 5 minute walk from Port Vell.",5,2015,02,22
32,Family half term holiday,"Always wondered what a ""boutique "" hotel was. Now I know. Vastly superior service compared to large hotels. beautifully styled rooms.
Perfect central location with taxi rank nearby to get to and from airport and elsewhere. There is street noise into early hours which was variable throughout our 4 night stay is a price worth paying for the location. The Placa Reial area has smartened up since my last visit 10 years ago and the square is good to eat out and people watch even in winter. 
The hotel ,included breakfast, free soft drinks in minibar and daily surprise morsels in the rooms were appreciated.
Travelling with 2 children did not dine at gourmet restaurant but did have superior tapas siting outside.
Very good value for standard of accommodation and service(especially if you leave the kids at home).",5,2015,02,22
32,"Boutique, smart, good design, great service in centre of town","2nd visit. Warm welcome including drink. Good foyer and reception, great simple white rooms. Decent baths and power showers. Good restaurant in square, gourmet food in La Cuina. It really is the designer hotel for discerning travellers. Niggles. None. We were here for one night only, to see a dance performance at the Liceu. So convenient for Placa Reial and the Ramblas. Hard to fill in the 200 word minimum. It's all so good. ",5,2015,02,21
32,A wonderful hotel all round,"We stayed at Hotel DO Placa Reial for 5 nights in the deluxe double bed room and we enjoyed it very much. The staff are no less than amazing, always trying to help and very quick to any request, you really get the feeling they are doing everything to please you.
The room was very good, clean, big bathroom including a shower and a bathtub and a seperate room for the toilet, the complimentary minibar full of drinks was just delightful and they hurry up and refill it whenever you drank something.
Breakfast was indeed very good even if the courses are more restraurant size than hotel buffe but if that bothers you just order double of evertything, they dont mind.
The location couldn't be better, right on La Ramble and very close to a Metro station.
I honestly don't have a single complaint for this hotel, it was amazing, they even gave us a nice surprise gift since this was our honeymoon.",5,2015,02,21
32,We were blown away; when can we go back?!,"We stayed here for a night before a cruise, and at another Barcelona hotel after the cruise was done. The other hotel was incredibly fancy, but we loved Hotel DO the most! If we ever come back to Barcelona, we'll be staying here, hopefully in our same room: top floor with a perfect private terrace. <3 The bed was so comfortable, and we took twice as many showers than we needed because we loved the shower so much. The restaurant downstairs blew us away, too.",5,2015,02,20
32,We loved it.,"Small, sophisticated, tastefully decorated, central.
Very friendly and attentive staff. Small staff, so, at times, you must wait to be helped.
Excellent breakfast: fresh squeezed orange juice from heaven. They were able, on a short notice, to handle my gluten free requirements serving home baked delicious bread and muffins.
The area is a little noisy, but we hardly noticed it. 
The wifi is little slow, but you have time to nibble on a piece of fruit delivered daily to your room.
We simply loved it.",5,2015,02,19
32,Superb!!,"First time in Barcelona and looked at many hotels before picking this one. How lucky were we ?

From the minute we walked through the door nothing was too much trouble. The room was first class with a terrific view out on to the plaza. 

Breakfast was excellent and a great start to the day. Had tapas and bottle of red, in the restaurant, while watching life go by on the plaza on a couple of occasions and it was excellent. 

The whole experience was a joy and I cannot recommend the hotel enough. 

Only one hotel for us now should we ever go back to Barcelona. 

Thanks again. 
",5,2015,02,16
32,Second visit even better than the first,"We stayed at the same time last year and decided this time to try a Junior Suite.... amazing. Nothing is too much trouble here and we really couldn't find a fault. Some reviews mention noise - this was definitely not an issue for us in room 31. The turn down service shuts the blinds (and leaves treats) along with the double glazing and thick curtains we didn't hear a peep.

My last review went into the details, this time I'll just say we were able to relax from the second we walked through the door and I'm pleased to say we have another night here at the end of the month. If you're looking for a big corporate, soul-less hotel this is not the place for you. it's intimate (18 rooms I believe) and the staff know you and offer a service I don't think is possible in larger hotels.

I certainly won't be looking elsewhere for our 2016 stay. We had tapas and cava included in this offer and I have to commend the food on La Terraza, simply wonderful. You just need to book here.",5,2015,02,14
32,Early break.,"We stayed for three nights in this hotel, 3rd time in Barcelona but first time here.The hotel has lots of good points it is very clean and tastefully decorated, lots of little extras with fruit delivered to your room and turn down service.The staff were all very good and attentive. Breakfast was good but not the best with toast so hard we could not eat it and a limited menu but excellent fresh orange juice. The hotel is situated on la rambla and placa reial and this is why we booked it because it was so close to good restaurants and central to everything. We were given a room on 1st floor no 15 and this must be the worse room for noise as its on the alley way between the two with people shouting till 3 in the morning then the rumble of the trains starting early.So for a five star hotel we expected a better nights sleep so wont be staying here next time in Barcelona.",3,2015,02,13
32,""" deserving of a 5 star rating ""","Excellent staff, service and location. Couldn't fault this hotel. Polite and helpful staff. We're on our 4th night while writing this review and all the staff are so welcoming and helpful. The endless treats, the afternoon and evening snacks are an added bonus. Would definitely recommend this hotel...Hotel Do made our stay in Barcelona enjoyableüëç",5,2015,02,13
32,"Superb Hotel Do, yet again!!","This was our second visit to the Hotel Do after staying for just one night in 2014. 
This time we stayed for 3 nights and really didn't want to leave yet again!
The hotel is centrally located just off the Ramblas in the beautiful Placa Reial. Everything is within walking distance and the metro station is only a few minutes walk. 
Ruth on reception took care of our booking and we were pleased that we were allocated a high floor room as requested. 
Our room was 31, a junior suite on the corner of the building overlooking the square. 
The room was very spacious, light and airy and we felt at home again the minute we walked in. 
Very little noise was heard from the outside, only the odd rumble of the metro. 
The staff are fantastic and very attentive. We were lucky to book having an offer of a free bottle of cava and tapas which were all to die for. 
We are looking forward to returning at the end of the month after our travels and before we fly home and will definitely be back in 2016!",5,2015,02,12
32,Impressive!!,"I didn't knew how can I touched by 'a hotel'.
Small but classic and unique interiored room, a jar of flower, marvelous view of the plaza, perpect location, and very friendly service! 
Everything was perpect.

I visited many 5 star hotels, but this one is best for me. It was so comfortable stay.
Me and my hubby miss there so much.
",5,2015,02,11
32,Weekend in Barcelona,"We stayed 2 nights at this gorgeous hotel, a weekend away from children and Norwegian cold.
The hotel has charm, class, personal service and are one of the best hotels we have stayed at!
From enetering and getting a drink while we checked in to top service when we left also.
We stayed in a room -El Terrat, beautiful, often I get a bit dissapointed because the photos does not match the reality when you arrive, but at this hotel it does!!!
Room, food, staff , nothing bad to say, just book a room. We are definitly going back and will bring the children!

Charlotte , Oslo",5,2015,02,10
32,"Beautiful boutique hotel, central location","We stayed at the Hotel DO for two nights at Christmas. It being our first time in Barcelona, we were worried about coming during a major holiday and missing some of the sights. After booking, I emailed the Hotel DO with several questions - not only did they put my mind at ease about the time of year, but they went to the trouble of providing the holiday schedules and opening hours for the city's must-see attractions. That's the kind of service you just don't get at most large chain hotels. 

As far as the hotel property itself, we prefer boutique hotels (the kinds of places where you feel like the decor is probably different room-to-room). We had a corner room with two balconies overlooking the Placa Reial, and it was beautifully decorated. The locals (and tourists) in this area are definitely night owls, but the Hotel DO has really impressive soundproofing in their rooms. Noise does not penetrate those French doors! Funnily enough, the shower was a highlight - overhead rain shower with fantastic temperature controls and water pressure!

Location-wise, the hotel is right off Las Ramblas, which is a fun walk (even if it is touristy), and the Mercado de la Boqueria is just a few steps away. The hotel's central location made it easy to explore the city mostly on foot, but there also were always taxis waiting right outside on the corner for getting out of the city center. Overall, highly recommend and would stay again!",5,2015,02,06
32,A great hotel with a superb location,"We just spent 3 nights in Hotel DO, and enjoyed every minute.  The staff was more than attentive, the room very well equipped, a la carte breakfast was great, and the location ideal.
We like small boutique hotels with their special atmosphere and personality and this hotel has it all.",5,2015,02,05
32,Wonderful hotel,"I stayed at this hotel for a few nights in April 2014. This is possibly the best hotel I have ever been to. The staff was service minded and very friendly! I was offered a drink while my luggage was brought up to my room.
I tried the sauna which was so relaxing. Free mini bar and they bring you a treat everyday like fresh fruits, biscuits etc.
If I travel to Barcelona again I will definitely stay at this hotel again. Very beautiful decor. I wish I had tried the roof terrace.",5,2015,02,04
32,Small Boutique Hotel in a Great Location,"We had a short stay of 4 nights at the DO Hotel on our way home home to Australia and found it to be a very welcoming hotel.  We were greeted with a drink and shown to our rooms which were not overly large (superior double) for the price but they were very well appointed and the housekeeping was excellent (Without realising I left a bracelet in the safe and I was emailed straight away for it to be sent on).  There were also plenty of complimentary soft drinks in the fridge, fresh fruit and a treat was delivered daily which was a nice touch.  We would like to return in summer to take advantage of the rooftop terrace and restaurant, however, we were given complimentary tapas one day which we had outside on the Placa Reial which were excellent.

The only nuisance was one day they were filming a TV commercial so we couldn't use the hotel/restaurants all day.  The staff were excellent and very helpful with booking restaurants etc, the location is perfect - we walked and walked - it is next to the Rambla and also the Gothic quarter and a short walk to the beach area and taxis were readily available nearby to go to restaurants at night. 

 Would recommend although a little expensive for the facilities offered in wintertime.",4,2015,02,03
32,Wrong room and the staff know it!,"Hi, many thanks. 
I thought the location of the hotel was great as long as you don't want a beach hotel. the building is wonderful and I'm pleased the family have kept the character of the building and maintained the atmosphere. If I was making any changes, I would replace the lift with a glass lift. 
When I arrived I didn't find it easy to find the front door, so walked around the building first, so I would put a canopy over the entrance to make it a little more welcoming. 
The staff at reception were really polite and very welcoming and throughout my stay exceptional and very helpful. A really nice experience. 
It's always important to know the staff care about their guests and in your hotel, it seems to be the case.
The food and drink were excellent. The green tea is the best green tea I've tasted. I was really surprised by this.
My room had very high ceilings and two balconies and if you like a kind size bed you won't be disappointed. Perfect size and perfect pillows and linen. New crisp and very comfortable. 
The interior decor was basic and in need of a revamp, but working and functional and of very good quality.
You need a masters to work out how the lights work, but you will eventually get there. A little too complicated for me!
Again, beautiful bathroom with an unusual sink, but very good. The shower is perfect, the best I have ever used. Perfect water pressure, with a really large vintage style round showerhead and all controls were really simple to use, which makes a big difference. Also the temperature control was perfect. 
On the downside, I was very disappointed, that I had a washing machine going into spin cycle on and off for two hours between 12pm and 2am in the morning which disturbed my sleep on a Saturday night and Sunday morning. 
Additionally there is no is no inner door to the room I was staying in number 25 and the door opposite my bedroom door was a service door for the staff, which every time they accessed the door to use the service room, you can hear the snap of the lock opening and every  word said even if it is under the breadth. I also didn't appreciate the staff laughing and joking at the top of their voices at 4am in the morning for 30 minutes.

What was really disappointing, is the room cost 275 Euros for the night and I didn't get much sleep because of this fact and the hotel and staff will know this, as this is not just a problem I've had.  Unless I had a different room, I wouldn't stay at the hotel again, which is a great shame, as everything else about the hotel is perfect and as a boutique hotel should be.",4,2015,02,02
32,Charming hotel in fantastic location.,"This is a wonderful hotel located in an area that is close to so many of Barcelona's famous  sights. The employees are very friendly and helpful. The rooms are lovely, spacious and comfortable. Everyday a treat is brought to your room - such as fruit and sweets. The attached restaurant has delicious food and a lovely atmosphere. ",5,2015,01,31
32,Fabulous hotel and staff,"A great hotel and location. The staff friendly and helpful. Breakfast was lovely amd although we didn't have a main meal there it always smelled tasty.
Just off Las Ramblas and public transport just round the corner, everything is in easy reach. The staff are more than happy to advise and help with excursions and restaurant bookings.
Enjoy the fresh smoothies at the market and the fresh waffles and ice cream from the vendors.
Would certainly stay here again.",5,2015,01,30
32,What a hotel!,"Quite simply the best city break hotel I have stayed in. Great room, amazing shower, and very attentive staff who really made us feel welcome - and the bar was very decently priced too! and they offer breakfast in bed at no extra charge! In a word - amazing!",5,2015,01,29
32,One of the Best,"We spent 2 nights in this hotel over a weekend trip, and we only wished we had decided to spend more time here. The hotel is doing everything right and this was frankly one of the few times when we were sorry to leave. Firstly, location is awesome. Right off La Ramblas and easily accessible by metro (Liceu station). If you're coming from the airport, take the aerobus to Pl. Catalunya, and then it's just 1 stop from Catalunya metro to Liceu. Also, Liceu metro station is wheelchair access friendly, so if you're coming with tons of heavy luggage, this would be super helpful. 

Secondly, we couldn't stop raving over the warm and personable service. Having spent 3 months in Europe in a fair number of 4 and 5 star hotels, we have a pretty good basis for comparison and this hotel came out right on top. We felt right at home and nothing was too much for the staff. In addition, service was prompt and swift - When we rang downstairs with a faulty toilet issue, the staff was at our door as promised within the time period they said they would. And when we emailed with a request for restaurant reservation, the hotel responded within 30mins on the same day. 

Other small touches here and there also made this hotel shine through the lot. We loved the molton brown toiletries, the free drinks in the minibar, the turn down service every night (delicious chocolate truffles one night, and then grapes and cookies another night), and the delicious breakfast that they put out every morning. If you're feeling lazy you could also opt to have breakfast in the room as we did one morning at no extra charge. We also ate at the tapas bar in the hotel on the night we arrived, and whilst slightly pricey in comparison to the offerings around us, the food was so good that we ended up having lunch there again on our last day. Definitely try the sangria with cava and the scallops; you won't regret it.  

Our only complaint was the noise that we heard from our room every night. For a hotel that clearly spent a ton of money on the renovation and the fittings etc, it seemed a bit odd that they did not think to invest in double glazing windows with better sound proofing, given that the hotel faces placa reial. Nonetheless, we will definitely be returning to this hotel, but we will also be putting in a request for a quieter room.  

ps: Wifi was decent, although not the fastest.",5,2015,01,26
32,An excellent and amazing hotel,An excellent Location & staff. I extended my staying for one more night and staff are cooperatives. Very good breakfast. Daily free soft drinks in room minibar and special daily gift for us as couple. It was my honeymoon time and I'll be back again.

32,Barcelona's best,"On arriving at the small reception we wondered if the hotel would live up to it's excellent reviews. We needn't have worried. As we arrived early, our room wasn't quite ready so my husband and I were given complimentary drinks at the bar.  As the hotel is small the staff were able to respond to our needs instantly. We upgraded to a superior room which was very well presented. The addition of complimentary free drinks in the mini bar was very welcome. The hotel is conveniently located on La Rambla within easy walking distance of the Gothic Quarter. Thoroughly enjoyed our stay and if we return to the city would definitely stay there again.",5,2015,01,20
32,"Centrally located, just off La Rambla","We spent a very enjoyable 3 nights in Barcelona. We easily found the hotel as it is situated just off La Rambla. On arrival the staff were extrememly welcoming and gave us a complimentary drink of cava whilst our bags were taken to our room. We stayed in Room 13 which I believe is one of the smaller rooms but it was nicely decorated and the bathroom was excellent - double sink, large double shower, separate bath, complimentary Molten and Brown toiletries. Breakfast was included and served at our table - rather than the self service buffets that you find in most modern hotels. The staff could not have been nicer, They spoke perfect english and indulged my imperfect spanish. This is a lovely place only slightly marred by the noise we heard overnight from La Rambla.",4,2015,01,17
32,Lovely boutique hotel but expect to lose sleep at night,"We stayed at Hotel DO Placa Reial for 7 nights in early January 2015. The hotel itself is quite beautiful. It's well renovated and conveniently located in gothic quarter. There's a subway station and a taxi stall near by so you can easily get to anywhere in Barcelona. Unfortunately, we did not sleep well because it was so rowdy outside at night. The noise usually began at around midnight and ended at 4 in the morning. We closed all windows hoping it would solve the issue but it didn't work. The noise was so bad that I felt like it was something that the hotel should talk to the police about it. After losing so much sleep, I felt like the hotel was very, very overpriced. I also asked for some tea and the hotel ended up charging me for a room service. I think it would be wonderful for the hotel to provide simple tea and a coffee machine in every room. Other than the noise and coffee/tea missing in the room, the service was great.",3,2015,01,17
32,Honestly one of the best hotels I've stayed in! ,"If you take anything from this account it would be the recommendation to book room 47! I booked this hotel as a surprise for my girlfriends birthday. 
The check-in process was smooth, we were given a welcome drink of our choice and shown to our room. Our room on the 4th floor was a pleasant surprise. Beautiful decor, styled to European perfection. The bed was large and of brilliant quality. The pillows are to die for! The shower is perfect, and complimented well by the private pool and terrace! 
The breakfast in this hotel has honestly got to be the best I have ever experienced. You literally tick the time you want and what food and drink you want and it's there, delivered to your room in all its glory! Fresh orange juice and the cava (unlimited might I add!) Made every morning a pleasure. 
The attention to detail in this hotel is second to none. A coffee machine, Molton Brown cleansers and lotions, and DO branded goods  (robes, slippers, toilet tissue!)... even DO business cards and a welcome pack with my name printed inside!
The staff are the most accomodating. Especially Gaylin! He always had time for us (as did all the staff) asking for help, directions... anything wasn't a problem.
We were given COMPLIMENTARY  champagne in our room and a birthday cake prior to our arrival (graciously left in our room). The staff were able to give great recommendations for restaurants (cachitos and botafumeiro) and were able to book this for us! 
Overall, my girlfriend and I loved this hotel. Definitely returning soon! I would return just for the hotel (providing I'm in room 47!! ...absolute class).
",5,2015,01,17
32,Brilliant !!',"We have just spent 7 nights here and it has been a brilliant stay. From arrival the service was outstanding, Ruth is a gem, the room (34) spacious and beautifully appointed and the location of the hotel for us was just perfect. For us there was just nothing wrong with this hotel and so much that was right so this is our Barcelona Hotel and I have no hesitation recommending it.",5,2015,01,10
32,Very good,"Location is very convenient. Right in the center I f the old town.  People are friendly and helpful in booking and recommending restuarant outside.
 Room are very nice and spacious.

The restuarant serves very nice tapas in the evening.

Breakfast quality fluctuates. And tends to be on salty side. That all the bad thing I have to say.",5,2015,01,10
32,Could not have been better,I checked in on December 25.  I had booked a single room - which was small - that being the only drawback.  The room had every amenity that you could think of.  The bed was extremely comfortable.  Very modern bathroom.  The extra touch of delivering a piece of fruit late afternoon and chocolates/almonds at night was wonderful.  Nice breakfast.  Too cold for roof top but it was beautiful.  Staff was very pleasant and helpful.  Walking distance to so many sights and the metro is very close.,5,2015,01,05
32,"if you want a quiet stay, choose other hotel","I chose this hotel for my new year's eve and 1 jan just because it had a very high rating on agoda.
I realised I made a mistake by choosing this hotel. But I will say both good and bad about this small hotel. However my overall impressions is bad.I will start with cons:
-very noisy hotel. it's impossible to sleep well here. I came back from new year's celebrations at about 6:00am and planned to sleep until late afternoon. However my plan never came true. Early in the morning the staff started to be really noisy by slamming nearby doors, dropping some bottles, rolling carts with glass, glass bottles,etc., shouting, making a lot of noise on the same floor, on the floor immediately above my room and outside. It appeared also that the staff room is just near my room.
Besides, I realised that a lot of noise comes from the first floor staff area (outside their restaurant, perhaps) where the staff made a lot of noise by collecting trays with glass bottles, discarding garbage, and doing all other really noisy things. bottles and other stuff dropped on the ground. The problem is that my glass door in the room (which probably was to substitute a normal window) faces that area.
As a result I could sleep only about 4 hours! I called the reception to indicate the problem, but nothing changed!
-the rooms are completely not sound proof!
-there was NO window in my room and the only view I could get was when I opened the sort of balcony door in my room and could enjoy the nearest wall of another building and ugly surroundings.
-the internet in the room is REALLY way slow. As if it is still from the birth era of internet.
-the room is ugly decor
-the room is TINY. i cannot even compare it with tiny rooms in hong kong or venetian hotels!

Pros:
-nice location at the base of La Rambla
-clean rooms
-free minibar",2,2015,01,01
32,If your staying in Barcelona look no further!!,We stayed here 4 nights from boxing day and it was quickly obvious the other great reviews were correct. The location is perfect just steps away from la ramblas and yet in a lovely square. The hotel staff were terrific and very helpful and friendly. We stayed in a terrace room on the 4th floor and it was amazing with lovely far reaching rooms and quiet as well. The breakfast was served until 11 am which was great as were not early risers on holiday. I wouldn't think for a second about not going to the same hotel again when we go back to Barcelona and we definitely will as its such an amazing city!!,5,2014,12,31
32,Lively spot in a wonderful location,"Traveled to Barcelona May 2014 and stayed at the Hotel DO Placa Reial for 3 days.  It was quite easy to get to via taxi from airport and reasonably priced fare.  It is a small hotel with the entry several steps back off the street and when you check in at the small desk they offer you a drink and are very friendly.  The hotel is nicely decorated and the room was large with an even larger bathroom.  It was clean and very comfortable.  Our room had a small balcony off the bedroom and bathroom facing a square lined with restaurants and bars.  For some this might prove to be a problem as the night activities start late, go until the morning hours and is very joyous.  There was a restaurant connected to the hotel and we got a little breakfast brought to the room.  It was very good.  It was very conveniently located to the tour bus stops and was walkable to many sites.
I would stay at this hotel again and would absolutely recommend it to friends and family.",5,2014,12,21
32,Amazing Hotel!,"Our room was immaculate, well designed and very comfortable. Great design and finishes,
The location is also great - in a lively plaza, which opens out onto the middle of Las Ramblas. There are loads of mini streets and alleys leading off the plaza which are also well worth exploring. 
Many people had complained about the noise - our room overlooked the entrance to the plaza, we were aware of a murmuring from the plaza, however it was not a loud enough noise to disturb us.",5,2014,12,20
32,"Perfect location, great staff, great room",Spent a few days here on business. I have been to Barcelona several times over the last 2 years and this is the best place I have stayed so far. The rooms have a wonderful view overlooking the square with windows and shutters that easily block the noise when you are ready for some quiet time. Top notch service and a very pleasant staff. I will be staying here again during my next visit for sure.,5,2014,12,15
32,The Best,Recently spent 3 nights there prior to a cruise. Was upgraded to room #47 which is probably the best in the hotel because of its location as the only room on the fourth floor. Very quiet and has a plunge pool on the patio. Couldn't get up enough nerve to try it in November! Every positive thing that has been written by others is true. Staff and service were fantastic and the meals at the downstairs restaurant were superb. Perfect location.,5,2014,12,12
32,Great place,"Extremely eligant, perfectly located, service was terrific. Just a few blocks from the beach very close to museums and entertainment. Restaurant right on the plaza very good food. Just down the street from a great food market.",5,2014,12,11
32,Perfect location and wonderful pampering by hotel staff,"My husband and I have just returned from one of our best hotel experiences in all of our years of travel at the Hotel DO Placa Reial! The staff were so welcoming and helpful. You really feel as if you are staying at the home of really good friends or family. Our room was located above the hotel entrance, which was nice and quiet at all times. The room was a good size and had everything you could possibly want, including very comfortable beds, fluffy duvets, lots of pillows (including a pillow menu), a fridge with a variety of free drinks that are refilled each day (and more often with just your favourites upon request), a safe, TV and a large bathroom. In the bathroom were Molten Brown products to use in both the bathtub and large walk-in shower. There were also bathrobes and slippers supplied to use during our stay. The included breakfast was another wonderful experience to look forward to each morning. During the winter months, you can take breakfast in the basement restaurant or in your room and we greatly enjoyed both. The breakfast menu had a wide choice of hot and cold food and drinks. Everything was freshly prepared to order and so yummy. I really enjoyed the scrambled eggs, bacon, fresh fruit mix, fresh baked pastry basket, fresh orange juice and thick Spanish hot chocolate. The location of the hotel is also very beautiful in a palm tree lined square. Everything you could possibly want to see and do is a short walk away. However, if you do want to travel further around Barcelona, the Metro is only a few minutes away. This hotel and it's staff must be very highly praised for all they did to ensure the best possible experience. We look forward to returning and will be recommending this hotel to everyone!",5,2014,12,10
32,Great hotel and very central,"This is a lovely hotel, in the courtyard of Placa Reial, minutes from La Rambla and very central for exploring the city, with good transport with the buses, the Metro and taxi rank 2 minutes away.Although the building is old the interior has been modernised very well three years ago, keeping many of the old features and enhancing them whilst making the interior contemporary. 

On arrival the staff were very friendly, offering us a complementary drink sitting either inside or outside the hotel whilst our bags were taken upstairs to the room. We opted to sit outside and as it was Nov thought it may be cold but the heaters made this a perfect temperature and a great place to sit and people watch. The courtyard is full of people milling around, restaurants and small shops and is a great place to stay.

We were initially concerned that the room may be noisy as it fronted on to the courtyard but however as it was Nov it probably wasn't too busy although lots was happening. We closed the shutters in the evening and heard very little noise.
The room was a good size, the bed very big and the bathroom lovely. Complementary fruit and chocolates were delivered in the afternoon and evenings and the staff were very helpful although not too pushy.

We ate tapas in the hotel one afternoon and it was very good and breakfast was always lovely but with so many other restaurants to visit in the city we didn't dine there in the evening. 
I would thoroughly recommend this hotel for the whole experience, ambiance and location but not sure it will be more noisy in the summer.",5,2014,11,22
32,Perfect 4 days in Barcelona,"Delightful boutique hotel located on historic Pla√ßa Reial.
Ruth and colleagues at front desk could not have been more helpful.
Breakfasts in the basement restaurant were delicious.
We did not have dinner there as the restaurant lacked a warm atmosphere.
Changing the harsh white light bulbs and warming the white walls would be a simple fix.
However, I suspect the food was excellent, if breakfast was any guide.

The tall double glazed windows in our room opened onto the Pla√ßa
a constantly changing show of people, light and sounds was fascinating. 
We slept soundly with the doors closed.

The Hotel was always exceeding our expectation with the delivery of little treats
such as Turron made with marcona almonds, caramel and lemon juice. Quite delicious.",5,2014,11,20
32,Fantastic Hotel - so welcoming,"My husband and I spent 2 nights here - fantastic service, clean, modern, excellent location, friendly, would definitely stay here if we were to visit Barcelona again.  The staff could not do enough for you to make your stay special.  Would definitely recommend!",5,2014,11,20
32,An excellent boutique hotel,"My fiance took me here as a birthday treat in October.  An excellent hotel and our stay was outstanding from beginning to end.  The staff are very helpful and can't do enough for you.  The hotel is immaculate and in a prime location for exploring Barcelona.  We stayed for three nights and the location, just off La Rambla is perfect for fitting in as much sightseeing as possible.  We stayed in the Junior Suite, room 21 which is on the corner of the building above reception and offers views of both Placa Reial and a view down the road onto La Rambla.  Our room was absolutely perfect with a four poster bed, double sink and double shower.  We received treats in the room every day from truffles to fresh fruit.  There is a well stocked non-alcoholic mini bar in the room which is included in the room rate, as well as nesspresso coffee machine with a stock of espresso pods.  There are lots of Molton Brown toiletries in the room with shampoo, conditioner and shower gel as well as minatures. The room we had could be a little noisy at night with the hustle and bustle going on in the placa until the early hours of the morning but I personally would say this didn't spoil our stay, keep the shutters, windows and curtains closed and it keeps the noise to a minimum. There is a private spa available for use which you have to reserve in advance, I cannot comment on this as we decided not to use it as we were not staying for long enough to take advantage. The breakfast on offer is lovely, you can order as much as you like from the menu which includes cold meats, cheese, eggs, pastries as well as teas and coffees and fresh juices.  We ate on the terrace outside reception, overlooking the placa, if you wish to eat breakfast on the rooftop terrace you do have to book in advance, you can also have room service which is at no extra charge and we enjoyed this perk on our last morning in the hotel which was lovely. On our last evening we ate in the restaurant which is located in the basement.  We had the restaurant to ourselves, it is a little pricey which is why we may have been on our own.  However the service we received and the standard of food was well worth the money.  We received excellent attention to detail when making selections from the food menu and also advice on pairing the perfect wine with our food.  I am ashamed to say I cannot remember the waiter's name but he was excellent and made our evening perfect which was followed by a proposal of marriage from my now fiance when we made a trip to montjuic. I have to say this is the best hotel I have ever stayed in, from the service, the cleanliness and the surrounding area it was absolutely faultless.",5,2014,11,15
32,Boutique Hotel,"My husband and I spent three days in Barcelona before boarding a cruise ship.  I chose this hotel mainly because of its location.  It is situated in the heart of historic Barcelona and is in walking distance to many attractions and shopping, since it is right off of Las Ramblas.  The port is also in walking distance.  We had a lovely room with a terrific bathroom.  A full breakfast was included in the price of the room.  They also provided a mini refrigerator full of drinks which was included.  The staff was very courteous and helpful. The Placa Reial is right outside the front door which has many choices for restaurants.  We couldn't have been happier with our choice of hotel and would not hesitate to go back there if we are in Barcelona again.",5,2014,11,11
32,The Best,"This is a wonderful, wonderful hotel.  The staff, the environment, the location, the lovely room, and the great bathrooms - what a terrific place to stay.  We loved this place and will make it our ""go to"" location in Barcelona.  It's our 6th time in Barcelona and this is by far the best hotel we've stayed in.  Cannot recommend it highly enough.",5,2014,11,10
32,Lovely central location,"Great food ,service & location close to the port, harbour & Plaza de Catalunya. Located in a quaint romantic historic part of town. Feels classy & trendy. The tapas and Sangria here was very reasonable & well presented.",4,2014,11,09
32,DO stay here!,"Amazing hotel, firstly location is excellent. If you are coming to explore the cultural side of Barcelona this hotel is ideally located. The staff are friendly and helpful, Breakfast is out of this world! The room was attention to detail down to a the very last thing. Business cards printed with name on, free well stocked mini bar, free wifi, little cakes left each day for guest's. Not sure why they felt the need to put a phone in the toilet - still each to there own. The roof top bar over looks the square. Went for partners 30th, would highly recommend to any couples looking for a getaway. Have stayed in over 100 hotels across Europe, this is by far the best.",5,2014,11,09
32,This hotel would be hard to beat!!,"We chose Barcelona and the Hotel DO for our 40th Ruby Wedding Anniversary and what an excellent choice it was.  The hotel is brilliantly situated on the Placa Reial and just off the Ramblas - nothing was far away by foot.  The hotel staff were just brilliant - so friendly and helpful and went the extra mile to make our stay something special, especially the welcome Cava and the daily ""treats"" left in the room - no good for dieters! The room itself was spacious; well equipped and very comfortable.  Looking out onto the Placa Reial (Royal Square) was enchanting, although it can get lively, but once the shutters and French doors were closed it was just serene and we slept well.

The quality and choice of the food was good, whether it be breakfast (best taken outside!) or the evening meals, which could be a simple tapas affair or a full blown meal. If you tire of the menu, the choice of restaurants both in the Placa Reial and close by offer almost every choice imaginable.

Barcelona itself is a lovely spot and relatively compact so getting around is easy, but watch out for pickpocket gangs in the metro! We recommend the tour bus to get around the many tourist sights as an ice breaker - just hop on and off all day.

As Terminator Arnie said ""We'll be back""!!",5,2014,11,08
32,"Among the many wonderful choices, this stands out","A warm welcome in both atmosphere as well as personal greeting, we were instantly at home.  Love the location, the d√©cor and the service.  A couple of the restaurant recommendations were spot on, while a couple missed the boat entirely.  Just like anywhere, choose your dining carefully.  The concierge does not always have the best experience upon which to draw.",5,2014,11,05
32,Fantastic place to turn 40!,"Loved this hotel.  Boutique and lovely.  Our suite had full length windows on two sides with juliette balconies which was amazing.  Very accomodating, food was very good and the staff were lovely.  Modern decor and very comfortable bed and pillows.  Overlooked a popular square but closing the windows eliminated the noise.  Breakfast on the square or the room terrace was awesome.",5,2014,11,03
32,A Jewel of A Boutique Hotel,"I stayed for 10 nights in this elegant hotel and recommend it highly.  The location is superb, the food lives up to the hotel‚Äôs gastronomic billing, the rooms are clean and comfortable and both the terrace and roof restaurants afford views of the charming ‚Äúroyal square‚Äù.  But, what really distinguishes this lovely hotel is the attention paid by members of the staff to every little detail, and their willingness to go above and beyond the call of duty to satisfy the requests of their guests. 

A special thanks to Ruth who, with great patience and efficiency, made suggestions, booked tours, arranged for tickets and looked after me during my stay.  In this, the assistance of Dayana is also greatly appreciated.",5,2014,10,31
32,Outstanding boutique hotel,"I give two thumbs up for Hotel Do Placa Reial although I hesitate to write a glowing review because if the hotel becomes too popular, we may not be able to stay there next time.  

We stayed for 4 nights in this amazing hotel just off the touristy La Rambla.  The location is perfect, near the metro stop Liceu, allowing easy transit to Sagrada Familia and Casa Batlo if you are touring around the city.  The hotel is an easy walk to Barri Gotic and famous sites including Cathedral Eulalia, Picasso Museum, Palau Musica Catalana, Montjuic, Miro Museum, the harbor, and numerous restaurants/cafes/shops in the charming neighborhoods nearby.  The room is lovely and he bathroom is gorgeous. The hotel's steam room/sauna was great for relaxing after walking around all day, and there is a rooftop terrace with pool that would be wonderful in warm weather.  We sat out there at night taking in the evening festivities.  The breakfasts were sumptuous and fabulous.  We also had dinner in the terrace restaurant... what an enjoyable time!  

The staff was friendly, helpful, and accommodating.  Elena at the front desk helped us order entry tickets online so that we can skip the queue at tourist site.  We were very happy with our stay!",5,2014,10,29
32,Smart boutique hotel,"We stayed here for 2 nights before a cruise.   I totally agree with all previous reviews, this is a lovely little hotel with extremely good and friendly staff.  Our room was not large but very airy and light as we had a balcony overlooking the side street to the square.   Bathroom lovely and elegant with Molton Brown soap, shampoo and conditioner.  Bed very comfortable.  Plenty of wardrobe space.  You could hear some noise from the Square as it is extremely popular so buy earplugs!  I have them wherever I go.  Terrible sleeper!     Breakfast was very good and in the charming basement.   Hotel just off Las Ramblas which is a bit tacky.   Lovely little coffee shop opposite on the side street.  Good restaurants in the square.  Underground not far away and easy to navigate.  Would thoroughly recommend this hotel.",5,2014,10,26
32,Excellent hotel in Barcellona,"My wife and I recently spent six nights at the Hotel DO Placa Reial. This hotel is located on the always busy Placa Reial one block off the Rambula and within easy walking distance of many exciting places to visit including the ancient Barric Gothic section of this beautiful city.  Our room was spacious and very comfortable with many amenities including free Wi Fi, complementary mini-bar and a fantastic shower.  The Terrace restaurant, out doors on the Palaca Reial, and the more formal restaurant downstairs both serve excellent food. I would save my highest praise for the staff.  They were wonderful in helping us plan our days and in recommending excellent fine restaurants for evening dining.  English is spoken throughout the hotel.  Barcelona is a beautiful and exciting city to visit and The Hotel DO Placa Reial is the perfect place to stay!

32,Sanctuary in the Heart of Barcelona,"I recently spent two nights at Hotel DO, and found it to be superior in every way.  The location is prime, just off La Ramblas and overlooking Pla√ßa Real, one of the loveliest and liveliest squares in Barcelona.  Despite the central location, the hotel is very quiet for sleeping, even with rooms overlooking the square.  Premium bedding and most comfortable beds make for an excellent night's sleep.  All amenities are first-rate.  On either end of a week-long horseback riding trip, we stayed in Rooms 22 and 31.  Both were lovely.  The real distinguishing feature of the hotel is its staff.  The concierge, assistants and bellmen were all gracious and helpful.  When I inquired about a taxi to the Columbus statue, the concierge said, ""oh, no.  It is so close.  We will help you with your bags, so you will not need a taxi.""  Sure enough, the concierge herself and a bellman walked us to our destination, pulling heavy roller bags.  They were quick to offer maps and suggestions for dining that were first-rate, and accommodated our need for an extra bed on the last night.  Their warmth and friendliness cannot be overstated.  I will certainly recommend the Hotel DO, and will return when I am back in Barcelona.  It is well-worth the cost.  Food on the terrace and on the roof were delightful, with our favorite potatoes braves on the roof.",5,2014,10,24
32,"Wine, buskers, palms and Gaudi","Well what a GORGESS place to stay in arty Barcelona. Right in the action but quiet and oh so comfy. I tasted many wonderful wines and am thankful for the help of the wonderful sommelier. I loved my room up high looking into the Plaza, the bed was so comfy and had a pillow menu, no excuse to be uncomfortable. Someone left me a little treat every night plus a weather forecast for the next day. Renationalise was always around to welcome me home with a wonderful smile. I'm vegetarian and although the choice was limited I enjoyed my meals very much.",5,2014,10,24
32,Wonderful Hotel - Happy Honeymooners,"As honeymooners traveling abroad, we received this hotel recommendation from some co-workers who raved about how great it was. The hotel itself is truly lovely - modern and clean with access to La Ramblas just steps away and the Boquiera down the street. We were able to walk to all destinations without any issues and enjoyed being near various restaurants and activities. The meal we had in the Hotel Do Cucina itself was by far, the best meal we had our entire trip and I highly recommend going there for a meal if you don't plan to stay. My only complaint is that some of the rooms are quite small but we were upgraded after a few nights. Incredible customer service from the staff, fantastic location, and a great experience. Do try this place.",5,2014,10,20
32,"Best room, best service, best location","This boutique hotel was the best during our 3 week vacation.  The staff was super friendly and helpful, the (superior double) room great with plenty of closet space, hangers and drawers, the king bed very comfortable and the location the best in the Ramblas district with numerous restaurants and bars nearby.",5,2014,10,20
32,Wonderful Hotel,"In the heart of Barcelona, right off La Ramblas sits an incredible hotel called Hotel Do. My wife and I were greeted by an exceptional staff of people who made are stay very memorable. From making dinner reservations or giving directions to tourist sites they were accomodating with every request. We stayed in Rm 35 (Superior Double) with an view facing the inner Placa Reial. Barlecona parties well into the early morning hours but we hardly heard any sounds. The king size bed was very comfortable, bathroom amenities were first class and the housekeeping staff kept our room in tip top shape. Every evening we would return to our room to find fresh fruit, cookies or delicious truffles. Breakfast was made to order - in your room, in the restaurant or the roof top terrace. After a long day of walking we enjoyed the roof top pool that was clean and a perfect temperature. The hotel is perfectly located to enjoy Barcelona. Taxis are plentiful, the two metro stations are within a 2 min walk, La Boqueria is within a 3 min walk.  Hotel Do is first class and would highly recommend this to any traveler.",5,2014,10,14
32,"Amazing experience, wonderful customer service","I'm traveled extensively, and this is the best hotel experience I've ever had. The location is wonderful. We arrived at 9am, way before check in, and we were greeted by the friendly hotel staff who immediately stored our bags for us and brought us a welcome drink. We were given a map of the area and given recommendations for our visit. The room itself was wonderful--the terrace room on the top floor with its own pool. Lobby is cozy and inviting. The room was very unique--a large shower, comfortable bed, great features. The staff brought us fruit in the afternoon and chocolate at night. The drinks in the non-alcoholic mini-bar are free. Food in the on-site restaurants is terrific. If I return to Barcelona, we'll definitely stay here again. It was the highlight of the trip. I highly recommend staying here, you won't regret it!",5,2014,10,10
32,Stay here. It's sensational.,Two nights in Barcelona and we chose the best location for access to the restaurants and night life. Sensational staff and service - nothing is a problem. Great restaurant and being right on the placca means you can sit and watch the locals and tourists alike. Highly recommended.,5,2014,10,10
32,Almost 5 Stars,"Staff is incredible. They will assist you getting tickets to anything and help you find places. Exceptional service. Rooms are great- updated, vaulted ceilings, plus all the stuff already mentioned by others. We had a room on the 2nd floor overlooking the square and didn't hear anything outside after we went to sleep so not sure why comments are made unless people sleep with their doors open (my wife has exceptionally good hearing, and didn't hear anything)     Ok, why not 5 stars- too close to Barcelona's version of Times Square and the lobby is very small. Minor complaints- we just learned to take other routes when leaving so we didn't have to deal with the craziness of las ramblas area.",4,2014,10,09
32,"Best location, modern room!","Loved staying here, despite it not being a 'full-service' hotel, lets be clear, this is a boutique hotel, with its main operation being the restaurant downstairs. But, being a 'gastronomy' hotel, I did appreciate the free mini-bar and the daily delivery of fresh local fruits. Located at the main entrance to the Placa Reial, you can't really ask for a better location. The only downside is, it can get loud. The hotel does provide for shutters for windows facing the Placa (and you want a room facing the Placa cuz its simply beautiful!) but if you're a light sleeper, make sure you bring your earplugs! Barcelona is truly the ""city that never sleeps"", I was SHOCKED to see how many people were outside at 4am (granted, we were there for La Merce but still!).",5,2014,10,08
32,Lovely!,"This hotel is in a perfect location with Placa Reial at the doorstep.  Quiet with shutters closed.  Staff is attentive, food  delicious, decor beautiful.  We were able to enjoy the oldest parts of Barcelona easily.",5,2014,10,08
32,Lovely Retreat,"We had a lovely night at the Placa Reial.  We arrived in the morning and of course rooms were not really, but the hotel was very helpful keeping our luggage while we went for a late breakfast and exploring.  They also offered to let us use the spa to freshen up there would have been no charge for this curtisey.  As soon as we returned to the hotel they were able to give us a room.  The staff was very friendly and helpful.  They were more than eager to recommend restaurants, sights, and tours.  It is a small hotel, with a big heart.",5,2014,09,21
32,Hotel with a buzz,"Hotel DO is right in the square with tables outside for watching and sipping.  The staff were amazing and so helpful.  The building is old and very interesting and has been tastefully renovated to provide modern conveniences but keeping the old world charm.  It has a lift so no carrying bags up stairs and it has a charming restaurant in the basement.  We didn't dine there but checked out the menu which looked really good and the wine list extensive.  The bathroom provided luxury products and everything you required was provided.
Breakfast was served outside on the square and was delicious.  Fresh bread basket with a variety of pastries. Freshly squeezed juice. I had fruit and home made yoghurt which was delicious, my husband had an omelette with crispy bacon and claimed it was better than mine.  It must have been good.
We had a room slightly off the square and it was our first night in Barcelona and unfortunately it was quite noisy with singing and cheering up until 5.30 in the morning but now we've been here a week we understand that that is how it is in Spain.  They know how to party.
Overall view of Hotel DO, you will not be disappointed. We will definitely come back",5,2014,09,21
32,A gem at the heart of Barcelona,"This small boutique hotel is located perfectly in the traffic-free Placa Reial just of the Ramblas.  There is a lot going on in the square which could be noisy at times, but the double glazed windows ensured we only got the noise we wanted.  Good linen, good bathrooms, stylish bedrooms.  The staff were all delightful and very generous; they responded positively to every single request we made.  The food is also excellent.  It's not cheap but I think worth the money.",5,2014,09,19
32,Very good hotel at a very busy place,"Nice, tastefully designed hotel in the heart of Barri Gotic (the Gothic Quarter), with exceptionally polite personnel and a good restaurant on premises. My room (junior suite) was spacious, with a comfort kingsize bed and good bedding. Great shower. 
However, one should bear in mind that Placa Reial is a very busy place with people hanging out until 6 am. Those who want a quiet night sleep may be disappointed. As for me - I love life, and the noise do not disturb me that much. What I found really annoying, as in many other good hotels - was the electric wiring: it's almost impossible to turn on or off the exact light you want. Why not to make it easy, as at home?
Anyway, the general impression was very positive. I liked the place a lot and will stay there again.",5,2014,09,10
32,Fabulous hotel - great Barcelona location,"I stayed at this hotel a year ago with a group of friends.  The staff was exceptional.  Every night we got ""treats"" in our room.  Their breakfast was included & delicious.  We never made it to their spa area during our visit.  Their location is fabulous - you can walk so many places.  There are many restaurants where this hotel is located.  I would definitely stay at this hotel again the next time that I'm in Barcelona.",5,2014,09,05
32,Fantastic Location,"Arrived in Barcelona on 29th of July,  We had our driver pick us up at the airport, made arrangements with the hotel in advance.  Very easy to communicate with via email, very prompt with requests.  Our room was beautiful with large glass doors opening to the plaza below.  The room was spacious with tall beamed ceilings and a mix of old world charm and modern amenities.  Large closets and equally large bathrooms with modern fixtures!!!   The hotel is small but very classic in d√©cor and the staff was very attentive.  The hospitality of the staff was wonderful and the communication was very fluid, since most of the staff spoken English.  The roof top bar with the tapas menu was excellent, plus a perfect view of all the activity below.  The restaurant in the hotel was fine dining and we were treated to a fantastic meal and our waiter was very knowledgeable. The hotel location was right off the Las Ramblas and walking distance to many attractions including the world famous La Boqueria!  The hotel faces the large plaza with many restaurants and bars for your dining and drinking pleasure, and the small alley ways have many small shops and bakeries also.  I recommend this hotel for couples and solo's, because you are in a location of many restaurants, bars and lively entertainment, the party last way into the morning hours.  Love this boutique hotel and we hope to be able to come back soon!  Enjoy!!",5,2014,09,03
32,Nice Boutique Hotel,"Nice hotel with friendly service. Room was clean and well proportioned, looking out on to the Placa Reial. No isssue with noise as per other reviews, stayed on first floor, so excellent sound proofing.",4,2014,09,02
32,A Fantastic Boutique Hotel,We have now stayed at the Hotel Do Placa Reial and each time it has been great. The staff are very friendly and welcoming and the Hotel is ideally situated to visit all the sights in Barcelona. The delicious breakfast watching the world go by on the forecourt is a great start to the day and the fruit in the afternoon and the turndown evening chocolates are nice touches.  We will definately return when we next visit Barcelona and recommend the hotel to friends who are visiting the city.  Many thanks to everyone there for their great hospitality.,5,2014,08,30
32,Not typical 5 star,"We stayed 3 nights after a cruise at this hotel as a ""treat"" before we returned home. It was somewhat of a surprise when we walked into a very small and cramped reception area. The staff were excellent though and assisted us with any enquiry. Room was small and I thought the the whole experiecnce was a bit of a let down and certainly different what we were expecting, given the high rating by others. Probably would stay somewhere else next time, but full credit to the staff, who saved this from being a major dissappointment.",3,2014,08,25
32,Exceptional,"We have just returned from this quaint boutique hotel which is situated in the heart of Barcelona, a moment's stroll from the Gothic Quarter through the wonderful Pla√ßa Reial. Amidst a busy August afternoon, we arrived with great anticipation and were not disappointed. Although we were two hours early for check-in, the staff that greeted us were warm, welcoming and immediately put us at ease - our bags were whisked up to our room whilst we were served a complimentary drink of Cava and a delicious appetiser in the cosy lounge. 

We stayed for a duration of two nights in one of the hotel's 18 rooms, and from beginning to end, were thrilled by the attention to detail in all areas of our experience. Our room had lovely big windows, with excellent double glazing that comfortably kept out most of the street noises.  Water and soft drinks from the mini-bar were entirely complimentary, and every day we received small refreshments delivered to our room, such as fresh fruit, sweet almonds and biscuits! This was especially welcome after a session in the private spa, which you can book quickly and easily at Reception. A keycard gives you access to a small room containing a shower/steam room, sauna, heated tiled loungers and a fully stocked mini-bar (of soft drinks). Wonderful!

Even though the hotel was fully booked on the Friday and Saturday nights of our stay, the hotel retained a sense of peace and quiet; the management worked hard to personally attend to our needs and were clearly keen to give us a happy stay. On the top floor there is a rooftop plunge pool and terrace overlooking Pla√ßa Reial - a stunning location. We had the pleasure of exclusive use of the loungers and pool on a hot, sunny Saturday afternoon which was extremely relaxing after a day of sightseeing. 

One of the highlights of our stay, although hard to choose, was the daily breakfast offerings. We were given the options of dining on the rooftop, in the hotel restaurant, on the outside terrace or in our room. On our first morning, we opted for the terrace looking out onto Pla√ßa Reial. The setting was very memorable and the service was quick and efficient. The next day, however, we opted for a luxurious breakfast in bed - an experience not to be missed! The entire service and meal is included in the room rate, and is all of a very high standard. 

On our final night we dined at the hotel restuarant 'La Cuina' and again experienced first rate, professional service whilst dining on beautiful food. A recommended experience for food lovers.

Hotel DO Pla√ßa Reial was a true five-star experience that we will not forget.",5,2014,08,25
32,Perfect short break,"I stayed for 4 days wanting to explore the sights, visit the beaches and also do some shopping. The location was perfect. The hotel was a little oasis of luxury with friendly courteous staff.
I would highly recommend it and would choose this hotel again if I manage another visit.",5,2014,08,22
32,Hidden gem,"This intimate refuge occupies an atmospheric corner of the Placa Reial, one of the prettiest plazas in all of Spain, just off the Ramblas, the historic, tree-lined boulevard that runs through the heart of the oldest neighbourhoods of Barcelona.  Completely renovated a few years ago, the family-owned property offers 5-star amenities in a limited number of well-designed rooms, as well as a superb restaurant in the cave (or basement), a large outdoor terrace for tapas and drinks, a small bar with lounge and library on the ground floor, and a rooftop plunge-pool with gorgeous views.  Travelling alone, I stayed in the hotel's smallest room, a ""single"" that is VERY tiny despite the fact that it includes a double bed and a small desk where I could set up my lap-top to use the excellent wifi.  The room's bathroom is a good size, with a walk-in shower large enough for two...though I don't advise booking this room for more than one person.  Be aware that if you do book it, the window is covered with translucent glass which means that the room lacks not only a view but any indication of the exterior whatsoever.  In fact, the ""window"" opens into a light-well, which partially accounts for the quiet that adds to the room's sleek but cell-like atmosphere.  The hotel's larger rooms increase considerably in size, with a few being quite grand.  Those that offer French doors onto small balconies overlooking the busy plaza are as noisy as they are picturesque, so be warned if you are a light sleeper. They also are more expensive.  Given that all the rooms include a magnificent breakfast (basically, anything you want) that can be consumed in the cave, on the rooftop, or in your room, along with turn-down service, and impeccable attention from the entire staff, a stay in any one of them is worth the price...and even, for me, the inconvenience of a space smaller than a cruise-ship cabin. Others seem to agree, for this hotel is difficult to book.  Look it up on a map, take a good pair of walking shoes, and reserve early. You won't be disappointed.  And you will be in the vibrant centre of one of Europe's great cities.",5,2014,08,16
32,Beautiful,"Highly recommended - wonderful stay, excellent staff, beautiful hotel. Lovely little pool on the roof to cool off, views over the buzzing Placa Reail. Clean, friendly, calm, pleasant and nicely designed. Extremely comfortable bed.",5,2014,08,11
32,Very nice hotel,"stayed with my husband in the junior suite which was excellent. good breakfast and excellent personnel. The swimming pool in he roof was a bit of a joke, though, not really for swimming. otherwise a great experience!",5,2014,08,11
32,Relais and Chateaux Quality,"Just returned from Barcelona, Costa Brava and Venice.  This hotel was by far our favourite.  

Best quality was the welcoming atmosphere, from being greeted with a Cava, to the free non-alcholic mini bar in the room, to the sumptuous and delicious breakfast.  Re the latter, you can order anything off the fabulous menu as your breakfast, free of charge. It was not a place that nickled and dimed. 

And you were a special guest, always greeted and they always knew who you were. 

We were in 34 overlooking the Placa as requested.  We would have preferred the room one floor down with the balcony but that was taken.  There was no noise issue whatsoever and the Placa is incredibly lively to all hours. 

The bed was fabulous.  The A.C delightfully cold.  There was a ton of space to put away and hang up your clothes.  We were there for 4 days. 

The bathroom is enormous and so functional - double sinks, separate toilet area, stand alone shower, great tub, great water pressure. 

The room is not big - I think ours was a superior or the second category - but because of the use of space, you never felt uncomfortable or that is was small. 

The Placa itself is beautiful, a rare old Spanish style you don't find elsewhere with two lamplights by Gaudi. 

One con is location in the sense it is off the somewhat shoddy La Ramblas and not in the elegant Eixample but I suppose then it would be twice the price and the Placa itself is elegant. On the other hand, you are very central,

Also, the concierge staff could be  bit more experienced.  We were told to get off at Placa Espanya for the airport bus and I think Catalunya might have been better but I am not sure They also sent us to a restaurant that was not great and we ended up walking out.  

But they do try very hard and are always at your disposal. 

Altogether a highlight of the trip.  Luxury at a high but not unreasonable price in comparison to others.",5,2014,08,05
32,Beyond Expectations!,"Wow!  I knew that I had chosen someplace special from all the other reviews, but Hotel DO really exceeded my expectations.  It is well designed, well located and the staff is truly excellent.  They were friendly and accommodating and made a point to make my visit feel special.  Everyone that I encountered was a true professional.  A special note to Dayana who was especially kind and welcoming.  I look forward to returning to Barcelona and will only stay at Hotel DO.  Fantastic restaurant, too!!",5,2014,08,05
32,Perfect hotel perfect location,"The hotel was so clean and comfortable. Nothing was too much to ask from the staff. It is situated on a busy plaza with excellent eating places and lively entertainment. Our room was very comfortable, with a complementary non alcoholic mini bar, a balcony enabling us to look out over the plaza, treats left in our room once or twice each day, and in the evenings someone came in and had closed the shutters and mats by the bed. The breakfasts were delicious - staff were always incredibly helpful. 

The location is also great - in a lively plaza, which opens out onto the middle of Las Ramblas. There are loads of mini streets and alleys leading off the plaza which are also well worth exploring. 

Many people had complained about the noise - our room overlooked the entrance to the plaza, we were aware of a murmuring from the plaza, however it was not a loud enough noise to disturb us.",5,2014,08,02
32,Perfect hotel,"Stayed here for an anniversary without the kids. The hotel was a perfect location for exploring las ramblas and Barri gotic. The room was everything we'd want for a city break, clean with a good shower with lots of Molton brown bits and pieces to keep mrs happy.
We used the roof terrace on a nice day to sunbathe and use the pool, and again for an evening drink. Breakfast was brilliant and we kept over lots of pastries for lunch to mean we had more money for evening tapas! :)
Great experience and would definitely recommend this hotel.",5,2014,08,02
32,Amazing Hotel!,"This hotel was the amazing and located perfectly in the heart of Barcelona! We had a room that was beautifully decorated and had a balcony that overlooked the plaza with fountain. Perfect for relaxing and people watching. The friendly staff, special touches (mid day & evening snacks) and awesome breakfasts put it over the top. Five stars in our opinion!",5,2014,07,31
32,A fantastic stay in the heart of Barcelona,"We can't recommend this hotel enough. Whatever you're after from a luxury stay in Barcelona this hotel delivers! Our room was immaculate, well designed and very comfortable. Great design and finishes, view over the plaza, complimentary (non alcoholic) mini bar, great bed - we were very very happy. The staff are the highlight though - hugely helpful and always on hand. 
Andrew & Greta, Sydney",5,2014,07,28
32,Great service and location,The hotel is excellent in everyway but the service is to be commended. Staff at the front are very helpful. Albert was willing to help us with everything. The location is perfect. Breakfast is fantastic. We can order anything on the breakfast menu. The restaurant is superb. We stayed 2 nights and had a great time. Thank you.,5,2014,07,28
32,Outstanding,"My husband and I stayed for three nights this week - his 60th birthday present from me. He has always wanted to visit the city. I chose the hotel for location and because I knew we'd want an oasis in the heat, and somewhere luxurious as it was a special occasion.  This hotel met every expectation and surpassed most of them.  We had a first floor room to the side of the building and were not troubled by noise in the slightest. The square is noisy until the early hours but with windows, curtains and shutters closed and aircon on there was no problem whatsoever. We slept soundly.  The staff were friendly, helpful, kind, welcoming, nothing was too much trouble. I've stayed in 5* hotels in many countries and few meet this standard of service. All spoke excellent English.  The food was first-rate - best calamari we had anywhere (it's my favourite!).  The room was stylish and the bathroom large and supplied with good toiletries and plenty of towels.  Every detail had been considered. We had breakfast each day on the roof terrace in the shade which was a very enjoyable and civilised experience.  We ate on the terrace on the square too - a lot of fun to watch all the people, and we were not pestered by anyone.  I cannot recommend this hotel too highly. Worth every penny and for a hotel of this standard, outstanding value.  If we visit Barcelona again, we will stay here.",5,2014,07,25
32,Amazing Boutique Hotel,"I chose this hotel for a family vacation. I read the reviews from other reviews and I was very pleased with our experience. It is centrally located near all of the attractions, shops and restaurants are all in walking distance. I appreciated a large, spacious room with high ceilings, remodeled in contemporary design. We had two balconies facing the Plaza. The bed was super comfortable, and the breakfast was amazing! The sweet treats they left us daily was a nice touch. The minibar was stocked with various drinks which were complimentary as well as WIFI.. That was a first!! The only downside was the size of the pool which was very small. It really can't accommodate more than 4 people. On the weekends, it was a little noisy as the young people all went to the plaza to hang out and drink all night.  I had to close the wood shutters outside to help block out the noise. Would definitely stay here again",5,2014,07,24
32,Awesome,"I expected a great hotel and everything surpassed our expectations. Very friendly staff, beatiful room and great location close to many attractions and restaurants. There is even a small pool on the roof which is rare in Europe. I strongly recommend.",5,2014,07,24
32,Quiet unassuming treasure in the heart of La Rambla,"We had dined on the terrace of this hotel a couple of years ago, not knowing until later that it was a hotel.  The food then was fabulous and so when we knew we were returning to Barcelona, decided to book the hotel, which we all absolutely loved, rooms were clean, spacious, bright and comfortable.  Service was good both hotel staff and restaurant staff, accommodating our every need.  Loved the quaint pool and terrace on the top floor where we relaxed with an amazing sangria in the late afternoon until sunset.  Even though our rooms faced the popular square below, at night time, it was busy and noisy outside, yet in our rooms, we could not hear a thing....

We would definitely return to this wonderfully situated boutique hotel.",4,2014,07,22
32,Perfect Gem in Barcelona,"I found this hotel here on Trip Advisor. I had never been to Spain before and really knew nothing about Barcelona or where to stay. We were traveling with 4 kids, so we always need three rooms. I generally try to find nice but not luxury hotels so we don't spend a fortune on our accommodations. All I need is a clean room, bathroom and comfortable bed! (preferably white bedding!)  I was delighted when we drove up to the Pla√ßa Reial and were dropped off at Hotel DO. We were welcomed by two lovely people at the small front desk and I was immediately relieved. They offered to have us sit and enjoy a complimentary beverage while they finished preparing two of our three rooms. We ended up eating out on the Pla√ßa, people watching and eating delicious tapas. After we were taken to our rooms, and all were just delightful. The rooms were of course clean, beautifully decorated in a Picasso, Restoration Hardware style decor. Big white fluffy beds, (yay!) lovely bathrooms, and chic atmosphere all confirmed that we had made a wise choice. It surpassed my expectations. 
Every morning I would call for a cafe latte and within minutes, literally, someone was delivering it to our room. The guest services were incredible. They took extra care out on the patio to serve us attentively even while the restaurant was full. They knew we were guests and we could order anything we wanted even after the menu's posted times. ;) The front desk was always friendly and attentive. They were at our disposal and printed maps, made suggestions, recommendations and were enthusiastic about helping us. The front desk was delightful. Also, there is a small rooftop pool, and a bar where we loved to go for delicious mojitos before we set off for our evening out in Barcelona. 
I can say that the hotel exceeded my expectations, and if I ever went back to Barcelona would stay there again without hesitation. Thank you to the Hotel DO for making our time in Barcelona just lovely.",5,2014,07,22
32,Boutique experience,"We had three rooms. The hotel design is quirky trendy and up market. Warm welcome, well stocked and free mini bar, cool rooms. A nice place to stay. May have been fact it was World Cup finals night, but it was a bit noisy in spite  of curtains, double glazing and shutters. Very central. Roof top breakfast terrace is good. Food on terrace in square or gourmet basement . Really good local vermouth as welcome drink. Nice place",5,2014,07,20
32,Perfect location .,"My husband and I celebrated our wedding anniversary  here .
We had chosen the hotel for its location and we're not disappointed .
The room was well furnished with everything you could need and the shower was a huge space .
We enjoyed the breakfast but service was slow .",5,2014,07,19
32,Beautiful hotel on a busy plaza,"We had a large comfortable room with a view of the plaza, which is right off Las Ramblas and centrally located.  The staff is very helpful and the ground level restaurant has a good, affordable menu and is a great spot for people watching.  The minibar is included in the room rate and there are treats brought to your room in the afternoon.  The hotel is noisy at night (not sure what was happening but it sounded like furniture moving in the middle of the night).",5,2014,07,16
32,Excellent Stay,"We stayed from 5 - 8 July after a cruise.  We booked a double superior room which was located in the front of the hotel with two windows facing the Reial plaza, which was a nice view.  There was some noise at night but nothing out of the ordinary for a hotel in the city center.  The room/hotel was very clean; the staff were very pleasant and helpful. The bed was very comfortable and the air conditioning worked very well during some very hot days.  The hotel location is good for attractions, and a taxi stand is about 50 feet away on Las Ramblas.  It was an excellent stay and we'll book here again if/when we return to Barcelona.",5,2014,07,14
32,We stopped here twice for drinks!,"Great hotel in a wonderful location very central to the port,  Las Rambla, lots of excellent restaurants and bars. We only had drinks in the outside terrace, a perfect place to people watch in the shade. Would certainly consider staying on our return visit to Barcelona.",5,2014,07,14
32,Fabulous boutique hotel,"Hotel Do Reial is an absolute gem of a hotel. The rooms are great, the staff are professional, friendly helpful and courteous. The breakfast is superb, and the rooftop deck is a real bonus. If you are looking for a boutique hotel just off la Ramblas where all the tourist action is and to be close to the very funky historical quarter, this is the place to stay. Not cheap, but worth it. Received excellent dinner recommendations: Pla and winders were among the highlights. The only minor downside to the hotel is that since you are so close tot he action and on Paca real, it can be a bout noisy late into the evening/early morning. Windows are good , but in case there is something special being celebrated, you may want to bring ear plugs if you are a light sleeper.",5,2014,07,14
32,Wonderful in a great location!,We stayed at Hotel DO at the conclusion of a Mediterranean cruise. It was the perfect ending to a wonderful vacation. The location of this hotel is ideal. Our room was lovely and extremely comfortable. The staff was warm and welcoming. Breakfast on the Placa Reial was excellent.,5,2014,07,08
32,Post Cruise Stay in June,Hotel Do is a lovely small hotel with an excellent location in Barcelona.  The square couldn't be lovelier and being just off La Rambla the hotel was in the centre of all the activity.  Our room was very spacious and comfortable and kept very clean although it was often not tidied until well into the day.  The staff are all friendly and efficient and were able to get us skip the line tickets to La Sagrada Familia and obtained our airline boarding passes for us.  The breakfast that came with our reservation was good but limited in selection.  By the third day it felt very repetitive. All in all I would definitely recommend this hotel for comfort and location.,4,2014,07,08
32,Outstanding,"Adorable, fashionable, superb staff, delightful breakfast on the terrace, fantastic roof deck.  Location could not possibly be better. You cannot go wrong.  I would recommend to anyone.  I was actually there for business but would make a perfect romatic getaway.",5,2014,06,30
32,Perfection in Barcelona,"Hotel DO is the perfect place to start a vacation in Barcelona.  Central location to many of the sights in the City.  Walk just about anywhere you want including the beaches.  The rooms are well appointed and nicely sized.  It's a small hotel, but big on customer care.  The rooftop bar is a perfect place to end the evening with a glass of their outstanding sangria.  Breakfast is included and it's a full menu.  The Placa Reial is a very popular hangout surrounded by many restaurants and shops.  Barcelona never sleeps but we did not have any issues with sound.  Once we closed our windows the room was quiet.
Only minus was perhaps the ""pool"".  It's really more of a wading pool then anything that one can swim in, but again the beach is just a nice 15-20 minute walk.
I would stay here again!",5,2014,06,28
32,Beautiful hotel! ,"Visited Barcelona for 5 days with my mother.  We could not have chosen a more perfect hotel!  From the moment we landed in Barcelona airport the staff were amazing.  We were greeted by a great driver to take us to the hotel.  The reception staff were excellent, showed us to our room which had a beautiful view of Place Reial.  We were in walking distance from everywhere.  The terrace bar was lovely to sit out during the day and the rooftop for the evening.  There was a lovely rooftop pool which was perfect after a day of sightseeing.  No complaints about the hotel at all.  If we return to Barcelona, we won't look at any other hotels, we will be straight back to this one! ",5,2014,06,28
32,Exceptional hotel.Exceptional staff.,"Arriving at this lovely hotel, tired and weary after our original  flight was cancelled and our luggage still at Heathrow we were greeted by charming staff who could not do enough to make our stay enjoyable. I was particularly grumpy without clean clothes or any toiletries but we were given a welcome drink while someone kindly left some ""essentials "" in our room. With still no luggage the next day ( of a 4 day trip ) a bottle of Cava was delivered to our room. This hotel is exceptionally well run. Superb bed linen, luxurious pillows and Molten Brown products in the bathroom and so many other nice touches. But mostly it is the thoughtfulness and efficiency of the staff that makes it a cut above the rest! The hotel is located perfectly in the very heart of the city. A perfect place to stay. My special birthday was saved ! Thank you",5,2014,06,28
32,Perfect Boutique Hotel,"We visited Barcelona for a few days, were wanting a small but luxurious boutique hotel, and we found it with Hotel DO. Our room, No 11, was perfect. The decor, sheets, pillows, towels, the Moulton Brown products were all top notch. I also am somewhat of a 'bathroom snob' in that I like a shower with great water pressure, and a tub, that is comfortable and big, etc. This bathroom snob was 'over-the-top' happy. Regarding location of hotel, it couldn't be better. Located in the charming Placa Reial square, near the Boqueria market, Cathedral, Placa Pi, near the Liceu metro. The hotel staff was also extremely helpful and kind with every request we had. They booked reservations for us for dinner, shows...all done perfectly, and with a smile. The breakfast was also excellent..we had delicious eggs, and yogurt with berries. Just perfect. I know we will return  to Barcelona someday, and can't wait to stay again at Hotel DO. Thank you to all the staff for making our stay just perfect.",5,2014,06,26
32,Wow.....,"The moment you walk into this hotel you know you are in for a treat. The decor is modern and respectful to the building's heritage; the staff friendly and welcoming.

Our standard room was a good size with a balcony. Everything in it tasteful and the best quality; from the Moulton Brown soap and show gel to the Loewe television. On checking in we received a personalised welcome pack and a welcome drink. Wow.

The rooftop pool is a great place to relax after a day sightseeing, and the terrace on the Placa Reial is great for people watching.

Breakfast does not disappoint, and service is discrete and efficient. We found afternoon fruit in the room and bed-time treats too. The complimentary mini bar is also a nice touch.

Yes there is some noise from outside but that's the price you pay for staying slap bang in the thick of it.

All in all I'd recommend this place for a luxurious treat.",5,2014,06,23
32,Exceptional Hotel in a great position,"Stayed at Hotel DO in June.The hotel is perfectly positioned in 
Placa Reial very handy to all of Barcelona's attractions
The Hotel is superbly comfortable and has a feel of Chic New York about it .
The staff are all very professional  and helpful .
The breakfast on the terrace is wonderful ,food is excellent

32,What's not to like - Barcelona,"Charming boutique hotel in Barcelona. Located in a fun and busy square. Great food - breakfast included. Sizeable rooms with high end finish. Located about mid-way off La Rambla; near Liceu metro, and walking distance to the Cathedral. Friendly and very helpful staff. Our teens loved the place - as did we.",5,2014,06,20
32,Excellent little hotel,"We stayed in this lovely little boutique hotel in June 2014.  Its situation is ideal for touring the city.  Our very first encounter with the staff was very pleasant, they were all extremely friendly, courteous and polite and speak a very high standard of English.  Everyone was very welcoming and helpful.  Our trip coincided with my birthday, and the staff made me feel very special, even giving me a cake to celebrate with!  The room was very comfortable, fitted to high standards and very quiet, which is amazing considering it overlooked Plaza de Reial.  I'd thoroughly recommend this hotel to anyone.  Thank you Hotel DO!",5,2014,06,18
32,"small boutique hotel; good, but not a 5 star","This is  a good hotel; just not a hotel to rave about. We stayed 5 nights; not sure why this hotel  is gushed over.
Location: the hotel is about a 15 minute walk to everything that you might want to do in Barcelona area, other than the Olympic village area to which you should take a taxi. It is on the square and young adults DO congregate there until all hour in the morning. Yes, you CAN hear noise in your hotel room, but as you have been warned about this on this site and are still  booking this hotel, you should not criticize based on the sound that filters in. The local walking tours outside the hotel. The sound  flowing up to the room is not awful.  I rate the location as excellent.
Room: we had a front facing deluxe? double. I thought it  was very small. We had to place one suitcase in front of the closet doors and move it to get in and out of the closet. The only chair in the room was more ""design"" than comfortable. The ""balcony"" had no seating and was pretty useless. Pillows and sheet were great. We retire early and as a result got NO bedtime treats. It would have been great to get chocolate covered strawberries like the other guests; be aware that you will not get them if you retire early. The room is pretty spartan, clean but not beautiful. I rate the room ""good.""
Bathroom: Very strange provision of toiletries. Shampoo, conditioner and bath gel are in pump containers mounted by the shower wall. SO, if you want to take a bath, you either need to fill your hands with the liquids and sprint  3 feet to the tub,or exit the tub to get the liquids. And, it took 20 pumps of the wall-mounted shampoo container to wash my medium length hair.  The hotel should toss the containers and provide toiletries in small individual use bottles. Toilet paper was not replaced daily. This was a problem when we had upset tummies and ran out out of TP.  Only one bar of soap was provided; this is a pet peeve-- one is needed for the shower and another for the sink. The light switches were impossible to figure out.My spouse accidentally turned off the light in the toilet twice when I was in the toilet room. We did not figure out the  switches in our 5 days at the hotel. Shower floor a littel slippery; no shower mat provided.
Service: At the front desk was as should be expected but not on stellar. A stellar front desk crew would have asked us on day one what we intended to see during our stay, and suggested that we get tickets  in advance for some attractions. Instead, if you want help, you have to ask for it, and have to know what to ask. 
Breakfast: Everything must be ordered, once you realize that you can order without cost, it is a good experience. What we ordered was of good quality, the orange juice is real, not from a container.  No complaints as to breakfast.
Rooftop: We found this on our own, not having been given a tour of the hotel on check-in. There is no service on the roof top , and its very small, no flowers, pretty dismal. 
Taxi service: very easy, they have a taxi stand about 40 feet from the front door.",4,2014,06,15
32,"Great location, 5 star experience","This is an excellent 5 star hotel in a great location. My wife and I spent two nights at the hotel and it was a good base to get our first taste of Barcelona - which we loved. Our room looked out onto Placa Reial, which is busy throughout the day and into the early hours of the morning. The room was decorated beautifully and we especially liked the14 foot ceilings. We took breakfast at the tables outside the hotel on the square. This was a great way to start our day.",5,2014,06,15
32,"Lovely hotel, great location, great staff","Had 6 nights at the hotel and it was lovely. The staff were fantastic, friendly and very helpful. The hotel and rooms are on the small side but the location is perfect. The restaurant was lovely and it is located on a busy, vibrant square. Wouldn't stay anywhere else when visiting Barcelona. ",5,2014,06,12
32,First Rate,"DO Placa Reial in Barcelona.  Barcelona is a city of excitement and the Placa Reial just off the Rambla is at its heart.  The reception, the accommodation and the service were outstanding.  It was great to look out the window on the Placa Reial loaded with people enjoying themselves at all hours of the day and well into the night.",5,2014,06,01
32,Simply the best,"We spent 3 nights at the Hotel DO for our city break in Barcelona.
On arrival we were checked in whilst enjoying a glass of cava sitting on the Placa Reial.  Already relaxed, we were then shown to our room which was absolutely spot on - excellent bed (very firm), marble bathroom, shower room etc. all very clean and well appointed with more than enough  wardrobe space (for my wife!).
The staff are excellent - friendly, helpful and focussed on making your stay as enjoyable and trouble free as possible - we were offered breakfast in our room on the day of our departure even though it was a much earlier than when breakfast was normally served.
We've done a few city breaks like this in recent years (Rome, Paris, New York) and I have to say that this was by far the best hotel we have stayed in
Would highly recommend if you are looking to have a short break in Barcelona - central to the Gothic Quarter, the harbour, La Rambla and for the metro system for when you don't feel like walking.",5,2014,05,28
32,The best hotel experience of my life!!,"This was the most fantastic hotel my wife and I have ever stayed at. The room and the service were impeccable. The room was a little smaller than we are used to as Americans but it had everything you could need. 

The bed and linens were very comfortable; they gave you a bathrobe and slippers to wear and also have a towel warmer for those early morning showers. Double sink in the bathroom made getting ready in the morning a breeze! We would get ready and go to breakfast, which was included and when we came back the room was made up already. When we came back from dinner the room was turned down and some fruit or candies were provided as well. Could not be happier with the service.

Speaking of the breakfast, it wasn't some continental breakfast that was included. You could go to the restaurant and order anything you wanted and it was free. Just tell them what room you were in and that was it. Breakfast was one of my favorite meals partly for this reason!

The staff spoke wonderful English and were very helpful. They greeted you every time you came and went and asked if there was anything we needed. One of the nicest things about coming back to the hotel was that everything in the mini bar was free as well. It was so nice to know you could come back to the room and have a drink and not worry about how much it would cost. It really seemed that they went out of their way to make everything enjoyable.

I will say that the hotel is in the Placa Reial, which is very loud pretty much 24/7. There are several night clubs in the area and the noise from people does not stop til about 4 in the morning. There is nothing the hotel can do about that but they do have shutters, decently thick windows/door and blinds. That is the only bad thing but again, if you are getting a hotel in Placa Reial you have to have some expectations of noise.

We are already planning our trip back!",5,2014,05,27
32,Amazing Hotel and Staff,What a great Hotel.Has the ambience of Old Barcelona and a staff that was 5 Star worthy. The location on the plaza was great.Xavier was most helpful during our stay and is a do over Hotel when in Barcelona again.,5,2014,05,15
32,Excellent choice if you want to be spoild,"I have just enjoyed a long weekend and Hotel Do. With its excellent location at Placa Reial and the staffs perfect support this was a weekend full of good experiences and luxury.

Definitely a hotel I would recommend to all",5,2014,05,13
32,Beautiful,"My husband booked this hotel for our first night in Barcelona.  Couldn't have been more perfect.  The bed was like heaven, wonderful location and incredibly attentive staff.  The little extras like fresh fruit and cookies were a nice surprise.",5,2014,05,13
32,Very Central Location,"Excellent position 10 minutes to most services well run family hotel recently refurbished, staff exceptionally helpful, complementary breakfast, welcoming cocktail on the house. Room and bathroom very spacious many little details done so well, late checkout was helpful as well.
Only small negative was noise from the la Rambles required keeping windows and shutters closed during late evening and using air conditioning , will recommend and stay again when returning to Barcelona ",4,2014,05,13
32,Wonderful attention to detail,"The Hotel Do is a beautiful hotel with friendly and extremely helpful staff. Everyone speaks English very well so there is no difficulty for the non Spanish speaking guest. The accommodation is superb (we had a third floor room) and housekeeping is second to none. The lovely surprises each day in our room, fruits and biscuits or chocolates were delightful and it was a real treat to have a complimentary mini bar stocked with non alcohol drinks. The breakfast each morning, especially the freshly squeezed orange juice, was extensive, fresh and very tasty and it makes a welcome change to have breakfast included in the room rate! The welcome drink on the terrace whilst our luggage was taken to our room was also a thoughtful touch. We had dinner in the hotel restaurant on our first evening and it was very good. The only down side to this beautiful hotel and its attentive and charming staff is the noise from the lively Placa Reial. If you are a light sleeper this is not the hotel for you. Even on the third floor we could hear the partying in the square below virtually until sunrise and after a few moments peace the street cleaners, bin emptying and deliveries started. The hotel management has done everything possible to reduce the noise impact and the double glazing and shutters work reasonably well. If you keep the air conditioning on all night its sound also helps to dull the noise from the streets below. The hotel's location, apart from the noise levels, is fantastic as it is very close to the heart of the lovely Gothic quarter.  Had it not been for the disrupted sleep this hotel would have scored full marks from us.",4,2014,05,13
32,Perfect choice for a beautiful Boutique Hotel,"Treat yourself to sheer comfort and convenience at the DO Reial Hotel.  Located on a lively square, a few steps from the Las Ramblas, where everything is happening. 

The taxi dropped us off about 15 feet away from the hotel entrance which is understated. I had booked 5 rooms for 10 friends and everyone was thrilled with the hotel. The bed and linens were amazingly comfortable, best I think I've ever enjoyed. 

Breakfast was included and the offerings are cooked to order and just excellent. The entire staff is impressive, attentive and helpful, in a very gracious manner. They went above and beyond to assist us.  

One gal in our group was injured and they ran around to obtain crutches for her and made every effort to make her comfortable.  

Even though the weather was cool, we enjoyed the roof terrace. Nice relaxing place for drinks and enjoying the views. 
 
I  had read about possible noise from the piazza at nights, and if you keep your windows closed and the exterior shutters closed, it seals out any night time noise from all the merrymaking that goes on below. 

We spent 7 nights here and all enjoyed it very much. Go and Enjoy",5,2014,05,08
32,A peaceful Boutique Hotel in the heart of Barcelona,"My partner and I spent our last night in Barcelona at the Do'. We read great reviews about it and we were looking for something central, historic with a private outdoor space.
After having spent the 3 nights before at Hotel Casa Fuster we thought it was going to be difficult to find a nicer hotel!
Upon arriving at the Do' we were greeted with a complimentary drink that we had in our room.
We chose a roof top room, the only one apparently, with a nice outdoor terrace and small outdoor plunge pool with an amazing view of the Palau Guell and Montjuic.
The room was a decent size, well fitted out and decorated. The bathroom had a large walk in white marble shower overlooking the outside terrace and the blue sunny sky!
The overall service was very good with small personal touches such as amazing strawberries coated in chocolate in the afternoon.
I highly recommend this hotel if you are looking for a small peaceful hotel in a historic central part of town.",5,2014,05,07
32,Lovely Boutique Hotel ....,"What a totally delightful experience at this family owned boutique hotel in the heart of Barcelona. From the moment you are first greeted with a drink and escorted to your room, till the moment you check out, you feel like a guest who is truly appreciated and valued. The attention to detail at this hotel is fantastic! Business cards with your name imprinted with a personalized portfolio, full re-fridge in your room stocked with comp. soda's, juice and waters, afternoon delivery of fresh fruits, evening turn down service with chocolates and weather forecast for following day, A comp. breakfast that's off a full menu that you may also choose to have delivered as room service....and the list goes on and on like a high end all inclusive cruise experience! The only draw back for us was our room which was on a low floor facing the walkway between Las Ramblas and Placa Reial ...was quite noisy despite the sound proofing windows. We are both in all honesty though very light sleepers so perhaps this would not be the case for others. Regardless we fell in love with this place...would highly recommend and stay there again!",5,2014,05,07
32,Hotel DO...Do It!  Wonderfull,"A visit to Barcelona was a birthday treat and surprise for my wife. I search things to the point of exhaustion and use Trip Advisor reviews and opinions extensively in the process. Hotel DO...From the booking to the departure...excellent all the way. Room was great ( 24 was ours, on the second floor overlooking the square) and as we ususally stay in quiet spots was a bit concerned with the ""city"" sounds, need not have been, when you close the double glazed doors.. it just goes..well.. quiet.
Staff attentive at all times, we only ate breakfast...it was great..so cannot comment on the food at other meal times..but never heard anyone grumping.
Perfect spot for people watching or relaxing,almost instantly onto Rambla and so very central for on foot exploration, in essence an overall great experience. I highly recommend. I think we will will return.  ps the TV takes a USB stick so you can, if you feel the need to that is, laze in bed and watch your fave TV series :-)",5,2014,05,03
32,So glad we stayed here,"This hotel changed our vacation from a good one to a great one.  The location is perfect and within a 10 minute walk to just about everywhere you need to go.  The staff are very friendly and accommodating.  A very good breakfast comes free with the room.  It's ordered from a menu, not a buffet.  Our room had a large window/balcony that faced the plaza.  It was so nice to open it and be a part of the activity below.  But when we wanted quiet, we simply closed the shutters and the sound proof windows.  There was no problem with noise at all.  The bathroom is good sized with a separate shower from tub.  When you consider the free breakfast, stocked fridge full of soda & water, plus all the little treats they left every evening, it was a good value. If we ever return to Barcelona, this is where we'll stay.",5,2014,04,30
32,Fabulous Hotel in the heart of Barcelona,"I took my niece to Barcelona for her first visit.  I had read the reviews of Hotel DO on TripAdvisor and had booked based off of that.  They did not disappoint!!!  From the moment you walk into the hotel, the staff is welcoming and warm.  The rooms are beautiful, modern and the bathrooms are unusually big!  (And one of the best showers I have had while visiting anywhere in Europe!!!)
The room price included breakfast, wifi, and unlimited drinks in the minibar.  The breakfast was amazing - whether you went down to the restaurant or had room service!  My niece could not get enough of the fresh squeezed orange juice and croissants.  Also, the fact that they included the water, juices and sodas in the minibar was huge to me!  I usually have to go buy extra water to bring to the hotel- but not this time!!
They also bring you lovely treats TWICE a day!!  During the day, they bring you some fresh fruit to the room and then each evening during turndown they bring a little sweet - we loved the chocolate covered strawberries and homemade marshmallows!
Everyone of the staff was welcoming and helpful and went out of their way to make our stay amazing!  Thank you to everyone at Hotel DO!!!  I will only stay here when I visit Barcelona!!!!!",5,2014,04,28
32,We love this hotel!,"This is the second time we have stayed at the DO and it wont be the last.  This time we had a Junior Suite on the 3rd floor overlooking the Placa Reial. It's such a cool hotel, with very nice rooms in a very good location. Sitting in La Terrassa with a glass of Priorat people watching on the plaza is one of our favorite things in the world to do. But by far, the best part of being at the DO is the staff!!  These people are so friendly and helpful and they treated us like long lost friends when we returned.

Moltes gr√†cies!  Fins aviat!",5,2014,04,25
32,Hotel DO Placa Reial,"We spent our honeymoon in the Hotel Do. When we first arrived we were greeted and shown to our room. Everything was in order and very smart. After 10 minutes we were gifted a 40 year old bottle of champagne along with lovely pastries. The staff were friendly and efficient, recommending and booking restraints, excursions etc which all proved appropriate. As read in other reviews before we went we did find there was quite a lot of noise at night, sometimes till 5 am. Although the sound proofing was good nothing could stop all the noise. 

All in all though a lovely place to stay and we left feeling very spoiled.",5,2014,04,25
32,Relaxing and comfortable hotel,"This was the third time in hotel Do and we simply love this hotel. The breakfast is superb, you can choose from a menu and choose where you want to eat, in the restaurant, on the terrace or in your room!! It is a luxoury stylish hotel and you step outside and are in the centre and everything is in walking distance. The people are very friendly and you get the best of service. We look forward to our next stay!!!",5,2014,04,19
32,Wonderful Hotel and Brilliant Location,"We stayed at the hotel for 3 days, upon arrival the staff were very friendly and spoke very good english. The hotel is situated just off las ramblas (a great place to be based in Barcelona.)  The rooms are very stylish and the small snacks and free wifi were a nice touch, not to mention the free drinks in the minibar. The service was impeccable and we recommend you try the hotel restaurant which overlooked the pretty square. Overall, the Hotel DO is fantastic for a city break and we couldn't recommend the hotel more highly.",5,2014,04,19
32,A great and intimate hotel near the Rambla:),"A small and ""cosy"" hotel in the middle of the city. Very friendly staff, and great breakfast. We only stayed one night, and everything was perfect.

Free WIFI, minibar and small snacks upon arrival. Beds are comfortable, nice bathroom. Some noise from the streets at nights, but thats obvious in that location.",5,2014,04,15
32,Best hotel for a short city-trip,"We stayed in Hotel Do for 3 days. This is the best location when you visite Barcelona. The staf is very friendly and the room is lovely. A good bed with 4 different kind of pillows to shoose from. Also nice breakfast '√† la carte', not buffet. I will recommondant this hotel to everybody who goes to Barcalona. ",5,2014,04,12
32,Wonderful Service & Central Location,"We stayed for 3 nights after disembarking in Barcelona from our cruise.  The taxi drops you on Los Ramblas at the entrance to Placa Reial and it is a short walk over to the hotel entrance.  Hotel Do is centrally located for walking excursions around Barcelona.  The staff were very friendly and greeted us with a glass of cava while they took our luggage up to the room on the first floor.  The room was very clean with comfortable beds.  Nicely appointed bathroom with separate tub and shower.  Non-alcoholic drinks in the mini bar were complementary which was nice.  The included breakfast served in the restaurant was excellent and the servers were pleasant.  On a couple of afternoons after our walk abouts we returned to the hotel and sat in the restaurant facing the square and ordered sangria and tapas.  They make a great sangria!  Our one complaint was the noise from late night partiers on Placa Reial that woke us up a number of times.  It sounded like 1,000 conversations interspersed with yelling.  The staff showed us how to close the outside shutters which seemed to help a bit.",4,2014,04,10
32,Wonderful!,"This is a great hotel in an excellent location! Located just off La Rambla at the Placa Reial. Walking distance to many sites and just a few minutes from Liceu Metro stop. Very comfortable rooms, nice size along with a good size bathroom with two sinks, separate tub and shower and a door separating toliet. Attentive staff. Very helpful. Complimentary beverages in mini bar along with fruit in the afternoon and a sweet in the evening. They had gluten free bread (pan sin gluten) for my daughter which they toasted for breakfast and even gave her a gluten free cookie our last night as a parting gift which was a super nice surprise. Highly recommend.",5,2014,04,05
32,Want to feel special??,"This hotel is fantastically situated for walking - the gothic area - and further afield with Liceu Metro about 50m away. Oh and you are right by La Rambla. Open the door to go in, and all is calm - staff delightful - little touches in abundance. Breakfast is generous (and free) which makes the place excellent value. If you don't want a business centre in your hotel and I certainly don't, this is a super choice.

The building itself is charming but well cared for and the restoration has been thoughtfully undertaken. The restaurant was exceptional tho a little deserted, which seemed a shame. Maybe the barca athletico game had deterred locals??",5,2014,04,04
32,Hotel DO,"Excellent location and very helpful and courteous staff.
Complimentary mini bar and treats (in the form of fruit or chocolates) in the afternoon was a nice touch.
The room/bathroom were in excellent condition.
We have liked a greater variety with regards to breakfast options.",5,2014,03,31
32,The Best Boutique Hotel in the City!,"You really feel like home here!  While your room is being prepared, you are offered a welcome drink.  You have a choice of a room facing La Rambla or a quieter room facing the plaza.  The rooms are very roomy and comfortable.  The included breakfast is very tasty.  Somehow they found out it was my husband's birthday, and they wished him a happy birthday in the morning and brought us celebratory sweets in the evening.  The location couldn't be better.  We walked to all the major sights from here!  We highly recommend this hotel.",5,2014,03,30
32,Nice but a bit disappointing,"On a recent business trip to Barcelona, I booked at the Hotel DO when my preferred hotel, the Hotel Colon, was booked.  The hotel is nicely located just off the Rambla on the Placa Reial. The first thing to know is that this is tourist central so be prepared to dodge tour groups and school trips. But it is near the Gothic Quarter and all that it has to offer. The hotel itself is nice but a bit of an odd duck. It is very small and seems to be built around a massive concrete stairwell that dominates the entire hotel. The lobby is built around the concrete cylinder with no more than a sliver of a sitting area a full bar with barely any room to stand in front of.  Because I was alone, I booked a single room. It was very, very small and, yes, it was dominated by a section of the concrete cylinder that jutted out into the room. The only area to stand in was the 8' of floor space between the door and the side of the bed. Even the closet was so small it couldn't hold my overcoat. I understand that the majority of rooms are larger, I hope. It also looked out into a shaft with the building next door. If you book, only book rooms on the outside of the hotel. On the plus side, the hotel is modern, clean and nicely decorated. The staff is very helpful and the complementary breakfast was excellent. It really was the architecture and size of the interior that I found unappealing. The Hotel DO is obviously right for many people, but I would probably look elsewhere for my next stay in Barcelona.",3,2014,03,29
32,Excellent hotel with great location!,Unable to fault this hotel.  The location is perfect.  The staff courteous and pleasant.  The little touches such as a complimentary drink upon arrival and chocolates and fruit in the afternoon were greatly appreciated as was the free mini bar (soft drinks).  The bed was very comfortable and the room of adequate size.  Very little noise heard from the passersby below (we were on the third floor).  A perfect stay in a lovely city!,5,2014,03,28
32,A peaceful haven in Barcelona's hub,"Superbly located, superbly appointed and superb service - what's not to like? We stayed for five nights in early March and were mightily impressed by the Hotel DO. We had a side room rather than one looking directly into the square - possibly a blessing as our visit coincided with that of a UK football team playing Barcelona. Their fans were up half the night and most of the day carousing - closing the windows however reduced even their racket to a dull hum. 
The breakfasts were delicious, the daily treats a delight. 
The only quibbles were the location of the safe which was very high up and hard to reach, and the lack of a second bedside lamp meaning only one of us could read in bed.",5,2014,03,26
32,"Lovely Hotel, Great Location","Choosing a hotel in Barcelona is not easy - there are so many! We were only going to be there for one night and wanted to be in the old part of the City, close to La Rambla. Hotel DO Placa Reial looked like the perfect location and so we went for it. I'm very glad we did. Not only is the location excellent (between La Rambla and Placa Reial), but this is also a really interesting and charming hotel. Housed in an old building, it has been well and imaginatively refurbished. It is small but our room (23) was a decent size, well fitted out and decorated and had a modern bathroom with all facilities. The staff were helpful and efficient and we could happily have stayed for much longer. Oh, and the bar makes the best Gin and Tonics you are ever likely to taste!",4,2014,03,25
32,"Nice small hotel in good location, however singel room is below expectations","As I travelled on my own, I stayed in a single room. The hotel is well located and very clean. There are only 18 rooms, which has it‚Äôs advantages and disadvantages. I personaly like it to stay in hotel that isn‚Äôt too crowded. Some other tripadvisor  users  commend, that they have stayed in many 5 star hotels and never have been served by  such a friedly staff as service is outstanding.  I experienced the staff as friendly and the service was good. However I wouldn‚Äôt discribe it as unparalleled. The breakfast and food served in the restaurant are good as well.

As mentioned I have stayed in a single room. Which is the cheapest and smallest room in the hotel. The bed is confortable and there is a free mini bar, stocked with soft drinks. (very nice :-) ). As a man I can‚Äôt complain about the bathroom. (excellent shower) 
Most rooms facing the placa Reial, I suggest it must be nice overlooking the placa. But I stayed in a single room, where the view is absolutely unpleasant. The windowpane is matt. Which has a good reason‚Ä¶  The ventilation from the kitchen is close by, so if you would like to get some fresh air in, you may end up smalling more like some fried saltwater fish‚Ä¶
Conclusion: Would I Recommend the hotel ? Yes I do ? Do I recommend the single room ? Well, I‚Äôm not too sure. If you spending the whole day and evening in the city and only looking for a place taking a shower, sleeping and having breakfast in the morning you will be fine. If you  have to work or like  spending some time in your room, it‚Äôs might be to small for you.
(sorry for my improper English)",4,2014,03,22
32,Best hotel we have ever stayed in,"We have just returned from a 4 night stay at the hotel for our honeymoon, everything about the hotel is 5 star, all the staff are unbelievably friendly and helpful, the location is ideal, just off the rambles and situated in place retail, very central lots of lovely restaurants close.

Our room was lovely, towels and beds changed every day, extremely comfortable bed, with choice of pillows, lovely decor in the room too, we had little treats left on a daily basis, which is a very nice touch.

We had breakfast in the hotel every morning, which again was lovely.

Couldn't fault the hotel at all, we will defiantly return and would recommend to anyone wanting to stay.",5,2014,03,21
32,Charming and romantic,"I had high expectations and they were fullfilled, a very good hotel with the right location , close to and by the same time secluded from the buzz on La Rambla.
Hotel, service from all staff and food is good. A very nice location at Plaza Reial , balcony overlooking the square Plaza Reial.
One little advice - when Barcelona plays at home the visiting clubs fans often party at the plaza, their singing may be loud on the plaza. Not a problem but if you prefer quiet nights on the restaurant outside check the calender and evade the evening before game.",5,2014,03,16
32,"Beautiful hotel, exceptional service","This was our second visit to this wonderful hotel, situated perfectly for central Barcelona. The staff are exceptionally friendly and helpful, and the quality very high. We will definitely be returning!",5,2014,03,15
32,Amazing,"We stayed at the Hotel DO for 3 nights for our 1st wedding anniversary. On arrival we were treated to a lovely glass of cava. Our room was very tastefully decorated, with nice little touches such as personalised business cards. The staff were incredibly helpful throughout our stay. The breakfast choice was very comprehensive and the service was impeccable. Every afternoon we were brought chocolate covered fruit or little biscuits to our room. As with a lot of things in life, it's the little things that make the big differences. The hotel location could not be better as a base for visiting the amazing city of Barcelona. I would recommend this hotel unreservedly, and cannot wait to return some day.",5,2014,03,12
32,Great boutique hotel with 5-star service,"We stayed for 5 days at the beginning of March 2014. The whole stay was wonderful: great rooms (all wooden floor, very high roof, modern bathroom facilities, great beds), and staff was just lovely. Very personal service, good recommendations, always friendly.

Even though the hotel is situated on one of the most impressive backyards in Barcelona with lots of restaurants, noise is kept down by the windows and we had no problem sleeping at all (caveat: we didn't stay there on a Friday / Saturday, apparently then it can be even more busy). 

The spa is a little bit small - but the good thing is you get to use it alone (with your partner), without having to share it with lots of different people. We enjoyed it very much.

Food was brilliant. My tip: ask to get the breakfast delivered in the room: didn't cost us any extra, and much more nice than having breakfast in the cellar. 

So, what is there not to like about the hotel? I admit, I had to think a bit about this :) Well, maybe the amenities could have a tiny bit better. Molton Brown is ok, but please don't put spenders in the shower: that is not 5-star like.

All in all, one of my best stays in a hotel in a very long time. Absolutely recommended!",5,2014,03,07
32,WOW!,Stayed here for valentines in February 2013. A lovely boutique hotel and the room was superb. All the staff were really friendly and we were given a balcony view over the square. We were extremely fortunate to be there during a festival and were able to see the whole parade from our balcony how cool is that! Would love to go back again.,5,2014,03,04
32,Boutique luxury in the heart of Barcelona,"The placa Reial is probably the heart of Barcelona. I have been to the city many times and always find myself drawn to the square, either for a lazy hot chocolate and churros in the afternoon or drinks and dinner in the evening.
I have to admit I had some doubts about how Do would be able to meet my needs, being smack in the middle of the most touristic place in Barcelona.

I have to say they exceeded my expectations. From the complimentary drink at check in, to the seamless check out, Do was a real gem.

The hotel architecture and ambience is a mix of classic gotico, with modern and sometimes trendy addition. The rooms are very comfortable (pillow and scent menu) and well appointed (free non-alcoholic mini bar restocked daily, upscale toiletries, bathrobe and sleepers...).
What sets Do apart, though are the attention to details. Fresh fruits or chocolate snacks delivered to your room with turn-down service. Ala carte all included breakfast, with freshly pressed orange juice....

I'll be back for more",5,2014,03,04
32,Fantastic Friendly Boutique Hotel,"Just returned from Barcelona where we stayed at this small and intimate boutique hotel in the heart of the old town. The staff and very helpful and friendly; the rooms are beautiful and airy, very clean and comfortable; the rainforest shower is to die for! Make sure you do plenty of walking as the breakfast (included) is delicious. The terrace on the roof has spectacular views of the city and the sea. I shall definitely stay here again. The only thing that would have been nice would have been tea/coffee making facilities in the room - otherwise I cannot fault this hotel.",5,2014,03,03
32,Seven out of Five!!,"From the moment we arrived to the second we left we were so impressed we could hardly believe it was real! We've stayed in some great five star hotels before but this was easily the best, the best service, facilities, atmosphere and staff.

We had a lovely warm welcome, with a complimentary drink of our choice from the bar on arrival. We sat overlooking the Placa Reial and taking in the atmosphere while our bags were taken up to our room for us. It was a really nice touch after a long journey to just have ten minutes and relax, a great start! We then were taken up to our room and given a tour of the facilities (take the stairs not the lift, what beautiful design!).  The room (number 23) on first impression seemed spacious for a city centre twin, the high ceilings really helped. The bathroom was beautiful with a bath and separate shower, cotton robes, towels, slippers and Molton Brown products throughout. The (free!) minibar was packed with water, various fruit juices and coke/diet coke which was in the wardrobe with the safe, which was really handy to have. Couldn't fault the cleanliness or the standard of fixtures and fittings, definitely in keeping with a five star boutique Hotel.

The welcome booklet was packed with information, including nice touches like personalised business cards so you can let people know how to contact you. Each time we went out the hotel the staff nipped in and left us a little something for our return. After our afternoon walk we were welcomed back with two pieces of fruit with plates and serviettes on the side. When we returned after a night out there had been a full turn down service with mats placed next to the bed so you didn't have to stand on the wooden floor, a selection of cookies, mood lighting, shutters closed and I'm almost certain the room had also been scented. There was also a sheet on the bed with the following day's weather and a big list of a la carte breakfast choices that we could have in the room should we not wish to dine in the restaurant (in the basement). We decided as we had an early start we would have the breakfast in the room, so we chose a large range of items and selected the time we wanted it. It said to ring down to reception and someone would collect the sheet but we thought we'd just drop it down, but no! A member of staff spotted it strait away before we could get to the stairs and insisted that they take it for us. We decided we'd see if the spa was available (it must be booked at reception, but it is private for two people). Luckily it was so we enjoyed an hour of relaxation.

After a wonderful night's sleep the breakfast arrived a couple of minutes early, perfect! What a feast! Brought in on a trolley we had a cooked breakfast of bacon, fried eggs, sausages, boiled ham and toast. Along with croissants, pastries, fresh fruit, juice, coffee and champagne! It was wonderful.

On checking out after breakfast we made it down to reception (a member of staff we'd not seen before) who instantly knew our names and room number without asking said we should have let them bring our luggage down for them. It was only hand luggage, but this is an indication of the kind of care and attention we were given during our brief stay. As far as I'm concerned from now on there are no other hotels in Barcelona!",5,2014,03,03
32,Wonderful Hotel!!! Amazing! Love it!,"I stayed here for one night and wish it was for more but the place was fully booked as there is a conference on in Barcelona this week. 

It is a really high standard family run hotel in the best location in the city. The rooms have every detail taken care of and the restaurant and tapas cafe they run are fantastic. The standard is so high and the price is good. I will come back to Barcelona to stay here for sure. 

This is my favourite hotel that I stayed in this year.",5,2014,02,24
32,"Beautiful hotel, great location, wonderful service","My husband and I stayed at Hotel Do for 4 nights, booking through Expedia.

The hotel is in a fantastic location with one side of it on La Rambla, which is the main tourist drag and the other side in Placa Reial, which has good food in it. The hotel gives free breakfast with hotel bookings and it's a wonderful a la carte breakfast, which was a first for me. I loved the freshly squeezed orange juice and my husband had the traditional thick Spanish hot chocolate every morning. Vero, our waitress, knew our drink preferences by memory by the third day!

The hotel is in a historic building, but it has recently been renovated and the renovations are sophisticated and beautiful. Unfortunately, because it's an old building, the toilet lights flicker sometimes and the hot water in the shower sometimes wavers in temperature. Nothing terrible, but just a little annoying and hence the slightly less than perfect rating.

Having said that, I absolutely loved my stay and would recommend this place to my friends. The room is beautiful, the windows are soundproofed so the sounds of people partying downstairs in the placa is a pleasant, distant hum, they have great free wi-fi in the hotel, a free mini bar and would leave little treats in our room everyday. They really look after you here and would go out of their way for you. Just outside the hotel, there is always a row of taxis waiting for passengers, and the metro stop is only 3 minute's walk away.",5,2014,02,20
32,A wonderful stay - highly recommended,"We stayed in this hotel for 3 nights and can only say positive things about our time there. We were welcomed with a friendly glass of Cava and were checked in and bags taken to our room while we relaxed.

We stayed in a standard double so nothing extra but the service and small touches included made us feel like VIPs! The staff were very friendly and extremely attentive, they were very personal and sincere. The hotel room itself was on the small size but had everything we could want and considering its fantastic location we could not fault the facilities.

We ate at the hotel one of the evenings, had room service and breakfast in our room, all the food was superb, the service was great and nothing was ever too much trouble.

The hotels location was ideal, Placa Reial is a very pretty, lively square which gives you a sense of being in the thick of it but still able to escape to a tranquil haven without having to trek across the city. It was at times noisy but not to the point of keeping us a wake or disturbing us, we enjoyed the sound of the city and could always close the balcony door, draw the curtains and drift off in the most comfortable bed.

The hotel had some wonderful personal touches which made it feel like a true boutique hotel, the fact that there are only 18 rooms means that the service is tailored to individual requirements whilst still being able to provide many of the services you would expect in a much larger 5* hotel.

Our only regret was not being able to stay longer, we will recommend this hotel to everyone we know who plans to go to Barcelona.",5,2014,02,19
32,Beautiful hotel in great location,"Booked a 3 night stay (14-17 Feb 2014) as a suprise for my husbands birthday and I wasn't disappointed. We were made to feel really welcome by all staff, they even knew it was my husbands birthday when I had not mentioned it. Our room on the top floor had a small terrace with a private dip pool which would be lovely when the weather was warmer and even in February it was nice to sit outside. Breakfast was delicious with plenty of choice and the daily little treats in the room were a nice touch. Would perhaps of liked tea bags in the rooms as well as the coffee machine but I have no doubt that had I asked they would of appeared without a problem. Location is ideally suited for a weekend break with plenty to do within walking distance and also further afield using the Metro. I would certainly stay again if I visit Barcelona in the future.",5,2014,02,18
32,Spectacular service in a central location.,"Hotel DO pampered us. The high ceilinged junior suite on the corner overlooking Placa Reial right off the Ramblas and just a short walk from Colon and Ramblas de Mer in one direction and Berri Gotic in the other made this a perfect anchor for a few days's visit to Barcelona.   The helpful staff provided local wisdom and arranged restaurant reservations and transport without any problems. 
And the restaurant at the hotel is among the finest in Barcelona. Can hardly wait to return.",5,2014,02,17
32,Very Nice Hotel in central location,"Very nice hotel, booked for Valentine's Week-end (14 Feb 2014) perfect Staff with very personalized service. Hotel has just 18 rooms,we were in room 335 which has a shower and a bath but no view on the Placa Reial ( which may be good according to the noise). The hotel is 20 meters away from the Rambla and surrounded by nice restaurants. Hotel has a roof pool for the summer and a privative Sauna free of charge. The mini bar is also free of charge and many other personnalized attentions make your stay perfect!",5,2014,02,15
32,Charming Boutique Hotel,"We spent 4 luxurious nights at Hotel Do at the Plaza Reial in the gothic quarter of Barcelona. Our stay could not have been better. The hotel is small, so the staff came to know us and greeted us with big smiles each time we returned. Concierge was helpful and recommendations always on target. A delectable treat (truffles or cookies or other sweets) or fruit awaited us in our room each time we returned. The bed was huge, mattress firm, pillows soft (you have 5 choices of pillow), sheets white and soft, towels huge and fluffy. Every detail has been carefully chosen, down to the tiny clothespin paper clips in the desk drawer. Drinks (non-alcoholic) in the mini-bar are free. The restaurant is pricey but the food is delicious and, again, very carefully prepared. Many of the Gaudi sights (a key reason to go to Barcelona) and other attractions are within walking distance, and the gothic quarter is fun and lively day and night. A fabulous place to stay in a fabulous city.",5,2014,02,12
32,Personal service in a beautiful hotel,"We were welcomed on arrival with a glass of cava, while we were checked in and bags taken to our room. Our room (47) s the only one on the top floor of the hotel and had it's own terrace and plunge pool, not particularly useful in February, but on hotter days would be great after walking miles through the streets of Barcelona.
Our mini bar was free throughout (soft drinks) and we had special treats left in our room every day, chocolate dipped strawberries, little chocolate cakes and everything in the room we could possibly need from Molton Brown products to a Loewe TV and Nespresso machine.
We had tapas on the terrace twice, service was great and food delicious, we decided definitely the best location for dinner to watch the world go by.
Huge breakfast selection, all fresh and delicious.
Lovely people, lovely place, we will definitely be going back!",5,2014,02,10
32,Fantastic hotel!,"My and my fianc√© stayed at this fantastic boutique hotel for 1 night over new years eve. The hotel is super clean, staff is incredibly friendly and service-minded and the rooms fits the bill perfectly for a nice and luxurious yet affordable stay in Barcelona. We couldn't have asked for better service from the staff, we had som huge requests and they manage to go above and beyond an fulfill ever single request that we had - all with a smile on their faces! I can gladly recommend this hotel to everyone who wants a fantastic stay in barcelona! Book it!!",5,2014,01,20
32,Excellent Central Barcelona Hotel,"We had a recent 4 day stay here for a special occasion.  The hotel was excellent - room, food and service.  Everyone was very friendly.  The location was superb with much to do just a stroll from the hotel.  For a place so close to the Ramblas it was quiet.  We will go back.
Just one point to note - if you stay here get a taxi or an airport bus.  We got one of these shared minibuses which dropped us at the same place that the airport bus would have dropped us (Placa de Catalunya).  It was raining and we were not sure of our direction - a poor start.  Not the hotel's fault but some advice on the website might help.  Used the ariport bus to return - no problem.",5,2014,01,18
32,Best Stay I have ever had,"This was the best stay I have ever had. Everyone was attentive.  The staff really understand the meaning of customer service. The concierges (Xavier and Ruth) were available to answer my many questions, book excursions and make reservations. The bell captains were helpful with explaining the hotel, assist with luggage, and walk with me to the nearby Laundromat.  The food was outstanding, you don't have to be a ""foodie"" to appreciate the great food.  The attention to detail that this hotel has is exceptional. The location of the hotel is perfect for a thorough exploration of Barcelona.  5 days was not long enough at this hotel or in Barcelona.",5,2014,01,11
32,All was great,"Excellent and friendly service, great location, cousy and spacious rooms. It is a truly boutique hotel. I enjoyed my stay and have nothing to complaint about. I will certainly stay here again when i am next time in Barcelona.",5,2014,01,11
32,A fantastic place,"We had the pleassure to stay one night at this hotel. The service was esplendid, the breakfast was heaven and the wine a taste of happines. We really recomend this hotel and we will be back,

32,Perfect!,"Stayed for 5 nights over New Year 2014.Everything from the moment we arrived was perfect. Excellent room; we had a junior suite overlooking the Placa Reial (which can be rather noisy at night but only if you leave the balcony door open!) which was stylishly furnished - as is the rest of the hotel. Staff were friendly and helpful. Bar and the restaurant facing the square are great ""people watching"" spots. Good food in that restaurant and basement restaurant - although the harsh lighting in the latter meant it lacked atmosphere. The small roof terrace and pool would be very welcome in summer.
If you are visiting Barcelona and appreciate a well-located, stylish botique hotel you won't do better than Hotel DO Reial!",5,2014,01,07
32,Dont hesitate to book this hotel,"My family (including 3 teenage boys) stayed here for our winter holiday and loved it.  First, it is a beautiful hotel with good, clean and comfortbale rooms in an excellent location. Secondly, the staff are excellent; professional, friendly and very helpful. They were helful even before we arrived; they helped me make some decisions about arrangements during the holiday season.  The restaraunt we dined in (Cuina) is very good. We enjoyed many hours sitting in their sidewalk cafe on the Placa Reial. The location - near La Ramblas, but hidden in the Placa Reial - is both unique and  ideal for those touring the city. If ever in Barcelona again, we will return to this hotel.",5,2014,01,02
32,great hotel,"this was a great boutique hotel.
fabulous staff, friendly and personalised service.

the food was fantastic - the only thing I would say would be to try and be there on a non-Monday as the only restaurant open on a Monday was the terrace tapas bar (which was however, the best tapas we had in Spain)

the staff looked after us with a great welcome, restaurant bookings (it was the Barcelona holiday, so very booked out), and taxi and breakfast for an early flight.

handy location in the middle of town and fascinating watching in the town square.

would definitely stay here again",5,2013,12,28
32,Personalised service from a beautiful hotel,"My third stay at Hotel DO - the staff have welcomed me back as if I am family.  I love the decor, copious breakfast, great food, location and excellent staff.  I highly recommend people to this small family owned hotel.",5,2013,12,27
32,Perfect Boutique Hotel,"We spent three nights here in early November and it couldn't have been better. The staff was amazing and there to help whenever we needed.  This hotel was centrally located and we could walk everywhere. The attention to detail was amazing, from personalized business cards waiting for me in the room to the afternoon fruit and evening chocolates waiting for us everyday.  When we return to Barcelona there is no question we'll be staying here again.",5,2013,12,16
32,Hotel boutique dengan pelayanan yang sangat baik,"Location is good, in the famous la rambla area . Service is excellent from reception to restaurant to daily routine. The old 150 years building is unique equiped with first class amenities and quality utensils.",4,2013,12,14
32,Worthless and ovevalued,"This hotel does not deserve to be 5 stars hotel and it is overvalued in term of price, we have window with city view in the shower! And there are only four or five staff.

Poor internet connection, lack of staff, no trolly for laugguges, bad entrance, one elevator only, very small hotel, the breakfast is menu type so we have to call the only one waiter each time we need peace of bread, our room with a pool but it was very cold one even tough we are in winter season.",2,2013,12,04
32,very enjoyable,"We loved our stay. The hotel is in a good spot, close to the harbor and the maritime museum. The beds were amazingly comfortable as were the pillows, just like home for me. Afternoon fruit was delicious - room service yum. The food was very tasty. The staff friendly with great service. I loved the bathroom with bath, wonderful for a nice lay in. We will be going back that's for sure. 

Markets are across the road - easy walk to the hop on hop off bus.",5,2013,12,03
32,Terrible Experience,"I stayed in the hotel last March. I was taking a shower, the floor was completely marble with no non stick strips, and no shower mat provided, and I slipped and smashed 6 of my teeth on the bath. I needed to find a dentist urgently and the staff had no idea where to even start looking. As it turned out I had to go to hospital badly bruised and shocked, and have had four surgeries since to rebuild my teeth and i have one more to go one year later!!!
No one from Management contacted at the time while I was injured waiting to get home, or since to see how I was doing although I made no demands whatsoever of them. A complete lack of care or interest in a client who was injured on their premises.

 Obviously never again for me or my colleagues who stayed with me.",1,2013,12,03
32,"Fantastic location, style and service","The hotel is located on Placa Reial directly on the Rambla, you will not find a more central location if you want to explore the nightlife (caf√©s, restaurants, bars, night clubs just outside the door) and the cosy, narrow streets of the gothic quarter. Both the marina and Placa Catalunya can easily be reached by foot in 5-10 minutes.

The building is quite old, but was completely renovated with great respect to the original architecture. The result is a very comfortable, modern and stylish hotel, yet with a lot of the original, hand crafted details intact as an integrated part of the design. Our room was spacious with a great bath room, and with around 5 meters to the ceiling.

Staff was always very helpful and service minded, couldn't ask for anything more. Breakfast was a superb a la carte menu - very high quality, everything seemed to be home made.

The location is very central, and Placa Reial is a main place to meet up with friends before going out for dinner etc., so it can be quite noisy in the weekends. We already knew and saw it as a plus, but if you need complete silence at 10PM, I would at least try to get a room on the top floor.

We didn't find the time to try the spa, and weather wasn't suited for exploring the pool on the roof terrace, but we will definitely return to do so.",5,2013,12,03
32,Excellent service,"The service in this hotel is fantastic, no doubt thanks to the very professional and competent staff, who are always willing to help and speak good English. Nothing seems a problem to them.

Hotel itself: perfect location on La Rambla, very nice and comfortable rooms, especially super-comfy beds (rare in Spain!) and bathrooms. 5* amenities. Nice touches: free non-alcoholic drinks in the fridge, fruits and deserts, welcome drink.

So why not 5*? Well, my room was quite small, rarely borderline for a business trip, especially the bed/desk area. Almost like a monk's cell... And the window was into a tiny back court, full of beer cases. So closed drapes and no light the whole day. Bottom line: at 200+ euros, this was a  drawback.

Still, definitely a gem in Barcelona",4,2013,12,01
32,Probably the best hotel I have stayed in,"I just spend 4 days in Do with my wife, celebrating my 70th birthday. The hotel is most probably the best hotel I have stayed in ever. And I have stayed in quite a few around the world. The location is perfect, the rooms are comfortable, the king size bathroom a pleasure, the building old and somehow gives a pleasant and warm feeling. You simply do not get this feeling in new, modern hotels. The service is outstanding, but the ""kicker"" is that the staff is family-friendly and not servant-friendly. Highly recommended.",5,2013,12,01
32,Excellent stay,"Just got back from 4 days in Barcelona. Had an amazing stay at the Hotel Do.  From the arrival right through to departure, the service was excellent.  The small attention to the details created a real Wow factor; from the welcome drink on arrival, the Molton brown toiletries to the helpful recommendations with sites and restaurant bookings - we will definitely be back. Not to mention the location - very convenient.",5,2013,11,28
32,"""The"" boutiqe hotel among boutiqe hotels","Wonderful hotel in the best location. Rooms are very nice and you sleep like an emperor. The breakfast is amazing, served al carte at your preference. Be sure to enjoy an aperitif in the bar. Will be back.",5,2013,11,28
32,Charming Hotel in ideal location,"We arrived from a cruise and had chosen the DO: because of its ideal location on the Rambla in the historic centre, where the taxi delivered us a few steps from the hotel entry.  The DO: occupies an old and carefully renovated building on the beautiful Placa Reial; the interior of the Hotel has a charmingly old fashioned look, but its amenities are all modern and up to date.  After a friendly reception with a glass of Cava, we were accompanied to our room overlooking the square.  With soundproof windows, free wlan, a very comfortable bed and a fully equipped bathroom (with tub and seperate shower), there were no details missing.  In the evening we found it too cold to dine on the terrace or under the arcade of the square (although there is electric heating!), but we had a great gourmet dinner in the Cuina, a cosy restaurant in the romantic basement.  There, a good breakfast is also served up to 11 a.m.  We liked the DO: and certainly shall return.",5,2013,11,23
32,Just wonderful...,"What can I say - this was a surprise birthday trip from my boyfriend and he could not have picked a lovelier hotel.  When we arrived my boyfriend accidentally smashed his finger in the door and the staff were so good - they immediately gave us two glasses of cava and a teeny tiny ice bucket so he could put his finger in it to stop the swelling.  The room itself was gorgeous - comfy bed, lovely interior and awesome bathroom.  The little touches each evening of treats being laid out for us in the room were great.  The breakfast was delicious and we had the choice of having it in the restaurant or as breakfast in bed in the room.  On the Saturday evening the manager of the hotel was getting married.  However she took the time to come over to us (because we have a mutual friend) and wish us a great trip and a happy birthday, so so touching.  On our last day in the afternoon there was a knock on the door and two members of staff brought in a beautiful cake and bottle of cava complimentary.  I honestly was so impressed by the friendliness, generosity and charisma of all of the staff in this hotel I wouldn't consider staying anywhere else if and when I go back to Barcelona.",5,2013,11,19
32,Perfect choice in Barcelona,"Chose this hotel after reading reviews on Tripadvisor and it was perfect.Placa Reial was a peaceful haven just steps away from the bustle of La Rambla.The hotel staff were efficient and pleasant,the room was clean and comfortable and the food was delicious.I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel.",5,2013,11,18
32,Perfect location. Wonderful service ,"Truly a wonderful location. Walking distance to just about everywhere. Stunningly converted. Floor to high ceiling windows opening out onto balconies overlooking Placa Reial, a wonderful spot to indulge in the hotel's top quality tapas and wine. Service discreetly wonderful. Not sure if ever choose anywhere else in Barcelona again.  
",5,2013,11,17
32,Feels like coming home in Barcelona,"We have stayed twice in Hotel Do and have already booked our next stay as we simply love the hotel. It is nice, very friendly staff, super service, very clean rooms. What do you want more? Don't forget to eat in the restaurant which is worth a Michelin star.",5,2013,11,16
32,Wonderful small feel in a fantastic location....,"I would thoroughly recommend this hotel - we had the terraced room with personal plunge pool.  The bed was as comfortable as my own and I LOVE MY BED.  The bed linen is better than mine.... where do you get it from????
The staff were wonderful too, could stay here forever.  Location second to none.",5,2013,11,11
32,Such a wonderful stay!,"Location was absolutely a winner!!! Located above a square full of restaurants and activity. Right off the main LaRambla made for convenient access to everything we wished to do...restaurants, shopping, tours. we felt very exclusive even in the midst of a bustling city. with only 18 rooms, you receive individual attention beyond believe. the room was wonderful. huge sliding doors led to a veranda with a personal plunge pool!! we enjoyed the breakfast in the restaurant and evening coffee on the terrace. both exceeded expectations. my husband and I had just disembarked a 10 day cruise and wanted both personal space and the abillity to take advantage of our short stay, this hotel allowed us to enjoy both.",5,2013,11,08
32,Delightful experience,"If what you are expecting is a conventional and formal five star service, this is not it. However, if you a enjoy a quirkier atmosphere in a boutique hotel, with a more personal and intimate touch, in a more bohemian part of town, in a more individualistic setting,  the hotel Do is absolutely perfect. 
It is off Las Ramblas, the car can deliver you a few paces from the entrance, as the hotel is situated in the Placa Reial where there is no access to cars. The service is a little informal and though not technically perfect, the staff are friendly, prompt and willing. And mercifully  -the thing that most annoys in more formal places -the constant intrusion by staff to fill mini bar, to tidy up, etc.... Is absent from the Do. The staff can be called when needed and appear promptly otherwise. The Spa -given its small size, needs to be booked  and is for the use of individual guests who reserved it, it is heaven, having the little steam and sauna all to one self. Not sure about the rest of the rooms, but ours El Terrat, was the only rooms on that floor, which made it even more private and wonderful. The hotel is billed as a gastronomic hotel, we usually had breakfast which was excellent, the orange juice was fresh, the bread freshly baked, and once we had a wonderful dinner.  I would definitely return to the Do and recommend it to friends who would enjoy the same atmosphere.",4,2013,11,05
32,happyas,"Its location is second to none .Our room overlooked the square which always had some activity going on. The double glazed windows still allowed us to have a wonderful nights sleep on the most comfortable of beds. Everything about the room was wonderful from the fine linen, plush towels, molten brown toiletries to the fruit or chocolates left each night. The staff were great and very attentive and friendly. We only eat breakfast there and always outside which great and I have never enjoyed breakfast so much. we walked everywhere from here. Loved it and will return",5,2013,11,04
32,A Little Gem in Barcelona,"Having travelled all over Europe staying in ""boutique"" hotels, I have to say this is one of the best. Fantastic location on the square, superb staff, great food and very, very comfortable rooms. Sitting outside, watching the people on the square and having a great breakfast is one of my favourite memories of Barcelona.  The fine dining restaurant -unfortunately in the basement- serves excellent food on par with any of the Michelin restaurants. The rooms (and beds) are so comfortable that I didn't want to get up! The service is great - staff are extremely helpful, know you by name and are very professional.  Last but not least, Ruth the manager is probably the best reception manager I have encountered in all my travels in Europe. Thank you again for great stay(s).",5,2013,11,02
32,Barcelona Visit,"Excellent service from arrival. Staff always helpful. Location and room were superb. Couldn't have picked a better hotel. Not cheap but we certainly got what we paid for. Included breakfast was delicious. Would have loved a kettle in room to make cup of tea but found this was not a regular availability in Europe.
      ",5,2013,10,28
32,Superb location,"A half block in off La Ramblas sits this little gem of a hotel.  We stayed here for 3 nights, post cruise.  It was a quick 10-15 minute taxi ride from the pier to the hotel.  It is situated on the outer edge of the Barri Gotic, an easy walk up to Placa de Catalunya, a block away from the Liceu metro station. We took the metro down to Barcelonetta for an excellent paella dinner one night, and a taxi back at night cost 15 euros.  

There has been mention of concern about noise at the Hotel DO.  We stayed in room 25, not overlooking the square, no balcony, but an excellent king-size bed.  There was some noise (not enough to disturb sleep, but noticeable) the first night because we left the bathroom door open, and apparently that room's windows are not sound proofed.  Closing the bathroom door was the answer, perfectly quiet.

We ate dinner at La Cuina del DO our last night in Barcelona.  The meal was an exotic journey for our taste buds, delicious and beautiful food! Service throughout the hotel was top notch.

The last time we were in Barcelona we stayed at the Arts hotel, which was overpriced, a lousy location, and the service deplorable.  Hotel DO Placa Reial is a superb boutique hotel.   I will certainly stay here again.",5,2013,10,28
32,Beautiful hotel!,"Stayed here for a couple nights. Beautiful hotel! Great breakfast! Great location! Room was decent size, very clean, bathroom pretty large and loved the shower! Bed SUPER comfortable! Staff amazing, very friendly and helpful.
Will be back next time I'm in Barcelona :)",5,2013,10,26
32,Anniversary Break,"This was a pretty good choice. 20 minute taxi from airport, cost ‚Ç¨30. Right in the middle of the Ramblers on the Placa Reail square. Great spot to people watch from our balcony room overlooking the square. We were a bit concerned about noise from reading other reviews however the windows & shutters kept ALL the noise out so wasn't an issue.
Booked through booking.com & got a good deal with breakfast.
Some of the places around the square are pricey but have a look around first and you will find some with reasonable prices.",4,2013,10,23
32,Beautiful Hotel,"This hotel was worth every penny.  Didn't know what to expect, but when we walked in to see the designer finishes and 15' ceilings, we were blown away.  The rooms are incredibly well done.  In addition to that, they have a 'pillow menu' and will serve you breakfast in bed every day at no extra charge. The locations was perfect, felt like the heart of the city.  If you go to Barcelona...stay here.",5,2013,10,22
32,Better than 5 stars,"From the moment we arrived we were treated like family.  The complimentary champagne on the patio. The graciousness, friendliness and professionalism of the entire staff ( most notably Claudia,the concierge, and Val, the bartender (always a good friend to make!). There  was nothing they wouldn't, or couldn't, do to make our stay more enjoyable. Fruit in our room mid afternoon. Treats by our bed at night. The beds/bedding were like sleeping on a cloud. Complimentary breakfast every morning. The location was perfect. Sitting on the patio with tapas and wine on the square of Las Ramblas after a long day of sightseeing...there's no place I'd rather be. The Do is, quite honestly, one of the very best accommodations we've had the pleasure of staying. Thank you to all the staff for making our trip to Spain unforgettable!",5,2013,10,17
32,Splurge in Barcelona,"While I can't compare this boutique hotel to any others in Barcelona, I can say it met and exceeded our expectations. The complimentary breakfast was wonderful with delicious eggs and croissants and much more. The churro was exceptional.  Also, the stocked mini bar with sodas and waters was a really nice touch. The room was large and the bathroom huge.  I will say that I noticed that the French doors in our bedroom completely sealed off all noise while the French doors in the bathroom still allowed some street noise to come through. So after realizing that, I simply closed the doors to the bathroom each night for complete quiet. 

The service here is great and the sauna was really nice to use after a day walking in Barcelona. We came off a 6 star cruise ship and this was of the same level of quality and service.",5,2013,10,16
32,I highly recommend this fun hotel!,"The DO Placa Reial is a great hotel in absolutely the best location in Barcelona.  It is pricey, but if you only have 2 days to experience the city like we did, it was perfect and well worth the splurge.   Our suite was beautiful, I know my pictures don't do it justice but it was large, modern, comfortable and at the same time quaint with an old world feel.  We were on the next to top floor and while I missed being able to open the patio doors (not really a patio....but just an opening space for the doors), I appreciated the height for the views and the windows were large and operable in all directions as are most of those wonderful European windows.  The bathroom was huge and very modern with separate tub, commode enclosure, and even double shower heads in the large shower for you and your partner. There were actually more closets than I have in my bedroom.  The bed, and I am not exaggerating, was the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in in my entire life.  Being a certified insomniac and even more so with traveling, I could not get over how comfortable it was.  I didn't want to ever leave it but, of course, had too many things to see and do!

While the room was wonderful, it is often the little things that make for an exceptional hotel experience and the DO did all the ""little"" things very well!  We took full advantage of the free mini-bar (good selection of waters, sodas and wonderful fruit juices!), nightly fresh fruit and chocolates, and welcome drink.  The staff without exception were professional, courteous, helpful and friendly.  The lobby, dining areas and public spaces were decorated beautifully.  

Breakfast was included and could be had in the downstairs restaurant, the outdoor cafe area, in room or on the rooftop terrace.  We encountered one other couple up there and they left before we were halfway done, allowing us to enjoy a very nice quiet breakfast looking at the busy Placa Reial below.  Just an FYI, the dining on the terrace is just like room service but served on the terrace.  They leave you and go back downstairs.  You can call down for whatever you may need and they are more than happy to bring it, but it may take awhile.  So if you do prefer being hovered over, I would stick to eating in the restaurants.  The rooftop terrace is also a wonderful place to share a glass of wine after a busy day in the crowds.  Again, we had the place all to ourselves.....I was feeling definitely spoiled! 

As for the location, it is right on the most happening street for touring Barcelona, Las Ramblas, as well as the very popular Placa Reial.  And previous reviewers were correct, it would be noisy on either side of the hotel that you stayed, but we didn't hear a sound after we had closed the windows.  It is within walking distance to the port, the wonderful market La Baqueria, the Barcelona Cathedral, and just so many attractions.  The metro is also close by for trips farther afield and plenty of reasonable taxis nearby due to the Placa Reial being such a popular spot.

Lastly, this won't apply to most but thought I should mention it.  The hotel doesn't encourage driving to the hotel as it is a little complicated but we always have a car so needed to.  It's not at all hard to find but a little hard to get to just due to the crazy crowdedness of Las Ramblas. There is a nice, well lit, safe public car park about 2 blocks from the hotel.  You pay the hotel and they validate your parking ticket,  I was apprehensive as we arrived late but I needn't have worried.  It was very safe and not at all threatening given that Las Ramblas is busy with tourists all the time.",5,2013,10,14
32,Perfect Hotel,"Amazing experience.  Great location.  Room fantastic and service best I've come across in a long time.  Some reviews say that there can be some noise from outside - the rooms are very well soundproofed, we had no issues.  The restaurants are good too. Highly recommended.

32,Beautiful small Hotel on Busy square off The Ramblas,We stayed one night at Hotel DO and almost wished we weren't moving after a wonderful warm welcome and a lovely room and bathroom looking out to Placa Reial. The restaurant was very good with friendly service. Ilaria at the front desk was quite friendly and helpful. We highly recommend the Hotel DO,5,2013,10,10
32,Excellent Hotel,"22nd Sep
What a memorable hotel in the heart of Barcelona. I only stayed one night and wish I had time stay more.
The room was excellent with a great bed, sheets and welcoming drinks. The bathroom was also magnificent!
The staff were lovely and the food at the restaurant exceptional. Breakfast was also excellent.
The hotel is located on plaza Reial and there are lots of caf√©s and restaurants near by. Truly great food.

The only issue I had was the noise from the plaza. The singing and music was until 4am and then they started cleaning at 7am. After a long flight from Australia I must say I wasn't impressed. Apart form that an excellent hotel and one you MUST stay in! Book it!
",5,2013,10,09
32,Good but maybe not good enough,"The hotel is very nice.  Total of 18 rooms all contemporary.  Bed is comfortable.  Numerous pillow options.  Bathroom is spacious enough and the hotel has provided good toiletries. Excellent location with some street noise. Food is good at breakfast. Reception area is small but sufficient. Bar is well stocked. Overall a good hotel.  Now the bad. There was dust on the hardwood floors, a dirty napkin in one of the night stands and the bathroom counter was not clean.  I expect much more from a 5 star hotel. There are no luggage stands which is a problem. We are required to open the suitcases on the floor. Not preferred by us.  

In summary, for the price I expect near perfection.  With a small boutique hotel (only 18 rooms) there's no reason for the cleanliness issue.  The hotel is really trying to be at the top and with some adjustments they will attain a 5 star rating from this traveler.  Today is not that day.

",4,2013,10,09
32,Perfect hotel to discover Barcelona,"I chose this hotel to start a 10 day Spain trip with two nights in Barcelona. It was worth the splurge! The hotel is phenomenal. With a small number of rooms, the staff are very friendly, helpful, and knowledgable. The rooms are stylish, luxurious - with premium toiletries, large shower, turn down service with truffles, complimentary mini-bar, etc. The location is perfect for discovering the city on foot - near the water, the old city, the midtown boutique district, the market, etc. Steps from Rambles, you are right in the heart of the city. The sound proofed hotel lets you forget the all night city life the minute you call it a night. (On the first night, I must confess that I was awoken at 7:15 AM when the hotel received a very loud delivery. I complained and they were most apologetic. While I may have appreciated some partial refund on the night, I did not ask, and one was not offered. That said, they appeared to take the matter seriously and I believe them when they assured me that this would not happen again and that the no deliveries would come before 10 AM. I am willing to consider this a ""one-off"" that will not affect future guests.)  Having breakfast and pre-dinner drinks in the beautiful Placa Reial still evokes great memories.  Making excellent restaurant recommendations they obtained reservations (albeit for one person at the bar) at places where others were waiting over an hour for a table. I could not have started my vacation with a better choice of hotel.",5,2013,10,06
32,"Fantastic - go on, book it!","What a wonderful hotel in an excellent location! Upon arrival we were greeted by extremely friendly staff and presented with a glass of cava and a relaxing chair whilst the staff whisked away our cases and dealt with the paperwork. With the doors to the balcony closed at night (there is good air-con) we didn't experience a problem with noise, after long days of walking, and a comfy bed, nothing could stir us! The hotel retains its classic charm with high ceilings, nice shutters and floor to ceiling windows. 

The attention to detail was excellent. Each day a card was given with the weather for the next day. The hotel card with the address had our name and marshmallows or chocolate was left in the room. The towels were heavy and luxurious and nice Molton Brown products in the bathroom.

The breakfast was very nice, with the waiter telling us we could select more than one item from the menu. Breakfast can be taken outside in the square or up on the roof terrace. The staff were very efficient and helpful.

The hotel is in a central location, you couldn't get much better. 

Highly recommend travelling from the airport to the centre via train & metro. Its very cheap and very easy (‚Ç¨7ish each). Follow the signs for the train from inside the airport. Using the machine or ticket counter select Barcelona Sants Estacio. From here, jump on the metro three stops to Liceu (on the green line). Upon arrival head for street level and ensure you head towards McDonalds and KFC to be sure you are walking down La Rambles in the correct direction. Returning back to the airport is very easy, follow the airport signs once you get back to Sants Estacio. The orange ticket machines next to the ticket office sells train tickets, just search for Aeroport. Platform is normally 9 or 10. Last stop is the airport, so you can't miss it.",5,2013,10,03
32,Very short stay,"Unfortunately, I can't say we stayed here long enough to give it a full review. Without knowing ahead of time, we booked this hotel, and we encountered one of the festivals in Barcelona. As the other reviews have pointed out, noise can be a problem here. Well, our room, as nice as it was, was right next to the stage of a very loud concert that was just starting, and going well into the night. We couldn't hear ourselves think. To a certain extent, I wish our travel agent would have found this out before we booked. Nevertheless, the managment here did allow us to move hotels, and were very apolgetic about the noise. The room was very nice I have to say. I am not sure even in the best of circumstances this would be the place to stay if you are looking for quiet.",3,2013,10,02
32,Short trip in Barcelona,"What a fabulous hotel!!! We had a short break as part of our silver wedding celebration & from the first moment it was fantastic ! Met with a lovely attentive receptionist, glass of complimentary cava whilst we ""got over our trip from the airport"" before being shown to a fabulous room overlooking the square. The bed with it's multitude of different pillows was great. Free mini bar of water & soft drinks, lovely fresh fruit brought up each early evening & the evening capped of with either chocolates or biscuits left in the room. The room was large with a great bathroom , kept it's older features too! Ome of the loveliest hotels we have ever stayed at. As Arnie says "" we will be back""!",5,2013,09,23
32,Extraordinary stay!,"We stayed at DO Placa Reial for 4 nights in September 2013 and it was an extraordinary experience.
We were pleased with the welcome drinks, the early check-in and our beautiful and spacious room, with a wonderful view of Placa Reial. 
The location of the hotel is perfect.
Breakfast was excellent, the free mini bar was very useful and the little luxuries left in our room in the mornings and evenings were very nice.
We used the free and private spa and we enjoyed it very much.
The staff was very kind and professional.
We highly recommend this wonderful hotel!",5,2013,09,23
32,Fantastic boutique hotel in the heart of Barcelona,"We picked this hotel after reading other reviews on Tripadvisor and we were NOT disappointed! It is quaint , well decorated in a true Barcelonian eclectic fashion, exceptionally clean, exceptional staff and had all the comfort and details of a first class hotel. All water, juice, soda is stocked in your mini bar daily ( for free ), and espresso machine, breakfast either on the plaza, rooftop terrace or your room ( at your choice), afternoon complimentary fruit and nighttime sweet snack .... Always fresh and delicious. Beautiful room accommodations ( we had room #21 junior suite  with balcony overlooking the Placa de Reial and highly recommend it). It is a popular and busy square in the Gothic center of Barcelona and can be noisy but sound is greatly reduced when the balcony doors and drapes are closed. Dining in their exquisite La Cuina restaurant is a gastronomic delight. The hotel is centrally located to all the wonderful sites of Barcelona. Without a doubt we will recommend this fine boutique hotel to our friends and family traveling to Barcelona as well as to our fellow travelers   on tripadvisor!",5,2013,09,18
32,Fantastic location,"This hotel has the best location for exploring Barcelona. 

Pros:
- Staff are very helpful and friendly
- Molten Brown toiletries
- Location
- Firm beds
- Rooftop pool
- You can eat your breakfast while watching people go by on the plaza
- All the details in making your stay as comfortable and pleasant as possible

Cons:
- We were first given a double superior room with only a small window. It felt claustrophobic. We asked if they had any other rooms available, and to our luck they had a balcony room overlooking the plaza. Great service by the staff in this situation, who solved this immediately. But I am puzzled that the rooms has the same rate, when the size and feeling of the rooms were so different.
- The day after we arrived, it seemed as if the floors were not cleaned. We had been to the beach the day before, and could still feel the sand.

All in all, we were very pleased with our stay, and will stay here again.",5,2013,09,17
32,Boutique Location,"This hotel is in a great location, situated in the Gothic region of Barcelona, over looking the Placa Reial, adjacent to La Ramblas. It is walking distance to tourist area's, shops and restaurants 
The staff are extremely helpful, no request is a problem and they make you feel very welcome and comfortable. It is a boutique hotel with approximately 15 well appointed rooms and comfortable beds. It is worth requesting a room over looking the Placa Reial, which is a popular tourist spot, skirted by restaurants where you can sit, relax, eat, drink and watch the world go by. The hotel has three restaurants and breakfast can be served on the roof terrace if you give staff notice the night before. The Placa Reial is always busy at night, however the rooms have double glazing on the windows, so can can shut out the noise at night and have a quite nights sleep. They also have a small complementary private spa for two people, which is available for booking. There is no gym, but you can get your exercise walking around the local area.
A taxi rank is 20M away from the hotel entrance on La Ramblas, so it's easy to get to other parts of the city. If you have never been to Barcelona before, this hotel is a great starting point.",5,2013,09,15
32,Great hotel with one exception,"I was there in August. I had a junior suite No.11. This room is on the corner of the building. I have to say that this holtel is almost perfect: great location, nice and clean room, staff is very helpful, breakfast are good. The pool is tiny but does the job. The only exception to this list is the noise. At night, it can be very noisy especially if you have a corner room then the noise comes from two sides. You need ear plugs if you want to sleep. Otherwise everything is fine.",5,2013,09,13
32,A peaceful home away from home,"My daughter and I spent two nights in Hotel DO Placa Reial after a Mediterranian cruise and were absolutely delighted with this charming boutique hotel.  The service was friendly, professional and very committed to seeing that we were happy.  The restaurants were great and the rooms were plush and comfortable.  Although we were in an area that never sleeps, we did.  The noise of the square below did not penetrate our little cave and the beds were fabulous.  I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to my friends and I will certainly return there when I get back to Barcelona.

32,Wonderfully indulgent,"We stayed here for the last 3 nights of our honeymoon & it was a fantastic end to our holiday.

The location is amazing, and though noisy with the windows open, we found that by closing both the shutters & the windows, the noise practically disappeared.

The staff were extremely friendly & the service was excellent - the fruit & little sweet treats left in your room throughout the day were most welcome, as was the unlimited mini-bar full of soft drinks.

The only meal we had at the hotel was breakfast & this was great quality.

The roof terrace offered a santuary in which to sip cava overlooking the Placa Reial either before or after a night & once again, the service here excelled.

I would highly recommend this hotel for a bit of indulgence in the heart of Barcelona.",5,2013,09,12
32,Great hotel,"Location is perfect, just off  La Ramblas. Check in was easy and whilst the porter took our bags upstairs we were given a welcoming glass of Cava. The room was decorated to high standard and the huge bed has a choice of pillows. Bathroom had a bath and large walk in-shower. Our balcony overlooked the Placa Reial, and as other reviewers have pointed out suffers from noise, so take ear plugs. The rooftop pool is only a plunge pool but very welcoming on a hot afternoon after walking the streets of Barcelona. Only had breakfast but service was efficient and friendly. The menu is varied and anything I picked was nicely cooked and presented. I found all of the staff to be friendly and helpful.",4,2013,09,08
32,A dreamy hotel in the heart of Barcelona,"We stayed at this hotel as our last stop before flying home to the US. I was looking for a treat, a place to celebrate out time in Spain and it delivered. The hotel is actually quite small. It is luxuriously decorated and furnished with lots of character. I did find check in a bit awkward as there is just one person at a small desk inside the door. She was quite busy answering questions and trying to check people in and out. I felt crowded with our luggage and kids as we waited. But, there were free drinks at check in and from then on the place was perfect. From our rooftop room we had a view of the rooftops and the plaza below. The breakfast was unbelievable. We even go our own personal business cards. I could go on and on. A dreamy place.",5,2013,09,07
32,Great hotel spoilt by noise problems.,"Lovely hotel, individually decorated to a high standard. 
Staff friendly and very helpful. 
Position on Placa Reial superb.

Council drilling every morning in Placa in front of hotel prevented us enjoying a lie in in the superb bed.
This also ruined breakfast at the tables on the terrace in the square, and this was in August but the hotel appears to have no dialogue with the council to arrange this at a time to disturb guests less.
Some noise from doors in corridor and from next room's bathroom.",4,2013,09,02
32,fantastic hotel,"This hotel was fantastic, here we decided to make a more luxurious stop in our travel and that was it. The room was big, beautiful and very clean. The service superb and their welcome very warm. The breakfast had variety and although in a central area we never had problems with the noice. Everything was excellent.",5,2013,09,01
32,Beautiful property and brilliant location!,"This was one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in. We stayed in a suite and it was stunning. A really large, bright room with two balconies overlooking the Plaza Real. The bathroom was modern, fresh, and well-equipped. The minibar was well-stocked and the room also had a Nespresso machine with supplies. The room was beautifully furnished with a large, high, four poster bed and oodles of plump pillows. It also boasted a massive flat screen TV, a gorgeous wooden desk, a small coffee table and a comfortable couch and armchair.
The staff was welcoming and helpful. On arrival they offered complimentary drinks and were happy to help me organise a surprise spa treatment for my partner. We ate out each night and so were only in the hotel for breakfast. My only criticism of the entire stay was the slow service for breakfast. The terrace as packed with both residents and non-residents and there didn‚Äôt seem to be enough staff on duty. Other than this, we had a fantastic stay and would heartily recommend the Hotel DO Reial.",5,2013,08,29
32,Do Placa - Barcelona,"I just spent a few days at Hotel do Placa Reial Barcelona after staying in Madrid.  This is a tiny hotel, the location is amazing just off Las Ramblas but a little noisy due to its location, as I read in another review bring earplugs so I did a wonderful idea.
The food at the restaurant was great but expensive I guess like the whole of Europe, but this is definitely worth the price.

I had a wonderful stay.",3,2013,08,28
32,Very nice but just missed for me.,"This is a beautiful hotel in a wonderful location on one of the prettiest squares in Barcelona. We had a nice second floor room with a small balcony overlooking the square. In the evening we could open our window and take in the interesting scenes below us. This was definatley a luxury hotel with many extras. That being said it fell just short of excellent for me considering the rates we were paying. Here is why. First the staff does a very good job but they are understaffed. Often one person was trying to answer the desk phone, act as concierge and work check in and check out. It was just too much for one person to handle. My second criticism was the noise. There were often drunks singing or playing instruments below our window at all hours of the night and early morning (one guy played an accordian from 4 AM to almost 5:00 while his friend sang). Also, every morning the delivery trucks for all the restaurants on the square unload at about 7:30 AM. Even with these detractions I would rate this a very good hotel with a high comfort level and great location.",4,2013,08,18
32,"Wonderful, thoughtful touches","Yes, this hotel has a great location, lovely rooftop terrace and attentive staff, but the little extras make it a standout.  Loved the business cards provided at check-in with the guest name and hotel info- handy for cab rides and when you get lost.  The cava at check in was also a nice touch along with the nightly sweet treat and weather forecast.  We were in room 33 just steps from La Rambla but it was relatively quiet.  The room was small but had what we needed. The bathroom was awesome.",5,2013,08,17
32,Amazing boutique hotel in the heart of Barcelona,Stayed here 4 nights and loved every minute.  The room was gorgeous and spacious.  Service was great.  The concierge was very helpful with recommendations.  Couldn't ask for a better location.  It was great to return to this oasis after a hours of walking and exploring. Highly recommend this hotel. ,5,2013,08,10
32,Contradictions.,"I so very much wanted to write a great review for this hotel, but cannot. Yes, there's a lot to like about Hotel DO and we were very excited to stay there.  True, it is beautiful--intimate and well appointed.  True, the rooms are absolutely lovely.  True, the restaurant is very good.  True, the location is perfect.  Yet, for the price paid, and it is expensive, there are numerous issues.  Our Junior Suite and adjacent Double were located on the Placa Reial side.  We were delighted, thinking the view was so sweet.  However, though the tourists and Spaniards in the courtyard were having a great party until 4 a.m., it was so very loud that the group of us traveling slept very little.  I don't think we've every had a noise complaint at any other hotel, ever, but truly, this was an impossible situation for sleeping.  Secondly, one would expect the concierge and staff to be outstanding--for the price.  This was not the case.  We tried for days to confirm a side trip (offered by the hotel itself!) to a local winery/cheese farm, and it was the most difficult thing to accomplish.  For example, the quoted price for a driver changed daily.  The cheese farm was not available after all, etc. We asked if the wine tour was offered in English and were assured that it was; when we arrived at the winery, it was only Spanish.  We also tried several times to have drinks on the roof terrace, to no avail--""private parties, not open right now, no tables..."" were just some of the reasons given so we never actually enjoyed that space as we had hoped to at the end of a long day.  Also, if you want breakfast on the roof terrace, you must fill out a detailed order form the previous night, which is inconvenient.  Service staff at the restaurant, and generally around the hotel were not overly friendly, though a few of the bartenders were great.  It was quite a sharp contrast to Hotel Urban in Madrid, where staff was so very friendly and accommodating.  If you plan to stay here, make sure your room is AWAY from the plaza, and don't plan on any exceptional assistance from the staff.  The daily room snacks were quite nice, however....",3,2013,08,10
32,Best Ever,I love this place. The service is the best. The rooms are very trendy and everything is very personal. We had a room with the plunge pool on our balcony overlooking Gothic Square. The rooms was clean all the time. The food is great and the beds are comfy. The location is perfect. Most things are within walking distance.,5,2013,08,09
32,"Excellent location, nothing worthy of complaint","I guess this could be a 4 star review if 4 stars indicate ""perfect"" and 5 indicate ""exceptional."" It's not an exceptional ""must return "" to one-of-a-kind hotel but it is EXCELLENT..flawless...etc The lobby and theme are somewhere between museum nouveau and romantic. The staff is pleasant and quite helpful. The food in the restaurant is EXTRAordinary (and I rarely am a huge fan of hotel food)..the location is exceptional --right on a square at La Rambla. The rooms have WONDERFUL air conditioning with unusually cold minimum temperature options (12--13 degrees C!)..The pool is tiny and the ""spa"" is just a sauna. Their massage therapists are outside --house call--agents...There's really nothing to gripe about ..It's an intimate boutique ish hotel just large and busy enough to not really feel ""intimate "" -but still a wonderful ..somewhat upscale experience..I think the incredible food and in-room strong AC helped me push it to 5 stars! ",5,2013,08,07
32,Beautiful boutique hotel,Beautiful boutique hotel and fabulous location on the Placa Reial.  Not at all noisy and we had a room facing the Placa.  Lovely restaurant with outdoor seating.  Concierge was extremely helpful. Very small rooftop pool but lovely on a very hot day.  Would totally recommend this hotel.,5,2013,08,05
32,You get what you pay for.,"We really enjoyed our mini break in this comfortable hotel. Attention to detail everywhere. Quiet comfortable room in central location. Lovely bathroom. Very comfy bed. Lovely breakfast served in Placa Reail. Wifi in the room and the brilliant soft drinks were included which was most welcome. I say included and not free as nothing is free. The high price reflects the standard, and this hotel is proof that you usually get what you pay for.",5,2013,07,31
32,Disappointing,"I was really looking forward to our stay at the Do based on all the positive trip advisor reviews. Maybe my expectations were too high but I found my experience disappointing. 
The room was great but I did not think that it was so special.
Enjoyed the roof terrace. I thought the location was great.
The staff/service was okay but one female staff member at reception was actually quite rude when we realised we had made a mistake with our booking.
Overall, I enjoyed my stay but I have experienced much better elsewhere. I would not necessarily want to stay here again.",3,2013,07,30
32,Great location,"The taxi driver from the airport did not know the hotel which is always a worry! She dropped me on Placa Reial and said it is in there somewhere? No more than twenty paces off the Rambla and the oasis door opened. The reception is tiny but very tasteful and somehow intimate. I was greeted by a welcome drink and warm hospitality. Great room, excellent service. Food was good -a most enjoyable experience 
The only comment the bed was a little too hard, the hotel offers a pillow menu so some comfort there.
Apparently the hotel opened only recently but they seem to the service ver well sorted",5,2013,07,30
32,DO Stay Here!,"Central barcelona hideaway.  Very helpful concierge booked our events including sightseeing tickets so that we could avoid long lines and concert tickets at the fabulous music hall.  Quiet roof terrace was all our's during the day for relaxing, reading and napping.  Complimentary mini bar, daily in room treats were nice surprises.  Comfortable room and modern bathroom.",4,2013,07,20
32,Great hotel room,"Perfect it is not. The location is very central. Easy to walk to the beach and most attractions. The problem was the weekend noise in the Placa Reial made it very difficult to sleep. It was much better during the week but Barcelona is a late city. We came in for the night at 2:00am and it was still too loud. I have a feeling that the area is not at its best in the summer. It is certainly in the middle of all of the action, but for me too many young revelers that go all night.
The room was beautiful. Clean, fresh, spacious. The bathroom was equally great. The view over looking the plaza was interesting, but it is a very busy plaza. The concierge was very helpful and breakfast on the plaza was great.",4,2013,07,09
32,Many hotels have a restaurant. This restaurant has a hotel!,"They absolutely deserve their five stars, we had a fantastic time here. Right in the heart of the city, just off the Rambla and with the Barri Gotic on the other side, the Placa Reial is bustling with activity and from the lovely terrace you can people-watch all you want. The atmosphere is relaxed and the food is top-notch. The √† la carte breakfast (included), dinner, or just a cup of coffee - we were able to do it all outside, watching the tourists and enjoying the view. Rooms are as you'd expect - television and phone are European design brands (Loewe and B&O), there are boxspring beds, wooden floors and there is (remarkable!) some really well-chosen art work on the walls. The street noise is gone when you close the windows and blinds, the a/c is very effective. The reception, the overall atmosphere and the perfect location are just wonderful. We'll definitely be back. (Funny: the Google Streetview pic shows the hotel being created in 2009!)",5,2013,06,30
32,Wonderful Boutique Hotel!,"My husband and I had received recommendations from friends to stay at the Las Ramblas area in Barcelona. We selected the hotel DO for its location. On the taxi from the airport, we realized Las Ramblas is a very crowded street and were extremely worried about the noise and the crowds. We were so pleasantly surprised to see that the hotel DO, although within steps from Las Ramblas, is a wonderful oasis that faces a very nice square which gives you a sense of being near the action but away from it all as well. The rooms are sound-proof and we only heard outside noises when we opened the beautiful doors to the veranda to look out onto the square. Our room was very comfortable and spacious with an immaculate heavenly bed. When the beds were turned every night they would leave amazingly beautiful snacks, e.g., chocolate-covered strawberries or coconut / chocolate covered marzipan balls! The reception staff as well as the restaurant staff were very friendly, spoke perfect English, and went out of their way to make our stay at the DO relaxing and memorable. Will stay there every time we visit Barcelona!",5,2013,06,30
32,Perfection,"We spent three nights at this beautiful hotel, it is in a perfect location about three minutes from the metro and ten minutes walk from the beach. The staff are lovely and the hotel atmosphere is very relaxing. 
There was no problem with noise at night with the shutters and windows shut. It was lovely to sit and watch the world go by on the roof terrace whilst enjoying a relaxing drink. 
The breakfast was absolutely delicious you can have everything you want from the menu if you wish. We particularly liked the fresh orange juice, croissants and eggs and bacon. We also ate at the restaurant in the evening the food tasted as good as it looked! We will be back with friends next time.",5,2013,06,30
32,Pricey but worth it!!,"The location and service at Hotel Do were amazing.  From the moment we arrived we were made to feel welcome, and the front desk staff went out of their way to ensure that we had a great stay.  Loved our room with a balcony overlooking the Placa.  Room rate included an a la carte breakfast that we enjoyed outside every morning.  Food was fantastic at all times of the day, and we loved the treats that were left for us each night.  Bed was soooo comfy that we might not have gotten up if there wasn't so much to do and see.  Just coming off less-than-stellar service at our hotel in Venice we could not have been happier.  We will absolutely recommend Hotel Do and hope to return soon!",5,2013,06,29
32,Return Visit,"Our second stay at this amazing Hotel in the heart of Barcelona. Wonderful rooms with soaring ceilings, beds and linen so comfortable, large airy bathrooms with excellent products. Good room service , put out some cleaning in the morning and it was done,beautifully, by mid afternoon.Terrace restaurant has amazing tapas, and the Restaurant in the lower level is to ""die for"",if you have something special to celebrate or you just want to spoil yourself try this restaurant, you wont regret it. My only ""complaint"" no turn down service.....and when you get back at the end of a great day exploring, eating, drinking in Barcelona, what to do with all those pillows on the bed is a little daunting !!!!! Staff are wonderful and so helpful.....but you get the picture, go and stay , you wont be disappointed....",5,2013,06,25
32,Totally perfect,"I have to echo all the recent reviews of this hotel. Where to start with superlatives? Absolutely great staff, amazing breakfasts, beds soooo very comfortable, large airy rooms with excellent facilities, silent aircon and brilliant soundproofing, perfect location. Fruit and sweet treats in the rooms every day. Every last detail for a perfect stay has been thought through - they have developed this hotel as if it is somewhere they would love to live - and it has worked perfectly - this is not a hotel that has been based on chance and hope - you really feel the love that designed everything to make your stay wonderful. The hotel is as good as everyone else has said - from every point of view. Will definately return.",5,2013,06,24
32,A great place to stay,"Where to start? The location is superb, busy and buzzy, and close to most of the things you want to see and do. There are ample and cheap taxis for the few that are further away, and as well, a metro stop nearby.
The staff were uniformly excellent: helpful and knowledgeable. We had the impression that nothing was too much trouble for them. Their recommendations on where to eat were 1st class, and their assistance in booking trains, tickets etc was invaluable.
The rooms (we took a junior suite and our adult daughter had a superior double) were exceptionally well laid out and comfortable, with great views over the Placa Real. The double glazed windows opened to allow fresh air in, and when closed kept out the noise from the square. The bed in our room was supremely comfortable, and the storage space was excellent. The bathroom was a delight, and one of the few I've found anywhere not to flood the floor every time someone took a shower!
The included minibar and fruit were refreshed every day, and great after a hard of sightseeing.
Breakfast too was terrific, with a wide range of high quality choices.
All in all, one of the best hotels we've ever stayed in, and well worth the price. I would return there in a flash, and would recommend it without any hesitation.",5,2013,06,24
32,Sumptious boutique hotel in a great spot,"Beautiful rooms, excellent refurbishment and handy sauna/steam room make it a really great place to relax. Indulgent but affordable for a few hundred dollars a night, highly recommended.  And make sure you get breakfast included - then you can ask for a tapas plate of everything on the breakfast menu ;)",5,2013,06,23
32,Delicious Delightful and Do lovely!,"Have just returned to magical Barcelona after a hiatus of 27 years and found the Hotel Do  Placa Reial, a boutique hotel just off the Rambla and overlooking the Placa Reial. The location is walking distance to absolutely everything and for those who prefer a taxi there's a stand round the corner.
The hotel is totally gorgeous with just 18 rooms all with iconic views.
The lobby is compact yet super luxe with plenty of areas to relax after a day of touring and the bar offers coffee and a cool vibe during throughout the evening.
The room is beyond 5 star with beautiful beds, bathrooms, plenty of storage space and modern yet warm interior design with white and wood tones high, beamed ceilings and excellent air conditioning.
The windows are double glazed to minimize noise from the square below and the room is serviced regularly.
The staff are all extremely helpful and nothing is too much trouble. Breakfast was included in our rate and it was superb anything we asked for was provided and the utmost quality produce was served. This hotel is a real jem, we will definitely come back!",5,2013,06,20
32,5 Stars All Round,"This is an excellent hotel in the heart of Barcelona. Extremely helpful staff and very comfortable facilities. Even though located on the busy Placa Real, the rooms are silent; in fact the air conditioning was so silent we could not hear it at all. The excellent breakfast can be taken in the restaurant, in your room or on the roof terrace by the pool.  My wife and I could not fault with this hotel at all and would definitely stay there again.",5,2013,06,20
32,Want to find the best Hotel in Barcelona - well this is it !,"We have now been to Barcelona 4 times and have stayed in some great hotels - but this is the best yet. It deserves every one of its 5* rating. Excellent location, excellent staff & service and excellent room with everything that you could wish for slippers, bathrobes and good quality towels and bed linen, air con etc. etc. Free soft drink mini bar, fruit and chocolates at 'turn down'. I just cant say enough good things about this place and the breakfasts WOW ! fresh pastries, fresh orange juice and fruit and yogurt and many cooked and cold options all to be enjoyed in a wonderful atmospheric setting. 

We cant wait to come back.",5,2013,06,07
32,"5 stars for room and service, 2 stars for noise","All the previous reviews have  summed up how fantastic this hotel is. The standard of service is right up there with the best I have experienced world wide. By now you all know how great this place is but just a small word of caution for those who like some sleep! I guess if you are in your twenties and thirties you can stop reading now but for everyone else you need to avoid the rooms that face onto the small side road that leads to the Ramblas. We had a lovely junior suite, room 11, its the corner room on the first floor. It was an amazing room but has two windows both to the Placa Reial, the main square and also a window facing onto the small side road to the Ramblas. Please note that this is where all the noise comes from when the clubs turn out and people go to this corner to get cabs and so on. On all 4 nights the din woke us up and reaches a crescendo between 3 and 4.30. Now I know that Barca is a noisy place but at 400 euros a night for a junior suite it felt wrong. Will definitely go back to the Do but will ask for a room facing the square only. The noise from the square actually is OK and won't keep you awake as the sound proofing is good enough. Also you'll note that the Police patrol the Placa Reial very regularly and prevent too much early hours fun and games. Hope this helps, its meant to be helpful. I do love the place.",4,2013,06,06
32,Did it twice,That's how good this hotel is... worth every penny.  And we did it twice in a month.  Why? because the hotel is on the best in Europe at the most reasonable prices. It's located in the middle of all the action from the Plaza Reial  to Las Rambles to the Harbor and Catalunya square.  The service is outstanding.  The Breakfast is include in the price along with the Mini Bar. They do not nickle and dime you to death.  WiFi is excellent.  Fruit in your room every night in addition to some treats.  After your reach the hotel they give a complementary drink as you check in and relax.  Now that's service .,5,2013,06,03
32,"Amazing hotel, service, view, food.....","We came to this hotel for a night before our cruise out of Barcelona.  The check in was easy, the front desk was very friendly and welcoming and went out of their way to reprint a ticket for us that we had left in Canada. 

The rooms were spacious and felt very cozy.  You literally feel at home in this place. Our room overlooked Placa Reial and had a cute little balcony that we could go out on and people watch.  Even though it is quite loud outside the large doors do wonders in keeping out all the street noise.  The bathrooms were well laid out, and the separate bath and amazing rain shower with enough water pressure to make it feel like a typhoon was wonderful.  

We had breakfast which was included with our package after our relaxing night at this hotel and the pastries were so delicious as we're the scrambled eggs.  Oh and almost forgot the mini bar with non alcoholic drinks in our room which were free was a very nice touch!

We can't wait to one back to explore more of the city of Barcelona and will definitely be staying at this beautiful property. No wonder they are now a 5 star hotel.  ",5,2013,06,02
32,You think it's great. But it's better.,"This was the best hotel experience I've had in Europe and here's why: 
- Location is incredible. You will spend all your time around Placa Reial. There's the barrio, the ancient Jewish quarter, the Picasso museum, the cathedral, the Boqueria, the Ramblas, the Parc Guell - all 10 minutes or less by foot. If you want to venture out to more of Barcelona, the metro is three minutes away. 
- Comfort. The bed and linens and size of bathroom are luxurious. The airtight windows keep sound out. Sleeping well made my first few days in Europe comfortable. 
- Free soft drinks. I loved this concept. I enjoyed my sparkling mineral water, juices and one day I even indulged in a coca-cola. Replenished daily. Fantastic.
- Smart. You know when you remove your key-card, all the power is turned off in your room? Not at Hotel DO. The desk plugs stay on to keep your laptop and phone charged while you're gone. Brilliant.
- Breakfast. You start your meal with a plate of croissants, and fresh baked goods. They bring you local farmhouse cheese and a selection of cured meats. Then you get to order anything off the menu. No buffet here; everything is cooked to order. I had the fresh fruit plate and yogurt and an omelette once or twice. Incredible.
-Friendliness. Everyone was kind and helpful but not over the top. After 6 days, I felt everyone was a friend and I didn't want to say goodbye. 
Barcelona is an amazing city and since it was my first trip to Spain, I wanted it to be special. Hotel DO Placa Reial made it that way. Just go.",5,2013,05,22
32,Truly a lovely experience.,"We've just got back from our long weekend trip in Barcelona where we stayed at the DO for 3 nights. I had taken my husband to Barelona as a surprise 40th birthday celebration and I wanted a hotel which offered elegance, coziness and a perfect location. I got it all. We arrived and were greeted with lovely warm smiles and two glasses of cava which we enjoyed at our leisure while the staff organised the paperwork and luggage. The room was clean, modern and very cosy. The bed is a delight. The chairs in the room are modern and very comfortable. After spending a day exploring Barcelona, we returned to our room to find little treats - chocolate covered strawberries, fruit or little chocolates. They were always appreciated. In addition the mini bar of juices, water and cola is complimentary. Also greatly appreciated. It's these small details which make your stay memorable. The staff are incredibly friendly and helpful. You really do feel that they are happy to see you, to help you and most importantly enjoy their job. The location is perfect. Right in the old town, close to La Rambla. Heaps of bars and restaurants in close proximity. Our room faced the Placa Reial which is still very lively late into the night. However we heard nothing. Double glazed windows eliminate all extraneous noise. 
There are only two tiny things I would fault:
1. The lighting in the restaurant downstairs is a tiny bit too low. We found it a bit too dark. It just needs a few more mood lights to add light but not effect the ambience. 
2. I'm short (155cm) and the safe is placed on a high shelf and deep into that shelf. Needless to say, I had great difficulties placing and removing items from the safe. 

As I said, small issues which did not deter from the incredible experience. My husband loved this hotel and his birthday surprise in Barcelona. I would strongly recommend this hotel. It truly delivers. ",5,2013,05,20
32,Fabulous!!!,My favorite hotel of all time.  So special. Staff was great and experience was exquisite. Could not be better. Beautiful and luxurious. Near la Ramblas and on the Placa Reial where the nightlife thrives.,5,2013,05,19
32,Worth every penny - whats not to like!,"I'm not sure how anyone could fault this chic elegant hotel. The location is great, pretty central to the city, overlooks the Placa Reial square with a great seating area where we enjoyed soaking up the atmosphere & bustle with gigantic gin & tonics. We had no noise issues whatsoever in our room which overlooked the square, in fact I found the whole of the interior of the hotel to be calm & tranquil
We had dinner 1 night - delicious and the breakfasts were wonderful too.
Our Room - spacious & comfortable, nice modern bathroom and everything spotlessly clean
Best thing about our stay ‚Äì the amazing staff. I think the best I have ever encountered, even in the most upmarket hotels, NOTHING is too much trouble for them, everything is done with a smile, they are so knowledgeable about the area and they seem to know what you need before you ask. We were made to feel so welcome & cosseted. This would usually be slightly more than I‚Äôd pay for a city break hotel, but it was for a special birthday treat & I‚Äôm so glad I paid that bit extra to be treated so nicely & get the most out of the trip I don‚Äôt think it possible to have had a better stay anywhere else
Management take note ‚Äì take care of your staff, they are worth their weight in gold",5,2013,05,18
32,Can't see how it can be beaten in Barcelona,"This has to be the best hotel in Barcelona, at least if you like small boutique hotels.  The location is superb, right on the liveliest square in the city and in the Gothic Quarter.  We had a fabulous superior room with two balconies overlooking the square.  I know some have expressed concerns about the noise, but we didn't have any issues and kept the doors open (other than for sleeping) to feel the energy.  Our room wasn't huge, but really well appointed with a great bathroom.  The service was super friendly and thoughtful (including the treats), with two people offering to use their personal credit cards to book tickets to the Sagrada Familia when I was having trouble using mine.  A special call out to Marc, who helped with Barcelona FC tickets and was overall really helpful.  Lastly, the offerings at breakfast were probably the best that we've had at any hotel, with service pretty much wherever you want it.  Huge recommendation!",5,2013,05,17
32,Outstanding boutique hotel,"We spent a few night here before embarking on a cruise. The location was close by the Port Vell and all tourist attractions. The staff went out of there way to ensure we had a relaxing visit. It's right on the Placa Reial square but we could barely hear the late noise. They have automatic shutters that close at night helping block the noise. The breakfast that was included was made to order and downstairs in a underground restaurant. They had eggs, fresh Danish, fruit etc. All white table clothes and beautiful. ",5,2013,05,04
32,"Do they deserve such rave reviews? Um, Yes!","I was suspicious. How can any hotel have such consistently good reviews? It must be a scam, eh? Well, I'm here to tell you that I am a real person with experience in fine hotels (thanks to a business expense account!) and that Hotel DO is right up there at the top of boutique city hotels.  Little things that are rare in Europe: Tissues in the bathroom, a clock, a separate shower that doesn't require a tightrope walker's balance, a wonderful bed and bedding.  Big things: superb location, wonderful appointments, great food, an extremely responsive staff.  A week before we stayed in Hotel 1898 just down La Rambla and we hung out in the bar of Le Meridien Hotel across the street. Hotel DO has bigger rooms and more amenities.   Consider this: Open your balcony window facing the Placa, order coffee or a Tinto, and sit watching the crowds from above like some member of Catalan Royalty.  Noisy at night? Well, you have your thumb on the carotid of Barcelona, you might hear some thumping. The shutters and very modern thick doors really work well to keep down noise from the Placa and we NEVER heard noise from other rooms. Modern, clean, well designed, and beautifully appointed.  Are we going back?  Oh yeah!",5,2013,04,29
32,good quality,"First things first, the restaurant is a jewel, so too the breakfast and hotel location.  Great place to chill and step out of the crazy action going on nearby.  Enjoyable design and living.  Will be going back again soon.",5,2013,04,28
32,Boutique gem right off La Rambla,"This is one of my favorite hotels ever. Period. First and foremost, the staff provided flawless service and responded to all of my requests with zero pretense or fuss. The hotel overlooks the Pla√ßa Reial, which is buzzing with activity day and night yet is buffered from the throngs of tourists along La Rambla. The 18-room boutique hotel and its outdoor restaurant engage this public space naturally yet maintain the proper degree of privacy. The rooms are well appointed yet uncluttered. I especially liked the inset wooden desk. The staff arranged for me to use the hotel spa on short notice, and all of the facilities were spotless.",5,2013,04,24
32,Everything was perfect!,"Cannot think of a single negative about the stay at this hotel.  The concierge service was tremendous, room was excellent, breakfast was great & the location cannot be beat!  Each afternoon they left treats in the room, chocolate covered strawberries, cookies or fresh apples were what we found on different days in the room.  The robes and slippers and heated towel rack were an added bonus.  Would highly recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Barcelona!",5,2013,04,23
32,Great choice for a stay in the centre,"Great location and lovely hotel. Clean and cute rooms and friendly staff. Only one small complaint is the noise from the square can get too much on a Friday or Saturday night, but then it is a busy square right in the heart of the old town. Beautiful and boutique and recommended by me.",4,2013,04,17
32,Wonderful service in an ideal setting,"Stayed here for 4 nights, excellent boutique accommodation with really nice touches, great staff and a great quality food in the restaurant.  Great location from which to explore Barcelona, would happily return and recommend it to anyone looking for a relaxing and memorable place to stay.",5,2013,04,13
32,A real treat,"Last day of holiday. Dropped hire car at airport and took taxi into Barcelona, before catching plane next day. Hotel located in Plaza of same name. Lovely square. Boutique Hotel is lovely. Very attentive from moment we arrived, taking luggage to rooms as we enjoyed free welcome drink in lounge/bar area. The rooms were very comfortable with great shower. best bed and pillows and wonderful sleep. We met friend for dinner and dined in hotel's gourmet restaurant. Treated with complimentary cava. We had 40 euro set menu which was lovely. Wines were great but Priorat I choose was expensive! At the end of meal waiter introduced the Chef to us. Memorable stay. Expensive stay but wonderful treat with great service",5,2013,04,11
32,Birthday Treat...and how!,"Not a significant birthday, but a treat nonetheless.  Reception staff, wonderfully welcoming, spotted the date from my passport and we were treated to a bottle of extremely good Cava next day.  The restaurant was stylishly unostentatious and the food as impressive as the attentive, but not at all intrusive, service.  Eating tapas on the terrace was also a delightful experience.

The room was comfortable and clean. Fresh fruit, chocolate treats, free mini bar of soft drinks all added to the feeling of luxury.  And then there was the bathroom; beautifully fitted out and equipped with luxurious toiletries.

The jewel in the crown, though, was the staff. Nothing seemed too much trouble and there were  always smiles. It is a wonderful place in a brilliant location and we will certainly be returning.",5,2013,03,26
32,Flawless Experience.  Period.,"When I'm traveling on business, I'm a big fan of Four Seasons.  I just want excellent and invisible service and bascically, as many of the creature comforts oh home as possible. But when traveling for pleasure, I prefer to be a ""little closer to the ground"".  I want to know I'm NOT at home, but I don't want to sacrifice service, location or comfort.  For this reason, I always seek out the best boutique hotel I can find.  And WOW; this time I achieved a new high!

My husband and I and two teenagers spent four days in Barcelona during a three week trip to Spain in December (2012)/January (2013)

Hotel Do is, simply, perfect.  A former youth hostel that underwent what must have been a tremendously costly reno and re-opened in it's current iteration in January?  February? of 2013, it is 18 rooms of perfection. (Have I used that word often enough?)  Located on the very busy and very centrally located Placa Reial, I suspected, regardless of what I read, that noise might be a bit of an issue, but I was willing to chance it, based on looks, reviews and location.  First of all, they have nailed te noise issue. Shuttered windows blacked out not only all light, but all noise.  Didn't hear a thing until we chose to.  The ideal.  

The rooms.  What to say about the rooms.  Dark hardwood flooring throughout both massive bedroom and massive bathroom meant we were traipsing around in (however clean) someone's else's DNA (yes, I'm one of those - lol).  Beautiful white linens on the exceptionally comfortable king-sized bed, floor to ceiling, full-wall closets and a lovely little sitting area by the window (I'll attach a photo of the view from our room if I can figure out how) completed what is probably the ""prettiest"" and most functional hotel room I have ever stayed in.  

The bathroom deserves it's own paragraph.  The dark hardwood floors continue into the bathroom.  A huge double vanity with ultra-modern, sleek and beautiful white sinks and fixtures gave of a very definite ""spa"" vibe.  The rain-head shower, EASILY big enough for two people to shower together - errr....I think ......was a joy.  Top-drawer amenities, (a selection of body soaps and shampoos - his and hers ) in pump bottles continued the spa feeling.  And then we had the soaking tub.  Not only the perfect size, but the perfect angle/slope to enjoy a good long read in the tub - a personal fave.  At the far end of this already huge bathroom was the closed off toilet with a hammered (stainless steel?) door to ensure complete privacy.

Two quick and easy points that every other supposedly five star hotel could learn from.  Every morning, a plate of chocolate-covered strawberries magically appeared in our room.  And every evening, a plate a chocolate truffles.  Small, but absolutely lovely gesture.  Secondly, a pillow menu.  THANK YOU GOD.  I'm not as princessy as this may make me sound.  I am 56 and have a neck that i would often like to disown.  Having a choice of pillow firmnesses and filling was an ENORMOUS joy to me.  I don't see that as often as I'd like and truly appreciate the extra effort and investment this option requires on the part of the hotel.

Service.  Not ONCE did I call the front desk and wasn't immediately greeted by name.  Not once did I make an enquiry that wasn't met with such genuine enthusiasm and - dare I say it - GRACE, that I finally asked what the secret was.  Everyone seems so genuinely happy to be working there.  Apparently the only ""secret"" is the family that owns the hotel genuinely wants everyone - including their employees - to be happy.  This attitude was consistent throughout the hotel; front desk, bar, both restaurants.  

The first night, exhausted, we elected to eat on the main floor outside dining patio.  Three weeks in Spain (Madrid, Segovia, Barcelona, Toledo) and the Tapas we enjoyed there certainly ranked in the top four Tapas experiences of the trip.  Coupled with a waiter who could not do enough for us and was happy to make recommendations whenever asked and we were seriously tempted to eat there again the next night.  But we didn't let ourselves.  And I still regret that.

This is already too long a review, but I have to add one small thing.  Two mornings we chose to eat breakfast in the downstairs dining room which was almost empty.  And both times enjoyed a beautiful meal.  Only after we had left did we hear that there is a (apparently well-founded) rumour afoot that the dining room (again, the downstairs dining room) is already being whispered about in Michelin circles.  While I can't attest to the verity of that rumour, nor did I have dinner in this dining room, I certainly didn't experience anything that would be inconsistent with one-star.  Quite the opposite.

Bottom line: As much as I enjoy finding new and exciting boutique hotels, I would look no further when I return to Barcelona.  For my money, this is simply as good as it gets.  Period.",5,2013,03,14
32,Great boutique hotel in a great location,"Positives: great location, great service, lovely comfortable beds, molton brown toiletries and a modern tastefully decorated room, free soft drinks in mini bar, Very helpful staff - good restaurant recommendations. Negatives:  room wasnt ready till 4pm which was quite a long time to wait considering we arrived at 10.30am! & not as much choice in the breakfast. 
As you can see the positives far outweigh the negatives. Its a lovely hotel in a great location & the nothing is too much trouble for the staff - true customer service! ",4,2013,03,13
32,Excellent hotel,"stayed there for business; best service i had in a long time; friendly and helpful. beautiful hotel, well designed. room was great, clean and comfortable, new and although not big - specious enough. location is also excellent, on ramblas facing a beautiful square, walking distance form the port. highly recommended.",5,2013,03,04
32,Great boutique hotel in Las Ramblas,"I just spent a week at Hotel do Placa Reial.  Very small hotel (5 or 6 rooms on each floor) in a great location just off Las Ramblas.  Cute, small bar on the main floor with a good selection of wine and cocktails.  Very helpful staff.  My room (on the 3rd floor) looked over the Placa Reial - very pretty.  Great bed, big closets, and very nice bathroom (separate tub and shower).  Only reason the hotel doesn't get 5 stars from me is because it can be noisy.  Late at night there are loud revelers in the Placa stumbling their way home.  If you are a sound sleeper, the hotel is perfect.  If not, bring earplugs.  

The restaurant in the lower level of the hotel is great.  Fantastic food and presentation.  Not cheap, but worth it.

Would I stay here again?  Definitely.",4,2013,03,02
32,A Calm Refuge,"We were were so happy to have this well-located refuge in a busy city.  Our room was large, extremely quiet and comfortable, with a great bed, plenty of room for storing things, and a lovely view of the Placa.  We liked that the toilet could be shut off from the rest of the bathroom, and, in a town where so many people smoke, the lovely room spray was most welcome.  Breakfasts were unbelievably delicious and generous and fortified us for long, art- and architecture-filled days. (Art lovers shouldn't miss the Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya, as well as, of course, the works of Gaudi and his contemporaries.)  As others have mentioned, the welcome beer/Cava at reception was gratefully accepted, and the before- and after-dinner snacks were special treats.  Despite reading everything provided, we never did master the complicated lighting system, and, except when one of us inadvertently turned on lights in the middle of the night, we found the room generally dark at night though very sleek.  This was somewhat offset by two comfortable chairs under a reading lamp and a bright desk lamp, but we needed our flashlight to see in the closet.  While the receptionists were extremely personable, none were able to translate our interests into exciting, walkable restaurant recommendations.  (The hotel's restaurant, La Terasse, was recommended and a disappointment as we hoped for a traditional paella and got only rice and some not-so-tasty lobster for quite a lot of $$).  We did bump into two restaurants that might have been interesting had they not been closed for Christmas Eve, the last night of our stay, but we now know they are there.",4,2013,02,27
32,Couldn't fault it!,"We had a wonderful stay here this month.  We stayed for 4 days and could easily have spent two weeks with Hotel Do Placa Reial as our base as it is a good central location to walk to many attractions and has easy access to buses, taxi's and metro.  
The staff were warm and friendly and put us at our ease from the moment we arrived.  Nothing was too much trouble.  On one occasion I couldn't get the safe open.  I phoned reception from my room and within 10 minutes it was repaired.
We had a lovely spacious room with balcony looking out onto the square with a lovely en suite bathroom, separate shower, large bath and toilet.  Our room had a huge bed and I had the best nights sleep I have had in months.  There was also a free non-alcoholic mini bar in the room.  Extra touches such as a couple of tangerines or strawberries dipped in chocolate and a weather forecast for the following day were left in our room which made us feel spoilt.
We had no idea what to expect from the restaurant and chose the tasting menu.  It was the best meal we had during our stay.  Each course was a feast for the eyes as well as the tastebuds and we were very happy to shake the chef's hand and thank him in person after our meal. 
We enjoyed a visit to a jam session at Jamboree Jazz Club just a few steps from the hotel and next to that is a venue for Flamenco dancing. 
Thank you Hotel Do Placa Reial, we had a wonderful stay.",5,2013,02,26
32,Excellent !,"Great boutique hotel with excellent location in Barcelona. We were coming from Marrakech (stayed at the Riad Monceau hotel which was pure gem) and on our way back to UK ;the stop we made at this lovely boutique was a good surprise. 
Our room was overlooking the Placa Reial and was spacious and beautiful. Staff were friendly and helpful without being intrusive. 
All in all a great experience even though our stay was very short. Will definitely return and spent couple days there if given the chance.",5,2013,02,25
32,Centrally located luxury with the personal touch,"Everything about our five nights at this hotel was perfect. Room, facilities, food and especially staff was top notch. The location is perfect for exploring the sights, the shops and the port side. The extra little touches (fresh fruit to the room, complimentary mini bar and excellent breakfast) made our stay extra special. We will be back!!",5,2013,02,24
32,Free sauna!!!,"This hotel was stunning. Staff were friendly and humble- especially considering they were waiting hand and foot on two teenage girls! The location was 3 mins from the local metro station and directly in the hub of the old city. The square itself is absolutely beautiful and after 3 days walking around Barcelona I can safely say we never saw anything that compared. But I think it was the freebies that really seduced us: biscuits, chocolate covered strawberries, macaroons and a free minibar were part of an array of little treats left for us over a period of 3 days. Oh and did I mention that the sauna was free? ",5,2013,02,24
32,Best Hotel,"Went for a long weekend to this lovely hotel. Perfect location and very close to las ramblas in Barcelona, ideal to explore the city. Very friendly and helpful staff, very clean and nicely fitted rooms and perfect service. A wonderful roof terrace to overlook la plaza real. Amazing weekend!!
Thank you very much .",5,2013,02,21
32,Great hotel!,"My partner and I just spent the week-end at Hotel DO. I've been to Barcelona many times but this hotel was the best I've stayed in. Overlooking the Placa Reial we were treated to an amazing spectacle from our balcony on Sunday morning  of Los Gigantes gathering in the square to celebrate Sant Fermin. 

All the staff were great (especially Louis from Streatham!!) and the breakfast to die for (especially the Xoca - doughnuts filled with creamy custard!). We'll be back - very soon if I get my way. Thanks to all the staff.",5,2013,02,20
32,Excellens hotel in central Barcelona,"Wonderful hotel!! Staff was really nice and attentative. Breakfast included also to your room at no extra charge. My room was a single room and pretty small, but it had it all. The bathroom was as big as the rest of the room with Molton Brown products, bathrobes etc. I really liked this, one of the best I've stayed at. The only ting was that some money dissapeared from my wallet in the room when I went down for breakfast the last day. I used the safe the other days and obviosly should have that last day. If not for this I would have ratad this hotel higher.",4,2013,02,11
32,Magnificent Hotel,"Nothing can beat the superb location between La Rambla and Plaza Reial, close to everything. The beds and their ‚ÄúPillow menu‚Äù makes you sleep like Royalties. The breakfast is lavish and served to your table at pleasure, no buffet. Why not finish with a glass of Cava? Everything included in the price for the room. We where there in December, so the roof terrace was not open. We used the bar at street level, both inside and outside, to drink and look at all the people at the plaza. The service at the Hotel was overall impeccable so I gladly recommend this small five star hotel and I promise to stay here next time I visit Barcelona.",5,2013,02,07
32,"Great Location, Room and best of all Staff","Loved the view of Placa Reial as there is always some action in the Placa.  This is the best location in the city.  Wandering through the gothic quarter was wonderful.  The staff really made our stay and worked very hard to accomodate our wishes from arranging coveted FCB tickets (10th row, no less) to helping us to rent a car and tour the coast.  Beautiful hotel and great restaurant but the staff really makes this hotel. Thanks for making our trip wonderful!",4,2013,02,05
32,Kidnapped to Barca,"My wife decided that we should celebrate my birthday in Barcelona, we had great memories of the city in the early '80s when we were part of a motorcycle racing team competing in the ""24 Horas De Montjuich"" Much has changed and particularly the Rambla has been cleaned up, and is not quite as much fun as it was. Anyway,the Hotel Do was a real find, modern 'designer' interior in a classical building on the (now) beautiful placa DoReial. The reception and other staff were particularly smiley, helpful and efficient, and our mood was much lifted by the immediate appearance of a cold beer and flute of Cava while we completed formalities. Our room (21) was truly gorgeous, looking onto the square, with a balcony, a four poster bed and enough fluffy white pillows to get lost in.Housekeeping was to a very high standard and the bathroom was properly luxurious. Breakfasts were attentively served and of good quality, only a little marred by the gloomy and under-lit basement restaurant. The hotel has outdoor terraces on the square which are probably fantastic in spring/summer, but this was January.
The final and huge plus point of the 'Do' is it's position, just off the lower Rambla within easy walking distance of most sights and the metro, and with literally thousands of bars and restaurants within staggering range. Although it was quite expensive and only just within acceptable value for money, we loved it.",5,2013,02,02
32,Luxurt Boutique Hotel,"Without a doubt the best boutique hotel and location in Barcelona. This was our first trip to the city and this location was perfect for exploring the city on foot. The staff took a personal interest in making sure our trip was perfect. The room with balcony overlooking the Placa Reial was beautiful: very clean well appointed, luxurious towels and sheets. The little touches were appreciated: unlimited nonalcoholic drinks in the mini bar, fresh fruit and sweets daily. The beakfast was special: homemade croissants, hot cooked to order eggs, great espresso. We will be back soon.",5,2013,02,02
32,Stylish and luxurious,We had a lovely weekend staying here.  The service and staff were helpful and friendly.  The room was so spacious and had very high ceilings!  Our room looked over the Placa Reial which was pretty - and the windows were so fantastic that we didn't hear a thing until we went out onto the balcony.  The bed has to be one of the most comfy ones we've ever slept in and the bathroom was plush with Molton Brown toiletries in abundance.  Breakfast was tasty and plentiful.  We would thoroughly recommend this hotel to other travellers.,5,2013,01,29
32,"Wonderful hotel, friendly staff, perfect location","Went for a long weekend to this lovely hotel. Perfect location and very close to las ramblas in Barcelona, ideal to explore the city.

32,Wonderful hotel!,"I was at Hotel DO Placa Reial last year; we got a nice room and it was really great. There was everything we need, the staff was very kind and helpful, breakfast was very good. If I go back to Barcelona I would definitely stay again in this Hotel. Highly recommended",4,2013,01,23
32,would go back to Barcelona only to stay in the hotel again,"we stayed for 5 nights, i don‚Äôt know where to start from. we are very seasoned 5 stars hotel travelers and this hotel was our first experience in boutique hotel concept. we loved every in the hotel and our extremely enjoyed our stay.

1- The service was amazing and as being a boutique hotel they pay attention to guests request.
2- Perfect location, walking distance from all the main areas.
3- The rooms were decorated in a very artistic way, we literary loved the bathroom and the amenities.
4- they served us every day with strawberry dipped chocolate and cookies or chocolates.
5- the breakfast was tasty and the mini bar along with the Wi-Fi was free which is very important nowadays, most of hotels their internet charges are expensive and I believe internet should be provided for free in all hotels.

What really attracted us when we checked-in is that they printed customized business cards for us with our names on and the hotel details. I really liked the idea and it showed they really pay attention to the small details.",5,2013,01,15
32,Awesome,"Can't recommend this place enough. One of the best - probably THE best - hotelexperiences I have ever had. Everything was just perfect. Our room was so ridiculously beautiful with large windows and views on the square but perfectly soundproof. The bed... I miss it already. A la carte breakfast, also to be ordered in the room at no extra costs. Free minibar. Twice daily luxury sweets. The Milton Brown amenities. We felt so spoiled.... Have I told about the beautiful designinteriour throughout (the stairs are a must see, triple wow). Perfect hospitality you won't find in a big 5 star hotel. The only reason why I would not recommend is because I am afraid this place will be fully booked the next time we visit Barcelona.",5,2013,01,01
32,Utterly perfect boutique hotel for romance and superb creature comforts.,"We loved it. Great welcome. Lovely area. Terrific breakfast. Great bed. Superb food. Sauna and steam a treat in privacy after exploring thie old city and its museums on foot. 
Just DO it. Go.its great value for money and you won't be disappointed. A great hotel is all about the little touches and gracious service. This one has it all.",5,2012,12,24
32,This should be #1 hotel in Barcelona!,"We just checked out today after staying 2 nights, and my husband & I (both very seasoned 5 stars hotel travelers) are very happy with our stay.  Here's why:

1) SUPER ala carte buffet breakfast spread! And the option of serving in our room is a star touch.
2) Excellent location. Walk to most sights
3) very comfortable rooms, extremely clean and well kept (kudos to the housekeepers)
4) very good sound proof balcony doors allow peaceful sleep
5) Molton Brown amenities. Wow!
6) free wifi 
7) very helpful staffs

Our only complain is the wifi requires frequent logging in.

And our only regret is not having dinner in the hotel restaurant. If the breakfast standard is anything to go by, dinner will be an event.

Definitely will stay here again.",5,2012,11,27
32,Lovely hotel with wonderful service,"After a magical week in the Catalunya countryside we returned reluctantly for a final two days in the city.  The hotel greeted us with a welcome glass of Cava while they took our passports and checked us in.  Particular thanks to the very welcoming young woman who checked us in--and my apologies because I did not write down her name.
Our rooms were small but very attractive and beautifully equipped, with thick robes, loads of thick towels, great amenities.  A free-of-charge minibar held bottled water, juice, vichy water and chocolate drinks.  When I refused my afternoon delivery of a fruit bowl I was brought a small plate of sweets instead.  Breakfast menu had a great deal of variety and food quality was good.  The Placa Reial is pretty.  I read many warnings about pickpockets but we neither saw nor experienced this.  Restaurants abound nearby, and the old city is right outside the Placa.

We had a 4 30AM taxi to the airport, and the hotel delivered coffee and rolls to our rooms at 4AM.
Lovely service, great value.  I would go again in a heartbeat.",5,2012,11,24
32,Excellent. worth every dollar,A very nice small hotel in a prime locatoon. Staff are very friendly and helpful. yhe rooms are somewhat small but with wonderful bsthrooms. there is a free minibar in the room. A free a la carte breskfast is served eiyher in the terrace or the basement restaurant. I paid 220 euros and woulf certainly stay there again.,5,2012,11,04
32,Absolutely Perfect,"The Hotel Do was a brilliant base for my trip to Barcelona.

I stayed in a deluxe room, with an amazing view of Placa Reial from both the bedroom and bathroom. The energy and interest of this view is just amazing, and I had absolutely no issue with noise from square (even though I didn't let the staff shutter the balconies at night). Its perfect.

I stayed for four nights, and I really don't have a single complaint.

The rooms are elegant and fresh, with top quality bed linen- extremely comfortable.

The bathroom used excellent bath products, with a separate toilet room, and an extremely deep bath.

The breakfast here is extraordinary. They bring you whatever you want- I ordered mushrooms off the menu, in addition to the extremely extensive Continental and Hot spread they brought to my room just for me. It is very special sitting out looking at Plaza Reial eating a late breakfast. I left the hotel for an early flight, and they arranged a full cooked breakfast for 5am, fully inclusive in the room rate.

This hotel feels like the height of luxury. At roughly 375 Australian dollars a night, it was superb value.",5,2012,11,03
32,Absolutely superb!,"My friend and I have just returned from a wonderful three night stay in this beautiful hotel.  I can only echo what the other reviewers have said.  We had an incredible experience from the very beginning.  We received a very warm welcome and were immediately offered a welcome drink and a comprehensive booklet about the hotel and its services, even containing visiting cards with my name printed on them.  Our room was beautiful and so comfortable.  The free minibar and complementary bowl of fruit each evening were just two of the thoughful touches as was the umbrella left incase it was needed. Our room was serviced twice a day and towels replaced, etc.  There was some noise from the square late into the night but this was before a public holiday so not typical.  The sauna/steam room area with exclusive use for one room at a time was very welcome after a day's sightseeing.  The breakfasts were beautifully presented and absolutely delicious with again lovely unusual touches.  Above all, the staff were outstanding.  They were so pleasant, helpful and efficient from locating a restaurant which I had booked on the internet, providing an adapter and checking train times on a public holiday.  We had a really lovely short break but the absolute highlight was our wonderful hotel in a superb location!",5,2012,11,02
32,Simply superb,"Perfectly located on placa redial, a lovely square dedicated to terrace dining. Just off la rambla and 5 minute walk to the cathedral. This small boutique hotel (18 rooms) has a fabulous restaurant la cuina, the tasting menu was heavenly, all the dishes interesting and cooked to perfection. I would recommend coffee on the terrace after, to sit and take in the atmosphere. Hotel staff were wonderful, hotel wonderfully clean and tidy. Each afternoon the arrival of a fruit bowl and replenished mini bar (complimentary soft drinks). Our weekend stay was relaxing and thoroughly enjoyable. I can not praise this hotel enough. I am looking forward to returning.",5,2012,10,29
32,Don't Mind If I DO...,"We stayed in this hotel in early September 2012 for 3 nights. It is a beautiful boutique hotel with less than 20 rooms which means the attention to detail and quality of customer service is extremely high. The front desk staff were always willing to assist with any of our needs including some excellent recommendations for restaurants with a local bias. The hotel has been operating for less than 12 months so is very new with a wonderful design. They had a free mini-bar, which is almost unheard of today, with a good range of non alcoholic beverages which came in handy after a long day touring around Barcelona.  On Placa Reial the location is good, however, we would have preferred somewhere a little further away from La Rambla which is full of tourists, in saying this it is in walking distance to all the main attractions such as the Placa de Catalunya, the gothic quarter and Marina Port Vell. They have a lovely terrace with a pool which over looks the Placa Reial and is a nice place to relax and enjoy a drink in the evening.

The food was fantastic, we enjoyed the breakfast each morning where we could order anything off the breakfast menu. We also enjoyed a dinner their one evening and had the degustation with matching wines (and beer) from the local region. Like all staff at the hotel, the waiters in the restaurant were highly knowledgeable about the local food and wines and were very friendly.

Overall we thoroughly enjoyed this hotel and it was one of our favourites in our 2 week stay in Spain, if we returned to Barcelona we would definitely be stopping here again!",5,2012,10,26
32,Highly recommended,"The most amazing hotel ever - small, designed but still warm amd lovely. Best location in Barcelona. The only minus is the WIFI that needs to be reconnected all the time. Besides that - superb. The breakfast is A LA CARTE and is also at the same spirit of the hotel - excellent.",5,2012,10,25
32,Perfection from beginning to end.,"This has to be one of the best hotels in Spain. From beginning to end, we could not fault the service, the quality, the atmosphere, the style, the food and the staff. A perfect 5 star boutique hotel with that extra touch that made our holiday become something very special.

Our room looked out over the square and provided an endless delight to watch the square come to life every morning and buzz with people until late at night. Then all we had to do was close the superbly fitting doors of our balcony to have complete peace and quiet for sleeping in the luxurious bed.

The food was fabulous:  casual, well priced tapas style meals on the square with wine recommendations from the friendly Javier - thank you! A stunning degustation meal in the downstairs restaurant (the service was like watching a perfectly choreographed ballet) and the lovely breakfasts each morning.

If you are thinking of anywhere in Barcelona, we are absolutely convinced that you will not do better. This place will be No. 1 very very soon and most certainly deserves to be. Thank you to all the staff and the owners for creating this very special place and your attention to getting it all so right.",5,2012,10,25
32,Absolute indulgence,"A wonderful experience, from A to Z! The DO Hotel is perfectly located on the very Placa Reial and even though I expected some noise in our 3rd floor room as the square below stays very lively late into the night, once closed, the window kept all the buzz away. The room itself was heavenly! Very elegant, very comfortable, simply faultless down to the minutest details. I've been at posh hotels with sloppy service, and also at places where the personnel is very courteous to compensate for the modest surroundings. At the DO, however, everything is impeccable! From the embroidered monograms on the fine linen to the cheerful, helpful and well-mannered staff, everything spells class. Our special thanks to Galin for being so kind and attentive!
We enjoyed ourselves so much that we already look forward to a spring weekend at the beautiful DO",5,2012,10,21
32,A Five Star Hotel Experience,"This is a 5 star hotel by any measure; comfort, location, and particularly the staff.  I have stayed in hundreds of hotels over the years and the staff here is unsurpassed.  They are competent, friendly , and caring.  They go out of their way to help. We stayed four nights and it was a superb experience.",5,2012,10,20
32,Boutique Luxury in the heart of the Placa Reial,"A super, truly 5-star experience in the heart of the city. My sister and I just returned from 4 days there, and had a marvellous time. The room and the hotel itself were beautiful, and the warm welcome and service from all the staff (without exception), makes this a place unlike most other hotels. I travel a lot for business, and this is honestly one of the best hotel exeperiences I have ever had.",5,2012,10,17
32,"OH MY GOD- AMAZING,AMAZING, AMAZING!","This is truly the MOST superb hotel! In an unbeatable location, with outstanding restaurants and service- the rooms are to die for.... If u want to feel like a celebrity- stay here!!! I couldn't recommend it more strongly. I have never seen a hotel that actually beats the photos on the Internet- this does! After being constantly disappointed by European hotels, this one actually lives up to its photos, website and prices!! Unbeatable.",5,2012,10,04
32,A wonderful boutique hotel,"The DO Placa Reial is a delightful small hotel, in a very central location in the old city, just off the famous Ramblas.

32,Fantastic Hotel,"An outstanding hotel with a good location, excellent service, fabulous design and the most amazing breakfasts imaginable. This hotel focuses on attention to detail with thoughtful touches such as fruit and chocolates provided in the room, along with a free mini bar providing a good selection of soft drinks (restocked more than once a day). A surprisingly peaceful and relaxing hotel considering it's location on the Placa Reial which is action packed both day and night! Highly recommended.",5,2012,09,14
32,Must try restaurant,"Did not stop at the hotel, although it looks fab and great location, but the tasting menu here for Euro50 is superb.  Chefs starter before another 5 courses was a procession of I think 9 dishes one after the other. Drinks to match comprising copious glasses of cava, four other wines and a local wheat beer was excellent choice at Euro 25. I have eaten at several Michelin star places, upto 3 stars, and this is deserving of one. Excellent value for a high standard of cooking, at half the price of established rivals in the city.",5,2012,08,26
32,Great place & great location,"Thanks to Tripadviser we come across this luxury boutique hotel in the heart of Barcelona on lovely Placa Real. It was just opened six month ego with good size modern arty rooms, great bathroom, 3 restaurants where food been excellent specially included in price breakfast. With all fresh local produce they even included wine for breakfast.
Food price in their restaurants was reasonable with great inexpensive wine selection. Hotel & restaurants staff very attentive & helpful with all ur needs including organizing sightseeing. Staying just on the corner of La Rumbla street u have almost everything on ur doorstep & without walking distance to many attractions plus good shops.
In Barcelona they have 2 company running double decker tourist buses not expensive and 2 day tickets are really great value. 
Only one negative for us been fact that our hotel been located on busy and very popular with young people square so all night long there have been action going on, and some rooms been exposed to noise more then others. And if u have top floor room expect some noise from roof restaurant at night ( from where is excellent view on Barcelona)If we are back there we definitely will stay in this hotel, specially being there we checked other recommended to us hotels and won't think of changing.",5,2012,08,15
32,Creme de la creme,"This hotel is amazing in every way, excellent service, the superior double room is very beautifull, the attention for detail in the rooms, the service, and the restaurant is just amazing. The room is very quiet, has a very comfortable bed and together with the pillow menu it feels like comming home. This hotel is service to the customer all the way and with a smile.",5,2012,07,16
32,WOW!,"We were enjoying our time in Placa Reial (one of my fav spots in Barcelona) and it didn't take me long to decide we were checking out of our average accommodation and into one of those rooms overlooking the square! It turned out to be the best decision of our trip. The staff couldn't have been more accommodating when we fronted up for a room (no booking) showing us a beautiful room overlooking the square. We lunched at the terrace restaurant, sunned ourselves on the rooftop terrace, had a dip in the plunge pool and ordered a bottle of cava room service which we enjoyed while watching the constant entertainment in the square from our little balcony. The bed was a dream, the bathroom divine and we had a fantastic 1 night stay. In the morning our flight was early so we had a room service breakfast (no extra charge) which was amazing and we on our way. If you are coming to this city I can't think of a better place to spend your time. The only complaint would be the service in the terrace restaurant needs to be improved.",5,2012,07,15
32,"Great Location, Spanish Beauty....","Wonderful staff, food and rooms. Friendly staff who want to please you. Lovely terrace overlooking the Plaza, Square. Central location. Rooms large and airy and very quiet, very well appointed bathrooms.... Only been open a few months and aim to be one of the best in Barcelona.....small pool on roof....",5,2012,06,24
32,Amazing Hotel,"We stayed at this beautiful hotel June 15th-17th, 2012.  This hotel is gorgeous and the service is outstanding.  There is nothing that hasn't been thought of.  The rooms are exquisite, gorgeous design, beautiful views and extremely comfortable.  They have a private spa that ou can reserve, free of charge.  There is a deck on the top floor that is gorgeus with a pool for dipping.  The morning we left, since we were leaving quite early, they arranged a private continental breakfast for us in the gorgeous restaurant located on the bottom floor.  Everything about this hotel is outstanding!  Lucas, one of the managers, went out of his way to ensure that our every need was met, from arranging a private breakfast the morning we left (at 4:30 am), to arranging a private car.  We had booked a different hotel initially, and after checking in realized it was horrible, we found this hotel, and Luca arranged for his bell boy to walk down to our hotel (3 blocks away) and transport all of our luggage (7 huge bags) down tot heir hotel.  I can not say enough about how amazing an experience it was in our stay at this hotel.  I would highly recommend it.  It is a boutique hotel with only 18 rooms located right on the Placa Reial, yet the price we found to be incredibly reasonable.",5,2012,06,18
32,A Spanish treasure,"Splendid room, solid service and wonderful attention to detail. ",5,2012,05,27
32,Absolutely Stellar,"Ok! We just stayed here in April as I was in town to see El Clasico. We stumbled upon DO by accident. We were staying in a cute place in Barceloneta and wanted to make our last two nights special: DO fit the bill. The rooms are plush and immaculate. The service almost borders on over attentive...a porter actually escorted us to a box office so we could acquire tickets for a dance event. The restaurant is very good and always open (no siesta which comes in handy) though you are in Barca so don't rely on it. For being in the heart of La Rambla the rooms are nice and quiet. The roof deck is a great place to escape and have an evening drink before going out. We're not the easiest of travellers, yes we adjust and aren't overly demanding like some but we do expectations that exceed those of less frequent travellers. DO met everyone one of them.",4,2012,05,15
32,Best service in Barca,"DO is a beautiful hotel in a great location and has the best beer I tasted on or near La Rambla, however what really makes it unique is the service, the staff here are so friendly and welcoming, nothing is too much trouble...will definitely go back and next time will try the food",5,2012,04,29
32,Excellent hotel in the hart of Barcelona,"We staid here for 2 nights, and it was a great pleasure from the moment we walked in to the mimute we left. The staff went out of their way to make sure we had a good time, and the room we had, a juniour suite was perfect. It was decorated with minimalistic and chick furniture, and the beds was soft and comfortable. You could connect your Ipod to the TV:) The bath room was spacios and luxurious. Complimentary minibar, Nespresso Machine and complimentary fruit in the room. We will definately be back. Thank you for a very pleasant stay.",5,2012,04,24

If you are curios on and if you want to make your visit to Barcelona to a very special event, you should continue to read this‚Ä¶ 
We will try to explain by words something that you need to have experience from; how to explain the taste of the ‚Äúking of fruits‚Äù to someone that has not even seen a Mango‚Ä¶
Hotel DO Reial is a 5 star hotel but could easily have 2 more stars‚Ä¶ It is almost impossible to measure the employees‚Äô passion for their work or their longing to give you as a guest something extra. For us this was an extraordinary experience, the only words that we can express for the staff are ‚Äúsecond to none‚Äù!
Location is one of our most important criteria. We want the Hotel to be in the center and also close to the sea‚Ä¶ If you would like to have walking distance to the the Ramblas, the Liceo, the Boquer√≠a market, the Palacio de la M√∫sica concert hall, the Cathedral, the Palau G√ºell, Santa Mar√≠a del Mar, the Picasso Museum the Port of Barcelona, it is all there and Hotel DO Reial was spot on! 
The next thing is the atmosphere or the feeling you get when you are visiting the room. Every little detail is thoughtfully chosen; Hotel DO Reial is actually given the concept Gastronomic Boutique Hotel a far better meaning than we have expected. With the gourmet restaurant with their exceptionally creative and tasteful food they really delivered and fulfilled our expectations ‚Äúsecond to none‚Äù.
This hotel gave our 15-year celebration trip, duration was 7 days, a feeling that will be with us forever‚Ä¶we just want to say, Thank You!

We will definitely stay there again.",5,2012,04,09
32,New 5* Design Hotel,"Always eager to try new hot spots, I stayed in this brand new small 5* design hotel on Placa Reial in Barrio Gotico. Very well designed large room, great bathrooms with deluxe Molton Brown toiletries. Beautiful roof top terrace with small pool and great view over the roofs of the old city centre and cathedral. Close to habour, ramblas, and shopping on Paseo de Gracia. 
Incredible breakfast selection. I liked the dinner in the gourmet restaurant, Thomas is a perfect Maitre D",5,2012,04,09
32,Not 5 stars,"Positive:
The hotel is very conveniently located near the Ramblas. A whole range of attractions can be reached easily on foot. We had a room with a king-size bed and a small balcony facing the side street. The room was a good size and tastefully decorated. The reception staff were very nice and helpful.

Not so good:
The hotel entrance is under
arcades, which are also used by some homeless people as a place to sleep and hang out. It's probably not the hotel's fault, but it can be unpleasant for guests and is not very inviting.
The lobby itself is very small and somewhat blocked by the staircase. We stayed in the hotel for three nights and every day something was missing. Sometimes a towel, sometimes body lotion, sometimes sugar. It's not dramatic, but it shouldn't happen in a hotel with a room price of more than ‚Ç¨300. You should also be aware that you can hear the subway (at least in our room on the 1st floor). It didn't bother us.
What really bothered us, however, was the breakfast. The breakfast room is in the basement and has the atmosphere of a bunker. The selection of food was limited, but at least of decent quality. Before you could have breakfast, however, you as a guest had to first set the table yourself. I have never experienced that in any hotel, regardless of category. 
For a hotel that advertises itself as 5*, this is simply a bad joke.

32,Avoid it,It is a modest hotel to which I give 3 stars. It is not eligible for it to be rated 5 stars GL. The wifi was very weak. They made up the room at 5pm. The cleaning of the bathroom was really embarrassing.,1,2023,11,17

El proceso de check in fue sencillo, solo hay que saber seguir instrucciones. La cocina est√° completamente equipada e incluye caf√© y te. Lo √∫nico malo fue que no me pudieron dar un late check out, pero al menos hab√≠a un lugar en el lobby para dejar las maletas. Me preocupaban los reviews de que era ruidoso, pero la calle de alfrente, aunque principal, no es tan concurrida de noche. Al menos para m√≠ el ruido no fue un problema mayor. Hay que tener en cuenta que est√° en el centro de la ciudad y la ciudad de por s√≠ es ruidosa.",5,2022,11,13

Vor der Anreise hatten wir das Hotel um die Vermittlung eines Miet-Rollstuhls gebeten, was hervorragend geklappt hat, ebenso die Reservierungen in drei Restaurants durch das Hotel (Danke!).
Wir hatten ein Superior DZ (Nr. 25)  mit Blick auf die Gasse zwischen La Rambla und dem Placa Reial. Das Zimmer war gut, das gro√üe Bad mit eigenem Fenster und mit separatem WC war sehr gut, und der Zimmerservice war hervorragend (t√§glich frisches Obst, und auch Abends nochmal ein Zimmerservice).

La habitaci√≥n no tiene doble vidrio en las ventanas por lo que es terriblemente ruidosa dada su ubicaci√≥n, As√≠ fue en febrero no quiero imaginar en los meses de mayor turismo.
El ba√±o no tiene bidet! 
y el colmo para un hotel que encima se promociona como gourmet el desayuno es un capitulo aparte!!!!
Se disfraza de minimalista para ser en realidad de una pobreza franciscana.
El ardid es que es a la carta pero.... no hay queso untable, solo tienen la mermelada del dia, cada cosa hay que pedirla y en el salon que se sirve no hay siquiera un solo producto para servirse uno. Es decir todo lo tenes que pedir y con la demora en traer las cosas uno se cansa y ellos ahorran...
Consejo para el chefff (el queso untable lo venden en el Carrefour que esta en la rambla) casi lo compro y se lo llevo...

32,Sehr gut!,"Die Lage ist hervorragend, das Personal sehr nett, das Fr√ºhst√ºck und der Service ist ebenfalls top. Das Fenster in meinem Zimmer war leider aus Milchglas und ich konnte es erst √∂ffnen, nachdem ich an der Reception einen Fenstergriff verlangt habe. Irgendwie f√ºhlte ich mich ohne direkte Sicht nach draussen etwas eingesperrt. Zudem schien mir das Zimmer f√ºr den hohen Preis eher klein, ich hatte z.B. nirgends einen sinnvollen Platz im Zimmer, um den ge√∂ffneten Koffer zu platzieren, ohne dass er gest√∂rt h√§tte. Hingegen waren s√§mtliche Getr√§nke in der Minibar inklusive, was mich sehr gefreut hat. (nicht alkoholische Getr√§nke) Alles in Allem f√ºr den hohen Preis okay, jedoch nicht Weltklasse.",3,2017,08,10

32,Un cinco estrellas de verdad,"Nos alojamos en este hotel Boutique por su ubicaci√≥n y por tener el desayuno incluido, gratamente nos encontramos con un hotel cinco estrellas en todos sus aspectos. El personal muy atento, dispuestos a ubicarse en la ciudad y a responder a cualquier tipo de inquietud. Al ingresar nos estaban esperando, hab√≠amos reservado unas entradas para un partido y en la recepci√≥n ten√≠an el paquete y ten√≠an bien claro para quien era, por lo que el check in fue muy r√°pido.

UBICACI√ìN

Este hotel boutique, ubicado sobre la rambla y la plaza real, es ideal para recorrer la ciudad ya que se encuentra a medio camino de la playa y de la plaza de catalu√±a.

HABITACI√ìN

El personal nos gui√≥ a la habitaci√≥n que nos asignaron. Espaciosa, luminosa y totalmente equipada. Piso de madera, armario, escritorio, cama doble muy comoda, tv plana, albornoz, pantufla, amplio balc√≥n a la plaza real y el ba√±o en cuatro partes lo que hace √≠ntimo y pr√°ctico su uso (Ba√±era, cuadrado amplio de ducha, doble pileta con amplio espejo y separado por una puerta el inodoro y bidet). Un detalle importante es que el frigobar esta incluido.

DESAYUNO

El desayuno incluido es libre, buffet y a la carta. El servicio es comparable con el de los mejores restaurantes, los mozos atentos y de r√°pida respuesta. La comida abundante, de excelente nivel. El salon no se queda atr√°s, se encuentra en un subsuelo, con una decoraci√≥n √≠ntima, muy agradable

El hotel tiene m√°s servicios de los que pudimos disfrutar en nuestros tres d√≠as de estancia, esperamos volver para poder verlos y hacer una revisi√≥n completa del hotel.",5,2017,02,27
32,Weiterhin ein ausgezeichnetes Boutique-Hotel,"Wir waren nun zum zweiten Mal in diesem Hotel und es hat uns wieder ausserordentlich gut gefallen.

32,"Perfekte Lage, perfekter Service!","Zur Jahreswende verbachten wir 5 Tage in diesem Hotel. Trotz kleiner M√§ngel habe ich ein ""Ausgezeichnet"" gegeben. 
Ein Mangel besteht darin, dass es im Bad kein Bidet gibt. 
Der 2. Mangel war der, dass wir von unserem Zimmertelefon nicht ins Ausland telefonieren konnten und es auch nicht zu beheben war. Wir konnten aber von der Rezeption aus kostenfrei telefonieren.....und als Entschuldigung stand Abends, als wir auf unser Zimmer zur√ºckkehrten, eine gro√üe Flasche Sekt im Sektk√ºbel bereit, ein Kuchen war aufgetischt sowie eine Schale mit feinsten Geb√§ckr√∂llchen. Das hat uns rundum entsch√§digt. 
Das Zimmer ist recht klein, aber geschmackvoll eingerichtet. Und wir brauchten keine Kopfkissen nachbestellen; davon gibt es reichlich!!!  
Auch gefiel uns das Fr√ºhst√ºck; man bestellt √° la carte! Selbst wenn etwas nicht in der Karte zu finden war: es wurden alle Sonderw√ºnsche erf√ºllt. 
Sch√∂n w√§re es noch, wenn man ""sitzend"" an der Bar einen Drink zu sich nehmen k√∂nnte; es fehlen leider die Barhocker. 
Hervorzuheben ist der √§u√üerst freundliche und zuvorkommende Service! Man f√ºhlt sich rundum gut bedient und beraten.",5,2017,01,03

32,Wunderbares Boutique-Hotel im Herzen Barcelonas.,"Nach meiner Meinung ein tolles Boutique-Hotel an perfekter Lage und sehr aufmerksamen sowie herzlichen Mitarbeitenden. Die Zimmer sind ausserordentlich sch√∂n eingerichtet, wir bekamen ein Upgrade mit einer sehr grossz√ºgigen Junior-Suite. Fr√ºhst√ºck und Nachtessen im Hotelrestaurant waren sehr gut, das Hotel bietet eine Terrasse an der Pla√ßa Reial und auf dem Dach. Als einziger Nachteil k√∂nnen bei l√§rmsensiblen Personen die Aktivit√§ten auf der Pla√ßa Reial erw√§hnt werden.",5,2016,01,31
32,"Zum zweiten Mal, nach einem Jahr","Dieses Hotel hatte ich von meinem Besuch im November 2014 in guter Erinnerung. Sehr kleines Einzelzimmer, aber sonst gut. - Nun war ich mit zwei Freunden √ºber die Silvestertage wieder in Barcelona, und ich hatte das Hotel DO erneut gebucht, schon wegen der sehr zentralen Lage. Die hat sich nat√ºrlich nicht ver√§ndert und ist nach wie vor ein Plus. Aber die Preise! Steigerung um 40 Prozent, ausserdem in der Nacht wenig Ruhe durch L√§rm vom Platz, aber auch aus dem Hof, denn dort wird nach ein Uhr die K√ºche aufger√§umt und die Flaschen werden in eine Tonne geworfen! Ausserdem K√ºchend√ºfte im Zimmer im ersten Stock! - Von daher kann ich sagen: Beim n√§chsten Besuch Barcelonas w√§hle ich ein anderes Hotel!",3,2016,01,09
32,Klein aber fein,"Wir verbrachten unseren dritten Silvester in Barcelona und entschieden uns f√ºr dieses Hotel, weil wir hier schon einige Male zum Essen waren. Das Zimmer war sehr sauber und im Badezimmer waren feine Toiletteartikel verf√ºgbar. Die N√§chte waren nicht auszuhalten, weil der L√§rm von Placa Reial auch durch die Schallgesch√ºtzen Fenster dringt. Ausserdem war in unserem Zimmer die U-Bahn zu h√∂ren und zu sp√ºren. Das Fr√ºhst√ºck wird frisch zubereitet und es schmeckte k√∂stlich, frisches Geb√§ck, frisch gepresste S√§fte Eier usw. Das Men√º zu Silvester mit Wein- Champagnerbegleitung hatte uns sehr begeistert - sehr empfehlenswert.
Aufgrund der schlaflosen N√§chten w√ºrden wir hier nicht mehr wohnen, alles andere ist f√ºr ein 5 Sterne Hotel √ºberdurchschnittlich und hat uns sehr gefallen.",4,2015,12,18

Restaurante en la terraza:buen men√∫,exelente comida y buen ambiente frente a la Plaza Real muy animada.
Ubicaci√≥n perfecta para visitar lugares de inter√©s (barrio g√≥tico,la ciudad vieja,la Rambla).
Mejor escoger una habitaci√≥n que no d√© frente a la Plaza Real por el ruido nocturno y por eso elegir habitaciones en pisos superiores.

32,Ein sch√∂nes Hotel aber nicht f√ºr l√§rmempfildliche Menschen.,"Die Standardzimmer sind etwas klein aber absolut ausreichend f√ºr einen Kurzaufenthalt. Das Hotel selber ist sehr sch√∂n und gem√ºtlich. Der Service ist hervorragend. Das Personal war immer freundlich und sehr hilfsbereit. Allerdings sollten sich l√§rmempfindliche Menschen auf eine etwas unruhige Nacht einstellen. Es wird die ganze Nacht auf dem Placa Reial (ein Innenhof) gefeiert. Auch die sehr guten Schallschutz-Fenster k√∂nnen nicht verhindern, dass der L√§rmpegel ziemlich hoch ist. Fenster √∂ffnen ist darum nicht m√∂glich. Die Klima- Anlage ist sehr leise und zugfrei. 
Fazit: Ein sch√∂nes Hotel in idealer Lage f√ºr die Stadtbesichtigung aber etwas laut.",4,2015,10,13
32,estupendo y no solo para extrangeros,"Las habitaciones son muy c√≥modas, no grandes, pero si confortables. Sientes como si estuvieras en tu casa.

La meravigliosa terrazza, il personale attento e gentile, la super colazione alla carta, completano l'offerta con  ciliegina sulla torta: i biglietti da visita dell'hotel personalizzati con il nome e cognome del cliente.

Das Personal ist sehr aufmerksam und freundlich, eine sehr nette Geste ist das √úberbringen von kleinen Leckereien (Obst, S√º√üigkeiten etc.) am Nachmittag auf dem Zimmer. So findet man nach ausgiebigen Spazierg√§ngen durch die wundersch√∂ne Stadt immer eine √úberraschung vor. Auch das Essen im Restaurant (ebenso wie das Hotel nicht gerade g√ºnstig) ist empfehlenswert.

Bett, Matratzen,  Kissen,  M√∂blierung   B&O Telefon, LOEWE TV, TOP.  Da f√ºhlen wir uns wohl. Nur  die Schalld√§mmung k√∂nnte ein klein wenig besser sein angesichts der spanischen Lebensgewohnheiten..... gr√∂lenende Machos bis in die Morgenstunden.

Wenn doch das Fr√ºhst√ºck dort angeboten  wird, warum soll ich dann auf der Piazza in der elektrisch leidlich ertr√§glich gemachten K√§lte essen?   Das ist aber der einzige Kritikpunkt an einem sonst perfekten Hotel in perfekter Lage. Just DO it  .... and again.",5,2014,01,27
32,Storico Hotel a Barcellona,"Seconda tappa di lavoro in Spagna soggiornato in questo Hotel storico, Classico negli arrdamenti e nella struttura, un p√≤ rumoroso ma di ottimo livello, ben collrgato con il personale davvero pronto e disponibile con i clienti, cucina e servizi di buon livello, se capitate a Barcellona e non sapete dove andare questo Hotel andrebbe preso in considerazione...",4,2014,01,02
32,Mi favorito en Barcelona,"Es nuestra tercera estancia en el Hotel Do y seguimos muy satisfechos.
Situaci√≥n ideal. Se puede ir andando hacia el puerto o pasear por el casco antiguo y hacer shopping en los alrededores de la plaza de Catalu√±a.
Nos sentimos como en casa. El personal muy atento, muy simpatico y lleno de atenciones.
Las habitaciones, todas distinctas y decoradas con mucho gusto. Nos gusta especialmente las que dan a la plaza Reial con un peque√±o balc√≥n.
Restaurante fenomenal (especialmente las tapas en el restaurante exterior en la plaza).
Desgraciadamente, en invierno no se puede aprovechar de la terraza de arriba que tiene unas vistas excepcionales.
No dudaremos en repetir peque√±as escapadas en Barcelono en este hotel.",5,2013,11,28
32,Tophotel am Hotspot,"Sch√∂nes stadthotel mit nettem Service und sehr guter K√ºche zwischen rambla und dem gotischen viertel. Sch√∂ne, kleine dachterrasse wo man sein Fr√ºhst√ºck einnehmen kann. Sehr leise da neue Fenster, gut ged√§mmt. Minibar im Preis inbegriffen. 5 min zum Hafen, und 3 min zur Metro. Kleiner Pool am Dach ist mehr eine Badewanne aber nett und gepflegt.",5,2013,08,21
32,tolles stadthotel,"Wir haben mit vier Personen das Osterwochenende im Hotel DO in 2013 verbracht. Es war ein sehr sch√∂ner Aufenthalt. Das Hotel ist modern, in einem leichten Kolonialstil eingerichtet und sehr gem√ºtlich. Die Lage ist sehr zentral. Ideal f√ºr eine St√§dtereise. Die Zimmer sind ebenfalls modern und in einer Art Lounge-Stil eingerichtet. Die Betten sind vorz√ºglich. Man kann sogar eine Auswahl seiner Kissen treffen und die Raumparfumierung w√§hlen. Das Bad mit Dusche und Badewanne ist ebenfalls stylisch und komfortabel. Das Fr√ºhst√ºck wird im Restaurant im Kellerbereich serviert. Auch hier setzt sich das geschmackvolle  Ambiente fort. Das Fr√ºhst√ºck an sich ist reichhaltig und man kann a la carte (kein Buffet) w√§hlen. Das Personal ist sehr hilfsbereit. Die Reception/ Concierge haben uns sehr gute Tipps zum Restaurant Besuch gegeben und auch die Tisch Reservierung koordiniert. Wenn man nach den Exkursionen des Tages wieder zum Hotel zur√ºckkehrte, fand man immer eine Oase der Ruhe und des Wohlbefindens. Wir w√ºrden jedem dieses Hotel empfehlen.",4,2013,08,02
32,Bello ma rumoroso,"Un ottimo hotel, molto chic e all'altezza del prezzo che si paga.
Premesso che ci sono tornato dopo qualche tempo e lo trovo sempre un buon posto. Unica pecca (inevitabile data la posizione) √® il rumore.
Camere grandi e arredate con gusto. Bagno bello e confortevole. Pulizia degna di nota positiva e colazione davvero buona.
C'√® una splendida terrazza a disposizione degli ospiti e il minibar √® gratis.
Grande cortesia del personale.

32,restaurante espectacular,"El hotel esta en el corazon de barcelona. El trato del personal del hotel es exquisito, estan muy pendientes de ti.
Estuvimos cenando y esta fenomenal la comida,trato exquisito. El ambiente del hotel es muy bueno.
La unica pega que pondria es que la habitacion standar ( creo que solo tienen 3) es muy muy peque√±a, y las camas son de 80.
El minibar es gratis y la ducha del ba√±o es perfecta.Todo muy limpio.",4,2012,12,10
32,Ambiente muy cuidado,"Habitaciones no muy grandes pero muy c√≥modas y agradables c√≥mo si estuvieras en casa. Decoraci√≥n muy cuidada. El hotel, solamente de diecisiete habitaciones, todas diferentes. Copas espectaculares (son  manuales). Restaurante ideal para cenas rom√°nticas bodega extensa y no se pasan de precio. Servicio del restaurante es excelente.",5,2012,10,21
