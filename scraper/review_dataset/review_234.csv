234,"Amazing experience, felt like a lord","I've been to luxurious hotels, but this is another level. If you want to treat yourself, look no further - this right here is a fantastic experience. Hotel is in a historic building that was made into a hotel. Every day there is a guide that explains the history of the place, purpose of each room, etc, which is quite interesting. With the rooms that are in the historical building, the breakfast is served in the ""golden room"" which is ""prettiest room in all the Ireland"". The view from my room was stunning - like from a fantasy movie (pictures uploaded, no filters used, made with motorola edge 40). Even the keycards to open the rooms are amazing - made of wood! Everybody in the hotel was super friendly. In the nearby town, Maynooth, you can visit St. Patrick's College which looks amazing.",5,2024,10,19
234,Beautiful Property,"Had an amazing time at the Carton House.  Thank you to all the wonderful staff that made us feel welcomed.  Thank you to Brian the Chef Concierge who made us feel welcomed. He was warm, knowledgeable, charismatic , kind and very helpful.  We so enjoyed our hotel tour he conducted a true professional. I would also like to acknowledge Anna Morgan at the Courtyard Bar.  My son and I enjoyed our conversations we had with her as she was very engaging.  She was quick and efficient in her role, a true gem.
Thank you to everyone from reservations, reception, guest services that contributed to our amazing weekend we had at the Carton House.  We will definitely return in the near future.  All the best!",5,2024,10,18
234,5 star stay with a warm welcome by Gregory,My second visit to Carton House and it was wonderful. Upon checking in I was assisted by Gregory and he was amazing!!! Gregory was extremely kind throughout my stay and Carton House is lucky to have him. The hotel tour is also a must do while staying.,5,2024,10,14
234,immaculate perfect,This is a great hotel that provides a great experience. We enjoyed everything from the very beginning till the end of our stay. Don't miss the hotel tour (we had a pleasure to attend the tour with Jack). It was really entertaining and interesting. I hope to come back again to this wonderful place.,5,2024,10,14
234,Fabulous hotel with great service,"This is my second time staying this month and both visits were amazing.
Such a luxury hotel with fabulous staff that are very attentive, but not intrusive. Rooms are phenomenal.
We had dinner in Kathleen‚Äôs Kitchen and it was so tasty. Cocktails at the bar top notch and my mum is not easy to please. 
Spa is very relaxing. Mum loved her facial.
Cannot wait to return.",5,2024,10,14
234,Excellent,"From the first minute to the end it was absolutely amazing time in the hotel and spa. We did enjoy every single little moment üôÇDefinitely recommend to visit this gorgeous hotel üè® 
Can‚Äôt wait to visit and stay in the hotel again! Thanks so much ü§ç",5,2024,10,13
234,The Most amazing stay,"We had the most fabulous stay in Carton House at the beginning of October. From the moment we walked through the door, we knew it was an amazing place. 
Check in was quick with the fabulous Anne who was so friendly and inviting, the grounds were amazing for a beautiful Autumnal walk and the bar food was very tasty. The main house and all it's rooms are so beautiful. 
Carton House were hosting their Wedding Showcase that day and the rooms were done up for either large or small Weddings which were so beautifully done. (we were not there for the Wedding showcase, it just happened to be on the day we arrived but what a super place to get married)
Our room was quiet, cosy and beautiful with everything you needed with a lovely view out onto the garden. Many thanks to Anne for our Welcome bottle of Prosecco waiting for us, which was a lovely touch.
Dinner in the Carraige Restaurant that evening was so tasty and again cosy with a good atmosphere and the staff so helpful. 
We finished the night with drinks in the main bar which again had a great atmosphere.
The breakfast in Kathleens Kitchen the next morning was delicious with so much choice. 
As we couldn't make the tour of the main house at 10am, Brian very kindly gave me and my husband a short tour of the main house and it's rooms. 
He was so informative about the history of the house which was very interesting and also fantastic to see the larger bedroom suites in this part of the house. 
I would highly recommend this tour.
All in all, we had a fantastic stay, the staff's attention to detail is excellent and the hotel and grounds are so beautiful. We will definately be returning.",5,2024,10,13
234,Nice golf break,"Room, service, golf, spa and food better than expected. Whiskey library visit is a must. All the staff we met and served us were amazing. We did use the spa and it was great, lunch at Carriage House and dinner at Kathleen‚Äôs Kitchen and the food at both places were great.",5,2024,10,08
234,Historic Estate - now a 5-star hotel,"Great experience.  This is a truly 5-star hotel on beautiful  grounds.  They have multiple restaurants that serve spectacular food.  Service was exceptional.  They only reason I gave this a 4 instead of 5, was because of 1 rude housekeeper (I had a late check out, and was presenting to a client over Zoom, and she began pounding on my door because she thought I had over-stayed my check out).  Otherwise, perfect place.",4,2024,10,05
234,Wish we stayed longer!,"Just a lovely place to stay in beautiful grounds. Very comfortable room. Dinner in Carriages restaurant was very pleasant with professional service. Breakfast in Kathleen‚Äôs Kitchen was also good. The pool is nice and had very comfortable sun beds. Able to walk through the building to see historical buildings.
Relatively expensive but seemed great value. Highly recommended.",5,2024,10,03
234,Disappointing stay,"Only stay here if you are playing golf.  This is a huge convention center.  There was an event going on at the time of our stay.  We were upgraded to rooms in the manor which were lovely.  We were almost 1/4 mile from the spa area.  The spa and gym were totally disappointing,  There was not service there.  No towels in the pool area.  No water or towels in the gym.  Since we did not want to walk across the entire hotel lobby area in robes we did not use the pool which was disappointing.  We could not get dinner reservations in the MIchelin restaurant due to the conference and could only dine in the kitchen restaurant.  The Kitchen was cozy and food good but since breakfast was served there as well would have liked a different venue.  The room we were supposed to be served breakfast was occupied by the conference.  
When we went to the lobby for a drink there about 50 people congregating at the bar.  It was so noisy that we went to dinner earlier.  
Not a pleasant place to stay when a conference is taking place.
Would recommend finding somewhere else to stay.",2,2024,09,29
234,A superior experience ,"Beautiful grounds and facilities. Some staff a little under trained for the grandeur of the hotel, but we all start somewhere.amd all our interactions were pleasant and enjoyable. Nothing was too much trouble. Great food, wine and decor. Highly recommended. The ",5,2024,09,28
234,Another enjoyable visit to Carton house.,"I had the opportunity to play and stay recently at Carton House. Golf course in top condition, really enjoyable. That was followed by five star food and beverage and top notch accommodation. All served with a smile from a very gracious team. Look forward to the next time.",5,2024,09,24
234,Great hotel just falling short of proper 5 star status,"We had an exceptional welcome, from staff who could not do enough for you.
Service was fantastic from start to finish
Rooms were very comfortable and the food in general was fair but not too the standard of a 5 star hotel‚Ä¶.
In the carriage rooms one of our party had a strip-loin steak medium rare but it was very tough.
The breakfast choice was suffice but could be bettered .
Buffet area was very small and congested also there was no egg station with the only eggs on offer being scrambled  and also there were no beans available..
A menu with optional cooked breakfast would have helped.
The grounds were exceptional and are well worth exploring.",4,2024,09,23
234,A wonderful stay (but too short),"I‚Äôm a return visitor to Carton House, on this occasion staying with our eldest son.

As always, I am struck by the grounds around the hotel, and the tasteful renovation of the original stately home, and the addition of the new accommodation.  It‚Äôs a stunning venue.

Although we arrived at 7.30pm and left by 8.30am the following morning, we were able to enjoy a drink in the reception bar (great buzz and a wonderful array of cocktails served by the bar team - we didn‚Äôt partake!), we had dinner in Kathleen‚Äôs Kitchen (wonderful) and returned to Kathleen‚Äôs Kitchen for breakfast (also wonderful).

The staff were welcoming and professional, although we did not have any complex requirements.

I plan to return again, but for a more leisurely staff, and probably with a bigger group.",5,2024,09,17
234,Fabulous Overnight Stay,"Fabulous Stay from minute we entered hotel we felt relaxed. All staff friendly, professional and welcoming. Room gorgeous, bed extremely comfortable and loads of space. Bar area gorgeous, love the decor. Ate Diner and Breakfast in Kathleen‚Äôs Kitchen, food wonderful and staff very attentive. Had the pleasure of using the Spa and treatments amazing! Overall a fantastic experience. Will be back.",5,2024,09,16
234,Nice staff/management failure,"What a beautiful building in beautiful grounds!  It is beautiful inside also.  It is decorated and furnished to 5 star expectations.  However, not all was good.  Firstly, check in was far too long and what a palaver!!  We had to decide there and then what time we wanted to eat our dinner and breakfast at.  Then a pre paid holiday card or personal debit cards were of no use to secure our entry.  We had to search out an old credit card to pass Go!  On to the room itself and it was lovely.  Comfortable bed, seating and a bathroom with separate bath and shower. Lovely and clean and well maintained.  Unfortunately, a poor night‚Äôs sleep was to follow due to the heat inside the room and air conditioning was too noisy to keep on.
We visited the bar for a couple of drinks before dinner but were very dissatisfied with the 10% service charge.  Even if you go to the bar and carry your drink back to your table yourself you are still charged.  How can you charge a service charge for just pouring a pint and a glass of wine?  We had dinner in the Carriage Room which is a beautiful venue with beautiful food.  We have no problem with the 10% service charge here because it is clearly written on the menu.
And so to breakfast chaos.  Remember we had to book a time for breakfast. What a waste because we had to stand in a queue.  As there was no space in the breakfast room, we were then escorted to a low table in the bar area where we would have had to kneel down on the floor to be able to eat at such a low table.  We refused.  All of a sudden there was a table available for us inside, and a few others materialised too, they just needed cleared.  The food itself was excellent which is more than can be said for the kitchen itself around which guests walked serving themselves whilst a chef continued cooking with little room to pass by.  A sharp knife lay on a chopping board half on a sink and half overhanging.  We think a risk assessment is urgently required in this area.",4,2024,09,14
234,Top Service,A lovely hotel. Brian our concierge was excellent with his communication and guidance provided getting me a top car service from the airport to hotel. A very special place and beautiful setting including the dining.  We hope to return someday.,5,2024,09,14
234,Amazing hospitality!,"We were attending KPMG Women's Irish Open few weeks ago...Amazing customer service, great quality food and fully focused on creating an emaxing experience Victoria G, who made us open our minds to considering Carton House as the go to venue for celebrating the most magical moments. Thank you <3",5,2024,09,14
234,Very friendly and helpful staff. Well maintained property with gorgeous landscape,"We had our son's destination wedding at The Carton house. After scouting serval locations we finally chose this one. It was the best decision we made. Each and every member of the staff was super courteous, helpful and organized. The chef went out of their way to accommodate our multi cultural cuisine. The event manger and the team made every event go seamless. Beautiful clean rooms with outstanding views. Whenever needed the general manager was always available. All our guests went back with a very happy feeling. Great location just 20 mins from Dublin airport",5,2024,09,10
234,5 star experience,First time staying here and honestly I can't wait to come back! Our room was huge and the beds are the comfiest I've ever experienced..if we didn't have to check out we would have stayed in bed all day! Check in was so quick and easy so special shoutout to Greg on the front desk..also to Rick who hands out cartons of water when queuing to check in/out..was a lovely touch. Next time I can't wait to visit the spa as I've heard so many amazing things about it!,5,2024,09,10
234,Book more than 1 night if you can afford it,"Had an incredible stay with my friend. There was 2 large beds in the room instead of 2 twin single beds which I really liked. We had an great night's sleep because the beds were so comfy especially the large pillows they are a lovely touch instead of your standard pillows. Special mention to Greg and Rick on the team. Greg was more than helpful on check in and Rick was there to attend to everyone waiting to check out such as offering us bottled water, what a lovely touch üòä  Breakfast was tasty and breakfast staff were friendly and attentive. 
Overall had an amazing 5 star experience. Would definitely love to book 2 nights next time I stay as I felt I didn't have enough time to explore everything as the resort is massive and lots of history in the hotel.",5,2024,09,09
234,Overpriced salad,"Had lunch in Kathleen's Kitchen. Food was nice but limited menu for teenagers and overpriced imo. The was no atmosphere in the room because the place was so quiet even though it was a Saturday. Staff were pleasant, I had mentioned my son's birthday at the time of booking which wasn't acknowledged; perhaps I should have mentioned it again. The hotel itself is lovely with impressive grounds but I wouldn't return for lunch. ",3,2024,09,09
234,Unforgettable experience!,"I recently had the pleasure of staying at Carton House during the Womens Irish Open Golf and it was truly an unforgettable experience. Nestled amidst stunning gardens and rich history, the hotel offers a perfect blend of luxury and comfort.",5,2024,09,09
234,‚ÄúOasis in the Countryside‚Äù,"Absolutely first class stay in this ‚ÄúOasis in the countryside‚Äù. Everything about the hotel oozes professionalism. Upon check in we had the pleasure of meeting Ann and Emma on reception, and they gave us the warmest welcome possible, making us feel special.
The hotel itself it's stunning, set in a sprawling estate with amazing walks and views. 

Our room was immaculate with everything to make our stay that little bit special, so spacious and clean! The size of the beds make for a good nights sleep. We ate in Kathleen's Kitchen and the food was so good and the staff were very attentive, within the setting featuring an old fashioned kitchen theme.

Don't miss the opportunity to stay at this hotel, it‚Äôs just perfect!!",5,2024,09,03
234,Farm to table vibe,"Excellent meal at Kathleen's kitchen. Fresh ingredients, delicious food & good selection of wine. Very nice presentations as well & excellent personalized service. The restaurant is set up in what was the old castle kitchen which is very cool.",5,2024,09,02
234,10/10 staff are amazing,"Upon check in we had the pleasure of meeting Ann and Emma on reception and when I say the gave us the warmest welcome and made us feel so welcome.  The most Astounding welcome we have ever had. 

The hotel itself it‚Äôs stunning, it‚Äôs immaculate. The room was spacious and had a massive bed. The cleanliness of the room was impressive. We ate in Kathleen‚Äôs kicthen and the food was the best food I have tasted highly recommend the chicken supreme. 

Don‚Äôt miss the opportunity to stay at this hotel.",5,2024,09,02
234,A favourite location for a holiday in Ireland,"This was not my first time staying at the Carton House. I am a longtime fan of the Fairmont hotel chain and this is a particularly beautiful retreat in the countryside outside of Dublin. The estate is vast and very picturesque, the rooms are large and comfortable with nice touches like the Liberty's motif pillows with the strawberry thief design and a balcony overlooking the gardens. The hotel has been newly renovated with large glass windows to showcase the stately trees and architecture. There is also a pool and spa area. The breakfast buffet was plentiful and served in a beautiful old-style kitchen with stone hearth, great food at the restaurants, and a nice bar/lounge for a Bailey's coffee with cream after a long day out. The hotel is very conveniently located close to many interesting things to see and do with kids. I recommend the Howth cliff cruises to see lots of birds and seals and buy fresh seafood on the pier. There is also an outlet mall at Kildare less than an hour away. You can drive across to Galway in only 2 hours which has a cute old town where I got my son an Isle of Lewis chess set beautifully carved. Even driving to Northern Ireland is only a couple hours away - for a future visit. A great choice for a holiday with family.",5,2024,09,01

234,Exceptional Experience at Carton House for a Special Celebration,"We stayed at Carton House for a colleague's 79th birthday and had a wonderful experience. The hotel was beautiful, with lovely surroundings. The food was delicious, and the staff was friendly and welcoming. Their hospitality made our stay enjoyable, and we would highly recommend Carton House to anyone looking for a pleasant and comfortable stay.",5,2024,08,30

234,The Morrison Room has a Michelin star worthy chef & sommelier,"Great hotel, bedrooms are beautiful, linen is fab, views spectacular but the highlight was the Morrison room restaurant signature tasting menu - I Scott we shall see the Co Meath chef show up on the Michelin star list shortly - the sommelier superb - just go visit!",5,2024,08,30
234,Pure luxury from start to finish,"Myself my husband and teenage son stayed for 2 nights in Carton house, from our arrival to the door we were greeted with fabulous hospitality. The service and staff were fantastic and extremely attentive. Our family room was extremely spacious and impeccably clean,  and beautiful prosecco and chocolates to enjoy which was a lovely touch. We enjoyed dinner in the Carraige House and Kathleens Kitchen and food was exceptional. We got to have breakfast in Kathleens Kitchen  and also in The Morrison Room which was a fabulous experience in both.  There was lots to do from Walks on the grounds  to hitting  a few balls at the golfing drive range. We used the gym, pool, Jacuzzi which was so enjoyable. Our over all trip was pure luxurious and we enjoyed our stay from start to finish.",5,2024,08,27
234,Carton  House,"So we got a deal with Rory‚Äôs travel for a one night stay B&B . We took an upgrade to a garden room ..  it was just ok , a small seating area looking into a large grassed area but nothing great about it really . Room was comfortable , tea/ coffee available , bed comfortable , nice walk in shower , surprised to see the multi use bottles of shampoo conditioner and body wash .. would expect single use products for a five star hotel . Towel were nice and big , bathrobes provided for pool use .The pool area  was nice and clean , nice jacuzzi and steam room , gym available too . Didn‚Äôt have any treatments as very overpriced .Dinner wasn‚Äôt included but although the food in the carriage restaurant was delish it‚Äôs extremely overpriced. Chowder 19 euro ! Chicken 32 euro and all sides extra ! 
Again it‚Äôs the location that‚Äôs making it expensive . I was again disappointed at a 5 star hotel to be served a buffet breakfast ,  as previously stated in other reviews , you should be offered a freshly cooked breakfast and more variety . All that was on offer was the full Irish breakfast , no choice of eggs and wasn‚Äôt advised if we wanted different type of egg we could , fruit selection was lovely as was yogurt selection . The service team were lovely .
 There was a daily tour offered for free of the Carton House which was very interesting . 
Just one comment . We had provided our debit card details  at check in with an additional 100 euro added for any extras . On check out the balance due was 10 cent , now I fully understand I owed the 10 cent but I was flabbergasted when on check out  the girl charged the 10 cent to my debit card !! ‚Ä¶ a bit harsh and not really customer friendly  ??",4,2024,08,27
234,Beautiful!,"A wonderful 5* experience. Room was extremely luxurious with those little extras that made the stay special. Staff were helpful and friendly with nothing too much trouble. The grounds surrounding the property were beautifully maintained and well worth a stroll around even if like me you don't play golf, although it was very busy with preparations for the forthcoming ladies golf tournament it was all outstanding. Breakfast was gorgeous with so much choice that you want to return again and again to try it all. Struggled on the second night to make a restaurant reservation due to volume of visitors used the room service option which proved to be great, hot food taken care of in warming cupboard and all beautifully presented. My only criticism (and I found it difficult to find any) would be the lack of a make-up mirror in the bathroom.
Will certainly be returning again even as a solo traveller.",5,2024,08,26
234,Some exceptional staff but overall not a 5* experience,"Service excellent but disappointed in how disjointed our golf break overnight stay was with no liaison between the hotel & pro shop.
We used a gift voucher but hotel staff and pro shop both tried to charge us as if we hadn‚Äôt pre booked with one!!
Also special in Kathleen‚Äôs kitchen was overpriced and in fact burnt!",4,2024,08,24
234,Not as good as it was.,"I will start this review with the positive, Carton House has beautiful grounds and lovely staff. This was my second stay here and I truly loved my first stay here a few years ago. This time around not so much. 
The air con in our room was useless and did not cool the room so slept with the window open. The first time we stayed the breakfast was served in the beautiful Morrison Room in the main house with a lovely selection of breakfast treats served on a tray similar to afternoon tea, this is no longer the case, it‚Äôs now served in the hotel in Kathleen‚Äôs Kitchen and you are given a choice of one pastry and order one main breakfast option. Also no toast came with the full Irish until I asked and couple beside me got none either which is very unusual. There was a buffet breakfast on the next morning though and this was much better . All staff were lovely apart from on check out I was served by an older woman with blond hair who didn‚Äôt seem to like her job, didn‚Äôt even ask how my stay was or anything. Have recently stayed in a 4 star and they made sure to ask how my stay went and gave me a complimentary coffee for the journey home. 
Quite disappointing.",3,2024,08,23
234,A five star experience in every respect,"This is a beautiful property. The grounds are immaculate well-maintained in every aspect. The two courses are different , beautiful, and challenging.  I played one round on each and found both to be in great shape with multiple sets of tees.  
Overall , the hotel staff , particularly Brian, the head concierge, and Dermot , manager , were extremely courteous, helpful, and professional .
I highly recommend this hotel.",5,2024,08,22
234,10 Stars for Carton House,"Booked a girly night away for some Mammy / Daughter time with my 7 year old. We had the most wonderful experience. My daughter was made feel so important. Every member of the team took the time to chat to her or even just give her a smile.
 
Upon entering our room, a beautiful welcome pack was left for her. Thank you!
 
We cycled around the beautiful grounds and enjoyed dinner in the Carriage House, absolutely delicious, and the staff were so attentive and friendly, absolutely recommend the Fillet Steak!!!
 
The swimming pool was so lovely, perfect temperature. The hotel is absolutely immaculate and stunning. Our room was so spacious and relaxing. I nearly had to drag my daughter home, she really didn‚Äôt want to leave nor did I. We‚Äôll be back, this will turn into a tradition for us.
 
Thank you to everyone for making our stay so enjoyable and memorable!",5,2024,08,19
234,Crashed by a Wedding,"A large three-day wedding crashed our highly anticipated stay at Carton House. Our wait for check-in exceeded 1 hour,  although after some negotiation we were offered a complementary drink.  It took almost as long for our bags to arrive in our room after several failed attempts to bring the correct suitcases. In fact, several of our articles went missing for some time. Our room faced the parking lot, in spite of the fact that we reserved a higher room class. So very disappointed.",2,2024,08,18
234,Never again. Long review - but worth a read.,"4* hotel at best with service worse than most budget hotels.

The bathrooms are in need of an update, with grout missing, hoels under the bathtub & small showers with slippery floors.

Aircon units work fine but do not allow you to actually select a temperature, again very old. 

Service terrible, check in was lovely however we were staying 4 nights and the morrison room was closed for the entirety of our stay due to private events. Afternoon tea was only available on the first day of our stay, we were informed by staff it would be available during the week and after the last sitting that day found out that was not the case. If we had been told earlier we could have visited on our first full day as they were available.

Pool is like a dingy leisure centre at best, again in huge need of an upgrade and not a place to relax.

Breakfast is fairly decent. 

We were given a room with a faulty sink that blocked upon use, staff told us this is standard and all sinks fill with water and you must put your hand in the dirty water to open the plug every use. We went into another room and verified this is NOT the case. Dirty sheets with blood stains on the pillow and what looked like semen stains on the bottom sheet. Due to full occupancy we could not move rooms. We requested a change of sheets, the new sheets had what looked like a faecal stain the size of one quarter of the bed on it so had to change sheets again. Slept at 3am, pregnant on babymoon and exhausted. This caused a lot of physical and mental stress. Nothing was done to compensate until we complained and asked to leave. After 7 conversations and most of our day being spent dealing with staff and our complaint we were offered 10% discount on our stay! This was increased to 20% and we cancelled the rest of our stay and moved hotels. The manager then made a mistake when agreeing the discounted amount for our final bill and emailed a confirmation with a higher amount again adding stress. It took 3.5 hours and a lot of chasing to get a confirmation email stating what had been agreed in conversation. So halfway through our babymoon having slept less than 5 hours a night and seen none of Ireland and used no facilities. 

In addition to this, to apologise I was given a mocktail which was a lovely gesture however after drinking I found out it contained raw egg white which should be avoided in pregnancy. 

Further to this we were told the resort manager in the morning would discuss refunding the first nights stay due to the faulty sink and us changing our sheets twice ourselves and being kept up until 3am. Upon speaking to the resort manager, he proceeded to defend, argue and accuse, wasting a further 20 mins of our time saying the sinks are all the same, they have taxes to pay and so cannot refund us for our stay, he agrees our experience is not acceptable but the discount is generous! He then proceeded to accuse my husband of lying when he said their staff had said afternoon tea was available on weekdays. Ludicrous, personally for a hotel charging 300-500 euros a night I would go elsewhere so you know you can trust the business if issues occur.",1,2024,08,18
234,Fabulous stay with fantastic and friendly hospitality,"My wife and I started our stay at Carton House with a relaxing limousine transfer from the airport with the Irish chauffeur company with Alan, the driver, who was super friendly, arranged by the hotel, many thanks Karen.
Check in was smooth and we were shown to the Ashford suite, in the main house, by Fanny who explained all the facilities within the room and around the hotel. The suite was well appointed with wonderful views of the rose garden and golf course.
We thoroughly enjoyed our evening meals in Kathleen‚Äôs kitchen and the carriage house, all the dishes were well presented and wonderfully tasty, huge praise for Chris Rogers, the executive chef and his talented team.
Each day of our stay started with a fantastic breakfast in the beautiful Gold Room, where Sinisha and Grace ensured we had an enjoyable experience. 
Mohamed, the guest relations manager, would greet us each day and kindly ask if he could assist us any way which was very much appreciated.
Jackie and I enjoyed relaxing in the main bar area, where Richard would come over to us and we had lovely conversations with him about our stay and other trips we had been on.
We had the pleasure of spending some time talking to Martin, the GM, over a couple of coffees, who is a true gentleman. 
We enjoyed using the hotel bikes to explore the beautiful hotel grounds, thank you Tom for your assistance.
The house tour with the Head Concierge, Brian, was extremely enjoyable and informative, which was enhanced with his charm and wonderful sense of humour. Thank you Brian for taking the time to wave us off, which was very touching, and arranging the limousine service back to the airport.
Check out was also smooth but we were sad to be leaving such a beautiful and charming hotel, however we will definitely be returning to Carton House. Jackie and I would like to thank Martin and his entire team for making us feel so welcome and special throughout our fabulous stay. We highly recommend this property to couples, families and groups. 
Well done team Carton House 100/100.",5,2024,08,18
234,Excellent Hotel ,"Beautiful hotel, excellent service, top notch restaurants. Had a beautiful dinner and probably the best breakfast I've ever had in any hotel.  Facilities are excellent.  I'm a non golfer but the golf course looks lovely.  Stayed in Powerscourt, Enniskerry, Co. Wicklow a month later but Carton House wins hands down in my opinion.  Best service, best food etc.",5,2024,08,17

The staff are highly trained and would like to mention the Greek waiter who served us sorry can't remember his name.Kiera  Karl and Zoe were very professional and Oscar in the Courtyard bar made our day very special.Thanks so much. We will be back. Highly recommend Carton House",5,2024,08,15
234,Most relaxing stay and incredible staff to boot!,"From we arrived until we left Mia Friel and all the staff were incredible. From the lovely warm welcome we received from Jack when he insisted on taking our luggage, to the lovely ladies who checked us in. The lovely gentleman at the Spa/pool area who welcomed us with open arms, to the professional and informative Ms Zoe at the bar explaining the different cocktails and wine, the well informed waiter who served our table, handled our kids with kindness and ensured we all had everything we needed.. our stay was relaxing, and so enjoyable! 
We cannot recommend this hotel enough. We‚Äôre already planning to return next yr. We left and drove to the airport to fly home to New York feeling revitalized and so well rested!
Thank you all for making our stay so enjoyable and memorable!!",5,2024,08,14
234,Very nice meal.,Excellent food. From adam.  In a lovely. Room with excellent service   And Adam. Came to table an introduced himself.  Was very nice touch. Was very enjoyable experience in a unique room very generous portions with great variety  thanks you to all very friendly staff,5,2024,08,13
234,Love it,"I find it hard to fault this hotel. Elegant, inviting, interesting and welcoming. 
From the moment you arrive the staff are professional and incredibly friendly. 
If you go you must do the tour. It takes around 59 minutes and allows you to get a sense of life when the original owners where there. I believe it starts in the foyer with Brian at 10. 
If you are a golfer the courses are highly recommended if not there are still loads to do aren‚Äôt the expansive grounds",5,2024,08,13
234,"A beautiful hotel , looking forward to staying again.","We had a beautiful meal in the Morrison Room , Sunday lunch , the beef with all the extras was delicious, everything else was also top notch , the only thumbs down was there was no sugar or milk served with the coffee , when it arrived , the bowl was full of empty wrappers. No big deal.",4,2024,08,12
234,Quality and comfort,"We stayed at Carton House for two nights for our 30th wedding anniversary and enjoyed every aspect of our stay. There are lots of staff around to help and everyone we interacted with was friendly and attentive, in a relaxed and unfussy manner. We felt very well looked after (special thanks to Ann). 
Rooms are generous in size and have everything you need. We ate dinner in the Carriage House and Kathleen‚Äôs Kitchen and both were excellent. High quality local ingredients and delicious dishes from the chefs, all served with a smile and just the right amount of friendly chat.
Our anniversary was acknowledged on several occasions and made our stay feel a little more special. Spa treatments are excellent quality also but make sure to book well in advance if you need a specific time. Finally, if you have a chance to take the history tour with Brian then go for it. The great house of the Dukes of Leinster is brought to life by Brian and a real treat. 
Highly recommended.",5,2024,08,11
234,Aim√©e and Andrew Trickett,"The second visit to Carton House Fairmont. Absolute world class service and staff in particular Ann at reception and Brian head concierge. They couldn‚Äôt have gone out for their way more to make our stay an unbelievable experience. We were treated like royalty and they could not have gone out of their way more to help. From Ann and Brian sorting out the Curragh races for us and also all of the other staff including Mohammed,  Vincent, Emma in The coach House and also Josh in the golf shop. We will most definitely be back again. Also would like to say a special  thank you to the chef in Kathleen‚Äôs kitchen Robert the executive sous chef for his amazing food and making our stay fantastic. Aim√©e and Andrew Trickett x",5,2024,08,11
234,Great spot to clear your mind,"The facilities and location are fantastic and would be hard to beat. The staff were all very polite and helpful. A special word of mention goes to Brian the concierge who gave us a wonderful tour of Carton House which was the highlight of our stay.. The afternoon tea in the drawing room was a peaceful indulgent experience due mainly to Eunice excellent service and friendly demeanor, which we highly recommend. Each member of staff who we encountered who were wearing a suit coat were totally on message with the hotels aim of giving a truly 5 star guest experience however a few others meant we just failed to get that complete luxury experience. Our check in was with an impeccably turned out young man who was extremely helpful and pleasant, however he failed to notice that I wore hearing aids and continued speaking in a whisper which even my hearing wife struggled to make .out even when this was obvious, At breakfast I was asked did I prefer tea or coffee only for the tea not to arrive and have to be asked for likewise I asked for ketchup and this never arrived. We found the rainfall showers in the room lacked power. These were minor annoyances which only slightly marred an otherwise wonderful stay.",5,2024,08,10
234,Birthday treat,"Stayed for 2 nights 4th and 5th August as a birthday treat and loved the entire visit. Stunning location and grounds and service was next to none. Breakfast in Kathleen‚Äôs Kitchen was fantastic, though did prefere the first morning's breakfast when it was a buffet style, even though it was bust. Big shout out to Lucy and to Anna at breakfast who were brilliant. Definitely would visit again if we got the opportunity",5,2024,08,08
234,Fantastic experience,We had lunch at the carriage house restaurant during the month of August. We had a delicious lunch the service was impeccable. We had a lovely view from our table and found the whole experience very memorable. Will definitely return! The weather was also fabulous,5,2024,08,08
234,Lovely experience overall with fabulous staff,"We stayed for two nights to celebrate our silver wedding anniversary recently. We enjoyed the luxurious ambience, the fabulous and friendly staff and the amazing smorgasbord breakfast on Sunday morning. 

We were surprised and disappointed to find that all the bikes were broken, although we‚Äôd been told they were complimentary by reception staff. One other thing was the a la carte breakfast on Monday was definitively a disappointment after the fabulous breakfast on Sunday. 

But overall it was an enjoyable experience.",4,2024,08,08
234,Fantastic Stay in this stunning property,Amazing stay at this beautiful hotel. Stayed to celebrate our wedding anniversary. We were so well looked after from the moment we arrived until we left. Great restaurant experience in Kathleens Kitchen and very nice time relaxing in the great leisure facilities. Can't wait to return.,5,2024,08,07
234,Expectations not met.,"Visited with my wife midweek and was left feeling a little disappointed overall . I‚Äôd like to start off by saying the location and grounds were beautiful. Room was basic and was let down by lack of mirror at vanity . Staff were very friendly but service was extremely poor , significantly so at breakfast where I waited 30 minutes for an americano and our hot food took 40 minutes to be served . Food was delicious but delay meant we were unable to get to the pool as planned . Dinner the previous night was an extortionate price . I had the halibut dish which was very nice but my wife had ‚Äú Jacob‚Äôs ladder ‚Äú slow cooked beef which was just a large lump of meat with a mound of celeriac and lacked 5 star quality. We‚Äôre very fortunate to have been able to  frequent many of Irelands 5 star hotels and don‚Äôt mind spending our money when it matches the product and service we receive but unfortunately Carton house as fallen short of our expectations and we‚Äôd be unlikely to return .",2,2024,08,07
234,Short break at Carton House,"Lovely hotel with great facilities. Spa, pool, sauna & golf were brilliant. Excellent choice of restaurants within the hotel and the food was incredibly good.  Close to Kildare Village for shopping. We enjoyed our anniversary weekend very much.",5,2024,08,06
234,Overnight stay,"What a fantastic hotel, staff provide excellent customer service in all areas espicially concergie and serving staff and the hotel is an excellent example of how to run a high quality hotel.
Food is fantastic with wide choice of restaurants to eat in, unfortunately our 1 night stay only meant we could only use the carrige house,location is ideal for easy access to Dublin.",5,2024,08,06
234,Absolutely not 5 star hotel,"Absolutely not a 5 star hotel. Beautiful on the outside, but don‚Äôt be fooled.  The interior rooms are dated and dark. Bathrooms had tiny showers and loose floor tiles. Bedroom had poor layout; one has to use the coffee nook to plug in to blow dry hair, as there was nowhere else in room with a plug and mirror. The bathroom had no hooks to hang towels. The interior wing where the rooms and gym are located is a cavernous maze.
Over priced and falsely advertised as five star hotel.",1,2024,08,05
234,Perfect relaxing stay and looking forward to going back,"We loved every moment of our stay.  We needed a relaxing overnight break and being a short drive from Dublin it was an ideal location.  We were greeted by Bryan who was so welcoming and the reception staff were lovely too and our room was ready which we were delighted about as it was still early afternoon.  The room was spacious with a large double bed with a big walk-in shower, with beautiful shower gel and body cream.  The room and bathroom were spotless which is so important to me as I am extremely picky. We enjoyed a beautiful lunch in the bright and relaxing lounge. The staff were so helpful as I needed a few changes to one particular dish as I have a food allergy - but no problem at all and they got it perfectly right.
We took a relaxing walk in the grounds enjoying the beautiful grounds whilst watching the golfers along the way !
We didnt have time for a spa treatment and we were already so chilled out but we overheard another couple talk about how great it was (next time !).  
Dinner was exquisite and we happened to meet Ian who i think is a senior manager and he gave us great assitance with our dinner and wine recommenendations which worked perfectly.  We had a great night's sleep and had a lovely table served breakfast which is so nice from the large buffets that most hotels have now.  It was very personal and the eager staff served us what we asked for.  Overall a great stay and we definately will be back.",5,2024,08,04
234,Taste of luxury,"We stayed at the Carton recently as a family of 5. We couldn't have been happier with the service from the moment we stepped through the doors until we checked out. Excellent customer service, all staff extremely friendly. Would highly recommend. A lovely French lady waited our table for dinner, I didn't catch her name but it was her last night working there, she was extremely attentive and friendly.",5,2024,08,01
234,Food experience of a life time,"We stayed for a night and had  a fine dining experience in Carton house Maynooth   last weekend.

The staff were absolutely amazing from the moment we checked in until unfortunately we had to check out. 
The dining experience was something to behold,from the staff member explaining to us what was involved in each course to the quality and the taste of the food it was all spectacular. The best food experience we ever had. The accommodation was fantastic as was the pool and gym facilities. I couldn‚Äôt honestly  find  a single thing that wouldn‚Äôt score 10 out of 10. I‚Äôm looking forward to a return visit in the not too distant future",5,2024,08,01
234,Spa Day Pampering,"We have stayed in this hotel before but this time I went for a treatment and lunch. The spa is beautiful... I booked a back massage as I suffer from ongoing pain and discomfort. From the outset Ciara was excellent. She personalised the massage for my needs and was very professional. 
The relaxation area is very chilled, with fruit, water etc Managed to fall asleep before the massage and afterwards! The sorbet, chocolate and prosecco was an added luxury! Will definitely go back for another day of pampering! Thank you to the spa team üëè",5,2024,07,29
234,"Beautiful location, amazing service.","To start; It's a 30 minute ride from the airport and 40 minutes from Dublin. beautiful location, the service since one is arriving is nothing but exceptional. They have two professional golf courses. The house is exceptional, untouched and beautiful in all the senses. They have 2+ restaurants in the property, a bar where one can relax and watch sports, and of course a golf shop. They have an amazing pool and gym, world class spa treatments, we were lucky enough to stayed when there was a film being shot on property. Amazing experience. ",5,2024,07,28
234,Worth another try but more misses than a hit for a first time.,"I have wanted to stay here for ages and finally got the opportunity. I‚Äôd go back to give the place a second chance maybe but it was a bit hit and miss. Arrived to check in at 4pm ‚Äì waited a good 20 mins. Only 2 people checking people in; if they redirected us to the bar or took an order for the bar while we waited that would have been expected. Especially when there are extended conversations with one guest while everyone is waiting. 
No light bites being served in bar area- which is unusual. Kathleens Kitchen was just ok for dinner; only 3 types of cheese for a cheese board is not satisfactory especially when they cant substitute if one type isnt liked.  No brie but they had brie at breakfast which was confusing. Veggie options at dinner limited. 
Rooms nice, bathroom tiles barely 3 star never mind 5 star. Bath was lovely. TV didn‚Äôt work- kept going all fuzzy; housekeeping was sent up when we called albeit late; and  basically just stared at the TV, left some not really sage advice and left. On check out ‚Äì I mentioned TV and comment was like we will get it looked at. No apology. We couldn‚Äôt chill out and watch TV properly before we went to bed so I think an apology would have been a nice gesture. 
Spa treatment was fab but pool and Jacuzzi felt very community pool not luxury. Lunch at the Carriage House was very enjoyable, great wine choices (why are these choices not in Kathleens Kitchen) same issue with the cheeseplate. 
Staff were generally very pleasant. Grounds were lovely ‚Äì can see why the golfers  enjoy it.",3,2024,07,27
234,"Good food, disappointing service.","Food was perfectly fine. But waited 45 minutes for our starters and another 45 minutes before we decided to leave the restaurant and have the food send to our room at the hotel instead (my dad had to work). Arrived in the hotel room 30 minutes later cold. I understand the restaurant was busy with a large party of golfers, but that‚Äôs not an excuse to forget about everyone else in the restaurant.",1,2024,07,25
234,The Essence of Luxury Dining,"The Morrison Room at Carton House is an extraordinary culinary gem that elevates dining to an art form. From the moment you step into this elegant restaurant, you are greeted with a warm, sophisticated ambiance that perfectly complements its historic setting. 

The decor is  beautiful, exuding luxury and comfort. The staff are exceptionally professional, attentive, and knowledgeable, ensuring every guest feels like royalty. Special mention to Richard, Adam and Emily.

The food is out of this world and I can't recommend it highly enough. We had a wonderful Sunday lunch. This restaurant truly embodies the essence of luxury dining and deserves every accolade it receives.",5,2024,07,22
234,A little treat,"Food was excellent . Staff were the best that I have ever encountered any where in the world.  
Had a very funny incident .
I was mistaken for a famous actor with a similar name . 
So we were giving a table with privacy.
Had a giggle about it with the staff. ",5,2024,07,22
234,Carton House - You did not disappoint üéâ,A fantastic hotel in an amazing location close to Dublin City. We wanted 2 nights away without the trav and this did not disappoint. From the moment we walked in through the doors the staff could not do enough for us. Highlight was the fine dining Sunday roast dinner ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶,5,2024,07,17
234,"Super, Grand, First class hotel","Superb hotel with lovely grounds and very friendly and attentive staff.
The room we had booked was purple and a bit disappointing but we were upgraded to a magnificent suite.
Would really recommend this great hotel and it has an important historical significance which all goes towards the atmosphere.",5,2024,07,08
234,Birthday stay,"Lovely staff made us feel very welcome. Room was very nice with balcony (which really could do with a good clean, lots of cobwebs) As it was my wife's 60th birthday there was a very miserable piece of brownie - would have expected a bottle of fizz as have received that for ordinary birthdays from lesser hotels. Breakfast was very disappointing- no buffet & had to ask for everything such as toast/bread and my breakfast wasn't as good or large as in previous hotels - also 10% charge on bar drinks not appreciated felt like penny pinching. Food in the Carriage Restaurant was really good however. Overall a lovely hotel but the small things irritating when it costs so much to stay there.",4,2024,07,07
234,Good stop,Cart√≥n House was a great stop the night be more we left Dublin. Way better than an airport hotel. Beautiful grounds and Kathleen‚Äôs Kitchen was fantastic. We had a transfer the next am as it‚Äôs not super close to the airport but again a much better option.,5,2024,07,07
234,Carriage House delightful,Fabulous experience in the carriage house restaurant.  Myself and my friend ate outside on the decking in the sun. Gorgeous Ceaser Salad and glass of chilled wine. Superb... The staff were amazing and nothing was too much trouble to them. They are a credit to Xaton House. Will deffo be back. Helen,5,2024,07,04
234,Eimears birthday,Arrived a few minutes late but no problem . Waiter knew his wines and offered taste decided on his recommendation and it paired with the meal we had . Service excellent and great attention to detail . Great ambience we will be returning again tomorro night.,5,2024,07,04
234,WOW! Fantastic Experience,This was a highlight of our trip from Australia. The property is magnificent and is matched by superlative service. The fine dining experience exceeded all expectations. We will talk about this for years to come. From the time we walked through the door to our departure a luggage was loaded into the car we were spoiled.,5,2024,07,03
234,Food Allergy Service Above and Beyond,"We had dinner at the Carriage House and we had complex food allergies. Sarah Kennedy the manager of the Carriage House noted our issues, spoke directly to the chef herself, served the food herself and made sure that we could eat safely. Unbelievable service. Strongly Recommend!",5,2024,07,01
234,Underwhelmed,"We stayed for two nights in June.
I found the whole booking process tedious and disjointed at times especially not being able to book exactly what we wanted but hoped that would change once we arrived. When we did arrive I realised that there was quite a large conference going on with lots of delegates also staying at the Hotel. I have no problem with this but feel we should of been given a heads up as it did affect restaurant booking and also trying to get a drink at the bar in the evening was a real pain with only 1 sometimes 2 staff who clearly couldn't cope. We were also overcharged by ‚Ç¨1000 on check out which took a little time to resolve and shouldn't of as it was clearly obvious where the calculation was wrong. On a positive note the staff were all very helpful and welcoming.",3,2024,06,30
234,Brilliant experience at Carton,"Had a lovely night in Carton House recently the Hotel looks great and has retained a lovely ambience.
Had dinner in Carriage house staff and food top notch lunch in Courtyard bar and lady (Anna) who served us made excellent recommendations my partner had Seafood sandwich I had Chicken salad I have been served by Anna over the years She's a great ambassador for your Hotel we will be back.",5,2024,06,21
234,Fairytale week!,"This review is based on the beautiful hotel and lovely staff, but please refer to our glowing Google review if you‚Äôre interested in having your wedding at the Carton House -- you will NOT be disappointed.

From the moment you check-in, you are treated as royalty at the Carton House. We have traveled extensively and Carton House by far is one of the most stunning hotel resorts we‚Äôve ever stepped foot on. The staff goes above and beyond to ensure your experience is unforgettable.
 
The lobby, all the restaurants, manor house, spa/pool, the grounds/garden, golf course and sleeping rooms are well-kept, smell divine and all have unique characteristics.
 
Our favorite memories during our stay is with Eunice and Grace in the Gold Salon during our breakfast. They are the most professional and welcoming people we have ever met. And we cannot forget to mention they make the BEST cappuccinos. Johnny at the lobby bar not only makes the best cocktails, but was a delight to talk to and so welcoming. Jack, the bellman, was always asking how he could be helpful and enhance our stay. Everyone at the front desk during our stay greeted us with friendly faces. Sarah in the spa gave one of the best massages I‚Äôve had in a long time and my favorite part was the relaxation room afterwards with sorbet and apple juice! We enjoyed lunches and dinners in the Carriage House with Sarah and Amy as they are service oriented and fun to chat with! The PM Front Desk Manager on the night of our wedding was a godsend as he provided us with waters, helped us order late night pizza and set up breakfast room service for the morning after our wedding‚Äîthe best way to wrap up the best day of our life!
 
Our room was refreshed daily and felt so clean and comfortable, the turn down service was also immaculate and a nice way to wrap up our amazing evenings.
 
If you‚Äôre able to make your way to the Carton House, you will be immersed in history, warmly welcomed by the best staff and find yourself at one of the most exquisitely beautiful hotels in the world.",5,2024,06,11
234,Beautiful night at Carton house,"We stayed at Carton house for one night celebrating my daughter‚Äôs birthday.   We had a seamless check in with Anna who made our arrival very special. We had 4 rooms and all were furnished beautifully and very clean.  We had gorgeous cocktails in the courtyard bar hosted by Richard and a fantastic meal in Kathleen‚Äôs kitchen where Victoria the restaurant manager and her team made sure we were very well looked after with our special occasion noted.    
As we were a large table we were lucky to have breakfast in a private section where the original tiles of Kathleen‚Äôs kitchen remain. The service was excellent and the food was delicious. We will definitely be returning.",5,2024,06,10
234,Amazing Stay!,"We just spent 2 nights at Carton House and our stay was amazing! From the moment we arrived, Anna took good care of us! We played 18 holes of golf, and all at the Pro Shop were so helpful with tips for the Montgomerie Course. We dined at Kathleen‚Äôs Kitchen and our waiter Mathis was outstanding as well. All around a great stay‚Ä¶would love to have spent  more time there.",5,2024,06,02
234,Amazing Stay!,"We were there for a wedding and we could not be more pleased with everything this hotel had to offer. From the wonderful, spacious rooms to the delicious breakfast to the fantastic tour of the property put on by the concierge each morning, we had a very enjoyable stay. Golf on the O'Meara course was also wonderul, although a bit windy. Holes 14-16 are a must see.",5,2024,06,02
234,Magical stay,"This is one of the most beautiful places in Ireland. The stay here is magical. The people working here are incredible. Especially Mathis, we will not forget him any time soon. The Carton House is so big that you don‚Äôt have enough time to discover it all. 
Great stay, great people!",5,2024,06,01
234,Amazing place.,Amazing property with more amazing staff and management. Loved it. Rooms and Golf was excellent. Coach House restaurant had fabulous service and it has one of the best breakfast rooms in the world in my opinion. Lots of park land to walk around to enjoy the view of old and new.,5,2024,05,30
234,Carton house hotel,"We had a lovely night recently in the magnificent Carton  house. Myself and my wife love this hotel. My daughter got married there in 2017 and we have  been coming back regularly ever  since. The food in all outlets was great all the staff were extremely friendly especially Anna Morgan, a great asset to the hotel so friendly and professional we will be back again for sure.",5,2024,05,29
234,Amazing,"Me and my Partner booked Carton to have a special weekend away, to do our gender reveal. It couldnt have been more perfect. Between the gorgeous rooms and staff especially Jack and Selina, it was perfect. 
The breakfast was gorgeous especially for two picky eaters. 
The hotel staff were always one call away if anything was needed and were extremely accommodating.  
Hotel is stunning in every way.
Amenities are 10/10.
Will definitely be returning in future.",5,2024,05,28
234,Amazing Stay,"1 Absolutely 100% amazing! The service, staff, and facility were all perfect. From the moment we arrived, we were greeted with warm smiles and outstanding hospitality. The staff went above and beyond to ensure our comfort and satisfaction throughout our stay. The facility itself was immaculate, well-maintained, and beautifully designed. Every detail was carefully attended to, making our experience truly exceptional. We felt pampered and valued as guests. It‚Äôs rare to find a place where everything exceeds expectations, but this was it. We can‚Äôt wait to return and highly recommend it to anyone seeking a flawless experience. Truly unforgettable!",5,2024,05,25
234,Beautiful Hotel,Had the most wonderful stay at Carton House to celebrate a significant birthday with family and friends.  We stayed in the main house in the most beautiful room. We were looked after so well by the staff who went over and above to make our stay memorable.  I‚Äôm looking forward to going back as soon  as I can.,5,2024,05,21
234,Beautiful grounds being poorly managed.,"As an event producer this was a venue I had a hard time with.

Though the Carton House grounds are incredible, the hospitality is not. The front desk and back of house staff were absolutely amazing, but the management lacked kindness and care. During the stay for a 7 night work trip, I experienced 2 star service in a claimed  5 star hotel. 

Room- I was given a room that had a filthy bathroom at first, only to be moved to a room that looked like the Garda had broken into it. A cracked peephole, a non-functional lock, a broken sink, a missing door stop. 

Dining - It took 45 mins to receive service in the courtyard, and attempting to get a menu or service directly from the bar was a chore. I discovered that the kind folk who seemed to be in over their heads were actually interns from France. Lovely, but they were being poorly trained and managed.

The carriage house, however, was a different experience. Far better in service and efficiency. Though most dining was done in Maynooth after having dealt with the poor service within Carton House, I will gladly recommend the Carriage house. 

I would like to commend the following employees who were impeccable at their work;
Jack, Seamus, Jenny, Terrance, Anna,, Emma, Johnny at the bar, Jenny at carriage house, and Deniyi the night manager, Davis at breakfast and the entire breakfast staff. 

I would also point out the poor service from the following - Richard, Ian, Liam, Alexis at the bar, 

Overall, the Carton House has the potential to be a fantastic stay but is being poorly managed at the moment.",1,2024,05,19
234,Exceeded expectations!,"I cannot say enough positive things about my experience at Carton House.  The property is stunning and picturesque both inside and out.  We walked all over the grounds with are beautifully kept even in the winter.  The tea was an absolute highlight and a real treat for all the senses.  Another highlight was the tour of the historic house given by Brian.  Brian's telling of the history of the house, the family who lived there,  and Irish history was fascinating.  He's very knowledgeable, kind, and has wonderful customer service.  Excellent customer service all around by the staff.  It's clear that the guest experience is top priority here.  We also enjoyed a delicious breakfast and dinner in Kathleen's Kitchen.  This was my first time traveling to Ireland.  I went with a friend of mine who has stayed at Carton House previously and insisted it was a must for our trip.  Well, I can certainly see why she felt that way!  I'll plan to visit Ireland in the future and Carton House will absolutely be on the itinerary.  Thank you, Brian and the whole team for the wonderful experience!",5,2024,05,15
234,Disappointing Five Star Experience,"I was quite shocked and disappointed by my experience with Carton. Found pre-visit communication left a lot to be desired. Afternoon tea did not live up to expectation and was poor compared to the Westbury, College Green, the K Club and other Dublin and local hotels. I  also felt let down by the response I received to my feedback.  The room was beautiful, however, and the service was good.",3,2024,04,26
234,Majestic & Authentic Place,"Majestic and authentic place with dedicated staff. The catering and service reflect the place. An environment of excellence to recharge your batteries and/or make important decisions! A special thank you to Marie for making this stay memorable.

Vanessia & Jonathan S.",5,2024,04,18
234,Worth a visit,"A beautiful hotel situated in fabulous grounds. 
Accommodation was comfortable and spacious, however the shower is surprisingly small. Biscuits on the coffee/tea tray would have been nice!
Food is excellent we dined with family on the Saturday night which was very good. However having booked breakfast for 9 of us at 9.30 it was served outside the kitchen on low sofas with coffee tables to eat off. Service was slow and staff had to squeeze between the tables which wasn‚Äôt very satisfactory. I suggest management look into using other dining rooms that seemed to be available? 
House tour is definitely worth doing and the Spa was lovely thank you Ciara for a wonderful facial and massage.",4,2024,04,16
234,Worth a visit,"Lovely hotel internally and externally. Super renovation work done.

The old house is magnificent and the tour is worthwhile doing.

The bedrooms are a bit of a walk from the main hotel and feel somewhat isolated.
When the rooms are cleaned, it is not really ideal for the rubbish to be left in the corridors for long periods. Sports shoe boxes, empty shopping bags, pizza boxes, general take away rubbish, beer and wine bottles do not set the tone for a so-called 5 star facility.

Breakfast was excellent, lunch pricey, probably could have some more options on the lunch menu.

As a group we had the set menu dinner in the Carriage House. It was a total let down. Management was not too sympathetic to us when we followed up with our issues after we had left the hotel.

Pool area was nothing spectacular, water was arctic and all that used it had the shivers after. Hotels in general appear to be cutting down on heating in pools.

On checkout there was an error with bill, and on another occasion again overcharged (accidently) at the bar. This can happen, so better off checking what you sign for.

Staff were very nice to deal with at all times.",3,2024,04,12
234,It‚Äôs the people that matter.,"We arrived later than we expected, and there was only one guest attendant checking people in. Understandable, but after a day of traveling, a bit off putting. But‚Ä¶ Liam. What can I say, he was and is one of the most engaging folks we had had the pleasure of meeting. More about Liam later.
My wife and I recently stayed two nights in a Deluxe King balcony room in the garden wing. The bed was perfect, the room was large, with all the amenities one would expect in a hotel of this caliber. Oddly - there was nowhere to hang a towel near the shower, and the shower itself, although great water pressure, was uncomfortably small. 
My wife called down to guest services, requesting a bucket of ice to be delivered to the room, and had to check back, as they had forgot. 
And the lighting setup was weird. The switches for the bathroom, hallway and main sitting area were all in the hall where you first entered the room. A pain at night when you wanted to use the restroom. 
All of the above would probably bring this review down to 4 stars, but it was the people that gives it 5. As I had mentioned, Liam was so engaging and took the time out of his busy day to always stop to chat. 
My wife and I had contacted the Castle ahead of our stay in order to set up a falconry experience. Brian, the concierge, seamlessly made the arrangements. And followed up with me prior to our stay. 
The falconer was also named Brian. What a guy! Although he was under the weather, he still showed up, knowing that this a was a bucket list experience for me. We had a blast! He was funny, knowledgeable, kind, and we could see he really had a passion for what he does. 
Highly recommended.
Another highlight was when Brian, the concierge, took the time out of his day to give my wife and I a tour of the castle. To get this straight - he did not have to. One of the most wonderful individuals we have ever met. He knew more about the castle than I know about myself. I could go on and on about him, so suffice it to say that our stay would not have been nearly as marvelous without having met him.
Room was wonderful, but on our next stay we are definitely booking a suite in the original castle.
Food was delicious. 
Staff was above first class.
Stay there!
We are already planning our next stay.",5,2024,04,07

234,Amazing weekend ‚Ä¶ fabulous team!,"We had a fabulous family weekend for my parents retirement in carton house. Fab hotel, beautiful rooms, great food, staff are fantastic. The management team in the hotel went out of their way to ensure we had a special weekend. Special thanks to triona and Selina for looking after us so well!!",5,2024,03,24
234,Very good but with some poor management decisions.,"First of all, the hotel is very good at the January price point that we paid. The staff (except for one) were loverly to us and our pet dog. We would stay again. I would recommend it to people and their four legged friends as long as there is not a price hike (Despite my recommendations).

There are a few points that I would like to make where improvements could/should be made. 

The staff were excellent but they do need to be better trained. So this constructive criticism is directed at the Training Dept &/or Management team. You charge a premium for food, so we were put out on occasion's (but not put off) by some or the smaller details. 

(i) Train staff to pour wine, supply the right glasses (red/white wine) - guest should not have to get up to get their wine bottle from afar. 

(ii) Don't say that someone can't have their steak 'well-done' and embarrass them in front of the table. Everyone is different, customer first!

(iii) Don't be rigid with what you can serve. One example: A child can order chips from the children's menu but the following evening when the children did not attend dinner, some of the adults ordered chips as a side order and the response was 'sorry, we don't do them'. We were spending over 650 per meal, so you need to up your game (TRAINING). 

(iv) Avoid asking diners to pass plates because staff can't remember the order placement. 

FYI: For the sub standard (but still enjoyable meal) I still paid the service charge as this is not the fault of the staff. They were very nice.

Availability of places to eat within the restaurant.

- For lunch next day we were told that the restaurant was closed for guests (those paying for overnight accommodation) because the hotel took a booking for the corporate function that day. They were on what I imagine a course for the day. You actually put them before your hotel guests. This is terrible, cashing in at the expense of others!

- We were told that we could order room service (10 euro tray charge) but what guests wants to be told that they can only have lunch if it's in their room or have a snack at the golf course cafe where we would have to walk outside for a roll/sandwich and takeaway coffee. We were also told that we could have barfood, but that would be from 2pm.

- We understand that you closed some of your eateries for renovation at the same time and that left one place that you booked out for the Corporates. You should have had bar food available from 12-2pm to cover this off but you failed to do so. You shunned guests staying at the hotel. Rigid/Penny pinching/Poor Management for a lovely five star hotel.

General
- The pool is massive, the changing rooms are nice. The pool area needs a lick of paint and a bit more 'wow' added. It would be a good idea to not have the cables poking out of the alcoves (water and electrics).
- Grounds are large, nice for dog walks.
- Rooms are nice and empty fridge is handy.
- Water available for free at reception.
- It's not always clear to first timers where the front desk is, especially when staff are not there.
- Not an issue but some 5 star hotels, show you to your room. They don't do it at Carton House Hotel.
- Lobby area is very nice, as is the bar area. 
- You have great staff and most go beyond their duty (well done staff!) but I question management and training.

Before I posted on trip advisor, I did ask for a chat with the General Manager (via email). Their auto response was "" Thank you for completing our online Enquiry form. A member of our team will contact you within 24 hours to discuss how we can assist you. However, it has been six weeks now and no response via email or phone. So I have shared my views with you all. If I had spoken to someone, I would have removed some of the above and verbally shared as a learning.",3,2024,03,16
234,Amazing.  Love the Fairmont Brand,"2nd visit since the rebranding to Fairmont

I was skeptical at first, but this is truly a Fairmont hotel. Lots of little service touches which make it feel so familiar. 
 Big shout out to Jack who welcomed us and provided a tour. He was knowledgeable balanced with humor. 
 The stay was nothing short of perfect. We will return if just to have one of Jack‚Äôs suggested cocktails.",4,2024,03,16
234,Health and Safety Issue - Children‚Äôs Pool,"Stayed here March 2024 with my husband and baby before I went back to work after Maternity leave. One of the reasons we picked Carton house was because of the Spa. Big mistake. Some small issues like the pool was freezing and the jacuzzi was broken, annoyances. HOWEVER the major issue was how utterly disgusting the children‚Äôs pool was. Black and white pieces of plastic floating in the water. Filthy pool floor. Hard to tell when it was last cleaned. I took photos and video and hightailed it out of the pool. We stayed 3 nights but that was the only time we used the spa/pool which was such a disappointment. Probably worse was the fact that I tried to highlight this issue privately with the duty manager rather than write a review‚Ä¶ still waiting for a call back.",2,2024,03,14
234,Pool and gym facilities not even two star,"The ladies rooms changing facilities are not kept to two star, never mind five star, standard of cleanliness at all. The basins are blocked and dirty, the showers are dirty. There are no hand towels. When I queried this, I was told they are on order and that the spa is not allowed to borrow hand towels from the hotel. I find it hard to believe that two departments in a supposed five star resort can‚Äôt come to an arrangement to borrow some hand towels. You are clearly not putting your guests first.

There were no wipes in the gym and the bin was overflowing. There were also stains on supposedly clean towels.",1,2024,03,13
234,Best Breakfast Ever,"Stayed two nights with family for a birthday treat for my brother. This was the first time we have stayed in Carton House and we were all so impressed. We ate the first night in Kathleen's kitchen which has such a lovely atmosphere and wonderful food. Night two we ate in the Carriage house as we were watching a rugby match. Again what a lovely venue with lovely bar food. Staff are exemplary, so pleasant without any of the stuffiness. The breakfast is easily the best I have ever had - name it and they had it for breakfast! The walks around the house and the spa mean that you can easily wile away a weekend without leaving the grounds. We had family coming to join us on the Sunday and the manager went out of her way to set aside an area for us in the main lounge although they were busy with breakfast, so we could have coffees. We enjoyed our stay so much that we have already booked to stay again!",5,2024,03,12
234,"Great hotel, great stay ‚úåüèª","Not my first time at the Carton House. Great hotel, great stay, awesome nature and fabulous kitchen üëçüèª. A special thank you for Kate and Emma at the reception. Were very kind and helpful. Had a couple of things I needed help with, managed in a speed of lightening. Appreciate it.",5,2024,03,11
234,Super weekend break,"We choose Carton House again for our annual spring birthday weekend break and as usual the hotel , staff and food were top notch!
We ate in the carriage house the first night which was fantastic and Kathleen‚Äôs kitchen the second night. I have to say a very memorable meal and my fish (Stone Bass) was absolutely perfect.
We had lovely long walks around the estate taking in all the lovely natural beauty of the place.
We will return again as the staff and impeccable service helped make the entire weekend a joy.",5,2024,03,11
234,Two words: Brian Sutton. An exceptional asset to Carton House and Fairmont overall,"Another fantastic stay at Carton House - the staff, the food, the decor, the service all 5 star with a lovely personal friendly welcoming touch. Ian Phelan looked after us so well, food was fabulous in Kathleen‚Äôs Kitchen, as was our wine tasting with Audrey. The best part was Brian Sutton - a warm, articulate and knowledgeable man. Carton are so lucky to have Brian, a huge asset to the hotel. His house tour was exceptional. An utter professional and gentleman. Brian‚Äôs service made Carton a standout from other 5 star hotels. We will be back!",5,2024,03,08
234,Lovely hotel with excellent staff,"Beautiful mix of modern and traditional. Hotel and grounds are beautiful, staff were lovely we did have a very poor meal in the hotel which according to other reviews was out of the norm and when we checked out the hotel did not charge us Anthony for the meal which I thought was absolutely first class service. Pool was nice but quite cold set up for swimming like a gym rather than relaxing. During our time at the pool a couple of families came down but had to leave because it was too cold for their children. My wife took the free tour of the old house which she really enjoyed. I would highly recommend the hotel and look forward to returning.",4,2024,03,06
234,5 star stay in the 5 star Carton House,"We enjoyed a 2 night D+BB stay at the end of February 2024.  The staff both on reception and in the restaurant were very welcoming & courteous, which made our stay very special. We were looked after very well by Ian & Marie, and we enjoyed an upgrade to bedroom suite.
The table service breakfast on Thursday in Kathleen‚Äôs kitchen was superb, and the ambience of stately home‚Äôs original kitchen was a very unique experience. 
The buffet breakfast on a busy Friday morning was also excellent. 
Dinner in Kathleen‚Äôs kitchen was also very enjoyable.
Overall the hotel accommodation it first class and surrounding setting of the gardens & golf courses very attractive. We arrived mid-evening and the lit driveway approach to the hotel was superb.
Looking forward to another visit in the near future!",5,2024,03,04
234,Stunning hotel and amazing staff,"Just back from one nights stay at Carton House. Stunning place,from the grounds to the hotel lobby, restaraunts, Spa area and bedrooms are all very beautiful.  Had an amazing facial and massage followed by a lovely complimentary sorbet and juice afterwards in the relaxation room.  We had a gorgeous dinner in Kathleen's Kitchen and also breakfast there the next morning.  Nothing to fault, food was amazing.  Really nice touch was the free tour of the House provided by Jack. Really enjoyed the tour  the house is steeped in history, really interesting hearing about each room and was great to see The Presidential Suite. Jack was very knowledgeable and had a great humour  really nice guy and is great at his job. Every member of staff we came across were so friendly and helpful in particular Ann at the front desk. The hotel is beautiful but the staff are the selling point for us. Couldn't be more helpful. We will definitely go back.",5,2024,03,04
234,Dog friendly stay,"We stayed at Carton House at the end of February with our dog and it was a lovely experience. The staff were highly attentive and couldn‚Äôt do enough for you. We had room service during our stay, and the food was excellent. We will most definitely be back again soon.",5,2024,03,04
234,Fabulous stay!,"Really welcoming from the minute I arrived. Very friendly and helpful reception staff. Plenty of areas to relax and vegetate in. Room extremely comfortable with both bath and shower. Food very good in Carriage House. Head concierge very knowledgeable about the history of the House.

Would return in a heartbeat.",5,2024,03,03
234,Best experience ever!,"Stayed for one night in Carton House Hotel.From the beginning, we were treated with warm welcoming. The decor of the hotel is absolutely fantastic.

234,An amazing experience,"I booked a 2 nights' stay at Carton House for my 50th birthday with a friend.

My experience in one word : faultless!

My stay was perfect from start to finish. Every aspect of it. 

We arrived really early (around 9am) : we were thrilled to learn that our rooms were available.  Thanks to my Accor status, I was upgraded to a wonderful room in the main part of the hotel, the Ashford room. What an amazing experience. That room really felt like a 5 stars' experience in a historical context. 

Every night, turn-down service was faultess with nice chocolates left by the bed. The bathroom was huge and everything was so nicely decorated. I felt special.

We used the spa facilities which are extraordinary (I had a scrub and a wrap which were out of this world).

We had dinner on both nights at Kathleen's kitchen : amazing food and service.

The grounds of the property are incredible : we enjoyed the walks.

We took the train to Dublin which was a nice and easy way of reaching the city.

Biran, the concierge, was remarquably competent and kind.

I just cannot wait to return.

THANK you Fairmont!  Thanks to all the staff at Carton House for making my 50th birthday SO special. I am very very grateful.",5,2024,02,15
234,Dinner and drinks,Had a meal recently in Kathleen's kitchen. The staff from front door to table service were excellent. You can tell they enjoy their jobs. The meal was fantastic as was the accompanying wine. We will definitely return soon. Yes it is expensive but it was worth it for us. ,5,2024,02,13
234,Fantastic stay,"We had the most fantastic stay at this hotel, all the staff were amazing, the food was excellent, the room was beautiful & comfortable, every area in the hotel was spotless. We were greeted by a lovely gentleman at the door, shown to reception, offered a hot towel which was a lovely gesture. Dinner & breakfast in Kathleen's Kitchen was incredibly good, & such a big variety on the breakfast buffet. A special mention to the lovely Selina who took our booking & looked after us so well, we really appreciate it. Among others, Eva in the restaurant, Anna on reception & Liam at the door, they made us feel very welcome & gave us a warm departure. We will definitely be back!",5,2024,01,30
234,Amazing,"The place is just amaising. Extremely friendly staff, from recepttion up to bar, restaurants, room and spa. We have dinner in Katlins Kitchen. If you like to enjoy a lovely dinner in an open kitchen restaurant then this is a must. We did as well a once in a lifetime experience: full tasting menu with pairing wine in Morrison room. Words can't describe the friendliness of staff and the quality of food. So if you want to be ""royal"" for a night, this is the place. The overall atmosphere makes you feel special but comfortable at the same time. Highly recommended.",5,2024,01,30
234,Excellent Hotel,"Attended a private function at the Carton House Hotel. The food and service were excellent, check in and check out were flawless and the whole operation was managed by a highly motivated and professional team. 6 star facility and service from a 5 star hotel.",5,2024,01,25
234,Beautiful hotel and wonderful staff!,"Carton House is a beautiful and very well kept property. When you first arrive greenery surrounds you everywhere and everything is very clean. I especially enjoyed my experience thanks to Margot and Emma in the bar lounge and the overnight front desk gentleman, I wish I had gotten his name, he was extremely helpful with getting airport transportation, assisted us with our bags at 5 AM and even provided us some small breakfast bags with yogurt, water, and other items. Everyone went above and beyond without us even having to ask.",5,2024,01,25
234,Lovely Stay - But not a Luxury Spa Destination,"Lovely hotel with excellent grounds and facilities. In terms of value for money with their B&B rate I would rate this as excellent value. With regard to our stay I am only giving it 4 stars as we had booked the overnight spa experience. We found the treatments excellent, however where the spa lets itself down is the cleanliness of the spa/pool areas and the minimal amount of facilities in this regard. With only a sauna, steam room and swimming pool available I wouldn‚Äôt consider this a luxury spa destination. I would however recommend Kathleen‚Äôs kitchen and we really enjoy the bar area. We previously had breakfast here and found this time round that the current setup of the breakfast area compared to the old way, which was I believe was in the Morrison Room isn‚Äôt as good or enjoyable. Overall the room was really nice, the stay was pleasant, the staff excellent as was the food and service.",4,2024,01,13
234,Family Birthday Dinner,"Booked for my Fathers 80th party. 

Have to say the staff went above and beyond to make us feel Welcome. From the greeting walking in the front door an area reserved for us at the courtyard bar prior to our dinner booking and for afterwards.  
The food in Kathleen‚Äôs Kitchen you could not fault. The waiters so friendly and engaging. 
A Big thank you to all the staff who made it a great evening out!",5,2024,01,13
234,Wonderful Stsy,"We have just returned from an overnight stay in the majestic setting of Carton House. From the warm welcome of Liam the concierge, the efficient checkin with Marie at reception & the friendly service of Thomas in the bar our initial impressions of Carton House were 5star +. The hotel grounds and historic buildings create a magnificent backdrop, something that intrigues us. The owners are proud of this history and so provide a free daily tour of the buildings, telling the story of this majestic building. Ryan our guide was informative and knowledgeable of Carton House and it‚Äôs famous owners, the tour is something I would definitely recommend. 
The final piece that made our weekend so enjoyable was the delicious food we enjoyed in Kathleen‚Äôs Kitchen. The menu on Saturday night was delicious, with local ingredients prepared in an innovative way. 
Overall it was a wonderful stay, with wonderful service & delicious food in an incredible setting‚Ä¶ I hope we can visit again soon.",5,2023,12,30

234,Christmas family lunch for the ladies.,"We booked a ladies only lunch for members of our extended family on Sun 10 December in the beautiful Carriage House. Twelve ladies covering three generations enjoyed  an amazing 3 course meal - the children‚Äôs menu being offered was the best I have ever seen and the choice and quality of the main menu was outstanding. Everyone agreed that all the food was delicious. The cosy surroundings and beautiful Christmas decorations added so much to the experience but it was the but it was the delightful team of servers who brought our experience to a whole new level. They made everyone feel special and valued and their patient attention, friendliness and sense of fun with the little ones was commendable. I would like to say a massive thank you to Phillips, Sara and Christine for the care and for making our lunch so special. 
After the small ones were dispatched, we adjourned to the Courtyard Bar for a little cocktail where we met William - maker of cocktails to die for and a wicked sense of humour.
This was one of the most enjoyable days out we have had in a long time. Take a bow Carton House.
PS I also managed to tick a few boxes on my Christmas Foodie list - Carton sell beautifully packaged boxes of 4 jams, chutneys, preserves etc for just 26 Euro. You can mix and match the contents to suit the taste of your foodie friends.",5,2023,12,15
234,Friends night out - luxury,The suite was beautiful with a balcony. The food was amazing. We sat at the chefs table in Kathleen‚Äôs kitchen. I highly recommend the history tour with Brian. So interesting and you get to see the old house and hear all the news with Brian. Great fun. ,5,2023,12,11
234,Lovely hotel combined with first-class service ,"We booked a 3 night stay to celebrate a special birthday for my wife. At check in the receptionist( her name escapes me- extremely professional) upgraded us to a suite as she noticed the birthday celebration. Brian the Consierge gave us a brief history of the hotel as he showed us to the suite which was beautiful. After a while we realised that the heating was not working and the room was very cold. Adter moving to a smaller room on the first night,Sharon and Brian stepped in and switched us to the Autumn suite in the main house which was beautiful (and warm).
Again Brian demonstrated his extensive knowledge of the hotel and gave us a mini tour of the original house and it's history- it is gestures like this which make all the difference. 
Breakfast in Kathleens Kitchen was excellent as was dinner. We also had dinner in the Carriage House which was very good.
The staff in the hotel, in particular the ones I have mentioned are a credit to the hotel and enhance what is already a spectacular place.",5,2023,12,11
234,Delightful,"My partner and I recently stayed with family at this lovely hotel. The hotel itself is a beautiful blend of old and new with many interesting historic stories to be told. The surrounding estate and golf course are magnificent with the interior presented in tasteful and stylish design.
  My partner and I occupied a lovely room with a balcony offering delightful views of the surrounding golf course. The room itself was well appointed and exceptionally clean.
  All staff whom we encountered presented as knowledgeable and skilful in their delivery of customer service.
  Our evening meal in the Carriage House was yet another pleasing experience. The meal was well designed and executed. The restaurant was extremely busy however the layout with it's small booths afforded both comfort and privacy.
  It is evident that a hotel such as Carton House requires a cohesive and efficient team in which each individual is aware not only of their own role but that of other team members. This level of awareness both front and back of house is what brings it all together to give their guests an experience that I for one, will only be too glad to repeat.",5,2023,12,10
234,One of the best üòé,"It was just amazing ü§© the facility is great and the food was really good. I was not expecting to enjoy so much, but definitely I recommend this experience in Maymooth. The pool is a bit small but enough to enjoy. Jacuzzi is great and bed OMG. We loved üòé",5,2023,12,05

234,Beyond our wildest dreams. ,"We had a lovely girls get together to celebrate two big ROUNDY birthdays in our family. We started with afternoon tea which was amazing. So much so we had more than enough extras to take home. Some of us stayed for dinner in the Carriage House which was delicious, yummy and more. Followed by nightcaps in the main house, we would each and every one of us young and not so young would highly and I cannot stress how highly enough we would recommend Carton House. Forgot to mention our breakfast in the morning was variety beyond our wildest dreams. ",5,2023,11,26

The beautifully appointed rooms exuded luxury and comfort, providing a serene retreat after exploring the stunning grounds.

234,An Incredible Stay - Beyond 5 star ,"From the moment we arrived to the Spa we were looked after beautifully by Zvon & Kasia - so professional!
Arrival at the hotel was the most welcoming and kind, Gavin and his team are so genuine and warm. I really had the most stunning time at Carton House! ",5,2023,11,20
234,Irelands Best 5-Star Hotel ,"Always a pleasure to stay at Carton House. I went dfor a break this tome bus have stayed there on Business. Very Helpful Staff, beautiful suroundings and rooms. I've stayed at other 5-Stars in Ireland and personally none come remotely close to Carton House. ",5,2023,11,19
234,Unpleasant experience through and through,"Let‚Äôs get the good stuff out of the first because there isn‚Äôt much to say on that score. The grounds are lovely and you can go on a couple of pleasant walks around the golf course. And if golf is your thing you might want to consider it as an option. That‚Äôs it there‚Äôs not much else going for it and here‚Äôs why.

We were looking for a dog friendly hotel for an overnight stay and having stayed in several Fairmont properties on various continents where we'd had a fantastic experience this one seemed like a no brainier. This was a mistake because pets are not permitted in any of the dining spaces not even the bar. So as someone who had breakfast booked we had to take turns and eat alone while the other stayed with our dog. We couldn‚Äôt possibly leave her alone in the room as it‚Äôs a new environment and she would get anxious. No offer was made for in room dining as a reasonable compromise. And we paid 50 Euros extra for the privilege. I typically call ahead to inform hotels when we‚Äôre travelling with our dog to understand their policy. I tried ringing them several times in the lead up to our stay and got a call back only a couple of days before we were due. By then it was difficult to find a better alternative.

Now to the bit that‚Äôs the most upsetting. I have never felt so unwelcome in a hotel before. Barring exactly one member of staff the rest did not make any effort to welcome us. Most avoided any kind of eye contact and those that did only did so because they had no choice since I was speaking with them. Not one of them cracked a smile and only spoke when needed, it was purely transactional. We couldn‚Äôt help but notice that we were the only non white guests there at the time and the only staff member that genuinely greeted us was black. At breakfast, I was shown to the far end of Kathleen‚Äôs kitchen where it was dark and given a corner seat where I sat by myself in whole section. I felt very uncomfortable as if I had to kept hidden from view from the rest of the guests. Only a couple of staff were there folding napkins but again no conversation, no one to check if I needed anything. It was awful and I left as soon as I could and my other skipped breakfast altogether after I told him how uncomfortable it was. Meanwhile other guests could sit wherever they wanted, they were given a choice, and they were all in the brighter parts of the dining area.

We also had an issue with our bill, they added 126 euros for a spa treatment that we never took.

Fairmont need to look at this closely both from an incompetence perspective and the subtle racism.

Needless to say we will not be returning.",1,2023,11,19
234,Fabulous Stay - will definitely be back!,Had a fabulous overnight stay with our kids during the Halloween break. We had lunch in Kathleen's Kitchen and dinner in the Carriage House. The food was amazing and we loved that the kids menu had a variety of options. Definitely the nicest lamb dish I've had in a long time!! The main house is really special with amazing stucco work on the ceiling and walls. It's worth staying just to have breakfast in the Morrison/Gold room! The kids loved the pool and they also had a movie playing for them in the evening which was nice. Didn't have time to try any activites on the estate but we will definitely be back to sample the fine dining in the Morrison room. Thanks for a wonderful stay!!,5,2023,11,17
234,Amazing stay ,"The hotel was amazing, Selina Rooney & Ana Walsh treated us with the highest standards. Our trip was brilliant from start to finish, the food, room and all the staff were beyond what we expected. 10/10 from us ",5,2023,11,16
234,Halloween family stay,"As a family we booked 2 nights over Halloween at Carton House.  We had a lovely check in where our kids were presented  with treat bags filled games, maps and colouring pencils. We ate breakfast, lunch and dinner and the food was excellent. Unfortunately we didn‚Äôt make it to the fine dining restaurant for dinner but both mornings we had breakfast and it was fantastic. There was a small issue with our room and we had to transfer late at night to another which wasn‚Äôt a problem. All the staff were very friendly and a big thank you to Kian who sent my sons down to us in Killarney after he left it in our room. I would definitely recommend this hotel and we look forward to returning again.",5,2023,11,15
234,Disappointing Christmas 2022,"Carton House is a beautiful hotel with superb grounds and amenities. This is what drew me to booking our family Christmas there last year. We are an adult family of 5. My daughter married last year and her husband was joining us, his first Christmas away from his family. Therefore, we wanted it to be special. The brochure stated that Christmas Eve dining would be in The Carriage House. It ended up being a buffet of very average food in a soulless function room. The staff, I think many of whom,  were brought in from abroad, were young and inexperienced with very little english. We felt sorry for them as they were obviously out of their depth. Our preference for Christmas Day dinner was offered to us when I was booking. I reserved The Morrison Room which was confirmed. My daughter and I specifically picked our table in The Morrison Room for our dinner after breakfast on Christmas morning. We were a bit concerned after the Christmas Eve offering. We were assured that all was in order and our choice was noted and confirmed. When we arrived to eat our chosen table was occupied by other guests. On enquiring why, were were ushered into a totally different area and a round unsteady table was made hurriedly in front of us behind the restaurant entrance. We had chosen a lovely booth with a view of the grounds. We did not want to make a fuss complaining as our son in law was with us and we did not want to ruin Christmas. The food given to guests later in the evening arrived on a tower which consisted of inedible dried up sandwiches. We were told that there was nothing else available, food wise. We did mention our disappointment to the young girl at reception on checking out. I contacted the hotel, on our return home, stating our disappointment and I got the offering of a good rate for my next stay. No explanation for the change of venue for dining on Christmas Eve or the poor standard of food and inexperienced staff. My husbands follow up email has yet to receive a response. Christmas at Carton House is a big expense. It was bitterly disappointing. It is such a pity as it is a beautiful hotel. I do recommend that any of you considering Christmas there this year get clarification as to what exactly their offering is for their guests.",2,2023,11,12
234,Weekend away ,"Great is a fantastic hotel and where the facilities are excellent. However dinning experience was a big let down. You expect to pay a little more considering the reputation of the hotel which is fine, but the quality and choice on the menus was poor. ",3,2023,11,07
234,Didnt appear to have the finesse of other 5 star hotels in Ireland ,"In general this is a lovely hotel... There were lots of things that we loved; beautiful grounds, dinner in the Carriage House was amazing, lobby bar service was super, rooms were spotless... but breakfast was chaotic.

We were booked into the Morrison Room but we were told that the chefs were very behind and we should consider going to Kathleen's kitchen or be prepared to wait quite a while for our breakfast.

We went to Kathleen's Kitchen and it was a disaster and such a disappointment. No- one was available to manage the room, food not being replenished, many guests walking around looking for stuff, tables not being cleared. 

This was our first time visiting this hotel as we normally go between the KClub and Powerscourt and if I'm honest I'm not sure I would return.
 ",4,2023,11,07
234,Special mention to Jack,"Fantastic 2 night stay from start to finish. Rooms clean, spacious and really comfortable. 

Some of the most friendliest staff we have ever encountered. Special mention to Jack from the service he provided in Kathleens kitchen to the drinks service in the courtyard bar he really made our trip more enjoyable. ",5,2023,11,07
234,Absolutely Perfect,"Just returned from a night in Carton House. Genuinely loved it! The hotel is immaculate, and the room in the old house was perfection. We ate in Kathleen‚Äôs Kitchen and the food was beautiful. The one thing that stood out though was the staff, everyone was so attentive and nothing was a problem, the team in the Carriage House, Kathleen‚Äôs Kitchen and reception were all so friendly, even the chefs in the open kitchen made our experience amazing. Special thanks to Gavin and the team in Kathleen‚Äôs kitchen who looked after us so well.",5,2023,11,05
234,Planning On Returning!!,Such an enjoyable 2 night stay at Carton House. Anne was the lady who checked us is in an in the course of our stay we interacted with about 35 staff - every single one were so courteous and client focussed. The food was just amazing - would highly recommend breakfast in the Morrison Room - give yourself loads of time as there is so much to enjoy. We had lunch in the Carriage Restaurant- divine. We had both dinner in Kathleen‚Äôs kitchen on our first night and the fine dining experience in The Morrison Room. An absolute pleasure from beginning to end.  I don‚Äôt think a piece of dust is allowed settle anywhere in the large building - it is spotless. I enjoyed all the nooks and cranny‚Äôs and materials that were used in the decorating of the house - it feels like a much loved hotel. Can not wait to return - both with friends and with our kids - I just loved my stay. I‚Äôve been in many of the Fairmont hotels in Canada - Carton House is  unique for me as the level of customer service definitely exceeds anything I experienced there - it was always positive but this is superb! ,5,2023,11,05
234,Beautiful venue for a getaway,"Great stay from start to finish, from Brian on arrival to checkout, we couldn‚Äôt have wanted for anything, We were on a family break away and some of us played golf, a truly magnificent course and wonderful surroundings. We had dinner in The Carriage House, we were a large party and the service to us all was excellent throughout the night, we retired back to the hotel bar for a night cap and again couldn't have wanted for anything more. Breakfast was delicious, we opted for the setting of Kathleens Kitchen and the buffet catered for everyones tastes, the barista on hand to supply the coffees was a lovely touch! Before checkout we were lucky enough to get a tour of the house, Harry who lead the tour was so knowledgeable and really passionate about the house and the history behind it! All in all a magnificent stay and we are looking to make it an annual tradition moving forward! ",5,2023,11,01
234,A dream of a place!,"Incredible place, an unforgettable stay (2 nights in the main house) Carton House is rich in history and it has been carefully renovated and curated, most features are original and it has been tastefully and elegantly interior designed, a wonderful job done by the Fairmont group and the teams they chose to do this massive project. Very impressed.
We were lucky to also have gorgeous mild weather!",5,2023,10,31
234,Wonderful escape to fairytale location,"Two nights in one of Ireland‚Äôs most exceptional buildings, restored beautifully with sensitivity and elegance. Wonderful food, ate at the Carriage House and at the Chef‚Äôs table in Kathleen‚Äôs Kitchen. Many special touches including the Head Chef checking in after our meal, a fun and fact filled tour of the house and 6km sunny walk in the grounds.",5,2023,10,27
234,Breathtaking venue and attention to detail,"A wonderful experience from start to finish, We recently stayed overnight as an extended family and were blown away by the attention to detail and service we were shown from start to finish.
The team at reception and the welcoming team ensured all our luggage was placed in our rooms and check in was a straight forward process, Brian at the front desk was particularly attentive to us all and made sure we were all very comfortable.
Following a drink and afternoon tea we attended the carriage house for dinner, the service again was exceptional, given it was a very busy night for the restaurant and bar as there was a big rugby match on TV we were never left waiting for food or drink. Our waiter made sure everyone was happy and enjoying their night, he was exceptional in his attention to detail on dietary requirements around food.
We had a lovely room overlooking the golf course and the room was very clean and warm.
Our breakfast the following morning again was a beautiful experience, all the food was prepared fresh in front of our eyes and we had multiple options of where we wanted to sit, there was also an option to order off a menu if we didn't want the buffet option.
Finally, before our departure we were taken on a tour of the House, having no real knowledge of the history of the House I was blown away by the detail Harry went into on the history of the house with us, learning about royal family members who stayed there and how there are many underground tunnels some of which are still accessible and the Whisky room was a particular favourite of mine.
Some family members played golf and said the course was in incredible condition.
Can't wait to come back again and stay for a longer time this time!!",5,2023,10,25
234,5 * Plus ,"Just home from a fantastic one night stay with my husband and my husbands family. This was a family visit to celebrate my father in law's 70th Birthday. It was a fabulous night away filled with great memories and delicious food. From the moment we arrived until we left it was a 5 star experience. Staff went  above and beyond to make us feel very welcome. Brian the concierge is an absolute gem, anything we needed or asked for, Brain and his team were on it they could not have done enough for us. The hotel, food and facilities are outstanding. We went for a lovely walk around the most beautiful well kept gardens. The Swimming pool and Spa area are absolutely perfect. Every staff member we met was friendlier than the next and could not do more for us! I would like to particularly thank Harry the sales manager and Phillipe the bar manager who went above and beyond for our party.  Definitely one of the best, if not the best hotels that I've stayed in. We are already planning to return in January. 
",5,2023,10,25
234,Impeccable 5*+,"Absolutely impeccable service and staff could not do enough for you. In particularly Selina at Reception. She is an absolute credit to the Fairmont Group, wonderful greeting and has gone out of her way to make our stay fantastic. The bar staff including Anna were fantastic too. We still here now as decided to stay another night with it being so good‚Ä¶ Chef Abi is amazing and his food in Kathleen‚Äôs Kitchen is second to none. Brilliant atmosphere and truest a wonderful place to stay. 
Beautiful surroundings, fabulous staff and impeccable 5***** experience. From the minute you walk through the door and you smell the fragrance to the beautiful walk around the golf courses with the dogs it‚Äôs breath taking. We have both stayed in the highest end hotels all over the world and this is one that is up there if not my favourite. Thank you to all the staff at the Carlton Fairmont Dublin. We are looking forward to another night here tonight :) Aim√©e and Andrew ",5,2023,10,24
234,Very disappointing.,"I'm not used to staying in 5 star hotels but I was disappointed with this experience. There are basic issues around breakfast time in terms of seating, availability of coffee and tea, and the clearing of empty tables. This is something I haven't seen in other 3/4 star hotels, let alone 5. The pool is disappointing in terms of space and the steam room floor was dirty. Carpets need replacing in many parts, particularly on the way to the spa. The hotel is going for luxury, but the only 'extra' effort I noticed was a hot hand towel at reception, which really just felt off. You are offered a cardboard carton of water at reception and in your rooms, but then are charged 8 euro for water bottled at dinner time. So it is more expensive to provide bottled water in Ireland of all places, than a pint of imported beer. This really felt like extortion, in fact it is extortion, with no option of tap water suggested by the waiter. Which we certainly would have went for. All in all, it was a 3 star experience, in a 5 star location with 5 star prices. I wouldn't recommend to any of my friends or family to stay over there and we are local enough to the hotel. And hope this review is a warning to the management of the hotel and irish and oversees guests, that they may not get bang for their (many) bucks.

Just on the bottled water, it was specially bottled for carton house somewhere down the country and provided in a glass bottle. From experience in the sector these are the type of bottles that are sent back to the bottling company to be refilled, which is good for the environment. The water was not particularly tasty but if someone wants to pay for this, fair enough. The issue is that we were asked did we want water for the table, not did we want to pay almost 1 euro per 100mls. 

Get rid of this policy of pushing this water to guests, it only serves for them to feel ripped off and begin to notice the other failures.",3,2023,10,20
234,Great overnight stay ,"We stayed in garden room for one night and it was a fantastic treat for us, we had beautiful burgers for lunch in the Carriage House and then dinner in Kathleen's....loved the view of chefs cooking and finished off with cocktails in the bar and  sleeping in a massive comfy bed! We will definitely return.",5,2023,10,16
234,Parents on tour,"Stayed here with my parents last week, love this place but all the extra small touches and care taken with my parents was beyond touching! They loved the tour of the house and hearing the tales of Queen Victoria's rooms, the food, service, personable approach of the team and cocktails went down a treat!",5,2023,10,16
234,Fantastic place,"Fantastic place with an amazing atmosphere. Very high standard of the rooms. Top-notch service. Polite and friendly staff. The breakfast was fantastic.

The staff, all the staff, are amazing, so friendly and helpful and you are treated like minor royalty! I was delighted to be upgraded to a beautiful room, the Ogilvy Room, in the main house which was stunning in every way, spacious, luxurious and decadent. Having a facial and using the facilities at the spa such as the jacuzzi and sauna really helped me to relax and I also so enjoyed running in the grounds every morning before the amazing breakfast which is 7 star in every way! Thank you so much to everyone at Carton House for such a wonderful stay! I would thoroughly recommend this hotel for a relaxing, pampering and rejuvenating break.",5,2023,10,01

On our last night we had a real treat in the Morrison Room, fine dining at its best, beef tartar, scallop ceviche, veal sweetbreads, BBQ mackerel, wild turbot brilliant menu all absolutely amazing, the champagne sauce served with the Turbot was one of the nicest sauces we ever tasted, the new head chef Adam Nevin is doing a super job definitely up there with one of the best meals we ever had, we will definitely return",5,2023,09,21
234,1st trip to Ireland,The hotel is stunning and the service and friendly nature of the staff was so welcoming. We enjoyed all 3 of the dinning experiences the hotel has to offer and found the different styles and atmospheres to be rewarding. A special mention has to be made of the fine dining in the Morrison Rooms. The skill of the chef and the service and care from the dinning room team was exceptional. An absolutely delightful experience and one my wife and I would love to repeat.,5,2023,09,20
234,A Memorable Place,Everything there is 1st class and you are treated royally. The grounds are meticulously maintained and walking in early morning feels like you are in another world. This is a must place for anyone who loves golf and wants to escape it all. ,5,2023,09,20
234,A fabulous experience start to finish - can‚Äôt wait to go back ,"We enjoyed a fabulous escape to Carton House at the end of August. We arrived to a haven of calm and a beautifully appointed room with super king size bed. The lovely atmosphere at the bar was perfect for a Friday evening aperitif before we had the most spectacular meal by Bech-Bailey in the stunning Morison room . We retired for a night cap to the well stocked Whiskey Library for a super tasting with the very knowledgable Richard. After a super nights sleep , the breakfast was just what the doctor ordered - very tasty and great service. It‚Äôs so close to Dublin and surrounds and it feels like a different world - perfect for a quick escape or longer stay. ",5,2023,09,19
234,Cancelled flight,"After our flight was cancelled we returned to Carton House and the staff went above and beyond to help myself and the group I was with.

The food was excellent throughout whether it was breakfast in the stunning Morrison room or dinner in the Carriage house or Kathleen‚Äôs kitchen.
Service is professional and friendly and pitched at just the right level.
Would highly recommend.",5,2023,09,04
234,Warm welcome after a stressful evening,"After a nightmare at the airport with cancelled flights and no more hotels available for us with Aer Lingus, we were able to book a room with Carton House.
When we arrived we were met with a warm welcome and a swift check in. The night staff could not do enough for us, they even had a pizza and chips sent to the room for us as we hadn't eaten.
The room itself was beautiful and immaculate with ample space for 2 people. The bed was a luxurious queen, a well welcomed sight for 2 tired travellers. 
The hotel had pre-booked a taxi for us as we had to be back at the airport early which was ready and waiting for us when we came down.
Even though our stay was short we will definitely stay here again in the future to experience everything Carton House has to offer.",5,2023,08,31

234,Wonderful hospitality at the fantastic Carton House.,"We experienced wonderful hospitality at the fantastic Carton House. Driving in via the long avenue, amidst golfing nirvana. Parking up and sidling up to main reception to be met by the charming greeting of Terry Moore. Terry walked us through the old house towards our lunch appointment at the plush yet relaxed Carriage House (golf clubhousebof sorts).
I feasted on a sumptuous chowder with a main of steak sandwich and truffle fries. Afters of lemon and lime cheesecake. My other half enjoyed a super good salad with chicken and broccoli side. Then through to the Courtyard Bar for some elegant piano and accompanying live singer.
A complimentary local Rye River IPA with gratis roast beef canape. Accompanied by a tasty flat white.

Tremendous.",5,2023,08,18
234,5 star physical hotel but lacking in management !,"Let me start with the positives :
Physical hotel ; gardens and golf course excellent .
Here are things that happened : 
1. Orders a salad on the menu ( trio ) which attracted us as it had crab. We were onky advised when it was ready to serve that there was no crab ! ‚Äò Scampi‚Äô eventually replaced it ( complimentary ). It was cooked jumbo prawns although in Ireland they should be Langoustines ? tried and left them . Is this expected in a 5 star hotel ? 
2. Ordered wine from the my menu in the restaurant ( after reviewing it fir 10 minutes ) and I my then told they do not  have the selected wine ! The meal service was erratic with clearly untrained or not instructed or monitored staff . Is this expected in 5 star hotel ? 
3. Called reception ( no 5 ) and not answered . Is this 5 star service ? 
4. The bar couldn‚Äôt make a ‚Äòspicy margarita ‚Äò as they did not have the ingredients ?? Incre√≠ble in a 5 star hotel ? 
5. Were looking forward to the jacuzzi onky to find it was ‚Äòdown for maintenance‚Äô . Never advised . Is this expected in a 5 star hotel ? 
6. The main shower in men‚Äôs changing room not working . Is that expected in a 5 star hotel ? 
7. Although not directly affecting us an elevator in another part of hotel had sign ‚Äò closed for maintenance‚Äô. Is this expected in a 5 star hotel ? 

I hace written reports on almost 400 places worldwide so take my comments as objective . In summary the hotel staff were all pleasant but on most occasions ( particularly in restaurants ) were clearly not instructed / trained & particularly not monitored by the management in standards expected for A 5 star hotel .",3,2023,08,11
234,Wonderful stay at Carton House,"Excellent and courtesy staff at all times happy to meet any need or answer any questions! The hotel and property were excellent for walking and running, two trails and other paved areas. Easy access to Liffey River Canal for walking or running. Indoor pool spa, sauna and gym available.

Most of which are in the new part of the hotel. Ground are lovely and beautifully maintained. All in all a most enjoyable few days was had, I‚Äôll hopefully be back.",5,2023,08,04
234,"Beautiful hotel, great service but we had to move room because of non-working air conditioning ","From the moment we checked in we experienced fabulous service from everyone we encountered. Everyone was so friendly and helpful. The hotel and the grounds were stunningly beautiful and I loved the running routes, even in the pouring rain! One issue we had though was how hot the room was. We had put the air conditioning on when we arrived and when the room had not cooled down a couple of hours later I rang reception and asked them for a fan. They rang back to tell me that the air conditioning was not working on the second floor where we were and that they had no fans available but that they hold move us to a room on the first floor, where the air conditioning was working. We agreed to move, however although the air conditioning sounded like it was working the room never actually got any cooler and the warmth of the room definitely affected how well we slept. Also the room we were moved too wasn‚Äôt quite as nice (although I was told it was a better room before I agreed to move) as our original room as it didn‚Äôt have a bath (and I was so looking forward to a relaxing bath), there was no full length mirror in the room, one window didn‚Äôt open and overall the room wasn‚Äôt quite as lux as the one we‚Äôd left. That being said we had a really nice stay, breakfast was fabulous and we‚Äôd definitely return. I just wish we‚Äôd had a room with working air conditioning - and a bath tub!",5,2023,08,03
234,Over night stop,"Main hotel has been refurbished and looks good .. our hotel experience was first class , we went to the carriage club house for tea , food here was average, the service let it down especially with a 10% service charge made me feel short changed.. breakfast was excellent.. recommend a visit",4,2023,07,31
234,Fairytale wedding in the amazing Carton House,"We had our wedding in Carton House on the 1st of July 2023. We have to say that from the planning to the day itself all the team in Carton were amazing and made us feel like we were the only guests in the world.
It is almost impossible to put down in words the level of service that the team in Carton House provided us and all out guests. And even more impossible to list all the members of the Carton House family that helped us before and during the day.
We started working with Claire Byrne from Carton House 13 months before our wedding and to say she is a true professional seems to undersell her skills and capabilities. She was more like our ‚Äúfairy godmother‚Äù taking us by the hand through all the stages of the wedding, helping us pick some of our suppliers, advising us on things we had never even thought of.
Before the big day we had loads of questions and Claire was always on the end of a phone or email to provide a super-fast response putting us at ease. Claire made our wedding the true fairytale that we wanted.
On the day itself, she took full control and made sure that everyone was aligned to our timings. If anything went wrong, we certainly never knew about it and it was just managed behind the scenes.
As well as Claire, we have to call out the amazing food, service, staff in this fairytale location. We had looked at a number of other prestigious locations in Kildare for our Wedding, but Carton House made it impossible for us to choose anywhere else.
A special thanks to Naz & Katie from the banqueting team , Kate from Food & beverages, Anna & Silana on reception, Loki from the concierge team, Ellen, Gavin, Orla in the pantry and the lovely Se√°n in the bar.

It was our first visit to Ireland, and we could not have been more welcomed at this amazing resort, just outside of Dublin. The staff was amazing, starting with Marie McFadden, leader of the Front Office team, and Brian Sutton, Concierge, who provided a personal tour of the property. Brian's storytelling talent and history of the former private residence was a highlight of our holiday. It was an easy walk into Maynooth, a small village and University town, with a train station for easy access to Dublin. 
We had several meals in the Carriage House, overlooking the two golf courses. The food was very good, and the service provided by Niamh, Karl and Georgia was exceptional. Breakfast in the Gold Room was amazing, with a warm greeting by name each day by Elena. We stayed in a great suite, which was very comfortable and unique in decor. Everything about our experience on property was amazing.",5,2023,07,24
234,There are no words to express how amazing this place is,"There simply are not enough words to tell you how wonderful this place is and how amazing the staff are.
Would highly recommend it to anyone and will be returning as soon as we possibly can, there really is nothing to beat this place. Selena Rooney, Brian Sutton, Marie, both Anas, Sean, the list is endless, nobody could do enough for us, nothing was too much trouble. The staff are so friendly and accommodating, the food is excellent. The accommodation is 2nd to none we arrived at this place, feeling like friends and left feeling like family, I actually had a tear in my eye as we drove away. This place really has to be seen and experienced to be believed. ",5,2023,07,24
234,Faultless!!,"We have stayed in Carton House many times in the past, this was our second stay since the refurbishment. We had availed of their July offer of b and b for ‚Ç¨270, an absolute bargain for the standard of hotel! On check in we were upgraded to a balcony room overlooking the golf course. Thank you so much! It was our first time staying in the new wing since the refurbishment. The room was beautiful, very comfortable bed and everything you need provided. The chocolates and juices were a lovely touch included in the special offer. We had lunch in the Courtyard Bar. The seafood platter was excellent! Dinner in The Carriage House also delicious. Could not fault anything. Fantastic staff throughout! Love the breakfast in the old house, especially that everything is served to you and you don‚Äôt have to be going up and down to a buffet. 

The whole experience was so relaxing and we can‚Äôt wait to return again soon!",5,2023,07,20
234,family trip to Ireland,"Fairmont has done an amazing job with the renovation of this hotel. Every mattress and fairway and chair and view and chocolate truffle and vignette is perfect. It is the quintessential resort in the Irish countryside that you have been looking for. Golf, archery, falconry, bikes, walking trails, boating, close to the villages of Manooth and Leixlip. Rugby players sitting beside you in the grandest breakfast room that I have ever been in. 
Where the hotel truly earns its five stars begins and ends with the staff. Thanks again to Marie at the front desk for making us feel more like her American relations who popped over for a visit than the strangers that we are. 
See you again soon. ",5,2023,07,17
234,"A beautiful clean, inside and outside hotel.","The room was beautiful. The staff were extremely pleasant especially John. Then the breakfast, this was out of this world. Plenty of everything. No corners cut. Plenty of staff on duty to provide first class service. This was a 10 out of 10 visit and mywife and I will be back again for a longer stay. Some hospitalities do not realise that the breakfast is a very important experience because it's the final experience that leaves a lasting impression.  congratulations to the Grand Hotel in Malahide.",5,2023,07,16
234,Can‚Äôt wait to return!,"Our stay at Carton House was excellent from start to finish. All the staff  were extremely helpful and friendly, going above and beyond to assist, particularly Maria. Our room was beautiful and we would recommend both Kathleen‚Äôs Kitchen and the Carriage House where we dined. The grounds are magnificent and definitely not to missed. Hope to be back soon!",5,2023,07,14
234,Classy and Sophisticated and Calm,"This hotel has a refined, sophisticated vibe and features excellent rooms, amenities, and customer service.  We particularly loved the way they have blended the old and new elements of the property.  It was very well done.  ",5,2023,07,13
234,Perfect escape and convenient to airport,"We had a lovely stay at the Carton House in the last two days of our trip around Ireland.  It‚Äôs a beautiful property, well maintained with excellent service, and very convenient to the airport - highly recommend for a night or two out of the city.  We had an incredible dinner at Kathleen‚Äôs Kitchen, and the staff was incredibly gracious with our children.  Breakfast each morning was delicious, and we enjoyed both a whiskey tasting and dinner in the more casual Carriage House.  We also enjoyed walking the property and renting bikes for a ride around.  Would definitely return!",5,2023,07,11
234,Not to be missed Fairmont Property! ,"I have been lucky enough to have experienced some of the finest hotels in the world. My family and I just spent an absolutely amazing time at Fairmont Carton House. It would be very hard to describe exactly how outstandingly beautiful  this property is. Think movie set from the movie 'Pride and Prejudice! On top of this, all of the staff were just so welcoming, personal and clearly proud to be part of the Fairmont team. A big shout out to Brian/ Chief Concierge who could not have been more knowledgeable and helpful, Richard/ Bar manager aka by my family as ""Leo "" who just took such great care of us every day, Rory / Carriage house Bar Tender, so passionate  about his craft and Anna, Manager of Kathleen's Kitchen who was super and so caring. My family and I left vowing to return soon and this time for as long as we possibly could!! Thank you Fairmont Carton House  and congratulations to all of the management team that are knocking it out of the ball park, you have made the short list of our top hotels!
We will be back!",5,2023,07,10

234,Thank you for an amazing stay !,"I have just returned from my 2 nights stay by this marvellous and luxurious hotel and I cannot highly recommend it for anyone who would like to get away with family or friends from the hustle and bustle life of the city. 

From arrival with being received on at the door by a lovely gentleman and being seated at the front desk with afresh hot towel is just a thing to begin with.

Anna at the front desk is an absolute gem and a real asset to the hotel; from check in to recommendations, to things to do.. wow this amazing lady is well to be groomed to a future hospitality leader 

The room was not ready till 4pm however I decided to store my bag and explore the Clonfert petting farm (which I would highly recommend)
Anna did follow up with a phone call informing me that my room was ready for check in.

The room itself is so spacious, excellent decor, fabulous amenities (complimentary toiletries, nesspresso coffee machines, complimentary still water). The beds were extremely well designed for (especially someone who has a back issue). The television had wide range of channels, Netflix, internet.  A Mini fridge in the room was a plus.

Sit back and relax on the porch side of the balcony overlooking far and wide lush golf course and nature.

Breakfast each morning was served so well, thanks to Laura in the breakfast room (I think she was the supervisor) who very well looked after my allergy requirements and exceeded to deliver an exceptional breakfast service with her staff - well done !! I would always recommend to go in for the full Irish breakfast (the menu is limited but with good choices suiting all taste buds).

The spa services were booked both days of  stay which the team followed up to secure any cancellations (tip: if you are staying at the hotel, pre book your spa services to avoid disappointments).

Terrence the concierge is a gentleman in himself with things to do in the city and options to explore the wilderness of the location , to wide and acres of golf courses with the red and yellow walks, he knew exactly what to suggest for a solo traveller 

Davidzo from housekeeping was a delight to chat with. With her friendly smile and expertise in making up my room, everything was spotless and well made. Another future hospitality personnel in her field of housekeeping management 

From check in , during my stay and on check out, every staff member was a delight to know, from great smiles and with greetings each time of the day just made it worth the trip at this colonial hotel which I would sure to be returning and recommend it to all who likes a bit of pamper and attention to details and being part of Accor Hotels mans managed by Fairmont flagship - this hotel has delivered and exceeded every aspect of my stay",5,2023,07,02
234,Outstanding 5-Star Experience,"From the moment you walk through the door at Carton House you are greeted with a warm, inviting and luxurious atmosphere. From start to finish the experience has been comfortable, welcoming and special. 

Check in is relaxed and efficient - you are seated in comfy chairs overlooking the beautiful grounds as the receptionist glides through the hotel amenities and ensures your stay is just the way you want it! 

Food is fabulous - I had a choice of multiple restaurants and dined in the Morrison Room fine dining restaurant which was colourful, delicious and full of creativity. I also dined at the Carriage House restaurant where the food was delicious and staff couldn‚Äôt be more helpful. 

The building is steeped in history and perfect for exploring during the day. The grounds are lush, green and ideal for an afternoon walk. 

What really makes Carton House special is the incredible team - every employee I encountered was happy and helpful and this is perhaps reflective of the fantastic workplace culture that exists here. 

Check out is tomorrow and I am so sad to leave but I‚Äôm feeling refreshed, energised and so happy from an outstanding and magical stay at Carton House. Cannot wait to visit again !",5,2023,07,01

234,The most stunning hotel in all of Ireland only 30 min to airport,Carton House is magnificent. Everything is so beautiful that we kept wanting to take photos. Staff brilliant. Wish I‚Äôd pre-booked Kathleen‚Äôs. Everyone enjoyed the golf and locals were thrilled that the soccer team of the north was staying for a week‚Äôs training camp. Maybe request a room that‚Äôs not too far away. It‚Äôs a huge place. A manager gave us a bit of a talk on the history of the house and the room bells. Highly recommend this place.,5,2023,06,12
234,Superb,"5 star experience..highly recommend.
Spacious room, friendly and attentive staff, spotlessly clean, beautiful grounds abd Close yo maynooth centre if you fancy a change. Great spa and wellness facilities with ample treatment offerings.",5,2023,06,06
234,Not a five star hotel,"I recently stayed the night at Carton House and I can honestly say it does not compare to some of the other upmarket 5 star hotels in ireland. 

The pros of Carton House is the fabulous grounds and some of the lovely staff members I met on our visit. The house itself is also lovely.

Firstly the room was nice but the bathroom was just basic. Our room was located far enough away from the heart of the hotel. All of the toiletries in the shower were empty. 

We dined out in the carriage house and the food wasn‚Äôt great or worth the price we paid. The prawn starter was mediocre and the sea food chowder was extremely watery. The couple down from us had the same issue.  The service here also wasn‚Äôt great from forgetting things to trying to flag someone down.

The hotel in certain areas could do with some updating and cleaning. The pool area was like a leisure centre in a gym and just full of kids jumping in and out and splashing around. I defiantly would not rate the wellness facilities of that of a 5 star. 

Carton House in my opinion is over priced and most certainly not a 5 star resort. I won‚Äôt be a returning customer.",3,2023,06,05
234,Lunch ,"Had a lovely light lunch, spiced cauliflower salad, very tasty, little on the small side compared to my mams chicken salad. Green tea & coffee never arrived with our lunch, asked different waiter who was lovely & he brought them out, no charge as we waited so long.  They've a new barista but she needs more training as green tea was undrinkable, very bitter, way too much tea leaves in pot. Ordered 2nd Americano from different waiter same thing never arrived, had to ask again, by the time it came out we were leaving. Lovely waiter Sean once again apologised. He very kindly came out as I was leaving with a complimentary pastry to have at home.  Lovely relaxed hotel & beautiful inside & out. Would have liked to sit outside but only one side of the seating area had parasols unfortunately, not sure why this is the case?? Shame as it looked fab but way too hot to sit there without some coverage from the sun. As a wheelchair user it was pretty much accessible throughout except once again the 'accessible' toilet was NOT accessible, door a ton weight, I'm guessing it's a fire door, it opened outwards, couldn't open it so my mam had to do it. Exiting was no better,  so heavy couldn't push it open, reported situation & chap (Arthur) said he was bringing it to immediate attention. Also needs an update, sink looks dirty, tilling & finishing poor for a 5* hotel.  Overall lovely hotel,  slight little blips but wouldn't put me off going back üòÅ Definitely worth a visit ",4,2023,06,05
234,Best service ever,"Was staying in the hotel this week Monday - Tuesday 
The service was impeccable Niamh made sure that I was looked after very well and was a pleasure to chat too! Would highly recommend this place based on service alone

234,"Carton House, Maynooth, Ireland","We stayed with a Martin Randall Group from 12-15th May. Lovely hotel, good food in Kathleen‚Äôs kitchen and the staff generally could not have been more helpful. We would like to highlight though the excellent service Sophie provided in Kathleen‚Äôs kitchen - she was so helpful, a lovely personality and made our stay feel that bit special. She stood out above the others and is one to keep on the staff!

234,Beautiful Hotel,"What a beautiful hotel. I felt relaxed from the minute I walked in. The atmosphere is immediately luxurious and calming. The staff were very friendly and welcoming and I enjoyed chatting to them. The bedroom was gorgeous and absolutely spotless and the bed was so comfy! We had a lovely meal in Kathleen‚Äôs Kitchen, the food was gorgeous and the atmosphere was casual and relaxed but the staff were so attentive. We went on to have the most gorgeous cocktails in the bar. The dining room where the breakfast is served is exquisite. I could have sat there all day. Can‚Äôt wait to go back! ",5,2023,05,23
234,Coffee at its finest,It‚Äôs hard to find suitable spaces to meet clients outside a formal meeting room. We used Carton house for a business catch up. Lovely comfortable spaces to have conversations in. The staff are very attentive and the coffee is supreme. Ideally located beside the n4 for people working in the greater Dublin area. ,5,2023,05,23
234,An Irish Gem ,"The Carton House Fairmont is the most beautiful hotel we have ever stayed at; period. A stunning country manor with incredible views, exceptional restaurants, beautiful rooms and a 
World class bar. The history of the property just adds to its unique story.
Brian and his concierge team are exceptional; Fairmont has figured out ‚ÄúHire Great People and Treat them Like Family‚Äù
The bonus was playing the O‚ÄôMeira Golf Course with the beauty of Ireland at its best.
Truly a spectacular property!! ",5,2023,05,22
234,Genuine 5 Star Experience,"Beautiful setting and magnificent original Great Irish House. The grounds are immaculate, the public rooms so impressive - you really feel this is a treat. The staff were first class - in particular we appreciated the friendly and professional service from Sophie when we dined at Kathleen's Kitchen throughout the three nights of our stay.
On my hit list for a return visit.",5,2023,05,21
234,5 out of 5,Stayed in the carton house recently! Loved our stay the room was spacious and facilities were great! Went down for food in the restaurant beside the main bar and was served by lady call Anna. Anna was great and couldn‚Äôt do enough for us that day! Credit to the hotel! We were also looked after by Marie I think at reception who was also lovely and pleasant. Overall we really enjoyed out stay.,5,2023,05,14
234,Terrific property,"This is a superb facility offering comfortable, spacious rooms and a varirty of activities for all. A couple of caveats: Kathleen's kitchen, touted as a place to eat where the original kitchen reigned is mediocre at best, with less than adequate, competent service, bland dishes, and over priced alcoholic beverages. the better alternative is the Morrison Room which is beautifully appointed and obviously got the better chef options. A real delight in a Michelin striving restaurant. The other is for those who like to use the exerciose treadmills. They are a real hot mess that will frustrate the evryday exercise person.
Otherwise a delightful facility.",5,2023,05,11
234,Luxury from start to finish,"Carton house truly exceeds one‚Äôs expectations. The moment we entered (6 in our group)the ambience was fabulous, greeted with a warm welcome and the staff couldn‚Äôt do enough for us and this theme was continuous through out our stay. We had our dinner that night in Catherine‚Äôs kitchen. It was low lighting, cosy , great wines on offer, service was excellent so attentive and the food was delectable! The morning we were checking out we had our breakfast booked , I can honestly say it was an experience in itself the room is nostalgic and so beautiful! Table service which was phenomenal special requests catered for and so obliging. I cannot fault this hotel on anything including the golf course the grounds and the staff couldn‚Äôt do enough for you .it is a truly special place! A truly luxury experience.",5,2023,05,05
234,Not 5-Star,"I arrived around 4.30pm to meet someone in the bar/lobby area. I asked for a sandwich and was told that no food is served between 4pm and 5.30pm. I found this hard to believe as I never encountered this in a 5-star hotel before. I asked the girl working in the bar to check for me and she returned after some time to say it was not possible to do anything for me. I  stayed in the K-Club recently and it was possible to order food throughout the day. It was the same in all other hotels I have stayed in. The offering at Carton House is not 5-star, unfortunately. ",1,2023,05,05
234,12/10 ‚≠êÔ∏è,"What a wonderful weekend spent in Carton House.
From the moment we arrived we were greeted with massive, warming smiles. We were checked in by a gentle man at front of desk named Arthur. He was full of knowledge and helped get us booked in for breakfast and our evening meal.
We had Spa treatments and the girls in the Spa were so friendly! Linda looked after our treatments and to say she was kind, professional and friendly would be an understatement. 
The food we consumed at breakfast, lunch in the Carriage house and dinner in Kathleen‚Äôs Kitchen was gorgeous.
Our fave being the Thai Red Curry! *chef kiss
The rooms were spacious, the bed comfy and the house keeping staff were lovely.
The front of desk supervisor, Selina always greeted us with big smiles. She was extremely helpful in anything we needed and even provided us with fresh bottles of water when heading off to bed!
I cannot wait to return! It was most definitely a weekend to remember and one of my favourite getaways yet!
A 5 star review for a 5 star experience.
Thanks to every staff member who we met and we are looking forward to seeing you soon.

234,"Disappointing customer service , lack of attention to detail wedding","Stayed in April for a wedding. Gorgeous venue. The staff team particularly the porters, the wedding coordinators on the day that had to stand in were so friendly and helpful.
 Few things at the wedding were disappointing,  wedding coordinator called in sick and then there was then a lack of important detail such as getting the newly weds names wrong on the welcome sign for breakfast. They had the brides surname only.
We were placed in a room where the bath did not work. 
A gift bag with jewlerry  went missing from the bridal suite in between us leaving to go down for the ceremony and the evening when I returned to collect bridesmaid possesions. Despite 2 emails to the hotel I have yet to get an acknowledgement.

Other members of the family/bridal party recieved a turn down service with chocolates however no such thing on our floor. Food was very average in bars,  
Corridor between rooms and spa was filthy with dust balls.

Pool was very clean however.",3,2023,05,01

And even though check in time is 3 to o‚Äôclock Marie was able to get us a room right away even though they had just had a full house. Also on the front desk a young lady named Olivia was always at her best Smiling and helpful. And then there‚Äôs Brian! The concierge of concierges!! He was terrific and  so knowledgeable of the history of Carton House..
Breakfast each morning was absolutely delicious and Kate the hostess with the mostest!
Our whole experience a Carton House was five star. I would recommend it highly to anyone wanting to enjoy a five-star experience. Your staff has had the best training and it shows in every step‚Ä¶..

234,"Wined dined, golf and spa - fantastic.","Stayed just before St Patrick‚Äôs weekend and had a fantastic time!  Amazing building with a unique mix of modern and old design, all set within fantastic grounds. 
My wife is pregnant so it was a perfect for a stroll around the grounds and she had a very good pregnancy massage in the spa whilst I was golfing on the O‚ÄôMeara.  
Nice open course with absolutely stunning holes 14-16 around the water. Stunning courtyard area for the clubhouse and great shop.  The bar/restaurant in there, the Carriage House, was a real highlight. An excellent spot for food/drinks/watching sports. 
We also did the 7-course tasting menu in The Morrison Room, with wine tasting for one.  Stunning room and an experience we would highly recommend! 
Overall fantastic stay with Irish hospitality as you would expect! 

Staff were fantastic throughout. Very attentive and nothing was too  much trouble. ",5,2023,03,27
234,Best Afternoon Tea,"My daughter and myself had a lovely afternoon tea at Carton House Hotel, Maynooth, Kildare today, served by lovely, pleasant, and attentive staff members.    The hotel is beautiful and the outdoor areas are just magical and very relaxing to just walk about.  We were very impressed by this hotel and will plan for my husband to play a game of golf here and maybe have an overnight stay.  Well worth a visit!  Thank you to all at Carton House Hotel.",5,2023,03,25
234,First Class Hotel in every way! ,"My wife and I booked a 3 nights stay to celebrate my 65th birthday (13th March) and our 35th wedding anniversary (9th Jan). We booked a Fairmont Balcony King but were delighted to be be offered a free upgrade to a suite for our stay (which was off-peak).

The suite was excellent - bed comfy, room quiet, lovely balcony, restful lounge, great TVs, nice coffee machine etc. It was at the end of the corridor in the new bedroom block and so a long walk to the restaurants at the other end of the hotel, but that was no problem as it's good to be able to walk off the extra calories!

The breakfasts were amazing and the luxury and ambience of the old Morrison Room and Gold Room was exceptional. The Carriage Room was relaxed for our evening meals and the food there excellent too, without being too pricey. (The Morrison Room tasting menu is extremely expensive). The steak was perhaps just a little bit too salty for our taste, but that's our only negative. The service in all the restaurants was excellent.

The front office staff were all brilliant. Brian the concierge gave us a lovely tour of the old house, explaining the history which was fascinating. Marie and the team at the reception were just wonderful - very helpful, always cheerful, and they all enjoyed a bit of Irish humour too! Overall, I'd say I have NEVER encountered better service anywhere (and I have been to 30+ countries)!

We didn't try out the spa, however it looked fine. We did enjoy a short 3 km ride around the ground on pushbikes which we got free from the golf shop. That was lovely. 
Another highlight was bumping into the Irish rugby team who just happened to be staying in the same hotel on our last night! Overall, an exceptionally wonderful short break in an absolutely brilliant hotel - we will definitely be back!",5,2023,03,16
234,Pure 5 Star experience,"Just spend a lovely night enjoying Carton house with some friends. From the minute you walk up to the main door and you meet the concierge team, you know it has a different feel to most places.  The entire team from start to finish were all amazing, really professional and descreetly knew when to approach guests.  The room was fabulous. The restaurant, Kathleen's kitchen turned out the most amazing dishes, and the breakfast the following morning which we enjoyed in our room was just top notch. The menu had every choice possible on it.  Unfortunately we didnt get to enjoy the leisure facilities as we had to leave early but I definitely look forward to another night there again. I did walk away thinking whatever Carton house are doing, it is right! The culture seems to radiate around the hotel so well done .",5,2023,03,07
234,Missing Engagement Ring - Unhelpful during a stressful time after a wedding,"Sigh! I‚Äôve been mulling over leaving this review but it‚Äôs been a few months now and my experience here is still not sitting right with me.

My fianc√© and I attended a two day wedding at Carton House last month. However, it wasn‚Äôt until the day after we got home I realised I had misplaced my engagement ring. Being 9 months pregnant, I had noticed my hands swelling up and my ring had felt uncomfortable. Worried it wouldn‚Äôt come off, I had considered taking it off, but I couldn‚Äôt remember if I had or not.

I searched my house top to bottom including all of my hospital and labour bags to no avail. I wrote down where I had been and the last place I definitely remembered having it was in the hotel room at Carton House. I called reception to see if a ring had been found and I was abruptly put through to the lost and found, there wasn‚Äôt anything handed in from when the room was turned over by the cleaners. I was distraught at this stage and in a best effort to find the ring my finese and I jumped in the car to travel the hour to the hotel to retrace my steps from when I last definitely had the ring.

Upon getting to the hotel, I explained the situation to the lady at front of house. A ring had been found! Amazing! I provided photos of my ring to see if it was it but it wasn‚Äôt mine. 
My aim was to retrace my steps, in the clubhouse and gardens and I asked could I access the room we stayed in on Saturday night to look for the ring myself for my own peace of mind. The lady seemed empathetic to my situation, at this stage I was quite upset given the rollercoaster of finding out a ring had been found mixed with pregnancy hormones. At this stage another lady from reception joined us and we were told the cleaners would have down a through job and that there guests staying in the room which meant we couldn‚Äôt get access. We didn‚Äôt want to cause a fuss or put other guests out by asking for access to the room, although on reflection others might have requested this approach. I retraced my steps as best I could in the clubhouse and garden. Upon leaving the two lady‚Äôs at reception asked did we have any joy and wished me luck to find the ring. 

The next morning I emailed the hotel again to see when the guests from our room were checking out and could we get access to the room, no response. I called reception and was abruptly put through to lost and found again, upon explaining the situation and asking to see if I could access the room, the gentleman checked the system and informed me that no guests were currently in the room we had stayed in since we had left. I honestly was shocked, given I had been blatantly lied to by reception that there were guests in the room. They knew that I, a paying guest only a few days prior and nine months pregnant had travelled the two hour round trip the evening before. We got in the car to drive to the hotel, this time to gain access to the room and to question why we hadn‚Äôt been given access to the room in the first place. The fob off answer we got initially from the lady at reception was because it was policy, however this was not explained to us at the time and as such we would have questioned it given the circumstances and called for a manager. We finally got access to the room to search it. While I realised that the chance of finding it was slim to none, my finese did discover a golf ball down the side of the chair I had been sitting on. A perfect illustration of why I wanted to personally check the room myself rather than rely on the once over by the cleaners.

We now spoke to a manager and explained all of the above. He couldn‚Äôt give a rationale as to why we had been treated this way and agreed that we should have been given access to the room in the first place. He apologised and assured us he would follow up with us a few days later. I haven‚Äôt heard anything since.",1,2023,03,04
234,Amazing stay in Carton House!1,"From the moment our stay began, everything was perfect. We were greeted at the door by Terrance.  My family and I ate lunch in the Carriage House last Saturday, we watched the rugby match. There was a great atmosphere, food was delish. We shared seafood platters and some starters. The food was so lovely, drinks were great. The team was fantastic and looked after us all so well, Grace, Mia, Emily, and Emma and the cocktails were great. Bartenders Conor and Alexander were great.

 We then checked into our room, Ciara, Martyna, Lucy, and Ryan were all so helpful.. Our room was lovely with a courtyard at the back, looking across the golf courses and the rose garden in the distance.

 We dined in Kathleen's kitchen that evening. We were looked after extremely well, and both the food and service were fantastic. The food was amazing, we were told it was a new menu and the choices were fantastic. We had a selection of starters, the carpaccio, chicken soup, terrine, and salmon, Followed by main courses, lamb, ricotta dumplings, and market fish, all so flavorsome, creative, and mouthwatering.  
We were treated to a selection of desserts, a chocolate bomb, cheese and raspberry, and custard tart.  The entire team in Kathleens was fantastic, thank you to Nicole, Davis, Eunice, Sophie, and Ian. Hats off to the Chefs Derick and his team

We returned to the bar and enjoyed a few more cocktails, made by Swanny and Cillian, and a big thank you to waitress Lylia she was great.

Breakfast was the icing on the cake. We were brought into the Morrison room, the room itself is breathtaking, we were sat with a view of the gardens, and the menu was great so much to choose from. We had a beautiful breakfast stand with a selection of fresh pastries, and bread, I had eggs royale which was beautiful and my mum had the avocado on toast. Breakfast was flawless, Mark looked after us so well. Thank you to the entire team at Carton for making our stay so special.We all hope to return soon.",5,2023,03,01
234,Stay at Carton House,"Stayed at Carton House a few weeks ago & really enjoyed my stay. We stayed for my friends birthday & we were warmly welcomed & well looked after within the hotel, our rooms were perfect & the breakfast the next morning was amazing, quick service, a lovely meal & beautiful scenery to look out at. The staff were very pleasant and helpful & made the stay beyond enjoyable for my friends & I. I would definitely recommend this hotel to stay in if you‚Äôre looking for a relaxed and comfortable environment",5,2023,02,28
234,Fantastic stay,"Stayed here a few weeks ago, had a great time, warmly welcomed at reception, staff were very friendly to me and my friends and made the stay very enjoyable, breakfast was amazing, and the whole stay was very comfortable, would 100% recommend",5,2023,02,28
234,Birthday Stay,"Stayed at the Carton House for my birthday with friends and had the best stay. Reception staff were very welcoming, we had adjoining rooms and both were so comfortable and clean. I also received a personal birthday message in the room which I loved. The hotel itself is stunning and the grounds are beautiful. Breakfast in the Morrison room was very enjoyable and I can‚Äôt recommend Carton House enough. ",5,2023,02,28
234,Late Valentines night away,"When I was asked where I‚Äôd like to stay for valentines of course it was Carton House! We had stayed last November and I fell in love with the resort. The welcoming from the Reception team was outstanding and Selina who walked us to our room was extremely helpful and couldn‚Äôt do enough for us. The main areas are so well maintained, the place is immaculate and the room was amazing!! We were lucky to stay in the old house and what a pleasure it was. We will 100% be back soon!! Picture is of a stunning view at breakfast üòç",5,2023,02,28
234,idyllic family trip to Carton House.,"We had THE best time at Carton House recently; everything from being greeted at the door on arrival through to checkout was perfect, and made us feel like royalty. Our room was stunning, the scenery was breathtaking, and there are loads of beautiful walks to do on site. The breakfast stands were a really unexpected treat which we loved, and our dinner at Kathleen‚Äôs Kitchen was seasonal and delicious too. The kids menu was also decent, which can be hard to find in hotels of this standard! There was a kids hour at the pool which was great as it meant we weren‚Äôt worried about disturbing those there on a more relaxing retreat, and the town is only a short walk away! The staff are all really welcoming and helpful‚Ä¶
It was idyllic and we will definitely be back.",5,2023,02,24
234,A very special place,"We stayed here in December 2022 for a wedding anniversary and the hotel staff made us feel so special.  We had a beautiful room which had a lovely welcome card and some treats when we arrived.   We had a gorgeous meal in Kathleen's Kitchen where we could observe all the food preparation.   Breakfast was served in a stunning room and we had lunch in the Carriage House after a bike ride and a swim.  The accommodation, food and general amenities are 5 star but the service won our hearts.  Everyone is so personable and you really felt like they wanted you to have the best time.",5,2023,02,19
234,Five star experience,Couldn't recommend the hotel enough from check in with Martyna and Flora to checking out with Ciara they were so friendly quick and very efficient with helping me make all dining reservation and answering any questions I had. From the get go they all went above and beyond. We chose to dine in Kathleen's kitchen and were looked after by the amazing Eunice. She knew the menu like the back of her hand and was able to make recommendations to my liking. Eunice has a great passion for her job and her bubbly personality made the experience so much more enjoyable. After dinner we went for a drink in the courtyard bar and the mixologist Niamh was one of the best I've ever seen. Her cocktails were top class. The whole resort is spotless and the grounds are just magnificent with the friendliest staff I've ever encountered. Staying here was a breath of fresh air.,5,2023,02,19
234,Lovely stay,Lovely stay at Carton in Feb 2023. The new refurbishment has changed the hotel completely and is beautiful. The hotel is now much more integrated with the old Manor House. The meal at the Morrison restaurant in the old Manor House was amazing. Would highly recommend.,5,2023,02,17
234,Poor experience - much better expected,"My wife and I stayed for a couple of nights at Carton House as a ‚Äúbaby moon‚Äù, as my wife is 36 weeks pregnant. We felt we had 5 star pricing but not a 5 star experience. 

The room we were assigned was as far from reception as physically possible. For people who haven‚Äôt visited the hotel before, it sprawls horizontally into the new wing, and with my wife in a very visible heavily pregnant condition, it was a 5-6 min walk just to get to reception. 

Our room wasn‚Äôt serviced the entire duration of our stay, despite leaving the ‚Äúservice my room‚Äù sign on the door when going to breakfast after our first morning. 

We arrived back to our room to find a workman standing in the room ‚Äúchecking air con‚Äù with no further explanation offered. We hadn‚Äôt asked for this. 

Virtually every little thing was wildly expensive. Room service was good, but overpriced. 

The meal in the sit down Morrison Room restaurant was over ‚Ç¨300 for two people with one glass of champagne as part of that and no other alcohol, and was poor. The pricing is at a premium to Michelin Star restaurants elsewhere in Ireland but the quality is not at that level. 

The grounds are beautiful, but other than that, we left feeling we had had a pretty poor experience.",2,2023,02,15
234,Loved our stay in Carton House ,"We had booked for two nights in Carton House. When we arrived we were given a warm welcome by Terence.
Arthur on reception checked us in. He is amazing. So friendly and professional. 
We dined the first day in The Carriage. We had fish and chips which was very good. Later that evening we went to Kathleen's Kitchen and we really enjoyed our meal. Sean and Dillon in the bar were very helpful and friendly.
Breakfast is most definitely the nicest breakfast I have enjoyed in any hotel. The food and service is excellent, the Morrison room is beautiful. You have to see this to really appreciate how breath taking it is with the organ and angels.
Aoife who served us breakfast was very knowledgeable about this room and we enjoyed chatting with her.
Conor gave us a tour of the Chinese Boudoir and Lord Fitzgerald's suite, which was brilliant to see.
We enjoyed a walk to The Tower, lovely surroundings. We got a taxi to Maynooth town which was roughly 15 euros, seemingly it's a 25 minute walk if you choose to go into town.
Mark on breakfast also looked after us very well.

It was nice to meet Robbie, the Chef. Thanks to Carton House for a lovely two days. The staff are super friendly. The food is outstanding. 

Definitely would recommend!",5,2023,02,13
234,My favourite hotel in Ireland,"I‚Äôve been lucky enough to stay at several five star hotels in Ireland recently and Carton House is the only one I am reviewing due to the amazing standard. It‚Äôs beautiful, luxurious, and comfortable, but what makes this place even better is the staff. They make this place extra special by going above and beyond to look after you. Thank you and hope to come back.",5,2023,02,12
234,Family night away,"2a+3c on arrival the staff were so helpful, there was a beautiful atmosphere & Christmas  decorations, wt mulled wine..  The kids loved the leisure facilities.  Our food was delicious, had choice of restaurants.  Staff extremely helpful.  Our rooms (interconnected) were immaculate wt lovely touches little goody bags for the kids.  Breakfast was the nicest we‚Äôve ever had with plenty to go around & no problem for more.  Hungry boysüòÇ my daughter told everyone about the castle we stayed in & the beautiful Christmas trees.  Will definitely be back.  ",5,2023,02,12
234,Lovely location but leisure facilities leave a lot to be desired!,"Lovely location and setting but the Spa and Leisure facilities are far from 5*star.   The changing rooms and showers are basic and we were provided with hard, worn out towels.  There is nowhere to hang your towel at the shower and  only shower gel is provided, no shampoo/ conditioner. The showers were only luke warm and the water pressure was really bad.  There are no creams or oils in the vanity area, just 2 hair dryers and it's not a very comfortable space as it's located towards the exit.  It felt more like a public pool area than a leisure club in a 5* hotel",3,2023,02,07
234,Really top notch,"Have to say this is a 5 star hotel in every sense of the word . Staff- top quality , hotel and decor - top quality , grounds - breathtaking . 
If I had one recommendation to improve this even further would be to renovate the pool area and make it more of a spa destination . Apart from that couldn‚Äôt fault it .",5,2023,02,05
234,Spa treatment - Lava shell treatment,"I could not recommend this treatmemt more, my therapist was brilliant, she explained the treatement, listened to me when I told her my problem areas, and was the 1st therapist to apply the correct pressure after asking me what level of pressure I preferred. After the treatment I was given a goodie bag of samples , glass of bubbles and a some sorbet, definietly these small touches added to the experience.",5,2023,01,26
234,Visit to Carriage House,Hi there.. had a wonderful walk around golf course.. then went for a drink to Carriage House to be greeted by Karl Robyn and Erika.. such delightful staff.. this staff are so welcoming and so professional.. will visit again tomo.. thank you guys in the bar.. Steph and Anton,5,2023,01,19
234,Rest and relaxation,"We just had the most relaxing, pampered and rejuvenating few days here. I cannot emphasise how well the staff treated us and pre-empted what would make us comfortable. From greeting to departure we were made feel like we were the sole focus of care.
Thank you to John and the restaurant chefs and waiting staff for the fabulous food and attention. Big praise to the concierge Ryan who took us on a tour of the historical rooms and gave us an insight into the rich cultural heritage of the house. To everyone else, those little gestures of attention topped the cake for us on what was already a treat. 
Many thanks to everyone here for what will be remembered as a proper restful break away after a hectic Christmas. x",5,2023,01,12
234,Incredible Experience,"We took our Team of 16 away to Fairmont Carton House for our annual Kick off event this January. 

Every part of the experience from the warm welcome on arrival, followed by a very quick and easy check-in, outstanding meeting facilities with the most helpful conference & events team, to the stunning surroundings of  the Carriage House for lunch and dinner that evening in Kathleen's Kitchen. The menu was off the charts and choice of wines naturally superb too. 

Every touchpoint with the hotel from enquiery to booking to their team on the ground was world class. Breakfast in the Morrison Room was out of this world served in the 17th century former ballroom! 

Would highly recommend Fairmont Carton House.",5,2023,01,11
234,Fabulous experience *****,"We a pleasure to stay in Carton House for my birthday. It was a fabulous and relaxed weekend!

The whole journey started at the time I contacted hotel and got to chat with Olivia. She was so helpful and professional. Olivia went an extra mile to assure everything will be perfect.

The breakfast the next morning was an experience, served in a luxurious room,, I was so glad to be staying for a second breakfast.
We took advantage of the Spa & was treated to really relaxing treatment. 
We were very fortunate with the weather to explore the grounds. The hotel is set in gorgeous countryside.

The night porter had an excellent tip at the end of night & always passed us water to make sure we were hydrated.

234,The most beautiful hotel of all,"I have been to many of the worlds greatest hotels but I think Carton House Hotel is the nicest I have ever been to. It‚Äôs a period house dating from 1729 that has been restored with no expense spared by an American hotel group. The hotel caters for conferences, groups of different sizes, but I was here with my husband today Dec 18th, 2022. We had lunch at ‚ÄòKathleen‚Äôs kitchen‚Äô, which is located where the original kitchens were and we thought the food was as good as it gets. We then had a stroll around the old part of the hotel which comprises of the old house and then strolled out to the manecured gardens for some fresh air. There is a special two night Christmas stay which includes food which will would love. Sorry to have to leave, Deirdre",5,2022,12,18

We were greeted by a super friendly lady who I believe is called Anna Morgan. She made my girlfriend and I feel right at home and she couldn‚Äôt have done enough for us. The next day she even remembered our names which I thought was a nice touch. Overall our stay was marvellous!",5,2022,12,16
234,Good...,"The staff are  wanderful, Anne particularly. She helped us with car rental return info. The bar is wonderful. Restaurants are so so so. Not much selection in either. The room was rather dismal overlooking the main road in. ",5,2022,12,15

Overall an amazing experience we will not forget. We will return.,5,2022,12,03
234,Couples anniversary treat.,"Amazing overnight stay. Dinner in the kitchen was fabulous, quiet on a monday late september but it was lovely to  have a little space in the restaurant. Amazing cocktails, tried  whiskey sour and amaretto sour as the night cap and definitely recommend. The bed in the old house was so comfortable, i did not want to leave it. The rooms in the old house are stunning, i am raging that i didnt take more pictures! The golf club was busy but lovely for a tiny pre dinner walk and cocktail. The grounds are extensive, woth a golf course on site and some falcony seemed to be booked the day we were there. The host was fab and gave us an impromptu intro to the birds while waiting for his booking.  Relaxing night away on a 5 star level, i felt so special and welcomed!",5,2022,11,30
234,Heaven,"Our 2 night stay (parents with 2 teenagers) was out of this world. The staff were very welcoming and nothing was ever too much trouble. The room was fabulous, spacious and relaxing. The breakfast was amazing  , in particular,  the chia pudding. Lots of outdoor activities, cycling around the estate, golf together with a very clean indoor swimming facilities .

234,A must go to Resort and experience!,"Carton House is an exceptional Resort to visit and stay in.

234,Expectations were high but far exceeded,"From the amazing breakfast in the stunning Morrisson room to the gorgeous dinner in Kathleen‚Äôs, myself and my family were really impressed with Carton House hotel. 
Myself and my son played golf and thoroughly enjoyed the Montgomerie course. 
Then we joined my wife and daughter for a swim in the indoor pool which was bigger than I was expecting, good enough for swimming lengths and lovely quality water. 
The Carriage House was also beautifully decorated and has such friendly staff there. 
Overall we would absolutely go back and I would 100% recommend it to anyone. In fact we‚Äôll more than likely buy a gift voucher for my parents for Christmas as I know they‚Äôd love it there now also. 
Thanks to Selina, Thomas, Reginald, and all the super staff it really was a lovely break for us. ",5,2022,11,03
234,Beautiful estate but not a five star experience this time,"This stay was to celebrate our wedding anniversary on the 28/10/22 My husband had emailed ahead to ask if staff could in any way help to mark the occasion and we received confirmation from Augustina in reservations that she would make a note on the reservation to ensure it was a ‚Äòvery memorable stay‚Äô . 
Upon checking in staff were not aware that the stay was for an anniversary and it wasn‚Äôt acknowledged anywhere during our stay which was disappointing to say the least. We weren‚Äôt informed where breakfast was or offered any information on activities . Our room was clean and I would say basic. No view. We had asked for a quiet room with a view . We were put at the very end of the corridor furthest away from the main hotel which was quiet but there seemed to be a loud fan or extraction system that went continuously . The hospitality tray was basic - nice coffee pods but no biscuits or small complimentary snack available. When I asked reception for a biscuit for my coffee it never materialised. The cups and teaspoons were dirty. These hadn‚Äôt been checked by cleaning staff . This was upsetting for me as I I feel basic hygiene would be to ensure clean cups and spoons. I did let reception know that our hospitality tray was dirty. She apologised. 
The estate itself is beautiful. We had wonderful walks. The estate house itself was beautiful and I enjoyed exploring it. The courtyard bar was also a wonderful space to relax and bar staff were friendly. 
The breakfast was very disappointing. The continental selection was very small and consisted mainly of a selection of jams. the wheaten bread provided was stale and inedible. The overnight oats were very sweet. I ordered the pancakes with some bacon and fresh fruit. The ‚Äòcrispy bacon‚Äô was not enjoyable. The option of normal thick cut bacon would be nice. My husbands fry was good although the potato bread was heavy and soaked through with oil. 
We decided to dine in town so I cannot comment on the food in the carriage house or main house restaurant. 
Overall a pleasant stay but for the price charged it wasn‚Äôt a five star experience. It‚Äôs the attention to detail that makes a stay enjoyable and during this stay it was missing . 
I wouldn‚Äôt return for the price we paid.",3,2022,10,31
234,Dont visit this hotel- Shocking Staff,"Where to start? I was part of a group of 3 who played the Montgomery course. Our Initial arrival at the Gate was magnificent, The chap welcoming everyone at the gate is amazing and it's a shame he doesn't reflect the standard of your team or the welcome guests receive.  We play our round and it was very very wet. The Monty course as expected is in great condition. It was after the round that it went horribly wrong.  We wanted to get a burger and chips or steak. We were advised the chancery was closed due to a private event and to go to the Hotel. Which is fair enough. When we walked into the Hotel we were greeted by a member of staff in a grey suit who I think is french. We explained we were looking for food. He said he would show us the way we were very thankful. He brought us underground to the staff tunnel, we explained multiple times that weren't staff and we have just played Golf and were looking for food. We arrived at the staff canteen and off he went leaving us there wondering how we got there and how to leave. It's not great to have been brought there, maybe it was lost in translation but it was a horrible assumption to make when we were clear we wanted to pay for food. We were then helped out but a very nice member of staff who brought us up through the staff elevator and showed us the way to the bar. Instantly as we entered the hotel there was a vibe from the staff. Who are these people and why are you here? The concierge gave more than a surprised look and I'm being very generous. We have traveled all over the world thankfully and stayed in all sorts of places and this vibe was the worst. Again we were approached asking what we were looking for.  Again we explained we were looking for some food and were advised to back where we came to the chancery, which we were told was closed due to a private function, I wonder was it really closed if the hotel staff weren't aware?? It was getting beyond awkward and uncomfortable, there were what felt like daggers thrown at us. We got to the bar and at this stage wanted to just go. Had to laugh the only food was 18 for a cheese and ham toasty. At this stage, the concierge was talking to staff and asking what we were doing there. I accept we were wet due to the rain but we were made feel so small and out of place, it was so awful. It was funny as we were researching for a corporate golf event in 2023 for upwards of 100/120 people. Playing each golf course one day with a night in the hotel in between safe to say this will not happen. The feeling created by the staff in the hotel that day was the most self-entitled horrible vibe that I can't stress enough, don't go there. On the way out the chap at the Gate who again was wonderful couldn't say sorry enough and was shocked. He is a gem shame the rest of welcome is nothing like this.",1,2022,10,24
234,Amazing experience,"We have discovered a wonderful place maintained by a wonderful staff. Our stay was over we expected. In terms of luxury, the Carton House is at a level of a palace. Some small details could be performed according experts, but honestly, we did not see them.

234,Beautiful hotel in a good location,This beautiful historic house is located close to Maynooth.  It has two golf courses and beautiful trails.  I was disappointed that I had emailed and specifically asked if the pool and spa were open and told that they would be open for my stay but then when I arrived the spa was closed.  My other disappointment was that all the restaurants were full for dinner and no dinner reservations were available.  The rooms were comfortable.  The service was very good.  Breakfast was super.,4,2022,09,29
234,5 Star hotel & staff,"Where to start! Everything about Carton House is of the highest quality. We recently stayed for one night and thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it. 

We were staying for a special occasion and Ann at reception pulled out all the stops to make sure it was a memorable stay.

Arriving in the gates of Carton House  you are immediately struck by the beauty of the grounds and it continues into the Manor House itself which it‚Äôs beautiful decorated throughout with a lovely blend of old and contemporary. We ate dinner in the Carriage restaurant and the food from the new menu was top quality as were the cocktails and the breakfast in the fine dining restaurant the following morning was an experience in itself!  All the staff were extremely pleasant and attentive.

We really enjoyed the boat trip along the river Rye between the two golf courses with our guide Rob who was knowledgeable and friendly. We also enjoyed the use of complimentary bikes to explore some of the 1,100 acres on two wheels. 

An incredible destination, we‚Äôll be back!",5,2022,09,27

I just wanted to thank for my fantastic week staying at your hotel.
I have stayed in many golf resorts around the world and this is one of my favourites.
I like to say how much I enjoyed the bar area, with your staff knowing I was alone, but made me feel welcome and as if they had known me forever.
Victor, is a credit to your staff looking after me and while sitting people watching, as you do, he ensured all guest were taken care of.
I have already discussed with my golfing buddy‚Äôs and will be returning for a visit, and I‚Äôm sure they will enjoy the stay as much as I have.

Thank you once again for a great stay!

234,Extraordinary romantic weekend,"My husband surprised me last weekend to a 2 nights stay in Carton House. The trip was far beyond what I expected. The house has been superbly restored and the hotel staff was extremely attentive to all our needs. 
Our bedroom was a garden suite located on the left wing which was very quiet and secluded. The suite was very spacious, extremely clean, spotless carpets and most of all the bed was very comfy. I have never slept so well in a hotel room. My small downside was the bathroom. It was nice and very clean but the shower was a bit small for the space you actually have in the bathroom. A few more hooks would also be handy. Same for the hall at the entrance. Lovely hall where you find everything from coffee machine to ironing board. Only downside I couldn't find a plug for all the appliances which is a shame. I had to unplug the fridge to use some of the appliances. A few plugs in that area would be amazing as there is a big mirror to do your hair and plenty of space. 
The breakfast was plentiful. The healthy shots in the morning were really nice and the selection was amazing from delicious pancakes to healthy omelettes. The first night we ate dinner at Katelyn's kitchen. The food was delicious. I really loved the decor of the old kitchen and walking through the kitchen seeing the chefs at work. The food was plentiful and very tasty. 
The second night we ate in the Morrison's room where we were treated with a 4 course dinner. The experience was comparable to a Michelin Star culinary trip. The dinner was absolutely beautiful from presentation to taste. My husband had warned me after reading a few reviews the portion could be small so I should eat the little extras in-between well that was a mistake. I felt full at the main course. The portions may look small but the food is fine and also filling. Don't be mistaken. You will be absolutely full at the end of the dinner. The waiters were so professional. I wish I knew their names to thank them personally. The French waiter was very helpful to help us choose the wine and so was the American and Italian waiter who brought out and explained the food with passion. 
The dinner was the best culinary experience we ever had. I wished I could have thanked the French chef for bringing me on a culinary trip through my French childhood and life in Ireland. We even got a balloon shaped chocolate dessert for our wedding anniversary which was a lovely touch. 
The grounds of the hotel are so well maintained. There are lovely walks in the park not to forget the golf.  
My husband did go to the pool and outlined the experience as slightly disappointing. Compared to the rest, the pool isn't up to standard and very shallow. 
I had an aromatherapy massage in the spa. Orla was truly amazing and very professional. A complete switch off for an hour. 
Overall we had an amazing experience. The hotel has such a history and so much character but its the staff that brings it all to the next level. The level of customer service and skills is far beyond anywhere I have been in Ireland so far. A big thanks to all the staff who cleans, maintains and welcomes all the guests. 
I recommend this hotel to anyone golfer or not who wants a luxurious quiet weekend.",5,2022,09,24
234,Fantastic stay‚Ä¶ wished it could have been longer,"Such an amazing stay‚Ä¶.too short!!
Visited  the hotel for the first time following the refurbishment and what a treat! The hotel is just stunning,  enjoyed the new lobby/bar area. Loved how you get to experience more of the original house now with the changes to the layout and use of the space. After a morning of golf we had a lovely lunch on the terrace off the clubhouse and then checked into a beautiful room overlooking the gardens. What made the stay was the amazing tasting menu we experienced in the Morrison Room‚Ä¶‚Ä¶delicious, delicate and so different, the French/ Japanese fusion is so unusual, decadent and  refreshing. The staff were so passionate about the menu, ingredients and pairing wines.,,,, enjoyable and educational‚Ä¶ a must!!  The staff throughout the hotel were so welcoming, chatty and clearly proud of the hotel.  Breakfast in the Golden Salon was so special, we particularly enjoyed the stand they brought to the table of pastries, breads, cheese, fruits, yogurt..,delicious . Can‚Äôt wait to go back but definitely at least two nights the next time.",5,2022,09,16
234,Simply the best!,"This is one of my favorite hotels ever. If you are a golfer, there are two excellent courses. If you want a quiet getaway, absolutely everything you could want is available.

The staff is incomparable, well trained and accommodating. The restaurants are beautiful and serve fabulous food. Highly recommended.",5,2022,09,15
234,Overnight stay,"We have just had the most wonderful stay in your fabulous hotel. The staff were wonderful, particularly Anna in the lobby bar and Marie on reception. They could not have been anymore pleasant and helpful.

234,A shout out for Housekeeping,"I spent a very pleasant weekend in the above hotel. When I got home, I noticed that I had left two items of clothing behind (I know, I should not be let out alone).
When they were collected, another item (‚Äòphone charger), that I had only subsequently noticed,(to be left behind) was included in the bag.

Not important, but annoying to lose, delighted with the integrity, & initiative to include it in the returns. 

And yes, I will return also.",4,2022,09,07

The golf courses are so different and that‚Äôs a big plus. If you dine at one of there restaurants there all of them have quality service. 
So that‚Äôs why I give them 5 out of 5.",5,2022,09,04
234,Fantastic golfing experience overshadowed by terrible staff/hospitality,"The Good

Second visit to Carton House and the golf side of things always delivers. Courses were in fantastic condition and you have everything that you could possibly need (lockers, buggies, range balls and help from clubhouse staff). 

Food was superb in both the Carriage Rooms and in the main room for breakfast (although portion sizes could br better - see Bad)

Rooms had everything you could want, including a balcony area with superb views across the estate.

The Bad

The attitude of staff working the bar in the Carriage Rooms. They acted like they couldnt be bothered. Very slow service for drink, including waiting for 5/10 minutes at an empty bar while 3 staff members stood chatting to each other. I'm not sure if they're students working part time, but they couldnt even break a smile.

Food portions leave a lot to be desired. Ordered the fish and chips in the Carriage Rooms and was given 3 small bits of fish, 6 chunky chips and a small helping of peas. While it was very nice, its not terrible value for ‚Ç¨23. 

The Ugly

A group of 20 guys on a golf trip willing to spend considerable money in the bar and we were treated woefully. We've been to many other golf hotels including K Club, Slieve Russell, Lough Erne etc and they've always bent over backwards to accomodate your needs and improve your experience/stay. The same can not be said for Carton House. We were informed that all bars would be closed by 11.00pm with no guest bar facilities available. While we appreciate restricted opening hours on a Sunday, most other resorts find a way to accomodate you. The attitude of staff was 'tough' and they even went to the lengths of turning the tv off that we were watching the golf on to force us out. With nowhere else to have a drink, we went back to the rooms for a few beers, only to have hotel staff knocking on the door every 30 minutes to tell us to keep the noise down. If they had bar facilities which opened to 12.30am like most other resorts then they wouldnt have an issue of people drinking in rooms.

It is safe to say that the negative experience in the Carriage Rooms has overshadowed a fantastic golfing experience. We will definitely be considering other resorts before we even think of returning to Carton House.

234,Beautiful hotel but poor service,"The hotel has been refurbished and is absolutely stunning set in a beautiful location,  the staff were all super friendly and helpful upon check in.  We travelled with a 1 yr old for a relaxing night away, when we arrived we were told there was no availability to eat in the hotel for both lunch or for an evening meal we were told the only option was to go into Maynooth itself or order in room dining. Extremely disappointing and unexpected from a 5 star hotel.",3,2022,08,29
234,Five star prices with a 2 star service very disappointing - Service extremely poor,"Myself and husband were really excited to get a night away alone with no children so we wanted to book that extra special place so chose Carton house and have been a number of times before covid and enjoy it. I was told about three times we are now a fairmount hotel so obviously I've been to others before so was expecting great thongs. 

Ohh how this place has changed.

When going to a hotel of this standard and to be fair paying 480 a night you expect the service to be five star but it was no were close. There is a serious lack of knowledge from the staff, from the menu at dinner to the major delays at breakfast. Asking for basics like butter and juice to be told sorry we are short on that. From the pulled up carpet in the breakfast room where 7 people tripped over including the staff it took one of the guests to pull a chair across to stop people from walking that way. Asking for a glass of water to be told we are short on glasses and are really busy just beggers believe.

There is a lack of maturity and experience here as these staff had no clue how to deal with guests. Serious training is needed.

I've never complained before but voiced my concerns at checkout as I was so annoyed and our experience was a real letdown. The girl on reception was lovely to deal with said she would be sure to tell the general manager and without doubt a call would be made in the next day or so. 

No call or email ever came.

You can't charge 5 star prices and have a two star service. Really disappointing experience. Your staff make the experience and at breakfast and dinner it was a total let down.

Customer service is everything but we left feeling annoyed and deflated.

234,Superb stay at affordable price.,"Our stay was made so much nicer by the staff especially Selina Murphy, we were looked after from arrival to departure. Definitely will be going back. Our room, dinner and vist to the spa was top notch. Beautiful walk around the grounds too.",5,2022,08,24
234,Like the Parson's egg it was good in parts.,"We stayed here for 3 nights.  On the whole it was very enjoyable.  The setting is absolutely beautiful and we enjoyed walking through the grounds and into the pretty town of Maynooth.  We had lunch in the bar which was very pleasant although 18euro for a toastie is a bit steep and we had dinner in the Carriage House one evening which was pleasant enough.  The breakfast however has to be one of the best out there - absolutely outstanding.  The staff here are extremely pleasant, friendly and eager to please.  So why isn't this 5 stars?  Well here goes.  The air conditioning in our room didn't work.  It was hot.  I'm menopausal.  We reported it repeatedly and a fan appeared but the air con was not fixed nor were we offered an alternative room.  Possibly the most uncomfortable 3 nights I've spent anywhere in quite a while.  Additionally, used glasses were left in the room and not removed by housekeeping.  I used the last tissue in the box on the first day.  No replacements were provided.  The shower took an age to come to temperature and water leaked out.  You then have to step out onto a wet slippy floor and mop up the water.  This isn't solely a Fairmont Hotel thing - it seems to be a modern hotel design fault but it's a pain in the proverbial.  And I think the toiletries were on the ration too. Now you may think I'm being picky but when you pay not far off 3000 euro for a 3 night stay for a family of four, I don't think it's unreasonable to expect the air conditioning to work and a replacement box of tissues. So four stars it is. This hotel should be achieving a 5 star rating and with a little more attention to detail and actually dealing with ongoing room issues they'll get it.",4,2022,08,24
234,Fantastic,Just returning from a lovely one night stay in Carton house. Beautiful grounds and room and food was delicious. All staff were so friendly and helpful throughout in particular our waiter in Kathleen‚Äôs kitchen who‚Äôs name we didn‚Äôt catch!

234,For a total relaxation,"CARTON HOUSE is 30 minutes from Dublin. The change of scenery is total. 

Golf courses as far as the eye can see but also paths to walk. Everything is made for relaxation: SPA with swimming pool, walks, bike rides... It is even possible to walk to Maynooth, a small town with restaurants, shopping centers and a beautiful university to visit. 

Carriage House offers a simple cuisine, Kathleen Cuisine more elaborate dishes and there is a gourmet restaurant. Incredible breakfast: fruits, cereals, many sweet and savory dishes at the buffet and to order (including avocado toast!). Delicious cocktails and mocktails at the bar. 

The rooms and suites in the old wing are beautiful. More modern and standard comfort in the recently built wing (but well hidden from view when we're in the park or even in front of the entrance). It is a magical place. FAIMONT, ACCOR Group, will gradually bring its professionalism.",5,2022,08,14

We had an amazing evening meal in Kathleen‚Äôs Kitchen. The food and service were exceptional. All the staff were amazing, big shout out to Anna, Davis and Viktoria.
The spa and pool were nice, but the pool needs an update and has not changed since Fairmount have taken over the hotel.
Carton house is situated on beautiful grounds with great walks, cycling, etc, well worth a trip out of the hotel to explore.

The hotel has added two electric car charging location, with two connectors per pod. My only negative is that they are charging to use the chargers. I would of expected this to be free with a 5 star hotel or at least free for the first few hours for guests.",5,2022,08,08
234,Family Wedding,"Just gone from a three night stay at Carton House to celebrate my brothers wedding. 

The grounds of the hotel are absolutely beautiful and so well kept.  Lovey walks around the grounds.

Food: we are in the carriage house, Kathleen‚Äôs kitchen and had breakfast two out of our three mornings at the Morrison room.  Fabulous food!  

Bedroom was spacious, with very comfortable beds.  Bathroom is good size with separate bath and shower.  Hairdryer available.  If I had to say one minor flaw, the mirrors lighting is not great for doing makeup, slightly on dark side. 

The hotel is so beautiful and what really makes it is the staff.  We didn‚Äôt pass one member of staff who didn‚Äôt wish us a good day.  Special mention to Denny and Selina! Lovely, lovely, people and so helpful! A credit to Carton House the pair of them!

We enjoyed an afternoon of tasting various teas and the ""to die for"" savouries and cakes. Our server, Anastasia, was a mine of information about the food and the various teas. She also shared many historical stories about the house and grounds. She made our afternoon a hugely enjoyable experience through her friendly and knowledge approach to serving. 
I would definitely  recommend a visit.",5,2022,08,06
234,Great  Makeover but...,"C.H. has had a fabulous makeover. The staff are excellent.  We stayed for two nights.  On the second day we went out and returned at 3.30p.m. to find that our room was not serviced which was very disappointing.  My key didnt work 3 times in the space of 24 hours which was annoying also.  We ate in Kathleens kitchen on the first night, lovely decor but the food was disappointing, we asked for bread to start thinking that we would get a selection however we received one big bread roll each, it looked ridiculous. My pork was tasty,my husbands chicken was tasteless. Overpriced.  However the Morrison on the second night was a differnt experience, it was excellent from beginning to end, a lovely dining experience with great food.  I used the Spa which was a 5 star experience, the swimming pool is not, you need to choose your time carefully if you want to avoid a busy pool as it is open to non resident members, I could not get into the Jacuzzi, it was packed.   It would be nice to have known the best times in advance.  Our room was very  comfortable and clean and despite the above we enjoyed our weekend in the new look Carton House.",4,2022,08,04
234,Amazing place to stay,"We stayed in a lovely balcony room with two queen sized beds. The room was immaculate and had everything we needed, including a modern espresso machine! 
From the moment we entered the hotel, the staff were polite and attentive and could not do enough for us. 
In the morning we had the best breakfast we‚Äôd ever had in a hotel-it was delicious and plentiful and again, the staff were incredibly attentive and friendly. 
I would not hesitate to stay here again!",5,2022,08,02
234,The Perfect Engagement Surprise,"The Best Weekend!
We got engaged here on Saturday night and have just left Carton House on cloud 9. 
From start to finish, the staff have been top class. We were met by Olivia upon check in who is so pleasant and kind and then brought to our room by a kind gentleman called Lockie who also gave us a tour of the old house. Our room was beautiful with fabulous views of the golf course and a bed that is so comfy- it was hard leaving this morning! We ate in the Carriage house and served by lovely staff, Robyn in particular who was so professional and warm and made our engagement dinner really special. Thank you Robyn. Special thanks  to Paul & Ciara who organised a beautiful setting for a proposal - something I‚Äôll never forget. Breakfast was delicious, the towers were a real treat! I think the manager was Nicole(?)- really attentive to every table. We wanted for absolutely nothing. 
We really were so well looked after and I can‚Äôt wait to return - hopefully soon.",5,2022,08,01

Rooms are a bit far from reception, but very friendly staff helps you out anytime.

We had the lovely Sasha tell us about the history of carton house and show us the Chinese room. Would highly recommend.,5,2022,07,29
234,Fantastic Experience,"From the moment we arrived at Carton House we were blown away by the hospitality we received. We were a family of six and dined in one of three of the hotels restaurants. The staff could not do enough for us, so friendly and attentive.  I look forward to returning.",5,2022,07,29
234,Beautiful hotel,Absolutely stunning hotel inside and out. Hotel and restaurant staff were very helpful and friendly.  We don't have a bad word to say about it. Lots of beautiful walks and activities to do on the hotel grounds.. we will definitely be returning.,5,2022,07,28
234,Beautiful hotel / Fantastic service,"My husband and I stayed for two nights in the king balcony room.  Absolutely beautiful.
We were welcomed by Paul the doorman and he really was lovely, he greeted us every time we passed and give us a history lesson on Carton House which was interesting.
We were free to browse the hotel and the rooms are so luxurious.
We went to the pool and relaxed both days by the pool.
Both nights we ate in the carriage restaurant, I would recommend the Butter Chicken. 
Waiters couldn‚Äôt be more attentive.
The grounds of the hotel are immaculate with a choice of three walks and bike hire.
I will definitely be back. It was the best hotel I‚Äôve ever stayed in.",5,2022,07,15
234,Afternoon tea Service Charge Issue,"I went for Afternoon Tea in Carton house on Friday 24th June and everything was perfect until it came to the bill, I asked for the service charge to be removed as I always tip in cash directly to the staff and had already done so but was told that it was not possible as the service change was part of the bill, I did not want to make a scene and spoil an otherwise perfect day so I phoned on Monday and highlighted the issue. I have no problem leaving a tip but I feel very strongly that if should be my choice of how much and how I choose to pay it. I would go again for afternoon tea but would make sure to pay without my guests present so that I could resolve any issues in private.",4,2022,07,13
234,"Beautiful old (1749) Manor house, newer rooms, gracious staff","This is a beautiful hotel and the rooms, even though there was no air conditioning for a very warm weekend, were very nice, not exceptional.  The grounds are very large and lovely, so it's easy to relax and enjoy the location.",4,2022,07,13
234,Beautiful hotel and Outstanding staff,We were weary travelers greeted with kindness and sensitivity. Marie is an outstanding representative!! Marie and the rest of the staff demonstrate superb customer service to accompany this amazing place!!,5,2022,07,10
234,Wonderful property with a fascinating history,"My wife and I enjoyed our time at Carton House immensely. 

The staff is wonderful‚Äîfrom the reception, to the waiters and waitresses, to the concierge and his team. Brian, the concierge, treated us to an hour-and-a-half (!) tour of the property, sharing the history of the FitzGerald family, the hotel, and each building and room (including the room Queen Victoria once stayed in).

The food is excellent. The star of the show is their breakfast, served in a beautiful room with views of the property (rose gardens, golf course), and featuring everything you could possibly imagine to want to eat. That  a breakfast of this caliber is included in the nightly rate is unbelievable. 

The spa is also tranquil and so professionally run. 

We were very refreshed by and grateful for our stay at Carton House.",5,2022,07,10
234,Great night away,"From the minute we arrived we felt very welcomed, from our waiter Amauary to the manager Sarah for any needs. Dinner in Kathleen‚Äôs kitchen was amazing compliments to the chef, will be visiting again in the near future",5,2022,07,06
234,Perfect night away,"Had such an amazing night with my boyfriend in the Kathleen‚Äôs kitchen tonight. The food by the chef was perfect and the amazing atmosphere set by staff Amauary made the well needed night away as a couple perfect. Never met a more pleasant manager than the girl Sarah, who ensured our night together was nothing less than the best.",5,2022,07,06
234,Wonderful afternoon tea,"I visited Carton House for the first time this weekend for afternoon tea. The overall experience was wonderful. When we arrived we were greeted by the lovely doorman and brought to the gold room which was magnificent. The waiters and waitresses couldn‚Äôt have been nicer-so professional and courteous! We started with sandwiches which were delicious, however I would have liked more of the savoury-they were very small fingers so nothing substantial. The scones with curd, cream and jam were divine! The four fancy patisseries were amazing- a taste sensation. So many different flavours and textures and looked so pretty. Then there was carrot cake and lemon drizzle. The carrot cake was nice (very plain after having those wonderful sweets beforehand), the lemon drizzle no different to shop bought which was a disappointment.  We enjoyed some time outside then went to the bar for cocktails. Again the service was wonderful and the drinks divine. If I were to change anything it would be to have  more balance between savoury and sweet and rethink the lemon drizzle recipe.",4,2022,07,05
234,"Lovely, friendly staff","Paul, the door man, grew up on the estate and was delighted to spend time with me sharing the history of the house, the estate and the surrounding buildings.  The location is stunning, the grounds are beautiful, perfect for golfers or just a stroll in the grounds.",4,2022,06,29
234,Lovely Day.,"I would highly recommend Carton House. I had an amazing day in a beautiful location. Everything was perfect, a wonderful door man called Paul greeted us with such a kind welcome. The food was so healthy and beautifully cooked and the atmosphere was just lovely. Definitely on my list to recommend to friends.",5,2022,06,24
234,Most certainly one of the best resort hotels in Ireland,I had stayed at Carton House only once before and this was many years ago. It was lovely but not special enough to tempt me back. This was my second visit and I honestly felt like I was staying in an entirely different hotel in every possible way. Everything has been renovated authentically and sympathetically. It is now sublimely luxurious but the character of the estate and its ‚ÄòIrishness‚Äô remain at the forefront.,5,2022,06,21
234,Golf trip and hotel stay,Service was excellent at hotel and golf course.  Paul greeted us in top hat and tails at main entrance and told us some interesting stories about the beautiful property. Shane was especially memorable in terms of service in golf area.  Everyone at reception was above and beyond‚Ä¶ including allowing early check in and making sure.  A top notch experience all the way.,5,2022,06,11
234,Disappointing. Has lost its easy Irish warmth & charm yet certainly nowhere near close to Fairmont standards.,"Disappointing. Has lost its effortless Irish charm yet Isn‚Äôt even close to being the high standard we have come to expect from a Fairmont. 
Having stayed at Carton before it was taken over we were lucky enough to experience the warm, effortless Irish hospitality as it used to be. Unfortunately, with the makeover & rebranding it has lost all of that warmth & Irish charm only to be replaced by a cold, sterile look (Bring back the cow paintings!!) . Staff still mostly endeavour to do their utmost but with all the new Fairmont rules (most of which seem to be a tick box exercise) the place is very stiff & unwelcoming, especially as a family with a child. Children are not allowed in the pool at all between 11am-3pm, so we only managed to go once in 4 days due to these restrictions & a busy wedding schedule, yet when we did finally get in, the children‚Äôs pool, steam room & jacuzzi were all out of use. Hardly the experience you‚Äôd expect from a 5 star wannabe resort hotel. 
Also such a shame to have turned a once beautiful restaurant into a totally uninspiring box of a conference & event facility, so much more could have been done here. 
The breakfast was mostly good although generally not as good as it used to be. 
The food & staff at the Carriage house were excellent & the grounds as perfectly manicured as always. 
The rooms are fairly small & basic but nice enough (if you get one the air con works in) the bed is really comfortable but there‚Äôs no wow factor here, especially given the price they charge. 
I think it would do Carton well to stop trying so hard & relax a bit. It feels like they are attempting to compete with the likes of Ashford Castle which unfortunately, they can‚Äôt. We certainly won‚Äôt be staying here as a family again anytime soon.",3,2022,05,31
234,Best Vacation of Our Lives,"The history is incomparable, and the staff is more attentive than you can imagine. Marie, Seline, and Olivia were amazing at reception, and Brian was the best concierge we‚Äôve ever had; his tour was equal parts informational and fun.

We went horse riding at Abbey Field, and had a falconry experience for the ages right on Carton House‚Äôs grounds. 

My wife and I will be back, guaranteed. I unreservedly recommend Carton House to anyone who enjoys comfort, indulgence, and superior guest service.

234,Fairmont service in a peaceful scenario,"This hotel is beyond beautiful. Everything from the architecture, to the landscape, is amazing. The service couldn't be better. I used the front desk, bar, and breakfast area and everyone was so nice and warm. The hotel is a 30 mins drive to the airport and 30 mins drive to downtown Dublin. I've stayed in Dublin before, which was convenient for visiting downtown, but I would opt for Carton House in the future because you get so much more from the experience.",5,2022,05,27
234,A absolutely wonderful Place with a ‚Äúhidden gem‚Äù at the entrance,"You can read lots about this stunning beautiful Hotel, but something very special is found on the main entrance. If you are lucky you might get the Porter to show you a bit around. And Paul is such a great Tourguide! Grown up in this estate he is able to tell lots about the History as well as some anecdotes and can show you some of the special places in the gorgeous rooms. You definitely should give him a try!",5,2022,05,24
234,Best stay ever,Nicest Hotel and sourrounding I Have ever been! Great golfcourses and very friendly stuff! Great breakfast. And a very intereating tour through this historic house ! Thank you Paul! Lucky to could be here!,5,2022,05,24
234,Amazing but little to no sleep as no air con and beds not comfy,We had the most amazing time. Brian did a tour of the house with us and told us all about the history. He couldn‚Äôt have done enough for us. The whole experience was amazing. The only thing that really damped our time was the air con in our room didn‚Äôt work and the bed wasn‚Äôt comfortable at all. So other than not really sleeping we had a great time. We got bikes from the hotel and went on a cycle of the grounds before we headed home.,4,2022,05,24
234,Total Luxury,"We stayed in early April for a special birthday break. From the moment we arrived 
I was struck by the level of luxury and elegance on hand. 
After check in we were shown to our beautifully appointed suite which was super comfortable and had everything we needed. 
We ate in Kathleen‚Äôs, and chose to sit near the kitchens, this allowed us to watch
the chefs as they worked, which was fun. Food was amazing as was the service.
After a very good sleep, it was down to the restaurant for breakfast. No buffet here,
service was fantastic as was the quality and quantity of the food. Anything that you could possibly want was available, and served in the most beautiful surroundings.

Had a tour of the Old House from Brian Cotter, a must do for all guests. The history is fantastic and Brian‚Äôs enthusiasm makes it that little bit special. Thanks Brian, we learned a lot.
After a bracing walk around the enormous gardens we lunched at the Carriage House, again the food was fantastic and Richard did a fantastic job of looking after us.
Extensive on site facilities include Spa, Pool, Golf Course, Gym. Everything is to hand. A special thanks to Brian for all his efforts and Harry Glynn for making our stay so special. 
The level of service stands out, those that work here are very well trained and perform their duties to the highest of standards. 
We had the most fantastic experience and look forward to our next visit.
Our thanks to all,
Leah",5,2022,05,17
234,One of Ireland's best hotels ,"Probably the best hotel I have ever stayed in. Everything from the staff, food, decor, atmosphere is top class. It isn't cheap but you get what you pay for. My wife and I only stayed one night (wish it could have been more) an amazing experience from start to finish, would highly recommend.",5,2022,05,15
234,Fantastic  from start to finish. Staff are amazing.,"We have stayed here recently and it was superb from start to finish!The staff were exceptional from Brian at concierge who gave us the tour of the old house and excellent knowledge of the history of Carton to recently Shane in the Carriage House Restaurant.
Shane couldn't have been more helpful and so professional. And made our experience even more wonderful with his super friendly personality.
Will definitely be coming back.",5,2022,05,05
234,Family Celebration,"We spent Sunday 1st May at Carton House to celebrate our Grandson Joshua‚Äôs Christening- it was a close family affair in a private room organised by our son in law who also made arrangements for us to stay overnight.

It might have been raining and dull outside but what a warm welcome we received from the minute we arrived until we departed the following day.

The private lunch for the christening party was excellent as was the breakfast the following morning. The ambiance of the hotel is calm and relaxing- a great place to spend a weekend.

Nothing was too much trouble for the staff who always had smiles on their faces they are a credit to the hotel.

My husband and I live in the UK and although we travel to Dublin to stay with our daughter and son in law we shall certainly be visiting Carton House again.

Thank you again for your warm welcome.",5,2022,05,03
234,"Great property, shame about the chef","Great property, shame about the chef

Lovely place ‚Äì we stayed one night and played golf. We had  booked the carriage house for dinner; had some misgivings after the golf when we went in for a drink ‚Äì it was obviously understaffed and the service was poor. We did look for a different restaurant in the locality but couldn‚Äôt see anything we fancied, so went along to the carriage house.

First impressions were great. Waitress very attentive and drinks arrived in a timely fashion, as did starters which were pretty good. I had ordered a fillet steak medium rare, which came not just well done but practically solid. Pointed it out to the waitress (who guessed it was well done before I said anything); she took it back to the kitchen and said another one will be along in five minutes. She came back to us with the news that the chef considered the steak it been cooked to medium rare . At that point I asked if I could speak to the manager, she persuaded me not to and offered the drinks.

The new steak came 20 minutes later and it was raw in the middle. The manager did come along at this point and he told me that he and the chef considered  the first steak to be medium rare. I asked for the duty manager despite waiting another 25 minutes, nobody turned up and nor did anybody attempt to contact us prior to checking out the following morning.

I emailed Sasha O‚ÄôReilly Crowe on the 27th of April and to date (3rd May) have heard nothing from her.

I‚Äôve been to many Fairmont properties over the world and always been extremely impressed. Many facets of this hotel are very impressive but they‚Äôve let themselves down with the attitude of the manager and chef in the carriage house and the lack of response at the time and since.",2,2022,05,03
234,A1 from start to finish,"Myself and my brother decided to treat my dad for hs 70th to a golf trip in Ireland. We had little or no knowledge of Carton House prior to booking but were completely blown away by every element of our experience.

From the moment our cab pulled up to the drop off to the minute we checked out we have never experienced such attentive and helpful staff anywhere in the world. We were treated to an early check-in, outstanding bedrooms, pro-shop golf staff that went above and beyond the call of duty to both accomodate and advise us and wonderful service in the bar and restaurants

The breakfast experience is extra special in the scenic dining hall and the quality of food is outstanding. 

Special mention to the front desk staff, concierge as well - we can't thank you enough for making the experience so memorable and exceeding expectations",5,2022,05,02

Totally love this place. Everything is perfect. I would return tomorrow!

234,Wee Easter Break,"Great wee one overnight stay at Carton House, our 5th or 6th visit.  Luxury hotel with very attentive and friendly staff.  Although check-in wasn't until 3 pm our room was ready by 1 pm.  

We ordered and shared  the hotel platter for lunch.  Absolutely delicious. Then we walked  into the village of Maynooth going along the path between the golf courses.   Our aim was to locate the train station and find out about parking facilities.   Shopping in Maynooth isn't really a thing but we did discover a wee shopping centre for the first time.  

There are plenty of walks around Carton House itself and the glorious weather on both days we were there encouraged us to take advantage of our surroundings.  

We ate in The Carriage Rooms on Tuesday night.  Absolutely delicious food and excellent service.  My wife had the fish and chips and I had the burger and we shared a dessert.  Highly recommended.  We had coffee back in the bar area of the hotel.  

Breakfast on the Wednesday morning was fantastic.  Seared at a table by the window we were able to enjoy the view over the golf course.  Breakfast was served to our table by attentive staff.  

Looking forward to return soon.",5,2022,04,24
234,A wonderful overnight stay,"From crossing the threshold of this hotel we had a 5 star experience. My husband has reduced mobility and every single team member went out of their way to ensure our stay was enjoyable and above all we had access to all the hotel services. We had adjoining rooms close to the reception so we were able to dine both in Kathleen‚Äôs Kitchen and The Carriage House. Food in both restaurants was delightful and the wines reasonably priced. 

I would like to give a mention to Brian, an asset to this hotel.

I look forward to our next stay and hope to include a spa visit. Keep up the good work.",5,2022,04,22

234,"Great luxurious venue, even better food","Visited Carton House for a special family occasion and our experience was made all the better from our stay here. The highlight was the food and the options are plentiful, with everything bound to satisfy. We dined at The Carriage House and Kathleen's Kitchen restaurants and also via function room hospitality. I enjoyed a mouth-watering wagu beef burger in the Carriage House and my partner enjoyed a creamy butter chicken curry. My personal highlight was the Burrata starter and boneless BBQ ribs for mains, served at Kathleen's Kitchen. The setting is quaintly designed in the old kitchen of the house and we enjoyed the novelty of watching our food being prepared in the open-plan kitchen. Our service also was top-quality, the hotel grounds/facilities are stunningly designed and well-kept. Also enjoyed a round of golf around the O'Meara course. Everything was worthy of the 5-star rating. We will be coming back! ",5,2022,04,20
234,Wonderful from start to finish,"Had a wonderful three day experience in Carton house.
We firstly dined in the carriage house restaurant  where I had the beautiful butter chicken, full of flavor. My partner had the wagu beef which was mouth watering. 

Then we dined in Kathleen‚Äôs Kitchen which was an unforgettable experience. The setting is very authentic  as you can see the chefs preparing each meal fresh. I have never experience anything like the food and the service. 
Adored the food in Kathleen‚Äôs kitchen and I will think about the Burata there for the rest of my days.

I highly recommend Carton house for a number of reasons

1. The friendliest staff
2. The food 
3. The food 
4. The Burata in Kathleen‚Äôs Kitchen
5. The Wine menu 

Entirely worthy of 5 star rating for a number of reps sons but particularly the food stood out for me .",5,2022,04,20
234,Birthday Treat,"A group of 5 girls stayed at Carton for a birthday celebration. On arrival the grounds and building were stunning.

The service was second to none from the minute we walked in the door.  We were greeted by Lochie who took our bags and brought us to our table for lunch. Flavie welcomed us at the front desk and made our check in very smooth. Brian Sutton introduced himself and kindly offered to give us a history and tour around the house. The staff were so friendly and could not have done more to make sure our needs were met throughout our stay. 

The rooms were fabulous and spacious. There was a huge selection to choose from on the breakfast menu. The whole stay was very relaxing and positive.  I will definitely be recommending Carton House and I will hopefully stay there again.",5,2022,04,20
234,Fabulous Stay,"Stayed for three nights and I couldn‚Äôt fault the hotel/staff or facilities. We ate in all of the restaurants and the food was excellent, great variety between all them all. Brian and Louchlin greeted us and helped with all of our bags and Anna served us welcome drinks. Derek in Kathleen‚Äôs was so helpful with some eating requirements. We were attending a wedding and Robyn couldn‚Äôt do enough for us! Our daughter hasn‚Äôt stopped talking about the pizza since we left! Our rooms were adjoining and were spotless with the most comfy beds! Would love some of the bed linen at home not to mention the pillows! (There was even a menu for these!) The children played tennis and went bike riding all organised by Marie and Selina. The eggs for the children on Easter Sunday were a lovely touch! All in all, the most memorable stay.

All in all it was a magical weekend, where amazing memories were made, thanks in no small part to the staff at Carton House.",5,2022,04,20
234,Obnoxious Staff,"As a resident, end up in a disagreement with staff who were not happy to serve me at the bar, whilst I was attending a wedding.  Very unimpressed with managements attitude which is very short sighted and as a result will take my corporate business elsewhere.",1,2022,04,19
234,Disappointing 5* experience,"We were very disappointed at our carton house experience on Sat (Easter Weekend 2022). We had a day in the spa, the staff there were lovely but my masseuse was 5 mins late (no apology) and finished 5 min early, which wasn't great but not the end of the world. Afterward we went to get some food, both the restaurant and lobby weren't serving and it was recommended we went to the carriage house. We were brought to the door where we were told they weren't taking walkins, only bookings as they were booked out, the room was barley a quarter full. These things happen in life but to treat customers who spent a chunk in the hotel and refuse them access to a meal later was quite poor, and if their excuse was they were not serving food, every 5 star hotel I've been to have a menu of some sort available. We will take our custom elsewhere in future",2,2022,04,19

We had a fabulous treatment with Stephanie in the Spa & the pool/jacuzzi & steam facilities were great too.
Lovely walks through grounds & a golfers paradise.
There are a couple of options for food, which was excellent.
The guys at the pro shop gave us a couple of putters & balls for the putting green. The pro Jacki came over & even gave us a few tips and we had a great laugh.
The staff are so attentive & friendly. Nicole gave us a lovely tour of the old house history.
It‚Äôs pricey but I would highly recommend as a treat.",5,2022,04,17

234,Disappointing valentines trip,"We stayed here in February 2022. The hotel is absolutely gorgeous, really beautiful building and surroundings. The service is nothing short of abysmal. We asked if there was somewhere to watch the rugby and were told to go to the carriage house. On our arrival there we were told that they only accept bookings so we then took a taxi to maynooth town. On our arrival back to the hotel we were told that the hotel did not do cash back to pay our taxi driver. We had to go back to maynooth to an atm and pay double the taxi fare. When we returned to the hotel I asked a different member of staff if cashback was available and I was told that it was. We queried why the concierge told us there was no cash back option and the staff member shrugged his shoulders. We then tried to get a drink at the bar and were told that carton house do not have a residents bar. 
The following morning we went for breakfast and were greeted by lovely staff who took our order. Cooked breakfast took over 50 minutes and the eggs Benedict were not edible. I genuinely cannot believe that this hotel is 5 star with the current level of service. The concierge was extremely rude and the bar men were young, inexperienced and poorly trained. There is no communication between staff and this is evident in the customer service. Overall I‚Äôm shocked that a hotel that claims to have a 5 star service cares this little about their guests.",1,2022,03,21

Mathias couldn't have been more friendly & helpful in recommending different things to try on the menu and see around the grounds. He recommended we try the Paris Brest for dessert which was delicious and went out of his way to give us information about walks on the grounds. He is a great advertisement for the hotel and a fabulous asset to have at front of house! ",5,2022,03,16
234,Birthday & Anniversary,"A Magnificent Experience in a Truly Fantastic Hotel & Resort with amazing dining, spa and leisure facilities in a quality country estate setting. 

Staff at every touch point were world class excellent.

My wife and I have travelled extensively abroad and to experience such quality on our own doorstep in Co. Kildare was such a joy.

We HIGHLY recommend Carton House as destination.",5,2022,03,15
234,The friendliest staff,"Yesterday myself and my friend had coffee and scones which were devine but it was not just the scones that impressed us.  First we met with Selina who greeted us with such a pleasant manner and gave us a little history on the main house afterwards we were looked after by Eunice with our coffees.  She was so friendly and polite .
Well done ladies üëè  ‚≠êÔ∏è  ‚≠êÔ∏è ‚≠êÔ∏è ‚≠êÔ∏è ‚≠êÔ∏è ‚≠êÔ∏è",5,2022,03,11
234,Perfect,"We‚Äôve just returned from three nights at Carton House. It was perfect from start to finish. Lovely staff, excellent room, superb breakfast and great choices for dinner. Made to feel very welcome. The grounds are perfect for running and walking. A short scenic walk to maynooth was great too. My only small negative is one our second night we ate in The Carriage House and it was just too warm.",5,2022,03,04
234,Not a true 5 Star experience,"We booked in for one night to celebrate my wife's birthday over a weekend. 

Unfortunately on arrival at 2.30pm, we were told our room would not be ready even though check-in time was 3pm (""maybe by 3.30pm"", was the response..). We were not offered any sort of apology, but were told we would be sent a text when our room was ready. Not the best start, but we grabbed a quick meal and headed to the pool. While we were having a meal a large wedding party arrived and began to check in. It appeared to us that some of those guests' rooms were ready and they were being handed bottles of water on arrival, which obviously didn't sit too well with us given we were also paying customers and watching this unfold in front of us...

By 5pm we had not received any text to say our room was ready, so headed back to reception. On enquiry, it turned out our room was ready. However there was no mention of an apology about the delay, the lack of contact as promised or any acknowledgement that we had been dragging our bags around for 2.5hrs while waiting for our room to be ready... We mentioned this and received an excuse to say that check-in staff were very busy....

After dinner, we returned to our room whereupon it became pretty evident that we could hear the wedding music from the function room (along with the very bright green light of the thermostat beside the bed as one other reviewer noted). We waited until close to midnight before ringing reception to ask for ear plugs (it wasn't the wedding party's fault after all!). The staff member didn't supply ear plugs but said he would turn down the music (?!). No idea how that would work, but in any event, we eventually got to sleep...

On check out we were not asked how our stay was, or any offer to take our bags etc... this is obviously not even including the fact that it was my wife's birthday and there was no acknowledgement of it at all during our stay (we don't want free stuff, but it would have been nice for it to be mentioned at check-in as I had included it in my comments when making the booking...)

In all, it was great to get a night away, but honestly, we could have stayed in any other 5 Star that night, so we decided to pick Carton House as understood it had recently reopened. On the basis of our stay, we wouldn't recommend it when compared to other luxury / comparable hotels in Ireland. There are plenty to choose from and Carton House isn't near top / middle tier.

On the plus side, we ate in Kathleen's Kitchen which was good and the cocktails in the bar beside it were very nice. Breakfast was great too. Staff in the restaurants / bars were also generally very pleasant.",3,2022,03,02
234,Not if you want to feel welcome....,"This was an unexpected disappointment for us. 

PROS:  (1) Paul the bellman gave us a tour of the house before our meal and that was the best part of our stay. He shared his personal experiences growing up on the estate and that made it much more relatable and personal. 

(2) Breakfast was nice, and seemed like the only place where the warmth of the Irish people was able to shine. Gorgeous offerings, extremely tasty, all made to order. Plenty of food and lovely servers. This venue should be highlighted instead of hidden for most of the day. However, nothing else was particularly enjoyable.

Upon arrival, we were quickly made to feel unwelcome and very out of place...not sure why. This is not the warm Irish welcome we have come to experience from our Irish travels through the years.

Our general feelings is that the folks at this property think they are very posh and are quite impressed with themselves. For example, they put a 100Euro hold on our credit card for dinner even though we are Fairmont members - we have NEVER had a hold put on our credit cards at another property at checkin, and has not happened since. 

Dinner at Kathleen's Kitchen was confusing and awkward even though we were the only ones in the back room. 3 different wine lists were presented and nothing we ordered was available. Took more than 30 mins to get drinks sorted so we just stayed with water. The food itself was good, but everything else was just odd and uncomfortable. The menu was extremely limited, however, so not sure how you could eat here more than once. 

The room was minuscule and the bathroom felt like the size of a postage stamp. Shower pressure was ridiculous and the 'rainforest' shower head was immovable; very odd. 

The thermostat has an extremely bright green circular light that shines all night long --right next to the bed in the room. We tried all sorts of things to cover it (towels, socks, etc) but it remained a bother throughout the night. The next morning I mentioned it to the receptionist and she said they usually send up housekeeping to disable it if it is a problem (read:  you actually sleep in the dark) and she would send someone up. I told her we were checking out in an hour so it wouldn‚Äôt help us, but maybe go ahead and do it for future guests or at least give them a heads up before their sleep is ruined. 

Upon departure, we called down to the front desk and notified them we were leaving. Our room was at the far end of the property, close to the far end of the car park, and we preferred not to walk all the way down to reception just to get a copy of the receipt. However, the receptionist informed us that her computer was down, so I had to walk all the way to reception to ‚Äúcheck our bill‚Äù even though we had already left a card for charges (in excess of the hold amount, described above). When I finally came down (long walk) the woman said it was all set and there was nothing for me to do. Never asked about our stay or wish us a nice journey or any other cordialities that a 5 star property should offer. 

I hate to be a negative nelly but it was so many little things that added up....honestly just not a 5 star experience. 

I think this hotel is relying on the fact that they are the only show in town, and really don't care if they provide a warm welcome or an enjoyable stay...if you are in Maynooth, where else are you going to stay? This is not a place to get a warm Irish welcome. This place acts super snobby and if we had not received a tour of the house from Paul we probably would have just checked out. 

I would not recommend this hotel, nor will I stay there again.",2,2022,02,25
234,Carton House,"I stayed in Carton House on the 23rd of February for a one night stay. I was looking forward to a relaxing break and that‚Äôs exactly what I had! 

From the moment I walked in the door I was treated like royalty. Brian welcomed me and offered to carry my bags to reception. I stated that it was cold outside and Brian brought me a hot towel to warm my hands! Sasha was working at reception, she was very friendly and efficient and offered me a map of the grounds. Brian then brought my bags to my room and told me some of the history of the house along the way. He is a gem and the hotel are lucky to have him. 

I stayed in the ‚ÄòSummer Room‚Äô an absolutely stunning room complete with original features, welcome chocolates, smart TV and all the comforts you could possible require. The room overlooked the golf course to the back and the view was breathtaking! 

I had room service for both dinner and breakfast and the food was delivered promptly and was very tasty.

All the staff were very friendly and polite with some even calling me by name! I thoroughly enjoyed my stay here and I would highly recommend it to all. I hope to be back very soon.",5,2022,02,24
234,Fantastic,"Myself and my husband stayed here for one night. The Check-in process was flawless, i loved that we could sit down and relax while checking in.  The room was beautiful and spacious and the beds were very comfy. We had drinks in the bar, a lovely barman with a ponytail (can't remember his name)  looked after us and made me a lovely non-alcoholic cocktail. We then had dinner in Kathleen's Kitchen, this is a very unique restaurant with a live kitchen where you can watch the chef cook. Sarah (the manager, I think) looked after us, she was very charismatic and highly professional and recommended some delicious dishes, compliments to the chef! The staff were all very friendly here. After dinner Sarah brought us on a tour of the house, seeing the Whiskey library and the Chinese room was a real treat! We had breakfast in the Morrison rooms, Caroline was our server and she was great, the food was out of this world, the best breakfast in a long time! The rooms are incredible! We will certainly be back to this wonderful hotel, our stay was magnificent! Thank you to everyone who made our stay so memorable.",5,2022,02,23
234,Perfect Weekend,"Just returned from Carton House having celebrated a milestone Birthday there. From start to finish I could not have wished for a better experience. The staff are very welcoming and attentive without being intrusive. The hotel has a very relaxed atmosphere and  the bedrooms are very comfortable. We ate both evenings in the Carriage House and the food was delicious, special thanks to Richard, Callum and Finn for making both evenings so special. Breakfast on both mornings was excellent due to a varied menu and great service from Caroline.
Despite the bad weather we managed a couple of walks but we will return in the Summertime when we can explore the grounds further and enjoy a drink in one the outdoor terraces.",5,2022,02,22
234,Not 5 Star,"Our bags on arrival went kissing. Called reception about 10 times and no reply. Ended up in. a panic down at reception looking for my bags as my daughter's asthma meds were in my bag, Service is very poor,  reception under staffed, not sure why there are door men pottering around when you actually can't get any service, maybe hire more on reception and loose the pomp in favours of actual customer service. Food in Carriage house was very very poor, I have had better microwavable meals,. Staff and food much better in Kathleen's Kitchen but could do with a bit more variety on the menu, Service staff actually genuinely helped redeem against some of the awful experiences we had our weekend, but again there was messing around on the Sunday that I just don't even have the heart to describe. I couldn't get  out of the place fast enough. Absolutely in no way can this be defined as 5 star, I will never return and would advice people to avoid, there are much better 3-4 star experiences. Kellys rosslare claims to be only 4 star but genuinely is 7 star in comparison to Cartons 5 star ??",1,2022,02,21
234,Perfect & Relaxing,"It was a busy weekend for Valentines however the staff and the Hotel were very welcoming and very pleasant from check-in to check-out.
Our room was so spacious and in a very quiet part of the Hotel which made it very relaxing.  Met up with friends in the bar and it was a lovely evening all round.  Great stay and will be back again.",5,2022,02,20
234,Amazing and Relaxing,"I had the most wonderful experience at Carton House for two nights. We had such a warm welcome with the staff being so pleasant and helpful for the duration of the stay. I never felt I needed to ask for anything as the offer always came to us first, be it help with luggage, a newspaper in the morning or an extra pot of tea. The spa and leisure facilities were lovely and not too busy. The staff at the spa were so nice and I had one of the best full body massages. All of the food and drink we got was of a very high standard, the care behind the preparation showed on every plate. The room was immaculate, spacious and cosy with a very comfortable bed. There was also no shortage of bottled water to bring with you to your room, which was offered on most occasions when passing reception. I was pleasantly surprised by the genuine interest showed by every staff member in our stay and the recommendations given by them to enhance it and ensure smooth running of all activities.",5,2022,02,13
234,Carton house.,My husband and I stayed for 2 nights and it was lovely from start to finish. I even had a massage and facial during my stay and it was fantastic. The staff were so friendly and attentive. We will definitely be back again. A beautiful old house turned into a lovely hotel. The history behind the hotel is very interesting and Andrew told us a lot after our lovely breakfast in the magnificent room. The beautiful grounds for long and short walks beside the 2 beautiful golf courses. Something for everyone. Thank you everyone at the hotel for our amazing break together after a long few years of misery. Mark and Joanne.,5,2022,02,10

234,Lovely but pricey,"Too expensive but nice 

Mad money for our interconnecting rooms on Stephen‚Äôs night, but hotel is lovely, reception staff and doorman very pleasant.. was asked to put my mask on while I was rocking a buggy and drinking in our family area which was a bit much but generally nice, pool area is brill",4,2022,01,22
234,Michelle mc Guinness,"I got married in  Carton house in August 2017,and I thought it couldn't get any better but it was amazing the ambiance and the refurbishing is second to none.The  Staff ,food and service was excellent,we had a great meal in clubhouse.Caroline at breakfast was so helpful, Marie in reception couldn't do enough and Anna at the bar so attentive and knowledgeable very professional. Will recommend it to all my friends can't wait to get back for my wedding anniversary. Truly enjoyable day and night from start to finish.",5,2022,01,18
234,"Excellent cocktails, brilliant bartender!","Stunning manor-style hotel and grounds maintained to a very high standard. I visited the Courtyard Bar on Mon Jan 10, and was blown away with the exceptional level of service provided by Mathieu. He went above and beyond to craft bespoke cocktails for my friend and I by taking the time to understand our likes and preferences - even adjusting things from one round to the next. Some of the best drinks I‚Äôve ever had! Not often would you find such a friendly and genuinely interested bartender serving you drinks he took the time to compose himself and experiment with. I‚Äôd also recommend the food in the adjacent Kathleen‚Äôs Kitchen, but stopping by the bar was the real highlight of the evening!",5,2022,01,13
234,Mrs,"I visited Carton House on 22 December with my 7 year old granddaughter and her friend as a Christmas treat. The experience was wonderful - from the beautiful Christmas decorations, the friendly greeting at the door by the concierge to the outstanding service provided by Anna Morgan who managed not just to serve a fabulous  tea with scones, croissants, mince pies and all the trimmings but took the time to regale the girls with some funny anecdotes on the history of Carton House. They said it was the best day ever. A massive Thank you to all at Carton and particularly to Anna who went above beyond to make a simple treat into something memorable.",5,2021,12,29
234,Carton at Christmas,"Fab overnight stay at Carton House, hotel beautifully presented for Christmas, staff welcoming, friendly and helpful, overall a great atmosphere! Enjoyed great cocktails from the bar and lovely food in the Carriage House, breakfast was very luxurious with an extensive menu. Our room was beautifully presented, lovely edible gifts and drinks awaited us and a great nights sleep on very comfy beds! A round of golf on the picturesque  O‚ÄôMeara course on a beautiful day was a great finish to our stay. Covid 19 protocols throughout ensured a safe and comfortable visit.",5,2021,12,26
234,A fantastic stay.  One of the best places we've stayed in Ireland (some small criticism),"My wife and were celebrating our first wedding anniversary.  From the moment we walked through the doors we were well looked after.
Check in had a nice relaxed approach.  We were offered mulled wine which was nice.
Small complaint that a couple arrived after us were checked in before us.

The entire hotel has had a major refurbishment everything about the hotel feels new, restored and very well maintained.
Our room was spacious, the bed was very comfortable.  There were local lemonades complimentary and a bottle of Prosecco was delivered to our room by management shortly after checking in which was really nice.
Hand written cards welcoming us and also another wishing us a happy anniversary are the excellent touches you expect from a luxury hotel.
As with any other Fairmont hotels you get Le Labo toiletries in the bathroom which are excellent.

The hotel offer a text service which comes in really handy.  You can ask them anything and they are back right away.  You can request your room to be serviced at a certain time, ask about in room dining, where is breakfast located etc etc.

Breakfast was one of our favourite parts of the stay.  It was one of the best breakfasts I've had.  Both rooms were stunning, the views over the gardens were excellent and the service was brilliant.

We had dinner in the Carriage house which was also very good.  The quality of the food was very good and prices were reasonable.

The spa was very relaxing however we did find it could be better marked out.  We did find that after our treatment it felt like a bit of a maze to locate the pool then find our way out.  

The bar area was relaxing, they had an extensive range of drinks but it does seem that some of the staff could do with a little more training.
I had a pretty embarrassing issue over the price of a whiskey measure.  I ordered a measure which was priced at 30 and 80 euro.  80 euro being the more limited whiskey so I said I'll just go for the normal one.  When the bill came I was charged 70 euro for a whiskey by the same distillery but wasn't even on the menu.  Thankfully management stood in and charged me 30 euro.  

My only other issue was during our stay one of the evenings I went out to the car to grab my laptop and went to visit the bar.  The same doorman that had greeted us several times throughout our stay rapidly chased after me in the lobby.  ""Are you visiting friends?"" ""Have you made a reservation?""  When I said I'm a guest and you have greeted me several times today alone he did apologise but I felt like he was talking down to me to be honest.  

Since my wife and I have visited it is nice to see the Carton House is now officially recognised as a 5 star hotel.  It exceeded our expectations and I'm glad we chose to stay here.
I've since recommended it to several of my customers and family members, few of which have now booked stays.

One minor criticism regarding the social media account.  I think the hotel should make a point of sharing more genuine customer content on their stories / instagram etc rather than focusing on influencer / sponsored posts.",5,2021,12,23
234,Festive Afternoon Tea,"We had a wonderful time at Cartons festive Afternoon tea. The gold room is stunning and the welcome mulled wine was a pleasant surprise. The staff were always checking in on us which was excellent to see how attentive they were. We had so much fun and would definitely recommend.

The only thing that let us down was when we went to the lounge for drinks afterwards, the service was very poor. We were constantly trying to catch their attention to give an order and they never checked in on us.",4,2021,12,21
234,Not 5 stars all the way !!,"Amazing hotel, we have stay in numerous high standard hotels around the world and we can say that carton house is absolutely stunning. 

Amazing grounds as you drives in. Imaculate golf course. 
Checking in was a little slow as there were only one staff on. Getting to the room was a long walk ,but a nice walk we could say. 

Room are nice, but dirty .. mirror wasn't clean and toilet didn't seems to have been flushed .. next day room was not clean again even we asked fo be cleaned. 

Afternoon tea was absolutely something.. while the room and service are outstanding, the food was not good. Especially the pastry selection, definitely a huge amount of sugar is used .. 

Dinner in Kathleen kitchen was nice. Made up for the afternoon tea. Theo was very funny yet very professional and knowledgeable. Yet ! Kitchen staff seems very disorganized and made the kitchen look very dirty.  Also not wearing their mask at all ! Made my wife feel very uncomfortable. 

Next day dinner in the Morrison Room was absolutely stunning. Food,service, wine pairing and dessert ! (Which made us wondering how is that possible after  the afternnon tea the day before..) 

Spa treatments were average .. 

All together could have been one of the best stay ever but the few goods don't make up for the many bad.",3,2021,12,21
234,Afternoon Tea In Style!,I had the pleasure of afternoon tea in Carton House recently. From the moment we arrived we were greeted by a very dapper friendly doorman and brought to the sumptious surroundings where  things just got better and better. I knew Carton House had revamped but wow the result is breathtaking and of course the festive decorations added to the ambience! The first thing we noticed was how friendly everyone was and there was such a lovely genuine atmosphere. I had called ahead with a food allergy which was taken care of and compensated well with other lovely options. My mother was with me and is quite old with mobility issues..the staff were so kind to her. We started with mulled wine then ordered coffee and speciality tea followed by beautiful sandwiches and scones and cakes. Just when we thought that was it another course came out with delicate festive treats that were made on the property! The crockery and cutlery were to die for and toned in beautifully with the decor... we couldn't manage everything so the staff packed up the remains into the CUTEST boxes ever! That lemon curd by the way was FAB... when you start selling that in one litre bottles i'm in! To be honest we were reluctant to go on the day as my mam was a bit down with all this covid news etc... I am so happy we went ahead and I can honestly say we had a really lovely day...go to Carton House and see it for yourself and afternoon tea is worth every mouth watering cent...,5,2021,12,14
234,Amazing resort,"From the moment myself and my husband walked in we were greeted with smiles from Brian ( concierge) Fiona on reception was a pleasure to deal with on arrival. I loved the informal aspect of check in sat down with Fiona had a chat which was lovely sipping on mulled wine compared to standing at a desk and feeling you are just a number. The attention to detail all across the hotel to all staff members was outstanding.  Richard and his team in the bar to Gary, Robbie (chefs) and the incredible team in Kathleen‚Äôs kitchen. Breakfast staff and afternoon tea all where outstanding. 
I had a spa treatment which was so lovely and relaxing. The hotel was very calm, beautiful walks & stunning scenery. Pool area was nice and spacious and very clean. Overall I cannot fault this stay we had a stunning room in the old house (summer room) it was truly abs experience we will remember. 

Will definitely go back!",5,2021,12,11
234,A fantastic stay,"I stayed in this hotel for one night and I must say it was absolutely fantastic. The attention to detail in the hotel from Loughran in concierge was great and he always had a smile on his face even with the mask! 
Our room was spacious and luxurious. We dined in Kathleens Kitchen with the very pleasant  Robyn giving us a nice table and very good service and I would like to thank Sarah the breakfast supervisor for making our breakfast and stay a special one. She really is fantastic, as were the whole team in this hotel. 

Thanks again from both of us!",5,2021,12,03
234,Amazing!,We had an amazing stay in carton house. The hotel is beautiful and so luxurious. The grounds are fab and from the minute you drive up you feel like you're in a period drama! Breakfast and dinner in the bar were fabulous. Only thing that could be improved on would be the service in the bar. Aside from that the stay was simply perfect!,4,2021,12,02
234,Fab stay,"This is such a beautiful hotel, looks like Downtown Abbey, gorgeous building and grounds. Recently done up, and it looks like no expense has been spared. You get a sense of luxury as soon as you enter the doors.  Beautiful reception area, leading straight to the bar. We loved the decor of our room, and appreciated the chocolates and handwritten note from the manager.  The hotel was spotless throughout, and the staff were extremely attentive. Breakfast in the Morrison Room was a real treat, room was stunning, and staff and food could not be faulted. The only area that could be improved would be the service in the bar, it was a bit hit and miss. We will definitely be back to Carton House next year",4,2021,12,01
234,Magnificent,"Just back from a two night stay at CH.
Always great to return to somewhere that‚Äôs so beautiful, relaxing and special. Was great to see the hotel decked out in all its Christmas jazz. Extremely tasteful and refined might I add. 
Had dinner in the very elegant Morrison Room and it was wonderful. Food and wine were exceptional and also the service. Would like to commend Margo for this. 
Breakfast each morning is always the highlight of our stay at CH. Also in the Morrison room. Scrumptious options to order. Something for everyone. Great service overseen by the very friendly & professional Supervisor Sarah. Who remembered what our hot drinks and juice selections were when we were seated. Impressive!! 
Kathleen‚Äôs Kitchen on the second night was equally great, served by the lovely Julia. 
The menu there, both lunch and dinner has changed for the winter and there are some lovely new additions. The mushroom soup is outstanding! Compliments to the Chef. 
All in all a wonderful visit! 
Shout out to all the brilliant staff ! 
To mention a few,  Anna in F&B. 
Fiona on Reception. Theo Bar Manager  & Samson Guest relations. Thank you ! 
Can‚Äôt wait to return in 2022 
Season‚Äôs Greetings to you all !",5,2021,12,01
234,Beautiful hotel,"We spent one night here last weekend and cannot fault it.  Welcomed on arrival by the doorman and the Porter and our luggage was whisked away from us. Fiona checked us in at reception and she was extremely friendly and welcoming. The room was a fair walk from reception but nonetheless we were very happy with it. Very comfortable, clean and lovely decor. The handwritten note from the manager, and the chocolates were a nice touch.
We ate in the carriage house and overall we enjoyed it. Think the lighting could do with some adjustment, it was very bright and lacked ambiance. Service was generally good. 
We had a few drinks in the hotel bar, and found service poor here overall, bar staff never came to the tables to see if we needed to reorder, we always had to go to bar to order. 
Breakfast in the Morrison room was lovely. Setting is beautiful, food and service was excellent. No buffet but a selection of pastries, bread, cheese & crackers and yoghurt was brought to table. Really well presented.
Overall a great stay in Carton House and we cannot wait to return",4,2021,11,30
234,Weddning anniversary,"Stayed in Carton House on Saturday 27th for one night to celebrate our 15yr wedding anniversary. From the moment we entered the hotel we were welcomed by a very attentive and polite doorman that helped us with our bags and talked us through the check in process. Waited only for couple minutes when we were invited to check in. Fiona at reception was absolutely fantastic!
While we were going to the room porter was advising us on amenities and activities around the hotel, so we were well informed before event going to explore the grounds. When we entered the room there was a lovely surprise from hotel management, anniversary plate with a bottle of red wine and the note from General manager! Absolute delight!
Later in the evening we had absolutely amazing dinner at Kathleen‚Äôs kitchen with a sitting opposite chef‚Äôs kitchen. Staff was very professional and attentive. At the end of our dinner chef came out to check on how was us our meal.
Overall fantastic experience and we will be back again to stay longer!",5,2021,11,28
234,Morrison room,"We ate over the week end at the Morrison room. 
Absolutely stunning room, ambience can be a little odd, maybe the music wasn‚Äôt to our taste but when the restaurant filled up it wasn‚Äôt something we could notice anymore. 

The service was impeccable, Lucas and Paul, to only names two, were very professional, very knowledgeable of the wines and menu, we could see they were very enjoying the job. Which give an all other quality level of service. 

Food was just WOW ! We eat in plenty of high end restaurant. The Morrison room is definitely to this standards. We ate the new 8 courses, and it was stunning on presentation, taste as well as very well thought dish after dish. This young chef (as per the waiters) had an amazing career around the world and it is was a pleasure to taste different flavours and he have a strong hand over his menu. Mussel dish was our favorite ! 

Only small thing, maybe the chef should go out as it would have been a pleasure to thanks him. 
Amazing experience, thanks to the team, and we will be back.",5,2021,11,28
234,"Below Average, not family friendly","We selected Carton house as it was close to where we live and it mentioned Child Friendly. We arrived on Saturday around 12.30 and asked to go eat in the bar with our two young children as we only wanted a small bite as we had booked an early dinner reservation at 5pm, we read the menu and asked if they could replace the gruyere cheese in the cheese sandwich to a cheddar cheese for the children, the answer was no changes to the menu. The waitress checked with the manager, same answer.
 
So we asked what could the children order, the answer was the menu is the menu and if we wanted we could go to Kathleen‚Äôs Kitchen which had a children's menu, so we said ok. There the children had options to eat but the two Adults did not as we didn't want a big meal before swimming and the earlier mentioned dinner reservation, so the children ate and the parents watched. No idea why the staff did not suggest the Carriage House as it has sandwiches and a Children‚Äôs menu.
 
While sitting at the table a waitress walked past going to the kitchen Grunting at something another waiter had done, most un-professional and something we teach our children not to do and then they see grown adults behaving like this. We told the lady at check-in, and she was most apologetic and said this was not normal about the menu and staff and she would inform the manager. We got no feedback.
 
We checked into the hotel and our room was upgraded to the main house because of my Accor status, the room was well decorated and great facilities, TV/Coffee machine etc...  Well-equipped bathroom. Very surprised there was no mini bar in the room, we stayed at Adare Manor for similar prices to the upgraded room and a mini bar was provided and restocked daily. 

We enjoyed our time in the pool with the children and the staff were most welcoming and helpful. The hotel has a great SMS facility to ask questions and ask for help which worked well. The porters at the front door always had a welcoming smile and a small chat to the children which always made them smile. 
 
Do NOT order breakfast to the room at nearly ‚Ç¨50 (Breakfast Charge ‚Ç¨32.50ea, Tray Charge ‚Ç¨10, 10% service charge) plus also remember you paid for breakfast in your booking it becomes an expensive breakfast. I can never remember a hotel charging so much for something people like to do on weekends away. The two people in front of us at checkout had not looked at the price and ordered it, they were not happy.
 
We arrived at the Carriage house at 5pm for our dinner reservation and were seated promptly, highchair and menu delivered promptly but then nothing for 25mins, so we approached the bar and asked if we could order food as the children were getting hungry and they said they would get somebody to come to us. 
 
The waitress arrived to take the order and mentioned they were not taking food orders before then because the Rugby was on, so why take a reservation for 5pm and not tell the guests this information. We ordered our food, 2 mains and 2 kid‚Äôs meals. All the meals arrived at the same time, which is not child friendly, most restaurants would bring the kids meals first. The food was of good quality and can recommend the burger and Guinness sausages and mash. We then ordered two deserts and a pint of Guinness, the pint of Guinness arrived and was drunk, and no deserts arrived, we asked for the bill as the children were falling asleep at the table and asked about the deserts and we were told they were coming. 10 mins later we gave up and left. 
 
We have never been to another restaurant/hotel where 90mins was not enough to have two main courses and two deserts after our earlier lunch issues it did not set a great hotel dining experience.
 
The hotel food offering did recover at Breakfast, Sarah greeted us and the children well and took us to our seats. Whatever we asked for at breakfast we got and there was no hesitation for changes or Individual items for the children, it was just accepted and done which is what you would expect from a 5 Star hotel. The staff were all pleasant and warm which defiantly improved our food experience at the hotel. Maybe the Breakfast staff should train the restaurant staff.

At check out we informed the member of staff of the issues the night before and asked to remove the service charge from the bill which she done but to be honest it felt like we were the one hundred guest to complain that morning and she was tired of hearing the complaints. 
 
In conclusion we paid nearly ‚Ç¨400 for the night away, we were upgraded to a room at twice the price and to be honest if I paid ‚Ç¨800 for the night I would feel hard done by. For that price i would expect a better dining experience, breakfast to room, mini bar, valet parking and remove the 10% service charge in the restaurant (there is no mention of where it goes too) there is no need for it, let customers reward staff directly.  Not sure we will rush back, its not child friendly and since we stay in a lot of hotels the children always come with us and this weekend it was not a seamless experience, there are better 5 star experiences in Ireland that treat children as paying guests with different needs.",2,2021,11,19
234,Outstanding,"Firstly,I have stayed in carton house many times since 2010, always found it pleasant but to say this stay was out of this world is an understatement! The revamp on the hotel during lockdown has me lost for words but I will attempt to give it the review it‚Äôs worth! From the moment I entered the grounds of the hotel until I left, I felt nothing but tranquility and awe at the stunning decor, the amazing and helpful staff, to the sheer beauty of surroundings and wonderful estate! I have also stayed in the shelbourne a few times but this hotel blows it out of the water, you pay for excellence you get beyond that here, sitting in the evening, reading a book or having a drink, in the gorgeous new lounge, is definitely the most welcoming change! Along with the exquisite breakfast which is to die for, so peaceful, and stunning as you look out onto the gorgeous gardens while eating pastries and sipping coffee wishing your life away. I know I have not done the hotel justice in this review but well done to everyone, and thank you from the bottom of my heart, I look forward to my next break away for some peace and quiet.",5,2021,11,18
234,Fantastic,My wife and I had a lovely few days for a birthday. Fantastic food.. breakfast lovely .. Kathleen‚Äôs Kitchen lovely .. The Morrison lovely. Rooms were clean and great and the staff were very nice - Emma and Flavie were very attentive and super nice. Loved it. Next time golf and more spa. Top drawer across the board.,5,2021,11,15
234,Thank You,"My husband and I booked Carton House for a special birthday and we had a fabulous time. Everything from the food, the walks, the beautiful rooms and especially the friendly and courteous staff. We had coffee and drinks in the Carriage House and dinner in Kathleen‚Äôs Kitchen which was delicious. Breakfast was our favourite‚Ä¶ we wanted everything on the menu ü§© compliments to the chef.  We will definitely be back soon.",5,2021,11,14
234,Covid checks,"Lovely hotel, great staff - However none of the eight people from this group who visited Carton House recently and stayed overnight, eat in a number of the restaurants, cycled, played golf, used the spa - nobody was asked for a Covid Cert - Ever!  Unbelievable",4,2021,11,11
234,Beautiful renovation and lovely morning tea!,My friend and I called in for morning tea today and it could not have been a better choice! Kate served us and recommended the coffee and cruffin  (a gorgeous combination of croissant and muffin filled with custard and raspberry sauce). Both were absolutely delish! I had the freshly baked fruit scones and the texture and flavour melted in your mouth.  Thank you to Kate and Katie for showing us the new renovations...fantastic and beautifully done.  We will most definitely be coming back with friends to try the new restaurant and afternoon teas:),5,2021,11,11
234,Highs and Lows,"Firstly let me say that the location of the Carton hotel is just beautiful with the most stunning gardens and nature everywhere, it is breath-taking. Check in was fine, room was not ready and the staff remained seated during check in which I personally find bad training. After a wait, we got to our rooms, however due to the delay with the hotel it left me late for my 3.30 golf game and my wife's spa treatment. No gowns in the bedrooms, I'm sure there is a COVID excuse for this but its amazing what boiling water can do. I consider it shocking there were no gowns. Food in Morrison was excellent, yet in Kates Kitchen it was terribly poor with an extremely restricted menu. We did not dine in the Carriage restaurant as it was outside the hotel and the rain prevented us from traversing across the grounds. Breakfast on both mornings was excellent. The hotel is extremely quiet and everywhere was fastidiously clean.",3,2021,11,10
234,Niamh and Harry were amazing!,"Stayed in Carton House, Niamh and Harry were absolutely amazing. Helped us with everything. 10/10. The restaurant in the Morrison room was also world class. Would recommend to everyone. The grounds are stunning also.",5,2021,11,08
234,Fabulous Hotel,"When we entered the grounds Friday morning the lovely drive up the avenue and the hotel looked amazing. There was a lovely young lad who greeted us and Brian and took us over to check in. We were early for check in (which we knew but we like to arrive early and make the most of our stay) and Fiona never said anything about itüòÅ in other hotels they tell you your too early for check in. Fiona was lovely and friendly, chatted away and explained where everything was. Brian offered to go get our luggage but we done it ourselves later. The walk to our room was lovely, the decor and the smell through the hotel was divine we kept commenting on this.

Our room was fabulous, comfy and everything you need. Lovely balcony to. Great bathroom. We had tea and scones in the courtyard bar and again it was great.  We used the pool and termal suites it was great.

We ate in the Carriage restaurant it was a lovely walk through the hotel and see all the amazing rooms and out into the courtyard to reach the restaurant. Staff friendly, service great. We were asked did we want still or sparkling water. We got still water but didn't realise till the bill came 8 euro for a bottle of water. Next night we were asked the same again and we didn't get the bottled water but staff did come over and fill up our glasses anyway.

Breakfast was amazing you get a platter out with yogurt, Fruit, pastries, cheese, jam. Pancakes was delicious. Next morning we got French toast and scrambled eggs delicious. Thank You to Gwendolen, Felipe (I think that's his name) and the rest of the breakfast team. They were amazing. Staff throughout couldn't do enough for you. We were very well treated. I can't wait to return. ",5,2021,11,07
234,Staff are wonderful.,"My wife and I booked Carton House for a special birthday and we had a wonderful time.  The standards in every respect are excellent: the food, covid safety, cleanliness, the grounds etc.  

The staff deserve a very big mention.  Every one of them made us feel very welcome and they were very attentive throughout.

We had two spa treatments which were both really enjoyable and we ate at the Carriage House and Kathleen's Kitchen.  Souring local fine food is clearly a theme and is done very well.  Breakfast was our favourite - served to the table in a beautiful room overlooking the gardens. 

We hired bikes (free) and cycled around the ground and into nearby Maynooth.  A lovely way to spend a few hours.  We didn't even make it to the pool, it felt like too much effort when we were having such a nice easy going time.  The jacuzzi and sauna were closed, so something to look forward to next time.  The reception/bar/lobby is very spacious and has lots of books sitting around for your use with an Irish history theme - a nice touch.

Our room was superb.  Very spacious and comfortable.  I booked a balcony as an extra but to be honest we didn't get much use of it and it was very small anyway.

If I could suggest two tweaks it would be turn up the heat a little - we found the Carriage House and the bar area quite chilly.  And when I booked our meals in advance I was sent an online form to complete asking questions like is it a special occasions / any dietary requirements etc, but the staff didn't seem to be aware when we arrived in the restaurants.  No big deal in the scheme of things, but it's not cheap to go Carton House so i suppose you want everything to be perfect.

Anyway thanks to all the staff, I'll not name names.  You were all fantastic and I'm sure management are proud of you.",5,2021,11,03
234,"The House and Hotel Staff at the Carton House, Kildare","My husband and I had no expectations of our visit to Carton House Hotel but as we drove along the driveway and looked upon the immaculate lawns, driving range, golf course and the magnificent house we began to realise the luxury of the place we were to spend an evening.  

Even though the Carton House Hotel is in every way luxurious and opulent, from the cocktails served by lovely and attentive staff to the d√©cor and furnishings, this fabulous house with its history, played second fiddle to the incredible staff that serve this magnificent historic house.

From the, knowledgeable, affable and attentive concierge Brian Sutton and the smart young men happy to transport your luggage, to Fiona at reception who brought efficiency, humour and good cheer as did Aine, making us feel we were incredibly welcome to Carton House. To all the staff who made and served delicious food and the staff who worked so hard keeping the hotel immaculate and pristine, to the Spa staff, especially Caitlin who was a warm and inviting person to the spa facilities, knowledgeable about the delightful products on offer and choose for me the perfect oil for the diffuser I bought at the shop.  
Everyone we met at the Carton House Hotel were effortlessly friendly, efficient and offered real Irish hospitality at its very best.

Thank you everyone.

We really look forward to our next visit to Carton House Hotel.

Wendi and Alan Magee",5,2021,10,30
234,Luxurious Carton,"This was our first visit to Carton since the renovations were completed. We really enjoyed our stay. The new decor is amazing and the level of attention to detail is great. 

We ate in The Carriage House and it was lovely. They have done a super job on this part of the hotel. Breakfast in the Manor House was also lovely. Great staff and super food. A real treat!

We enjoyed a walk around the grounds and took in the pool and leisure centre too. All in all, a great trip to Carton. A perfect hotel for both luxury and relaxation. ",5,2021,10,30
234,Just wonderful!,"From the minute we checked in, to play golf, to when we left, having eaten in the wonderful Kathleen's Kitchen, we could not have been treated any better by the warm and welcoming staff at Carton House.
Hadn't been since before the massive revamp and you'd barely recognise the place.
I certainly didn't recognise Kathleen's as the bar of old and as for the food, that was something else!
The menu was so appealing that we didn't know what to choose but the group of 4 each got something different and none of the dishes disappointed.
I'm salivating thinking about the Mackerel starter and the Beef cheek main!
Staff couldn't do enough and made the whole experience
Thanks to all in Carton and best of luck with all the new elements.
Everything I saw and sampled looks like a good investment on your part and we'll 100% be back, and soon",5,2021,10,27
234,24 hours of total relaxation,"A solo trip for a bit of mama RnR and Carton house ticked everything box from the welcome on arrival to superb food and coffee to luxury linen and the most comfortable bed in an elegant room right to the end where a request for late checkout to soak up the last hour to myself was easily accommodated. Each staff member only too happy to do what they can to make my stay that much more comfortable. The front of house staff were the loveliest I have encountered! My only complaint? That I couldn‚Äôt stay another night! üòÖ
Looking forward to my next visit already 
- Elaine",5,2021,10,25
234,The warmest of welcomes,"From our arrival on Friday afternoon to departure on Sunday morning, we were made to feel very very welcome by all staff, and we weren't even in the fanciest of rooms! It was a superb move to go for the 5 course tasting menu in the Morrison Room on the first night, with perfect service from Darren. I really hope Thomas and his team gain the Michelin star they are aiming for, as each little course was a feast for the eyes and belly.
We're not golfers, but managed to fill our time rightly over long breakfasts, swims, spa treatments, walks and a lot of relaxing. A surprise highlight was the historic tour of the old house given by House Manager Harry - well worth asking at Reception about this! We were unable to see any of the rooms in the old house as they were all full, but maybe one day we will be able to afford to stay in one...!
They have long term ambitions to become a five star hotel, and I hope that in time, and when they can find more staff (they were open about this challenge) they reach this goal. Thank you Carton House and all your splendid staff. ",5,2021,10,10
234,Magnificent stay from start to finish,"I cannot speak highly enough of our two night stay. Every member of staff should be praised: on arrival,  Brian and Samson at the front door, Aine, Marie and the entire reception staff and the lobby bar team. 
The Morrison Room dining experience was marvellous. Beautiful surroundings with professional attentive staff, especially Darren, Thomas  and a first class team of chefs. Breakfast each morning was served to the highest standard; Our spa treatments were among the best we have ever had and the staff were first class. We ate in the Carriage House on the second night and while it was not the Morrison Room, we thoroughly enjoyed the meal and ambiance. Again, the staff were excellent.
Special mention to House Manager Harry Glynn for his tour of the original house and for his courtesy, thoughtfulness, insights  and professionalism. 
We are already plotting our next stay - thank you Carton House team. Please pass on our thanks and compliments to the entire staff.",5,2021,10,10
234,Highly recommend,"We had a lovely 3 night stay at Carton House. From check in to departure we had a very pleasant experience. The decor and ambiance was so relaxing. I love the colour scheme. 
Our room was very comfortable. The breakfast menu was extensive and delicious. Coffee served in cafetieres a lovely treat.
We enjoyed evening meals in Kathleen's Kitchen on 2 evenings and in the Carriage House on the other. 
We had planned to do some driving and explore area around, we just walked into Maynooth and explored there. The rest of the time was spent walking around the estate and relaxing. We are not golfers but that made no difference. 
The staff were very attentive, sometimes overly so but were so friendly and polite. Special thanks to Aine who gave us a tour of the House.
Overall a lovely stay in a beautiful hotel and highly recommend this destination.",5,2021,10,10
234,Mrs,"The hotel and grounds are stunning.  The golf courses are immaculate and challenging with greens that are precarious!The food was fabulous and I would definitely  recommend  the Morrison Room. What made the stay truly perfect  for us though was the absolutely exceptional staff who were so friendly, accommodating and efficient from the minute we arrived until the end of our stay. The level of service was impeccable and of the highest standard - very very impressive.",5,2021,10,01
234,Over-priced and badly managed,"Back in August we decided that because we hadn't travelled much during Covid we'd treat ourselves to one romantic night in a luxury hotel. Fancy room! Great food! No kids! Exciting! 

Having booked a 'balcony' room (over 500 euro), we arrived at exactly check--in time (3pm) so we could soak in the elegant and opulent surroundings of this grand country house. We were told at reception that the room wasn't ready yet so why didn't we head to the bar and have a complimentary drink while our bags were brought to the room. Fab! An impressive drinks menu was provided and we choose well. What could go wrong?

Two and a half hours later we remained in the bar, confined indoors because it had started to rain, bored because our bags had been disappeared and slightly tipsy as our complimentary drink had long since been supplemented by the paid-for version.

Finally, we got our key - hurrah! - and a complimentary bottle of wine as an apology for the wait. Not so wise for people who had been soaking up a little too much atmosphere in a bar all afternoon but a nice gesture. A better gesture would have been a partial refund but whatever. We embarked upon the 10 minute trek to our room, past the boundaries of the grand country house and entered into a large extension where corridors upon corridors of identical doors awaited us. Our room was bog-standard hotel style, our balcony was a shared one and our view was a close-up of some trees. 

Luckily we didn't have to stay very long in the room as we had pre-booked dinner for 6.30 having been advised this was one of the last slots left. A quick change of clothes and we journeyed back into the country house to a beautiful and completely empty room where we were served a selection of fancy dishes that were very badly needed after our afternoon of complimentary and not so complimentary alcohol and wolfed down accordingly. As far as I remember, the food was fine. 

The rest of the stay is slightly blurred. We walked around the grounds, we sat in the bar some more and we left the next morning after a complicated breakfast. 

We obviously noticed some staffing issues and we understand that these present difficulties.  We have no complaints about the young people who work there who are doing their best and were always pleasant and as helpful as they could be.  However, we would suggest to the owners of Carton House that staff are paid a decent wage - yes, why not pay them more than they get on the PUP?? And then your guests wouldn't feel compelled to write 2000-word essays on how disappointing their stay was.",2,2021,09,27
234,Amazing hotel!,"Had a fabulous stay at Carton House, very friendly staff, wonderful surroundings! Our stay would not have been the same without Phillip! Both golf courses were in immaculate condition, very helpful caddies.  The Montgomery proving a sturner test than the Omera.",5,2021,09,19
234,Lovely hotel,"Stopped for one night and loved the stay from start to finish.

The staff were super friendly and helpful throughout which really made our stay. 

We had dinner in Kathleens Kitchen which was very nice - delicious selection of meats cut to order in the open kitchen. 

The breakfast was one of the most sophisticated and delicious we‚Äôve had. 

Lovely comfy bed and room spotless. 

Lots of little touches that make the stay superb.

My only slight niggle as a female was the room must have been designed by a man as no mirror to dry your hair near a plug.",5,2021,09,14
234,"Beautiful, elegant hotel!","Carton House is a very special hotel! This was our second time staying, first since the renovations and we were absolutely blown away! The attention to detail is second to none, and the staff are an absolute credit to the hotel. So friendly, kind and attentive- thank you! Our breakfast was absolutely mouth watering in the Morrison Room ( I wish I could make scrambled eggs as good)- everything was so fresh and delicious. We're already planning our next stay!",5,2021,09,14
234,A dream come true,"Wonderful place with a great history, well maintained, staff extremely friendly, courteous, motivated, rooms of first class quality, perfectly clean. Food is incredibly good and competitively priced. In summary: a dream all round, good luck for the future!",5,2021,09,13
234,Fantastic experience,"Amazing hotel, professional staff, wonderful service and great food! From the arrival till departure everything was perfect. The highlight was a breakfast with a lot of choices. Full Irish was served to the table. Everything was fresh and delicious. Highly recommended!!!",5,2021,09,09
234,Old world charm & elegance,"It had been over 10 years since our last stay at Carton house so we were very excited to come back and see how it had changed. The hotel has recently joined the Accor group as the only Fairmount hotel in Ireland and has also undergone major refurbishments and enhancements. From the minute you arrive at the front door you know this is going to be something special. We were checked in by Niamh who was extremely welcoming and ran through all the details of our package to make sure everything was correct. Philip brought our baggage up to the room and was very chatty and friendly. Our balcony room on the end of the second floor had lovely views of the grounds and was extremely well appointed with everything you would need. Our first taste of the magic that is Carton house was afternoon tea in the Gold Salon, talk about a ‚Äúwow‚Äù experience. From the beautiful China crockery to the place settings and then the gorgeous selection of dainty cakes and savory bites washed down with as much hot tea as you can manage. This was the best afternoon tea I‚Äôve had. You really felt like you had travelled back in time to the olden days. From then on every experience was equally amazing. Dinner in the carriage house, breakfasts in the Morrison room and the drawing room, meals in Kathleen‚Äôs Kitchen where we got to experience two different menus all were top quality including lobster octopus and oysters which was incredible . We were meant to have an outdoor picnic one day but of course the Irish weather didn‚Äôt behave. The staff didn‚Äôt miss a beat and quickly arranged for our lunch to be set out in the Mallaghan room, which was a totally novel and fun experience . Anna made sure we had everything we needed and even heated up our scones because that‚Äôs the best way to have them she insisted. At Carton house time goes by  slowly and you find yourself not wanting to leave the grounds for any length of time only to explore the estate on complimentary resort bikes. I‚Äôd especially like to thank Niamh Anna Sarah Hayley Emma and Paul for making our Anniversary so special and memorable. Sasha for giving us an insightful tour of the manor house and telling us some of its secrets. Also Barbara for the ginger and lemongrass tea which was a tonic. 
Our stay was completely relaxing and  unforgettable, one  that we want to repeat many times over in the future.",5,2021,09,08
234,Fabulous luxurious hotel,"My self and my daughter stayed in a suite absolutely pure luxury, cleanliness and quality, we had lunch in the Carraige house and Dinner in Kathleen‚Äôs Kitchen which was amazing and the staff were so friendly and helpful. Breakfast was out of this world loved it. Beautiful swim in the pool and fabulous walks on the grounds. I highly recommend and cannot wait to visit again.",5,2021,09,08
234,"Superb hotel, probably one of the best in Ireland.","The d√©cor and furnishings were absolutely fabulous. The staff were extremely helpful and friendly and were everywhere, on hand even if you didn't expect them to be.
Kathleen's Kitchen is a super restaurant to go to, highly recommend this for ambience and friendliness. 
Plenty to do even if you aren't interested in golf. The walks are as long as you need and really picturesque.
Breakfast room is just so enchanting, beautiful ceilings and wall coverings. Breakfast was a delight too,",5,2021,09,06
234,Great hotel,"Carton house 

Recently redecorated and looks great.

The hotel and grounds look fantastic and in addition to golf there are super walks around the perimeter of the estate and a lovely pedestrian walkway over to maynooth village. If you‚Äôre looking for longer walks there‚Äôs also easy access to the canal and the waterside walk over to maynooth village is lovely.

Restaurant offerings have been revamped and there are three options which we sampled over our two night stay.

The formal high end dining restaurant was delicious but the menu choice at this price point is very limited which for me felt limiting. And while the room is beautiful the experience lacked atmosphere. ( I‚Äôd been to One Pico the previous day so perhaps that clouded my judgement - one pico is for me one of the best restaurants in Dublin & it‚Äôs a significant step ahead of Carton house in terms of dining experience at approx the same price point).

Good news is that Breakfast is now served in the old house and the room is so wonderful. This was the highlight of my dining experience - loved it. The range of breakfast options was brilliant and to my surprise was accompanied by an incredibly generous ‚Äòcake stand‚Äò filled with all sorts of breakfast goodies.

The new bar in the lobby is a wonderful place to sit for a pre dinner drink - this enhancement much improves the look of the lobby area.

Golf club dining is very casual but I loved the buzzy atmosphere - soups on offer were yummy! ( nite - access is limited to members & residents )

Last option was kathleens kitchen - happily recommend this casual Italian style dining option but note that they serve very generous portions so order accordingly.",4,2021,09,06
234,Fantastic,"Great hotel altogether ! 

Beautiful walks around. 
Did not  get to golf but the place looks perfect for it. 
Room aren‚Äôt anything crazy, (bathroom are a little dark), but well designed and bed is very comfortable. 

Heard a few guests complaining about prices .. is it not cheap but also it is a 5 stars hotel and believe they do provide a great service ! 

Staff did look a little bit under pressure but  were very good, lot of attention to details and made us feel very happy. Especially regarding the Covid 19 regulation. 

Exemple, the Morrison room waiter first gave us a little wet towel what a great idea ! 
And also the food was amazing, very well plated and flavor were very Interesting ! Being from the industry myself, we can see it is taking the right way to be an amazing dining experience in a near future

Breakfast was stunning, great set up in the gold salon, lot of choices and food was very tasty. 

Would definitely highly recommend",5,2021,08,27
234,Ta total break,"Carton house was a fantastic experience. From the moment you drive into the beautiful grounds to the service at the front door. 
You are made feel special and as it was our 25th wedding anniversary this is what we wanted. 
The staff are fantastic. The breakfasts amazing apart from our first day when we only got the part you order and not the extras. 
We ate in Katie‚Äôs kitchen and it was a really good take on Mediterranean food. 
We ate in the club house on 2 occasions and it was delicious, plentiful and good value.
Looking forward to a return visit. 
Thanks to all the team",5,2021,08,22
234,Beautiful Hotel & grounds  shame about the dinner.,"The hotel and the grounds are a fitting location and setting for a quality hotel. The reception and lobby lounge area are nice - the majority of the bedrooms are spacious and well equipped but they are a  long walk from reception/the period rooms in the house where you can dine.  The breakfast was good, with a good choice and served by lovely staff in a beautiful period room.  The hotel was good with excellent service.
However dinner options were limited as we did not book far enough in advance and ate in the Carriage House, which was very disappointing. This is a sports bar with large screen TV's and perhaps suits golfers, we found it a soulless place for dinner in a 5 star hotel. However, given the short menu, you would at least expect the food to be great, alas, not so, the Burger, burnt on one side, was very ordinary. My wife had a mild(bland?) Butter Chicken that was initially served cold and was returned to the microwave and back within 5 minutes.  
Perhaps worth mentioning, when my wife phoned reception to ask if she could have Breakfast in bed - she was told it would cost ‚Ç¨32+‚Ç¨10 service per person, even when she explained  our room rate already included breakfast. Still cant believe this could be correct?",3,2021,08,18
234,Superb!!,"My Husband and I checked into Carton house for my Birthday and what a treat! Firstly, we were greeted by Fionn at the door who took our luggage and directed us to the Front Desk where we were checked in by a lovely lady who brought us to the Old House where our room was situated. It featured original floors and windows dated back to the 1700‚Äôs which were beautiful. The room was very clean and had a sanitizing pack for us to use during our stay which showed their commitment to the safety of their guests during covid 19. We had the most amazing fine dining experience in the Morrison Room on our first night. We chose the 5-course tasting menu which was exquisite. Staff were very attentive. We finished the night with 2 old fashions at the bar, which the bartender Lucas, chose for us based on our preference of spirit and they were delicious! The following day after a lovely walk around the estate my children had organized a facial in the spa as a surprise, which was heaven. Kasia left my skin feeling incredible. That night we had a dinner in Kathleen‚Äôs Kitchen and were provided great service and were even told a few historic facts of what the restaurant was once used for when it was a Manor House. I am already planning my next trip to Carton House for our Anniversary in October!",5,2021,08,17
234,Excellent staff and beautiful hotel but early menu was very limited,"The staff are amazing and the property is stunning.
The only issue we had was the more relaxed approach to dining which would have been fine if we were a couple but we had our 10 month old with us. We had to wait an hour between our starter and main course one evening making it very tight with getting our son down to bed - I didn't get to finish my dinner. But dessert was sent to our room later. They offered no charge for our dessert but when I stated it was already part of our stay they just apologised. I think as a gesture here our drinks should have been complimentary - we only had 3 in total. Also only 1 menu had dinners at 5pm again limiting our dinners to pastas or flatbread. Our son gets his dinner at 5.30 and bed by 7 so we couldn't avail of the other menu since that restaurant opened at 6pm. Again all of this would have not been an issue if it was just the 2 of us. 
But the staff were excellent and so welcoming and friendly. And so sweet towards my baby. I would stay here again but maybe just ourselves or when my baby is older",4,2021,08,16
234,Really beautiful and great service,"We recently escaped Dublin for the night and west to Carton House.  The renovation is really impressive, and the service standards excellent from beginning to end.

Our room was in the heritage side of the hotel - super special experience.  We ate lunch the old kitchen, and dinner in the formal dining room - both delicious in their very different ways. 

Highly recommended and will definitely be back.",5,2021,08,10
234,Incredible experience!,"The most incredible weekend in this spectacular hotel! From start to finish Harry (the manager) and his team could not have done more for us. They helped with the proposal to my girlfriend and went above and beyond.
We had dinner in the Morrison room (tasting menu) which felt like we were in a presidential palace, and the food was superb. Our bedroom (the Ashford room) was beyond words ‚Äì my girlfriend even started crying when we arrived in the room.
As a wheelchair user, the accessibility was very good, with lift access to each floor and good floor surfaces throughout. 
Just book this place ‚Äì you will not be disappointed.",5,2021,08,10
234,10/10,"The hotel is stunning and the staff were so warm, friendly and welcoming. The grounds are spectacular and there is so much to see and do. We had a private tour of the hotel where we learned the wonderful history of the estate. The food was amazing also. A very special place - we already can‚Äôt wait to stay again.",5,2021,08,08
234,Wonderful stay,"We just had a wonderful one-night stay in the Carton House. It is the best hotel we have stayed in. It was beautiful and welcoming. The refurbishment is stunning - they have kept true to the history of the estate while ensuring comfort and elegance. 

The staff were very friendly and helpful, especially the House Manager, Harry Glynn. While we were on a walk of the beautiful grounds, it started lashing. Harry came by in his golf cart and asked if we would like a lift. So he gave us a little tour of the grounds including the fabulous Shell Cottage. He very kindly offered us a tour of the house also. The history of the house is fascinating and it was wonderful to learn about its heritage. 

The interiors have been delightfully restored and designed. We had afternoon tea in the Gold Salon, which is incredible. 

We had delicious food during our stay. We really enjoyed our lunch and dinner in the Carriage House and breakfast in the main house. 

There are many areas where you can lounge and very interesting books to flick through while relaxing.

Our bedroom in the garden wing was lovely. It was spacious and the bed was very large. There were armchairs where we could relax. The bathroom had a separate shower. 

The grounds are gorgeous and we were able to take a few walks. 

Overall we had a fantastic time and we will definitely be back soon. We have already recommended the hotel to family and friends.",5,2021,08,07
234,Stunning refurb and a lovely stay,"Had a 2 night stay last week with my husband and toddler & highly recommend. The refurb respects the integrity of the old building with some lovely restoration work and beautiful finishing on modern structure. The landscaping work surrounding the glass walkways is a feast for the eyes.
Disagree with earlier review about hotel not being child friendly. Staff could not have been friendlier or more accommodating to my family. Had a lovely adults dinner in the Morrison room & loved the menu in Kathleen's kitchen. 
Spa was gorgeous-great massage. 
Only criticism was bedroom temp was too high for my liking & rooms in the spa needed  dyson fans which isn't very ecofriendly.
Anyway since refurb one of the nicest hotels I've stayed in & have recommended to friends. We're keen to come back for another break in the winter.",5,2021,08,06
234,Mrs,"I was disappointed you could not rent pay for abit

234,Incredible,"Recently stay with 2 friends at the carton house. 
Absolutely lovely place for a nice relax few days. 
We got lucky and were there on the warmest week of July. 
Hotel itself isn‚Äôt exceptional but it‚Äôs all the small bits added that make it an amazing 5 stars experience. 

Enjoyed everything we did. The golf is exceptional, carriage house service and food was outstanding and vegetarian friendly which is great as one of us is vegetarian. 

Top class for the Morrison room. We had the 5 course, (1 vegetarian) Food was excellent, presentation and service top class and I we are sure it is only the start of it. Well done to the chef ! 

Would very much recommend and come back once Covid regulations smooth a little bit to try out the beautiful spa.",5,2021,08,03
234,Very disappointing stay.,"Having stayed here many times in the last 15 years, we were so looking forward to coming back again in 2021. The refurb is ok but let‚Äôs get into the bones of it. The check in is a disaster compared to the previous check in. Now there are only 2 desks so you have to wait. Not 5 star service. Next, the room we were given was a joke for a family room. Do much so, we were offered 3 different options when we complained. Next. We have taken our children here many times but now, it appears that children are not welcome. Zero food options & zero interest in kids. The food/eating options are really poor. Very little options. We were told by a staff member to head into Maynooth for better options!!!
Restaurants stopped service at 8pm, we couldn‚Äôt get a decent relaxing lunch & the staff were stretched too much. At one stage, the chef in Kathleen‚Äôs Kitchen verbally abused a waiter in front of us for asking for a slight change in a dish. We had dinner booked in the Carriage House only to be told  3 times it had changed. When we got there we were told immediately that we needed to order quickly as the kitchen closed at 8pm. I certainly would not recommend it for families now. It was such a fantastic place before. Such a shame. Fairmont  Group need a serious rethink. It‚Äôs all wrong. Zero atmosphere. Can‚Äôt blame Covid on the short comings this time. 
For the record, we have been here 11 times now. So disappointed.",2,2021,08,02
234,Fabulous 5 star stay üòä,"Had an amazing two night stay in this beautiful hotel. The attention to detail from every aspect is just fabulous. The hotel is a wonderful combination of old and new and has been refurbished to the highest standard throughout. We stayed in the Garden wing of the hotel, in a room which had everything you could want for - luxury bedding and toilettries, coffee machine, mini fridge and ample space to sit and relax. The original house is steeped in history and  we enjoyed a superb breakfast in the gold salon room.  It was lovely to meander through the various rooms, all furnished and styled so elegantly in keeping with the history of the house. We dined in Kathleen‚Äôs Kitchen and the Carriage House - top quality food, service and surroundings.  The staff were so accomodating in providing slight changes to the menu and the food was delicious. The grounds around the hotel were great for walking and cycling and keen golfers would be very impressed with the facilities available. All the staff we encountered throughout our stay were  so welcoming and helpful and provided us with top class service.. We cannot wait to return in the future!",5,2021,08,01
234,Special Honeymoon Stay,"We had the most AMAZING 1 night stay!!! 
Special treat staycation for the first night of our Honeymoon at Carton House. We stayed in a deluxe double bedroom, located in the newly refurbished Garden Wing. 

Travelling from Belfast we found the hotel easily, situated not far from the M50 motorway. We checked in and concierge helped with luggage. Fantastic facilities in our bedroom including bed, bathroom and coffee making all the best we have encountered.

My husband & I booked to use the pool and gym which we found clean, spacious and bright. 

The service at Carton House is what sets it apart as an exemplary destination hotel. Harry the House Manager at our request gave us a beautiful and very interesting tour of the original house and it‚Äôs history. Already impressed and content with our house tour, Harry then offered to bring us on a private buggy tour of the estate. We were taken back by Harry‚Äôs kindness as he went over and above his duties to make our stay truly memorable and for this we cannot thank him enough. 

We feel Carton House is absolute luxury and worthy of any special occasion, or just an excuse to relax in the beautiful surroundings and take time out. 

It‚Äôs a MUST SEE hotel Xx",5,2021,07,31
234,Fantastic,"Most enjoyable break 2 nights B & B and dinner.  First night we dined in Kathleen's kitchen and the second night in the Morrison Restaurant - exceptional fine dining. Lunch was great in the courtyard. We enjoyed the garden wing bedroom.  The staff are 7*.  Sorry I cannot mention everyone, Adrien and the young woman in the courtyard restaurant, June, Lorcan and the fabulous reception staff.  Enjoyable walks and enjoyed lunch in the Carriage House. It was such a relaxing break.  Looking forward to returning.  Some good came out of covid, we would probably never have visited Carton House and now we cannot wait to return.",5,2021,07,28
234,Untrustworthy & Unscrupulous Establishment,"We booked a golf trip to Carton House in April 2021  for 8 for July 24-27th 2021. Roughly 2 wks before travel date we were advised by Your Golf Travel thru whom it had been booked that Carton House had cancelled our booking as they could only cater for groups of 6 stating Covid regulations. When asked they refused to amend our booking to two groups of 4.  We subsequently noticed in the media Chelsea Football club were visiting Carton House on virtually the same dates we had booked and also that a stay at Carton House had more than tripled in price since our booking, and this didn‚Äôt even include the golf aspect of our trip. 
QUESTIONS I would like answered.
1. If Carton House were so keen to abide to Covid regulations why did they take our booking in the first place?
2. Did Chelsea FC bring less than 8 when they were accommodated for pre season matches on virtually the same dates they  cancelled on us?
DO NOT TRUST THIS ESTABLISHMENT WITH YOUR BOOKING, TIME OR MONEY AS THEY HAVE NO SCRUPLES OR HONOUR..  IN ALL MY YEARS TRAVELING  THIS IS THE MOST DISGRACEFUL AND UNSCRUPULOUS BEHAVIOUR I HAVE EVER SEEN FROM WHAT WAS PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT TO BE A REPUTABLE COMPANY.",1,2021,07,28
234,A Fabulous Weekend of Luxury and Relaxation. More than 5 star!,"Last weekend, my husband and I escaped to Carton House Maynooth. It was our first visit since the hotel was redecorated under new FM management. Our stay was fabulous and we cannot wait to go back! The experience was 5-star from check-in to checkout. We were greeted by a lovely dressed and friendly doorman who led us to an organised, friendly and professional team of reception staff. Aine was particularly helpful and really lovely. 

We stayed in the main hotel on the 1st floor. The rooms were exquisite and so clean and comfortable. The toiletries were lovely. Robes were fabulous. Air conditioning in the room was a life-saver, as the mercury was at 32! 

For dinner, we ate in the Main Restaurant for a tasting menu. The food was something else, absolutely delicious and so well presented. The bar service was brilliant and the cocktail menu was interesting, with a bit of history behind each drink. We even got to sit outside under an umbrella in the warm sun for pre-dinner drinks.

We pre-booked the swimming pool on 2 days and it was lovely and quiet.

The CH Breakfast has been my favourite for years, but this time is was even more amazing with full table service and plenty to eat. First we were presented with a platter of pastries, cheese and bread, fruit salad and yogurts with juices. Then we got to choose 2 further courses from a menu. The poached eggs... !! We couldn't move after.  

The grounds of the hotel were also delightful and so well kept. The Rose garden behind the main house was amazing and the smell of so many roses in one place was lovely. We did the red and yellow walks to walk off the endless eating and drinking. Once you check-in you really don't need to leave the grounds as the hotel has everything you need in one place. Can't wait to go back there again!",5,2021,07,28
234,5 Star - Levels Above Most 5 Star Hotels,"Stayed here for one night.

From check-in you receive a true 5 star experience with chairs situated at the check-in desk so no standing during check-in. Sure, that‚Äôs not too amazing on its own but it is the start of a true 5 star experience.

A nice touch is even the room key. There is an ever so slight matt-finish which removes a plastic feel. Again, nothing too outstanding in itself but all these small details allow it to be a 5 star in its own class when compared with other 5 stars.

The hotel rooms are very impressive as you would expect. The in room facilities are high quality also. Large tub, nespresso machine with plenty of supplies and mini fridge. Large comfortable bed.

Had tea and scones in the bar which was a lovely experience. Hotel staff are young and very attentive.

Dinner in Kathleen‚Äôs Kitchen; lovely restaurant with mostly Italian cuisine.

The grounds are very well kept and walking before and after dinner was fantastic. Walking around inside the house/hotel is a great experience in itself.

Breakfast in the morning is a real quality feature. Easily the best breakfast I have had. From the surroundings of the room to the quality of the food provided and amazing staff service. Real 5 star experience.

There was a slight issue with a fire alarm sounding but management dealt with it in true 5 star fashion in addressing it the following morning.

The hotel and grounds are very similar to Castlemartyr in Cork but Carton House just beats it in my opinion.

With many 5 star hotels now in Ireland, this hotel shows that there are levels within the 5 star bubble.

To use a sporting analogy, in mixed martial acts, specifically the UFC there are elite fighters in the amazing lightweight division. From Conor McGregor to Dustin Poirier to Justin Gaethje, they are all elite lightweight fighters but there are still levels within the elites. Khabib Nurmagomedov beat them all showing he is the elite of the elite.

Carton House is the 5 Star Khabib.",5,2021,07,27
234,Didnt get the Bang for our Buck,"Came here for our baby moon, due any day! 
Hoping to be pampered and spoilt rotten..very disappointed with the Spa as the jacuzzi, sauna, steam room and even showers are all closed and just the pool open. 
Dinner was top class, the tasting menu was sublime ( totally recommend it!) and the service almost impeccable!
Had high hopes for breakfast but it was like eating at Fawlty Towers..the hot food was served up before the fruit/ croissants etc. Couldnt get Anyone to give us toast, butter or juice, asked several people several times but NO luck, hugely disappointed with the service.
Will not be returning or recommending this hotel",2,2021,07,26
234,Carton transformed,"We stayed here a couple of weeks ago for two nights and it was excellent. We had stayed at Carton a few times in its previous incarnation and it really is like a different hotel in terms of luxury and service. It is wonderful that the old mansion now forms a key part of the experience, with breakfast in the really grand reception rooms. Breakfast was one of the highlights - really well designed for Covid times with a cake stand selection of items (bread, mini muesli, cheese, mini pastries etc) brought to your table and a really extensive menu to choose from. It all felt very generous and pampering (and much better than the breakfast we experienced in Powerscourt last year).

The bar area is roomy, high ceilinged and well spaced out and felt very safe. The interesting books on Irish history and design on the tables is a lovely touch and adds to the country house feel. We had a lovely picnic at the tower in the grounds  - but be warned, it was more like afternoon tea for 4 than lunch for 2!

From a Covid point of view, the Carriage House with barn door open felt safer than Kathleen's Kitchen. A few quibbles. Our suite didn't have a bath. Also, Kathleen's Kitchen should perhaps be renamed - the food is heavily pasta-based, which the name wouldn't really lead you to expect!

Overall our stay was lovely. Lots of attentive staff everywhere. The text service where you receive a text asking you if everything is to your satisfaction is a brilliant innovation - it really made us feel looked after and was an easy way to raise anything, rather than leaving it until check out when the hotel can't really do anything about it. A special shout out for Martina and Niamh on reception and Gavin at breakfast - three smiling professionals who made our stay memorable. We hope to return to sample the fine dining in the Morrison Room.",5,2021,07,26
234,Girls break bliss,"We spent an overnighter at Carton as a group of four gals to celebrate a big fabulous birthday and all I can say is WOW, WOW, WOW.  
Everything from the welcome, to the ambience, to the staff was just sublime. The recent upgrade has taken it to a new level‚Ä¶ can‚Äôt recall ever having such a decadent breakfast in such a beautifully historic venue.  The food was top notch - the five course tasting menu was a real treat. 
We also did a golf lesson and it was so much fun, followed by a coffee in the Carriage House.  Carton House is truly operating at the top end of the market and I couldn‚Äôt recommend it highly enough.",5,2021,07,22
234,"Service, food, golf and grounds incredible.","We've stayed many times at the hotel, however, this stay for sure topped it. The new renovation's, the staff and the quality of food was exceptional. Highly recommend for a visit with friends, a romantic stay or for a nice round of golf.",5,2021,07,22
234,Fantastic Stay,"I recently stayed at Carton House with 3 friends, to celebrate a missed birthday. Having stayed here several time‚Äôs before I was really excited to see the newly reimagined hotel. And it really was wow!! From start to finish. The interiors are stunning and the service was excellent. We stayed in the old house, which I would highly recommend as a great, the rooms are spacious, beautifully decorated, bathrooms are fab and showers excellent. The view over the golf course was amazing. 

We booked a golf lesson with Seb, which is highly recommend for something different. We are not golfers but loved it and Seb is such a gent. 

The pool was nice and relaxing for an hour before dinner

We booked the five course dinner in the Morrison Room. It was such a treat, each course was beautiful, the room was amazing and the staff super efficient and friendly. 

The next morning, breakfast in the gold salon was just another wow... such a beautiful and comfortable setting for breakfast. Food was excellent, and great options on the menu. 

We didn‚Äôt want to leave so after another hour or so lounging, we headed to the club house for a coffee before we hit the road. Another dining option and the setting was so comfortable, the team there were super friendly too and so attentive

Overall Carton House exceeded expectations. I loved it before, and even more so now. They have new experiences opening up over the next few weeks and I can‚Äôt wait to try them. Already planning to go back",5,2021,07,22
234,Wonderful Stay,"From check-in to check-out, we had a wonderful stay at Carton House. The team is so attentive. We booked Carton House for a romantic weekend away to celebrate our anniversary. We were met by The General Manager,  Mr. Mangan on arrival and were so delighted to be led to a beautiful suite, we had booked a House Garden Suite.....WOW...it was so spacious , beautifully designed and had stunning views over one of the award winning gold courses. We had amazing cocktails before dinner in the bar followed by a beautiful 3 course dinner in The Morrison Room, Compliments to Chef in the Morrison room, the food was superb. Their menu is beautifully designed and Thomas the Director of Food and Beverage provided plenty of the right recommendations. A big shout out to Harry Glynn who was so professional and accommodating throughout our stay he even provided a private tour of the grounds in a Golf Buggy, it was great fun! The Carton House Team all have that professional and caring attitude and we just cannot wait to go back, we would highly recommend it!",5,2021,07,22
234,"Grandest of Culinary Experience at the Carton House, A Fairmont Managed Hotel in Kildare","You know when you receive one of those emails that is just right, the Grandest of Culinary Experience at the Carton House, A Fairmont Managed Hotel in Kildare was one of these. 

The experience included sampling the finest of locally sourced Irish produce and meet with the Chef‚Äôs and suppliers who provide these unforgettable dining experiences. 

3 night‚Äôs luxurious accommodation in the Presidential Suite of The House.  Room Description: The moment you step across the threshold of our opulent Fairmont Presidential Suite, the grandeur of yesteryear becomes apparent - historical luxury in the most opulent of settings. The room did not disappoint, it was amazing with views over the Rose Gardens, driving range, golf courses and Tyconnell Tower was spectacular. 

Enjoy locally inspired refreshments on arrival in our Duchess Suite with our Hotel Manager and exquisite champagne and treats in your Suite on arrival. We were met by the General Manager and House Manager on arrival, which a glass of champagne and Guinness for me! I had my first ever fresh oyster‚Ä¶.(Not sure about these). The Coolatin mature cheddar cheese and truffle croquetas and the Beef and Bone Marrow arancini were wonderful and tasty. 

The breakfasts were amazing, and you had a choice of which rooms to sit in. Luckily, we sat outside and enjoyed the glorious sunshine you get in Ireland on two mornings, on the last day we enjoyed eating in the Gold Room, a spectacular ceiling. 

Private cheese and wine tasting in the cheese pantry with a local cheese supplier and our resort sommelier.   Avril of Irish School of Cheese explained the Irish Cheese Revolution and we enjoyed Mossfield, Cais Na Tire and Crozier Blue!  With some perfectly matched wines; Patrick Javillier Meursault with the Cais Na Tire; Vosne Romanee Les Chalandins with the Mossfield and Gevrey Chambertin 2014, Domaine Taupenot-Merme with the Crozier Blue the team who were extremely knowledgeable. 
 
Chef‚Äôs Table dining experience on one evening in Kathleen‚Äôs Kitchen, we had a table in front of the chef‚Äôs and as they cooked food was being delivered.   

We had a wonderful picnic relaxing out by the Tyconnell tower enjoying a magnificent picnic with the wine being opened for us, how magical it was. (This was extra)

Irish whiskey tasting experience in The Whiskey Library, unfortunately my wife did not partake, shame really, I enjoyed doubled quantities of Irish Whiskeys, enjoying Yellowspot 12 yr. Redbreast 15yr and Jameson 20 yr., With some great Connemara and Teeling as finishers.

The Executive Chef kept checking in to see how we were getting on. He introduced us to other chef‚Äôs throughout the weekend. It was good to meet the Chef who produced the Private 8 course tasting menu on one evening in the Morrison Room, what a great menu it was, truly outstanding and worthy of at least a one Michelin Star..

We thoroughly enjoyed the chocolate making, we love chocolate. And we will be making the chocolate pistachio truffles. The Chef was brilliant, he explained his techniques well and we created the most outstanding truffles and Mendiants! 

The Team at Carton House created an outstanding package, we felt extremely welcomed and treated like royalty. The little touches were clear as lot of thought and preparation had gone into making the Grandest of Culinary Experience outstanding. It was! We loved our visit, the experience and will return again.",5,2021,07,21
234,Absolutely amazing,"We stayed at Carton House for 3 nights in July 2021.  We have travelled quite a bit in the past and enjoy high end trips and food.
Our experience at Carton house was outstanding in every way.  The Hotel itself, the service, the food and facilities are absolutely second to none. 
I am sure it won't be long before they win serious awards.  
Our room was one of the best we have stayed in and EVERY staff member we came in contact with was accomplished, professional, helpful and very warm and friendly.  They really couldn't do more for you.
We enjoyed an outstanding tasting menu, a fabulous meal in Kathleen's Kitchen, wonderful breakfasts and a 1st class picnic in the grounds.
We booked a fishing trip which was fabulous fun, went cycling, hit some golf balls on the range, made chocolates and tasted cheese, wine and whiskey.  EVERYTHING WAS AMAZING.  We will be going back just as soon as our diaries can make the time.  Highly highly recommended.  
p.s. we also had massages in the Spa which were fabulous.",5,2021,07,20
234,Beautiful experience in a fabulous hotel,"I stayed here last week with my husband for our anniversary.  The hotel is absolutely exquisite.  The service was unbelievable - fast, efficient and friendly in all areas.  They have a text service which is set up on arrival and anything you need is delivered to your room within minutes from sending a text to the allocated number. 

We had a beautiful meal in the Morrisons Restaurant which was just perfection!  Not only did every course look like a piece of art, it tasted unbelievable.  The flavors in every bite was quite impressive! 

Overall we had a lovely night away and would highly recommend the hotel.",5,2021,07,19
234,Highly recommend,"A beautiful hotel, all staff were attentive, friendly and polite. Choice of restaurants and menus to suit all tastes, extensive choice of breakfasts served in amazing surroundings and dinner was sublime. Highlight of our visit was our guided tour of the house and grounds with Harry. His knowledge of the estate and family added another dimension and truly made this a stay in a luxury hotel. Carton house has many many assets but uppermost are the staff, particularly Harry. Look forward to returning.

234,10 / 10 for Fab Carton House!,"We had an overnight in Carton House with a game of golf on the wonderful O'Meara course.  The golf was special and very well run by the friendly ranger.
The revamp of the hotel is fantastic.  Everything is perfect.  The staff, without exception, were friendly and very helpful.  We were particularly lucky to get chatting to Harry Glynn.  He offered to take us on a tour of the house and was very knowledgeable.  We thoroughly enjoyed this history lesson!
Overall, the whole experience was very special and we very much look forward to returning soon.

234,Impressive surroundings,"A one night stay following the reopening post Covid 19.   The Hotel has just reopened after a big revamp as well.  I was very impressed with the staff, surroundings, food etc.  The public areas are beautiful as are the grounds.

Bedrooms are nice but nothing special compared to the rest of the hotel.  Breakfast was excellent.  The leisure centre is nice but limited due to Covid.  

Overall I would highly recommend.",5,2021,07,13
234,"Beautiful and spacious surroundings, great service and very relaxing",Spent 2 nights at Carton and enjoyed every minute! Everyone we met was very helpful and friendly. Bedroom was  spacious and very comfortable. Text messaging service was a very good option for COVID situation and all requests were dealt with very quickly. Manicure from Katie was particularly good. Breakfast served in fine dining room with a lovely view of golf course and had lunches and dinner in Carriage house. Nice relaxing casual dining which was exactly what we wanted. Did not get to enjoy the walks within the grounds of the hotel but looking forward to that on the next visit! Will definitely return!,5,2021,07,12
234,"Carton Gets Fairmont Lift, Now A True 5 Star Resort","Carton House has definitely been changed for the better.  We checked in for a well deserved break after a very busy year.  The look of the house and its dining facilities has neon through a remarkable transformation and yet bring you back to the comfort and elegance of an old country house.

We tried everything food wise during our stay from creamed tea, breakfast in bed, the casual fair in Cathleen's Kitchen to the exquisite 5 course dining menu in the fabulously appointed Morrison Suite.  It was all excellent.  Presentation was magazine photogenic and it was all delicious to eat.

The true delight was the warm welcome and the professionalism of the staff.  They were knowledgeable and tactful in equal measure.  If you can grab him, Harry Glin's guided tour of the house and estate is well worth experiencing.

We were so busy enjoying ourselves over the two days we didn't even get near either golf course - that'll be for the return visit.

Thanks Carton House, it was a real pleasure.",5,2021,07,10
234,So disappointed,"Excellent check-in and reservation staff (Aine in particular was superb). 

Dining experience very poor. While staff were friendly they were slow to take orders and more often than not, forgot to bring requested items. It all started with coffee and scones on arrival..... no milk, scone hard and over heated, no butter/jam etc. Lunch & Dinner were much more of the same & very frustrating; mistaken orders, forgotten orders, no soup spoon, milk for tea (I could go on!). When we made a complaint the manager remarked on the number of new inexperienced staff and offered us the wine complimentary. While a nice gesture it did not make up for the disappointment that far. 

The food was generally mediocre for lunch (soup over seasoned, thin sourdough bread without bitter or oil, and a charcuterie board which was tasteless (save for a huge dollop of mustard) and lovely toasted sourdough bread which was inedible and dinner but breakfast was really lovely. The tiered cake stand with a selection of cereals, fruit and pastries was a lovely touch and the breakfast room was stunning! 

To top off the calamity of our 24hr stay, there was a power cut in the local area and two out of the three generators for the hotel did not function. Thus, our night in the room was in complete darkness AND there was no water in the bathroom (toilet included) until the following morning. Needless to say that taking off our makeup & brushing our teeth with the complimentary still water did not go down well given this was supposed to be a 4-star (and planning to be 5 star soon!) Hotel experience. 

At check out we recieved a verbal apology and a courtesy 45e off the total bill. Again a nice gesture but what an utterly disappointing stay!",2,2021,07,10

234,A Fantastic stay at The Fairmont Carton House not to be missed !!,"A fantastic memorable stay at Carton house fairmont resort !!
We recently stayed at the newly renovated Carton house. All the staff were extremely friendly and attentive and the hospitality shown to us was brilliant.
We had a guided tour of the house and estate which has a  truly fascinating history and some breathtaking grand rooms which need to be seen to be appreciated.
All the food was outstanding and it was also nice to have dinner in the aptly named ‚ÄúKathleen‚Äôs Kitchen‚Äù .. the original kitchen of the house with its original stove still standing!
It‚Äôs a truly unique resort where the old is beautifully mixed with the new
Modern part of the hotel.
We also had the use of the hotel bikes and  took the opportunity to cycle all around the estate and take in the breathtaking views. A senior staff member even organized a super Picnic for lunch as we had a lovely warm sunny day  and this was delivered up to us at the Tryconnell tower which overlooks  the grand carton house. 
Top marks to the new general manager for providing such great service under tough restrictions due to only reopening a few weeks before our stay!
We plan to stay again around Christmas and experience the resort in the winter season.
5 stars all the way",5,2021,07,07
234,Definitely not 5 star,"Had great expectations but oh! What a disappointment. After a long day, Just wanted a simple cup of tea and a sambo on arrival but after trudging about 1500 metres in circles ( the property is 950m end to end) the only thing available was a a takeaway sandwich  in plastic wrapping from the 'Hatch' beside the golf pros hop. Only thing for dinner was pizza or pasta for ‚Ç¨55 per head in the little ground floor caf√©. So canceled our reservation and ate out in town.
We were in 165 which us about 500m from Reception. 
Definitely not 5 star or anywhere near.
If you must stay here ( and I won't be again) ask where your room is and make sure you bring your walking shoes! If you want to get your steps in, then this is the place.",1,2021,07,07
234,Luxurious staycation,"We recently stayed in the fabulous Carton House for a girls night. We received a very warm welcome from both Philip and Ellen upon arrival. We received the highest standard of service from the moment we arrived until the moment we left which is very rare to find these days. This was my first time to stay in Carton House and it will definitely not be my last. The food in the Carriage House was excellent and the staff were extremely friendly and helpful, especially Selina. I would definitely recommend this hotel to friends and family and I look forward to returning soon.",5,2021,07,06
234,Room to improve,"Spent 2 nights with partner in June. Didn't get off to the smoothest start. We killed time in Maynooth  to avoid turning up ahead of 3 pm check in.  However, on arrival, are room wasn't ready until 4.30 pm. This was a similar problem for the couple that checked in ahead of us. I note, that you can pay extra for the privilege of an early check in, maybe you should be compensated for a late check in.

To kill time, we ordered drinks to have in the courtyard. Mine arrived promptly but a bailey's coffee for my wife  we were told would be out shortly, a delay arising due to the coffee machine being broken. We waited and  waited, I had finished my drink, when a waitress arrive to tell my wife, they couldn't fulfil the order because they had no cream! simultaneously, another waitress arrived with the ordered drink! not sure what was going on.

The room was big and spacious.  The website for booking, isn't the most user friendly and we weren't too sure what we were getting.

The breakfast is a real treat in a beautiful room.

The dining options in June were  limited.  We had pre booked Kathleen's Kitchen for the two nights. While the food was fine the first night, we found the Italian style menu rather limited, so we cancelled the option to dine there on the second night. 

While there were hiccups, all staff we dealt with were extremely friendly and helpful which always lessens any inconvenience.

Would we return? maybe, would feel the need for better value for money and better dining food options.",4,2021,07,06
234,Perfect staycation,"We booked to go to Carton House on a girly staycation. Upon arrival we were greeted with a warm welcome from Philip. Check in was very smooth and staff were warm and friendly. We stayed in a lovely luxurious room with a stunning balcony overlooking the golf course. The room was comfortable and very clean. We had a great lunch in Kathleens kitchen. We headed to the spa for some pampering and relaxation. April was my therapist and the aromatherapy associates face and body ritual left me feeling refreshed and relaxed. Dinner and drinks in the Carriage house topped off the end of a great day. The staff in the Carriage house were very friendly especially Selina and Conor who looked after us very well. The fish and chips were that good we went back the following day to have them for lunch before leaving the hotel. Breakfast in the stunning Morrison room was one of the best breakfasts I‚Äôve experienced in a hotel. We finished up our trip with renting bikes and having a picnic at the boat house. 
We will definitely be back and hope to stay longer next time. Will definitely be recommending to family and friends!",5,2021,07,04
234,Derek Delany,"Stayed in carton house at the weekend for 2 nights and it was amazing beautiful grounds the room was unreal ,the food was lovely different menus to suit everyone and the spa treatment was lovely with relaxation room after with a lovely swim in the pool would recommend it to anyone planning a luxurious night or 2  away staff were all lovely and very helpful.Look forward to return visits.",5,2021,07,01
234,Lovely revamp poor food and unprofessional service,"The revamp of the hotel lobby main house is lovely.
The service while friendly is chaotic and unprofessional by some staff to exceptional by front of house bar manager Anna.

The only food options we had on our Monday Tuesday night stay was Kathleens Kitcheen.
Limited flatbread and pasta offering in a room that doesn‚Äôt work as a restaurant. The lack of outdoor seating in the beautiful courtyards is a missed opportunity.

We opted to try the hatch take away service in the golf courtyard but the refrigerated pre made sandwiches and rolls were awful.

Breakfast while in lovely rooms is chaotic with poor erratic service.
Trying to combine food drink delivery on time cooked correctly and hot is a fate yet to be achieved on our two attempts.
The last day we were sat at a 4 top table as. Party of 2 we had to ask for the additional settings to be removed to make space. The food on the last day was good but we waited 45 minutes for 2 omelettes.

I hoped and wished for better I cancelled an additional weekend booking I had made for August on check out.
Carton will have to up its offering to attract repeat business.",3,2021,06,30
234,Great stay,"My wife and I stayed for 2 nights in June and had a great time. From the moment we checked in we felt very safe. For example, the pens, the credit card machine, and our room keys were all wiped in front of us before we used them. Everything in our room was very clean too. 

Our room was amazing, with a great view of the rose garden and golf courses. There are some signed walking trails which were really nice too. 

Our room was in the ‚Äúold house‚Äù part of the hotel, which is like a stately home with ornate decoration and artwork. This would be worth visiting if it were an attraction in its own right, so to get to have a full Irish breakfast amidst it was special. 

Service was excellent - there was always somebody helpful and friendly on hand throughout the hotel. 

We had a really excellent stay and are already thinking about when we can return. ",5,2021,06,29
234,A truly fabulous experience,"What a place! My friend and I arranged a girly catch up in Carton House on Thursday night. I‚Äôd stayed there a few times before but not since Fairmont took over, rehauled and revamped this hotel into absolute luxury. It has always been a great property with a lot to offer (golf courses, spa, leisure, walking trails etc etc) but it now rivals the best 5*‚Äôs in Ireland!

We stayed in the very charming and elegant old house in a very luxurious room. Le Labo toiletries are always a good sign! We ate in The Morrison Room which is the new restaurant and in the old wing of the hotel with magnificent views of the gardens, beautiful high ceilings etc.

The food was excellent and I doubt it will be long before they receive a Michelin star not just for the food and setting but exceptional service. Thomas and the team looked after us so well.

Breakfast the next morning was plentiful with a great a la carte menu including Avocado Toast and Eggs Benedict. Great coffee and juice and an afternoon tea style serving of continental items.

The lady who checked us out offered us waters for the journey, such a simple yet thoughtful touch. Everything from the flowers to the staff uniforms to the level of courtesy and service screams luxury!

Carton House has gone to that next level. From a great hotel to exceptional. K Club beware, there‚Äôs a new and very sophisticated kid on the block !",5,2021,06,25
234,Bad Service and lack of genuine hospitality ,"My wife and I decided that we needed to get away and we‚Äôd heard the promotion of Carton House on RTE, radio 1 and thought that if they were promoting themselves, let‚Äôs see what they are like. 

They have just been renovated apparently we haven‚Äôt stayed before, so cannot compare. The guest rooms in my opinion were average and I‚Äôve definitely stayed in better rooms, yet the price felt that we were being charged for a newly renovated room. These rooms cannot have been in the renovation program. The corridors are so dark, long and empty to get to the room that when you find your room, you are always happy to have made it.

The servicing of the guest room was prompt and the housekeeping staff‚Äôs attitude was much better than the reception, restaurant and bar staff. 

We thought that there was little or nothing to do for a couple on a leisure break, yes, you can walk around, but with Covid lockdowns, we‚Äôve all done a lot of walking.

Staff attitude was so poor, they were obviously under pressure, due to under staffing maybe, not sure, but they felt hassled and we felt guilty for asking questions and special requests.

Food was standard fayre and wine list predictable and overpriced. 

Overall, we will not return or recommend. It‚Äôs another example of a hotel shouting about being renovated and ‚Äúaren‚Äôt we great‚Äù, without the training, attitude and substance behind it to back it up. 

We felt ripped off when we got our bill at the end of our stay, we decided to pay it and chalk it down as a lesson learned. 
",1,2021,06,24
234,Absolutely Fabulous,"Just returned from a trip to Carton house and I must say in all my times staying in different hotels I have never been so well looked after, 12 of us stayed on a overnight and played 2 rounds of golf and while the golf was excellent and the two courses were fabulous I must say the way we were looked after in the hotel was second to none, the staff couldn‚Äôt do enough to help us, Thank ye so much and I‚Äôm really looking forward to going back again üëèüëè                     Regards Willie Morrissey",5,2021,06,21
234,Simply Faultess,"When I read about Carton House now coming under the Fairmont banner I was very eager to experience their new offerings. I am very fortunate to stay in various hotels and am a diamond member with Hilton. I chose to stay from Monday to Friday on a half-board basis. After arriving by train, a quick 10 minute taxi ride to the hotel brought me to the new front door. The excellent David at concierge greeted me with a warm smile and greeting by name which is always a good start to any stay. Aine and Marie checked me in flawlessly and i was on my way to my room in minutes. A beautiful natural light filled corridor brought me to my Fairmont room in the Garden Wing. My room was fantastic. It had the Fairmont ""feel"" with soft carpeting and two cosy armchairs. The bathroom was perfect with a separate shower from bath. The bed was huge with comforting support. However it was the size of the room that really won me over. It was a big as a junior suite in other hotels I have stayed in. 
Being looked after by Anna, Grace and Emma in Kathleen's kitchen each evening was a delight and they are three shining lights of Carton House. Dinner is cooked right in front of your table with any small menu request immediately looked after. To witness up close the skills of all the chefs was amazing with the food equally so. A must for any guest.
Shortly before checkout I met an old friend Harry who I knew from previous Dublin stays with Hilton. As professional and polite as ever all of his colleagues will learn a lot from his extensive hospitality experience. A valued member of any hotel.
All too soon my stay was up and it was time to checkout. This is just a snapshot of all that is on offer in Carton House. There is so much more to do and experience in this resort and I look forward to doing so on my next stay. The only Fairmont managed resort in Ireland is sure to delight guests well into the future  just as it did to me.",5,2021,06,21
234,"Wow, Just Wow!!!","Just finished off my 50th birthday celebrations at Carton House & what a way to do so! The hotel has just been refurbished and i must say they have certainly done a fantastic job. We booked the 'Complete Resort Package', 2 nights B&B, 2 evening meals, 1 picnic lunch, wine tasting & spa treatment, it was truly amazing! The staff were brilliant, could not do enough for you, they shared old stories about the house which was a lovely touch. We had a picnic up by the tower, baskets filled with the most fantastic selection of food & drinks. The new Morrison room & refurbished Kathleen's kitchen amazing, the new bar layout much much better than before, the new wine room, i could go on & on. We stayed in the house, rooms overlooking the gardens & golf course, its just all breathtaking! A big thanks to Selina for giving us such a warm welcome, Fiona & the girls on reception, Gavin from breakfast & delivering our picnic, Thomas from the wine tasting, Grace in the bar, if i could remember all their names i would mention them, they really made our stay so special. I cannot wait to return again, THANK YOU ALL xxx",5,2021,06,15
234,Stunning renovation!!,"After many years staying at Carton House, we were so excited to return to see how the refurbishment turned out and we certainly weren‚Äôt disappointed!! 

Firstly, special thanks to Fiona in reservations who very kindly changed our reservation four times over the last year due to COVID and the hotel not being able to open.  From check in to check out , all the staff were excellent and can‚Äôt do enough to make sure your stay is perfect! 

We stayed in the Victoria Suite, which is a personal favorite of ours and it has been completely redecorated in a style more keeping with the period of the house. It‚Äôs a beautiful suite, very comfortable bed and all the little extras of a five star hotel. There was no turn down service but I presume this is because of COVID. I would definitely recommend staying in the old house , it really makes your stay extra special. 

We had dinner in Kathleens Kitchem., unfortunately no other restaurants are open on a Sunday night at the moment. It‚Äôs more of a casual dining experience and it was nice but not a wow meal. I would definitely try the Morrison Room on our next visit, it looks so beautiful!

Breakfast the next morning in the Gold Saloon was excellent. Such a stunning setting to start the day and the service and food delicious!  Ginger shots on the way into breakfast was a lovely touch! 

Everything is luxurious and beautifully finished. The new bar area is just amazing and so relaxing! It‚Äôs great to have a hotel to rival Adare Manor and Ashford Castke so close to Dublin and the East Coast.  We really enjoyed our long awaited night away and felt so refreshed after our stay. It won‚Äôt be long until we are back and would 100% recommend a stay in this stunning hotel!!",5,2021,06,15
234,Superb experience,"We stayed on a Saturday night with 1 year old toddler and friends. It‚Äôs a fabulous hotel with great facilities. Looks stunning after the refurbishment. The hotel grounds are in great condition. 
Check in was very pleasant and efficient. Had lunch in Kathleens kitchen which was nice and casual, food very tasty. Followed by dinner in the Morrison restaurant, which is a fine dining restaurant. It‚Äôs was a culinary delight! Service was superb, exceeding our expectations.
Will definitely return in near future.",5,2021,06,13
234,Amazing Stay,"I was lucky enough to be treated to a night away at Carton House on their first night of opening - what a special place, we‚Äôve made another booking for August already! The staff were so great, made us feel so welcome.. the seated check in was very special .. Aine was so helpful. We had drinks in their new bar - it was so luxurious, felt like we were a million miles away from home and all things pandemic. We decided to treat ourselves (why not it‚Äôs been so long since we‚Äôve stayed in a hotel!) to dinner in their new restaurant The Morrison Room - this was one of the most unique rooms I‚Äôve ever been in and the food was incredible.. also got to go for a swim in the pool (again, such a treat!) while my other half went to the golf range ... there‚Äôs so much to do here you really need 2 things to do it all! Can‚Äôt wait to go with the girls in August.",5,2021,06,04
234,Gorgeous property! ,"If you are a golf fan or know a little bit about golf courses around Ireland, you should book a stay in Carton House. 
¬†
Besides the two championship golf courses¬†at the heart of the property, you can find great activities for a complete getaway such as cycling and walking trails, tennis, archery, fishing and a quite decent  wellness centre with spa, swimming pool and gym 
¬†
The property is just a 30 minutes walk from Maynooth city centre where you can find little markets, restaurants and bars (the route btw is beautiful) 
¬†
They also offers three different F&B outlets:
- The Linden Tree Restaurant: quite luxurious, for a formal occasion
- The Carriage House: a little bit more casual, for a substantial dinner and a pint
- The Courtyard Bar: part of the lobby area, for a quick bite and cocktails
¬†
For sure a little bit of everything for all tastes.

234,The Carriage House at Carton,"My mum and I had a beautiful lunch at The Carriage House in Carton. We adored the new decor, it‚Äôs very stylish. We both had the burger and it was cooked perfectly. The homemade coleslaw and fries were delicious Too. The service was impeccable, we were served by the lovely Franka and she gave us a 5 star service. We can‚Äôt wait to return!",5,2020,07,17
234,Strange atmosphere,"We had booked the Carton House Hotel for the St Patricks weekend... Yes, just before the covid 19 lockdown was announced. Given the global coverage, we were still happy to travel and the hotel was open.
The place is large with a long frontage opposite the car park. The original Carton House in under renovation, but that did not interfere with the stay. There was a strange atmosphere, as obviously many people had cancelled bookings, but there were still guests. In fact, we were amongst the last group to stay before lockdown. 
Food was excellent in both the hotel and the golf club bar brasserie, staff were attentive and polite. The leisure complex was adequate, but it needed updating( it was due to be renovated). The complex is huge, with extensive grounds which harbour the Golf Union of Irelan Academy and the training facilities of the Irish rugby team. There are two huge golf courses and there is a road that connects through the complex to Maynooth. Plenty of walks around the courses and if you want a stroll into Maynooth, there is a nice tree lined traffic free avenue taking you there. Rooms, clean, comfortable and well equipped. The reception area was the only area that I personally felt could do with improvement, it was small, compact and a bit dark. The staff in the main were friendly and attentive. The Big Question is always... would I go back? I think I would give this place another chance, when the current crisis has passed and hopefully the leisure complex is refurbished and there are more people around",4,2020,06,25
234,Lovely hotel let down by service,"We stayed for one night after spending the day at Kildare Shopping Village. The hotel is under going renovations which we knew about and those were really well managed so didn‚Äôt impact on our stay. The reception staff were excellent and our triple room was huge and really nicely decorated. The pool area was great and really well maintained. The issues were with dinner in the Carriage Rooms, the bar service that evening and breakfast the next morning in the Linden Tree. The service was pretty awful. Staff not understanding the dinner menu, not being attentive, taking orders and then having to chase them, cutlery missing, no ice bucket for white wine, no clean plates at breakfast, no gin glasses, coffee ordered and not arriving. The list just went on and on. We didn‚Äôt make a complaint but the manager could sense our frustration at breakfast. He had recently moved from the Westbury and admitted that things needed to improve. It‚Äôs a shame as small details turned a lovely hotel break into one that was pretty poor. We do hope to come back in future but not until these issues are dealt with. Real shame.",3,2020,03,10
234,Beautiful hotel,"A beautiful hotel not far from the capital. Quiet location, very comfortable beds, great breakfast. Luxurious facilities, very nice staff.  The landscape around the property idyllic and quiet. Also the restaurant is recommended. I will definitely come back",5,2024,10,03
234,Living in an atmosphere of other times.,"Excellent location immersed in a beautiful park of one of the most prestigious golf courses. The hotel develops in two bodies one ancient the other recently built, well connected to each other. The room, services and common areas are in the norm of a prestigious brand like Fairmont; it gives you what you expect and with the excellence and exclusivity of a top-of-the-range hotel. The only note you can make is the service in general; both at the reception and in the restaurant, in my opinion, the staff is not adequately trained in the type of clientele. For example, at the table service the Ladies are never served in advance; the change of dishes, in case of several courses, must be requested as the waiters continue to carry not knowing where to place and only in this case remove the previous dishes. At the reception both on arrival and departure the staff is awkward and approximate giving very few explanations of how the hotel structure is composed and the options for restaurants for dinners and especially times; you must always ask. For the rest a highly recommended hotel where I promise to return shortly. I forgot: a big compliment to the young, but very qualified chef of Monza, who made me taste delicious dishes!",4,2024,07,15
234,Charming ,"I stayed in this magnificent hotel altogether 3 nights, the first two at the beginning of the trip, the last at the end.
The property is located within a magnificent property with spectacular golf course, and has ample parking.
The staff is extremely courteous and helpful and many of them speak French.
The hotel consists of a more 'modern' part in which the reception and most of the rooms are located, connected directly to the historic building in which there are lounges with antique furnishings and on the upper floors the most luxurious and expensive rooms.
The restaurants available to guests are 3, one near the reception, one in the clubhouse and the third, starred, inside the period building.
We always had dinner at Kathleen's Kitchen and every night the food quality was great! Breakfast is also served here, which is √† la carte.
The rooms are finely furnished and the bathroom is equipped with both shower and bath, both times we were assigned a room on the ground floor, with outdoor space furnished with table and chairs. Excellent quality of sleep both for the comfort of the bed, both for the quiet surrounding the structure.
It is priceless to be able to walk inside the property, in the middle of greenery, ponds and canals. The last night we could enjoy a spectacular sunset that made the atmosphere even more magical.
I really enjoyed staying at this property! ",5,2024,07,12
234,Luxury in the countryside near Dublin,"A wonderful place to switch off from the hustle and bustle of the city in the countryside. The hotel lives up to its claim of being one of the best hotels in Ireland. Very friendly staff and excellent cuisine in all restaurants. In addition, you can experience the history of the house in the rooms. Fantastic golf courses and its proximity to Dublin make it an excellent starting point for city trips for guests who otherwise want to experience the relaxed Ireland in the countryside.",5,2024,05,19
234,Great stay,"The hotel and service were great! The breakfast was fantastic! We felt very comfortable and we were helped at all times. We would like to highlight Brian Sutton, the concierge. He gave us lots of great tips and was very helpful. He lives and loves his job and is a lovely and helpful person! We would love to come back.",5,2024,04,05
234,Very poor value for money.,"Even the check-in took a little longer. Then I would be escorted to the room. But about 30 m from the room, the gentleman at the front right said her room was. There was no escort to the room. When we arrived in the room there was no welcome card or welcome gift as is usual in all Accor hotels and is also guaranteed as a Platinum member. Because it was a public holiday, the swimming pool was only open until 8 p.m. and I was really looking forward to a nice swim. There was only one restaurant available. The steak was perfectly cooked, but unfortunately apparently bought at a discount store because it was tough. Since I didn't feel like eating at this restaurant again the next evening, I shortened the stay to one night. As usual, I pay my bill before checkout. Unfortunately, I couldn't receive an invoice there that also had an invoice number. Now I wanted to talk to the manager and tell him about my experiences, but he didn't get back to me within 3 hours. He couldn't be spoken to at check out either. I think it's a shame that management isn't interested in problems. There seems to be a lot of savings here from above according to the motto. Stinginess is cool.",1,2024,03,21
234,Perfect house,"After landing in Dublin, picking up the cars and dealing with the traffic, we drove to this beautiful hotel. It was the first day of our tour of Ireland.
Everything was perfect here: location, reception, rooms, service, food. The surroundings are stunning, even if you're not a golfer.
When you start at the top like that...
We would have liked to have stayed longer.",5,2024,03,13
234,"Unique feel-good atmosphere, wonderful facility with charm and unrivalled service","This hotel has more than impressed us! It exceeded all our wishes and expectations and fascinated us with everything it offers and how it is designed. The complex is so beautifully situated in the countryside, wonderful expanses and great for jogging or walking. There is even a small lake, a tower, a wildflower meadow, its own honey and a path along the river within the grounds. The leisure activities on offer are very impressive and varied and yet this place is simply a place to linger and be. To slow down and enjoy, with all your senses. 
The arrival alone is so pleasant and warm. Especially as we were greeted with hot little towels and had a very friendly check-in. 
The rooms, especially the Terrace King category, are uniquely beautiful. View of the countryside, own small terrace with seating. Very lovingly designed coffee and tea bar with a lot of choice in the room. Everything is very well maintained and excellently clean in the room and in the entire hotel, including the hallway and all communal areas. Very well trained, committed and very warm friendly staff in all areas, especially in the 3 hotel restaurants. Very delicious, high-quality food at breakfast and in the restaurants, with the menu featuring regional service providers who supply the hotel with high-quality meat and vegetables. Very sustainable approach and well-being and mindfulness are evident everywhere in the hotel. Particularly how appreciative the castle building from 1730 is of a very modern standard and has nevertheless been so well preserved. A mixture of tradition and modernity and lots of Irish charm, culture and art in the building. You feel like you are in a fairytale castle, particularly in the main restaurant for breakfast, which leaves nothing to be desired, and the rooms in the hotel are also so uniquely designed. Wonderful old trees and lovely places to sit outside. Great golf course and sports facilities. Very delicious food in the restaurants. One of the best-run hotels we know and we will definitely come back!",5,2023,10,18
234,Perfect place,Perfect hotel in a beautiful setting. An impressive symbiosis between historical buildings and modern elements. Wonderful breakfast in a stylish atmosphere. Very friendly staff who really care.,5,2023,09,24
234,Ein royaler Aufenthalt,"Mein Mann und ich hatten eine wundersch√∂ne Woche in Carton House. 
Jason war der perfekt Golflehrer. Ich hatte √ºberhaupt das erste mal einen Golfschl√§ger in der Hand. Aber auch ohne Golf ist ein Aufenthalt sehr zu empfehlen. Mit Cathleens Kitchen und dem Golfclub gibt es 2 Lokale, die auch wir uns leisten konnten. Das Fr√ºhst√ºck ist der Wahnsinn. Dem Gast werden alle W√ºnsche von den Augen abgelesen. An der Sauna, Schwimmbad und Fitnessraum gibt es ebenfalls nichts! zu meckern. Achtung! Die Iren gehen mit Badebekleidung in die Sauna :-( In diesem Hotel habe ich mich gef√ºhlt wie eine Prinzessin :-)
Nur die Wege sind weit. Aber das Hotel ist halt auch gro√ü. 169 Zimmer.  Wenn man sich viel im SPA aufhalten m√∂chte empfehle ich einen Aufenthalt im neueren Teil. Wobei die Zimmer im ""alten"" Teil beeindruckender sind.",5,2022,07,01
234,Grandioses Anwesen aber M√§ngel im Servicewe,"Meine Tochter (16) u ich waren von der Gro√üz√ºgigkeit der Anlage angetan u sind uns wie in einem kleinen Schloss Sch√∂nbrunn vorgekommen. Rosengarten, uralter Baumbestand und riesige Wiesen, Teich u Bootshaus, etc. Im 500 ha Anwesen gibt es W√§lder, Radwege u nat√ºrlich nicht zu vergessen 2 Golfpl√§tze. Alle Restaurants, Golfclubhaus, K√ºchen, Bar befinden sich im 1739 errichteten Herrenhaus. Angeschlossen ein Neubau mit den Zimmern u ziemlich kleinem SPA. 
Aufgrund der Gr√∂√üe des Anwesens legt man lange Wege zur√ºck, weshalb man Zimmer mit niedriger Nummer (10. -20, 110-120 usw) w√§hlen sollte. 

Das Management und die K√ºche kann leider mit der grandiosen Kulisse nicht mithalten. Strenge COVID-Regeln waren nat√ºrlich zu akzeptieren. Was aber das Zimmerservice damit zu tun hat, blieb unklar, wenn man nicht t√§glich (!) an der Rezeption darum ersuchte, wurde das Zimmer nicht gemacht. Unsere Nachfrage wurde lakonisch mit dem Hinweis auf den Zettel im Zimmer quittiert. Auch bekamen wir Badem√§ntel nur auf Ersuchen und diese wurden 3x  am zweiten Tag wieder entfernt ohne neue zu liefern. 
Es gibt sehr viel Personal im Hotel, was grunds√§tzlich positiv ist. Allerdings wird dadurch bei den Mahlzeiten laufend Bestelltes vergessen, besonders beim Fr√ºhst√ºck. Die Karte in den drei Restaurants ist klein, sodass es durchaus gut war, dass wir nur Fr√ºhst√ºck buchten und manchmal in Maynoth essen waren, wo wir sehr gut gegessen haben und pulsierendes Leben in der Kleinstadt erlebten.  

Insgesamt hatten wir lange ( wir waren 12 Tage im Carton House) den Eindruck, dass dieses Hotel nur Tagesg√§ste, Hochzeitsgesellschaften oder max 1-2 √úbernachtungen bevorzugt. Erst zum Schluss kamen wir uns willkommen vor. Da war allerdings der Aufenthalt trotz Vorauszahlung mit t√§glichem ‚ÄûPackage‚Äú noch einmal auf der Hotelrechnung ( gesamt gut 1000. ‚Ç¨!) 
Also wenn Sie beabsichtigen, ins Carton House zu fahren, erleben Sie ein tolles Hotel in sensationeller Lage aber sie m√ºssen trotz des stolzen Preises beim Service Abstriche akzeptieren.  
Aufgrund des unglaublich tollen Anwesens trotzdem  4 Punkte.",4,2021,08,08
