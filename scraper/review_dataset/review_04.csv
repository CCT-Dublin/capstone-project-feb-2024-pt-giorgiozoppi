04,Simply wonderful! I wish everyone to stay there at least one or two nights!,"Our stay was simply excellent. Everything was perfect, from the views to the service to the food. The hotel is immersed in the green, but yet steps away from the center. The hotel organizes shuttles to and from the city center for guests to go visit landmarks in Florence, but then you go back to the beauty and quite of the hotel in the evening. A perfect blend between resort and city!",5,2024,09,23
04,A jewel in a beautiful setting,"We were enchanted by the spectacular views of Florence, drinks on the terrace, lounging at the pool, jazz concert on the terrace, dinners under the stars on the loggia,  The wonderful staff were always there when we needed them, but respectful of our privacy when we didn‚Äôt.

04,Pure excellence in Tuscany,"Villa San Michele truly embodies excellence and was the highest level of service and attention to detail my wife and I have ever experienced at a hotel (we've stayed at many high level hotel brand properties).

04,The Best hotel we've ever vistied!,We love traveling and enjoying the hotels we visit but this one was 5-star in all aspects. So grateful to the amazing team for making traveling with our toddler seamless. ,5,2024,09,03
04,NO DOUBTS! It is nr 1 hotel in Firenze . Full review - The Luxury Travel Expert,"This year we have visited Villa San Michele for a second time ! We have been visiting 5 hotels in Firenze so far . Four seasons / Il Salvatino / Lungarno / Villa Cora and Belmond Villa San Michele . 
After two stays in this property it is nr 1 for me despite the fact that price of a night has increased twice in last 5 years. 
Location with the view is spectacular. Restaurant - dinners / lunch time / breakfast are top of the notch.
We have been staying in apartments near swimming pool with a small garden . They are very nicely designed and enough spacious . Swimming pool is a perfect area due to its intimacy and privacy! 
Staying in this place is a kid of ‚Äúfeeling ‚Äú . If you have got a budget for this place do not try to consider anything else",5,2024,08,27
04,Disappointing: Not a five star welcome,"Dear Villa San Michele,

My wife, daughter, and I recently visited your establishment to explore the possibility of returning for a meal or a stay. As seasoned travellers who have frequented many five-star hotels, we were taken aback by the unprofessional and unwelcoming reception we received.

First Impressions Matter: Belmond, unfortunately, missed the mark on this occasion. First impressions are crucial, and our encounter left much to be desired.

GM Reputation: I had heard positive things about the General Manager, Sofia Peluso however, our experience made me question whether those accolades were warranted.

Unpleasant Greeting: One of the three staff members at the entrance questioned our presence, displaying an obtuse attitude. Despite explaining that we were local guests, we felt unwelcome. The situation resembled a scene from the movie ‚ÄúPretty Woman.‚Äù

Mixed Signals: After some ‚Äúdiscussion,‚Äù we were begrudgingly shown to a garden terrace. However, the staff‚Äôs lingering stares and the shocking initial greeting prompted us to leave prematurely.

Impactful Encounter: Our brief visit left a lasting impression. I felt compelled to share this review, as professionalism is integral to a memorable hotel experience.

Recommendation: For those seeking true five-star treatment, I recommend trying Villa Fiesole. Their staff sets a standard leagues above what we encountered here.

Thank you for considering our feedback.

Best regards, Geoff Stewart",1,2024,08,21
04,Workcation Paradise,"I travel a lot for work, and let me tell you, this place stands out from the crowd. Check-in was a breeze, the room was perfect for getting work done (hello, ergonomic chair!), and the business center saved my butt when I had a last-minute printing emergency. But it wasn't all work - the gym was top-notch and the bar made",5,2024,08,21

04,An absolute must in Florence,"This hotel just hits on every aspect.  The hotel itself is stunning, rich in history and boasting incredible views of Florence from its hillside location.  Rooms provide a relaxing haven from a busy day and the food options are top notch.  What really sets this hotel apart, however, is the team.  From the moment you arrive, you are met with the most genuine people who truly make you feel like you are coming home to family.

04,"No REALLY, you won‚Äôt want to leave‚Ä¶.","If this review were simply decided by first impressions, then Villa San Michele (VSM) would earn 15 out of 10 stars for the approach and the views from entrance.  High in the hills, 20 mins from Florence, the Tuscan valley and Florence surround you and the massive Duomo back in Florence still looks to be in reach. Alas, a good review needs more than a view and luckily, VSM has many wonderful qualities‚Ä¶

The hotel itself is an ancient monastery.  The architecture and the grounds are spectacular. The main structure which has the restaurants, living area and bar is perfectly preserved while affording all modern conveniences.   Step out on to the loggia or the back lawn and the beautiful views steal the show. However, look around the spectacular gardens will also catch your eye. Take some time to walk around the property or enjoy a coffee or cocktail on the lawn. Listen to the birds as they go about their business. This place is as beautiful and tranquil as it gets.  

The pool area at the top of the property is another special area. It‚Äôs easy to sit by the pool, enjoy the views and spend the entire day - I think the Italians would say ‚Äòdolce far niente‚Äô.   The pool has attendants to set up your chair and bring you as much Prosecco as you need to stay hydrated while soaking up the sun. The pizza at the pool Grill is not to be missed.   I should also highlight the shellfish platter that Antonio prepared for us poolside with a nice glass of Ruinart to go with it.   

In our case, we had reserved a ‚ÄòSuperior Junior Suite with Terrace‚Äô which was positioned overlooking the main lawn, and just under the pool terrace. We loved the location as it was easy to get to both the main structure and the pool. However, be prepared for a good cardio workout!   The junior suite has a small terrace at its front with two lounge chairs and a small table and chairs for dining. The views from the terrace, looking back to Florence, are beautiful. Inside, the junior suites are large, with a king sized bed, small couch and sitting area, dining table with two chairs and an oversized bathroom. The bed and linens were very comfortable with king sized down pillows and a down comforter. Meanwhile, the bathroom is clad in marble and has two separate sinks, a large tub, enclosed toilet and the world‚Äôs largest shower üòä.  The toiletries are from Aqua di Parma. Turn down service included slippers, a bottle of water, and a soft bedside mat.  I should also note that each night, we got a small gift, including a handkerchief, a bookmark, and a linen tea towel.   Very thoughtful.  We enjoyed our room very much.

We enjoyed the main restaurant for both breakfast and dinner. We enjoyed the Grill at the pool for lunch. We also spent time on the lawn for cocktails. Food was consistently good and tasty. One stand out dish that everyone loved was the ‚Äòcasentino egg‚Äô appetizer on the dinner menu. The gnocchi and ravioli were also very good.  

Overall, service at VSM was wonderful. Whether it was Eleanora at the concierge desk, Marco in the main restaurant, Mateo at the bar, Antonio and Ruben at the Grill, the various pool attendants, or the the bellman at the entrance‚Ä¶. everyone was extremely responsive and friendly. Need a steamer for your clothes, one shoes up in 5 minutes.  Ordering breakfast, it shows up in 20 mins. We even had a nice conversation with one of the young ladies positioned at the pastries in the breakfast  buffet. The one thing that became clear speaking to each one of the staff at VSM is that they all recognize they work in a special place.   

If you are thinking about VSM, just book it.   My only warning to anyone looking to stay here is that I pity the person who has to choose between spending a day at VSM and exploring nearby Florence. It would seem to be an impossible choice.",5,2024,07,09
04,Not worth the huge price paid,They cancelled us one week prior to arrival and failed to apologise to us in person one we arrived after they ad sorted out their error. Will never go again. Belmond Hotels over priced and under serviced.,2,2024,06,30
04,EXCEPTIONAL in every way!,"This hotel is in a league of its own. This hotel is run by the most outstanding General Manager - who happens to be a woman - and it does not miss a thing. This is probably one of my top 5 properties in the world. It is not only the location, but the staff from top to bottom. - there is NOTHING that is lacking - the food is incredible, service extraordinary.
If traveling in Florence - I would stay nowhere else..
I cannot wait to return.  Thank you San Michele for the most remarkable, unforgettable holiday!",5,2024,06,26
04,Back to Florence,The entire staff could be your brothers or sisters as they invite you into this magical place. While this hotel checks all the boxes as a visually stimulating building and property it‚Äôs the staff that makes it world class.

The entire staff went above and beyond ! ,5,2024,06,20
04,Birthday and Wedding Anniversary Celebrations,"A briliant hotel on the edge of Florence with a very efficent complimentary minibus service to and from Florence.

The staff were excellent and in particular the concierge and front of house team were very engaging and helpful. 

The rooms are of the highest standard and all 3 restarants are excellent. The Hotel has a very talented chef and at least one meal in The Loggia restaurant during your stay is recommended.

04,Superlative Oasis ,"Villa San Michelle is a truly superlative oasis. Just finished a 3 day stay and regretfully would have loved more. How can any other majestic perch compare. Breathtaking views around every corner, attentive blazing responsive service to every need incl convenient shuttles to hot tourist mobbed Florence every 30 min.. San Michelle makes it hard to leave. Yes it's expensive incl any meals drinks etc but here at least you get 150% of what you pay for",5,2024,06,12
04,An oasis of kindness and civilisation,"Claire and I have just spent our 40th wedding Anniversary at Villa San Michele. The setting in an ancient monastery with a breathtaking and ever changing panorama of Florence is outstanding. The very frequent hotel shuttle service makes the heart of Florence easily accessible and at the same time provides a perfect retreat from the city which is - in places - teeming with fellow tourists. We benefited hugely from the expertise of Adriano the head concierge in planning the trips and making the bookings. His help was invaluable. It is difficult to believe the restaurants don't have a Michelin star between them. We have eaten less well and with less enjoyment in many that do. Of course this hotel is expensive (how could it not be?) but the value is high.
Most of all we  - and all the guests - were treated with unfailing courtesy and kindness. In our experience Italians are hospitable and friendly. This experience took hospitality to  new heights.  Ottimo!",5,2024,06,06
04,The most amazing place in the world!!,"Best views of Firenze, and old monastery with outstanding rooms, excellent Managment with delicate and elegant touches all over the property.

There are only a few hotels in the world that when you stay there it makes you feel connected with the people and the culture of your destination. Villa San Michelle is one of them.

04,Villa San Michele - April 2024,We have been lucky enough that this was not our first visit to Villa San Michele. If you are considering this hotel we highly recommend staying here. It is located in Fiesole in the hills above Florence. They have a shuttle that will run you into downtown (current drop off is near the Savoy) and pick you up. It runs every 30 minutes or so. After a few hours in the chaos that is Florence it's a great place to relax and enjoy the view. And the team at the Villa is extremely friendly and helpful and not in a forced way. We will definitely be back!!!,5,2024,04,30
04,Magical monastery turned world-class Villa in the Tuscan hills,"If there were more stars available I‚Äôd give them to this gem of a property. Belmond clearly knows to create magic in this romantic setting seemingly hewn out of stone and lush greenery in the hillside cliffs of Fiesole, just above Florence. This villa had been on my must-do list for years but they are open only seasonally April to early October, and I finally made it! Yes, the setting is like out of a fairytale but the staff is the secret weapon, spreading curated care and attention at every turn. Our junior suite was perfectly appointed mixing the old world elegance of this former 14th century monastery with updated touches throughout including a large marble bathroom, closets, and  terrace. The bar, restaurants, including a Michelin-starred one, deliver top-class food. The enormous pool and patios beckon guests to lounge endlessly forgetting the outside world. You won‚Äôt miss being 15 minutes above the bustling center of Firenze because it‚Äôs a fantastical escape. GM Sofia and her first-class team of Luana, Eleonora, Andra, and all the rest felt like family after 3 days there. I cannot wait to return to this Tuscan home away from home.",5,2024,04,29

04,simply magnificent,A unique hotel to relax in Florence. The place is magical and the service is very attentive. It's a real Hotel without any superficiality. It is completely removed from the city but a shuttle takes you to the center of Florence in twenty minutes.,5,2023,10,14
04,Didnt want to leave the property,"We were so excited to come back and see Florence post Covid. Unfortunately, this hotel was so Amazing we didn't want to leave and explore the city.  We obviously did but, Wow!  What a magical place. Top shelf luxury and unparalleled service.",5,2023,10,03
04,4 star now,"It seems Belmond LVMH has made the decision to downgrade this important property.  We found the room to be large but with a very  noisy a/c system, doors that can‚Äôt shut because the curtain gets stuck, and dated furnishings.  The food was a huge disappointment as in the past it was fantastic.  The fine dining room makes the effort to look the part but the chef delivers not edible attempts at earning stars.  Cocktails are still a good time and the pool is great.  Can‚Äôt recommend .",3,2023,09,19
04,Renaissance Retreat: Unparalleled Luxury at Hotel San Michelle in August,"Nestled on teh hills overseeing Florence, Hotel San Michelle proved to be an oasis of excellence during my stay in August, a time when the city saw fewer tourists. This gave a sense of exclusivity and tranquility, enhancing the experience. The service was nothing short of impeccable; every staff member went above and beyond to ensure guest comfort. The ambiance, bathed in Florentine charm, captured the essence of Italian luxury. The highlight was undoubtedly the gastronomic journey ‚Äî from mornings graced by deliciously flaky sfogliatellas to nights' dinners at amazing La Loggia, sampling Chef Alessandro's amazing and concluded with expertly crafted cocktails. San Michelle isn't just a hotel; it's an experience.",5,2023,09,17
04,Villa San Michele is magical!,"My wife and I just celebrated our 40th anniversary at Villa San Michele and it was magical! Situated on a hill above Florence with beautiful gardens and stone walls, you‚Äôre able to enjoy the museums and restaurants of downtown Florence by day but the quiet and beauty of Florence below at night. Upon arrival we were greeted by a nice gentleman and a couple of valet and we enjoyed a glass of Prosecco while Katrina checked us in. Our suite was a one bedroom, living room and a terrace. Everything in the spacious room was perfect! To celebrate our anniversary there was a nice welcome letter from Sofia the GM, a bottle of wine and a dessert. 
Dining:
We ate breakfast every day at the resort. You can eat from the buffet and order from the menu, Pamela, one of the wait staff was fantastic!!
We also ate a few dinners at the casual restaurant by the pool on the upper terrace and at the casual restaurant in the main dining area. The food was very, very  good. 
We did not eat at the smaller restaurant thats on site.
It‚Äôs a 20 minute ride to downtown Florence and back, Villa San Michele has a shuttle service which worked flawlessly, was ALWAYS on time and is easy to locate.
One really nice touch were the fresh flowers in the suite every day! There were also small gifts which are a nice touch!
I cannot share enough positive comments about our time at Villa San Michelle! We miss the resort and the wonderful staff already!! Thank you to everyone at the Villa San Michele!!",5,2023,09,16

04,"What a magic place, beyond wonderful","This place it's magical.
I have been in many 5 stars or luxury hotels, but the experience at Villa San Michele was beyond any expectation.

The Villa and the location it' s a gem of true Italian craftsmanship, history and just incredible beauty all around. Any angle of the hotel it's picture perfect. The Italian garden in which the hotel is immersed it's an incredible frame to anything you are doing, whatever is breakfast, dining or just relaxing by the heated pool. 
The room was beautiful, with a private outdoor where you could also enjoy your breakfast and it had a very big bathroom filled with all sort of toiletries.

Aside from the unique location, what made the stay very special, unforgettable and unique, is the service. The level of attention, care and kindness of ALL the staff it's beyond. They are all and always ready to help and satisfy any request of the guests.

A special thanks goes to Francesca. One morning, at breakfast, I said that one of the filling of a pastry was reminding me of my grand mother custard. The following morning, at breakfast, without saying anything, Francesca brought me a small cup filled with warm custard and that really moved me.

I also have to mention how delicious is the food in general. At breakfast all croissants are freshly baked every morning and filled with custard or chocolate filling prepared daily. Also all types of breads are prepared and baked in the hotel every day. The pizza by the pool is really good and the main restaurant have a selection of classic Italian dishes that are made with the best ingredients and beautifully presented. Try the pappa al pomodoro.
We did not try the fine dining restaurant, but I was told that it's also extremely good.

It was so refreshing seeing that there are still hotels with that such high level of service, care and attention to their guests.

I can only hope I will be back.",5,2023,09,04

A special thank you to Pietro who served us each evening for both pre and after dinner drinks. Such a friendly member of the team.

04,Breathtaking Views & Pampering Service at Villa San Michele,"Nestled in the hills overlooking Florence sits the magnificent Villa San Michele, a stunning luxury hotel that provides an unforgettable Tuscan escape. Despite being located in the charming village of Fiesole, just a quick 20-minute shuttle ride from the heart of Florence, the villa feels like a secluded retreat thanks to its sprawling gardens and awe-inspiring views of the Renaissance city below.
From the moment you arrive, the top-notch service makes you feel like royalty. The attentive staff caters to your every need and even provides thoughtful gifts and surprises during your stay. The rooms are spacious and comfortable, with Old World charm and decorative touches like frescoed ceilings, even if they could use slight renovations. But you won't spend much time in your room once you experience the breathtaking villa grounds.

The highlight is the view - sunrise over Florence is a sight you'll never forget. The views from the romantic restaurants and terraces are just as magical. The high-quality breakfast served every morning is a dreamy, decadent affair. Everything from the food to the dining spaces feels luxurious.

The heated swimming pool is incredible, with perfect temperatures and peaceful surroundings overlooking the valleys and Florence below. The pool bar and restaurant serve the finest cocktails and champagne, along with wood-fired pizzas that are the best we've ever tasted.
While the rooms themselves may need slight updates, Villa San Michele's jaw-dropping scenery, phenomenal service, and overall ambiance make it one of the most unforgettable hotels we've experienced yet. Its hilltop location makes it feel world's away yet still convenient to Florence's attractions. For a vacation of pure indulgence and beauty, Villa San Michele is an exceptional choice.",5,2023,07,21

04,Top Notch,"This venue is amazing - attended for a wedding. It is certainly pricey, but you get what you pay for. Fantastic views of the city and amazing staff. Great food and something different than inside the city of Florence. ",5,2023,02,23
04,"Luxury, with a panorama of Florence","My wife and I spent two nights here as part of an anniversary trip, and were very pleased with the experience.  From the beginning to the end of our stay, all of the staff were outstanding, and made us feel so pampered and comfortable.  Our room was everything one would expect from a 5 star hotel, including our own terrace and the larger gardens with a magnificent view of Florence.  Access into the city was easy, about 20 minutes to the center, either by the hotel‚Äôs shuttle or cab, so we didn‚Äôt have to use our car.  After busy days touring, we chose to eat at each of the two restaurants on site for our dinners‚Äîboth were excellent in terms of food and service (I have reviewed separately). The breakfast was also outstanding.  The pool was open and looked inviting, but in November we chose not to brave the cool air.",5,2022,11,19
04,A wonderful weekend,"From the moment we arrived we were greeted by members of your wonderful staff. They were very welcoming and eager to make our stay comfortable.  

During our stay we enjoyed many aspects of the beautiful facilities and our room was both extremely clean and comfortable.  It was like a home away from home. 

We enjoyed our dinner in your restaurant as well as cocktails and snacks in the bar and on the terrace.  The service was excellent.  ",5,2022,11,10
04,Extraordinary and Magical Stay--With Toddler!,"I had the pleasure of staying at Villa San Michele for 3 nights in November and truly loved the experience. That is the case, even though we traveled with a 2 1/2 year old. It really started before we arrived--the warm and relaxed, yet responsive and efficient team--that made it so we could both plan in advance and go with the flow during our stay. / The property is 25 mins from central Florence with a free Mercedes van that ran like clockwork so we were in town when we wanted it and relaxing in the hills when we were done. The food at the hotel is extraordinary so I recommend meals on property. / In terms of having a toddler, every single person was kind to her and asked us what they could do to help. There were toys and snacks but it was this welcoming attitude that made us feel comfortable as parents and made it a memorable stay for all of us. I highly recommend this property to everyone!",5,2022,11,08
04,A magical place,"It was astounding how quickly you were drawn into the peaceful aura of this place, overlooking Florence, enchanted by the luxury as well as the history, the art and the sheer magic of this place. It seems like all your stress cannot penetrate the thick walls of the old monastery. Every walk through the gardens is a little holiday in itself.",5,2022,11,05
04,Magical Villa San Michele,"Imagine you‚Äôve been invited to stay at a friend's Villa in the hills above Florence, in a town called Fiesole (Fee-ehh-so-lay). Up the windy road you turn into a drive lined by Russian sage, olive trees, lavender and white lantana. A smile greets you and the scent hits you; dried herbs, sage and rosemary. You have now arrived at the Grand Palace, whose five arches and facade were designed by Michelangelo. Reality sets in as you are whisked through the Villa San Michele to check in and escorted through the lovely manicured grounds and stone steps to your room. The pi√®ce de r√©sistance that takes your breath away is the view of Florence.  Details, like fresh flowers and champagne/Prosecco, or the Acqua Di Parma in each room and small gifts that suddenly appear while ones out just make the experience even more special. Belmond makes every guest feel at home. Every minute we were treated with the best hospitality in Italy! Really, better than staying with old friends. ",5,2022,11,04
04,My wedding anniversary,"The villa/hotel is unique. The view on Florence from the Restaurant, garden and room is amazing.Chef and Restaurant well deserve a two Michelin star. Highly reccomended drink at the bar with live music and Florence view. Very high quality for price. ",5,2022,10,31
04,"Beautiful Hotel, Impressive Service","We stayed at 5 different 5-star hotels during our 2 weeks in Italy, but my wife and I agree that Villa San Michele was our favorite. The beauty of the hotel and grounds was so inspiring (not to mention the view!), and the genuine care of the staff was impressive. We felt right at home from the moment we arrived until the morning we checked out. A special ‚Äúthank you‚Äù to the staff/management who constantly went above and beyond to make our stay memorable. The extras were much appreciated. We can‚Äôt wait to stay at another Belmond hotel.",5,2022,10,30
04,Beyond perfect.. with everything.,"It was a perfect stay, with everything! I can recommend villa san michele from the bottom of my heart. We loved it. 
Thanks to the whole team who made our stay unforgettable. We wish to come back one day! ",5,2022,10,28
04,an oasis of peace,"The Villa exudes peace and tranquillity, set among beautiful gardens and identifiably an old monastery. I have never experienced a hotel where absolutely all the staff were so charming and cheerful and helpful. It is expensive but the rooms were luxuriously comfortable, the pool area delightful [pool heated too] , room service quietly efficient - and the whole place a delight to the eye.",5,2022,10,28
04,La Dolce Vita in the villa,"We had an extraordinary stay at the Villa - this is a place you should stay, if you can afford - don't second guess!  We enjoyed our stay immensely - the views, setting, and beauty of the area are stunning.  It was a perfect respite but the bustle of Florence to come back to this tranquil setting.  ",5,2022,10,25
04,A perfect place,"Everything was perfect : location, service, sleep quality, swimming pool, food, etc , so it gives you a taste of paradise, not far from the museums and churches of Firenze, another kind of paradise. I can't judge about the price because I had the chance to be fully invited.  ",5,2022,10,21
04,We loved every minute of our stay at Villa San Michele,"My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed our recent short stay at Villa San Michele. It is a very special hotel, located in a historic building, surrounded by lush gardens and offering the most spectacular views of Florence. The hotel is very well managed by a team of experienced, friendly staff, who clearly enjoy working together and whose focus is to ensure that their guests enjoy every aspect of their stay. Our room/suite was luxurious, comfortable, clean, spacious and beautifully furnished, including fresh flowers and a wide range of amenities. The food and service are of the highest standard. A particular highlight for us was dining one evening in the hotel‚Äôs La Loggia restaurant (we booked in advance!), The wonderful food, wines and service were complemented by the beautiful views of Florence. The hotel provides a regular, free, shuttle-bus to and from central Florence - we used this service each day and found it to be very comfortable and convenient. We have very happy memories of our stay at Villa San Michele and are already planning a return visit.",5,2022,10,10
04,Top Service ,Wow what a gorgeous and Unique property.  Staff are so professional and helpful with everything and there is a free shuttle service every 30 mins to Florence centre.  The views alone are worth it.  The pool and gardens are magical.  An excellent option if you like being a bit away from it all in a quiet space.  The only thing is there are a lot of stairs so maybe would not be practical for someone with mobility issues.  Otherwise totally amazing!! ,5,2022,10,10
04,Above and beyond,We stayed there for 3 nights and this was the best hotel of our trip. Beautiful pool amazing view nice rooms but above all amazing service. The lady at the reception ( I forgot her name she is from Egyptian origin) stayed 4 hours trying to Carnegie our tickets ( and did it !!) but 4 hours ?? Can you believe .this is just an example because staff from housekeeping to reception to concierge to restaurants are all amazingly trained and very very nice . Thumbs up!,5,2022,10,09
04,Belmond Does it Right Again!,"ABSOLUTE PERFECTION! The property grounds, the views, the amenities, the cuisine, and of course the wonderful staff!  If there are any concerns of not being in Florence, think again. The shuttle service operates frequently from morning, to 11pm to and from the beautiful hotel. The entire property is a photo opportunity and the rooms are spacious and beautiful. We thank the staff very kindly and can‚Äôt wait to return again! Grazie Mille!",5,2022,10,06
04,Truly excellent experience,"The staff and property exceeded our expectations. On the last leg of our honeymoon, they made our stay extremely enjoyable and relaxing. It was a great way to end our honeymoon and we have every intention on returning there when the opportunity arises.",5,2022,10,05
04,Best hotel in Florence!,"Location is one of a kind, the entire staff was so attentive and friendly, but never intrusive. We had the chance to try all of the three restaurants of the hotel and they were all three impeccable: well done to Chef Alessandro, both as a professional and as a person. Last but not least, the wonderful General Manager Sofia, I have to say that you can tell that she is a woman: such a great attention to details, grazie and we will definitely be back!",5,2022,10,04
04,"Magnificent Property, Expert Service","The staff at the Villa San Michele, coupled with the gorgeous hotel and grounds, make this property a must-visit. Every request is treated with grace and effect, and the staff are truly dedicated to making guests happy. The terrace restaurant is lovely, the views are amazing. We cannot wait to return - sooner rather than later.",5,2022,10,01
04,Bellissimo,"My husband and I just spent 8 days at this beautiful hotel with the best view of Florence.  The gardens were magical and the property was pristine. My room was luxury at its finest and the restaurants were first class.  My favorite part about this hotel: however, is not all the great things I just mentioned...It was the staff, they treated us like we were part of the family.  I will be talking about this place forever, they didn't miss a thing.",5,2022,09,27
04,An amazing stay!,"My wife and I stayed at Villa San Michele as part of our honeymoon. We couldn't have been happier with the hotel, the view, the service, and the food. The building feels very historic, and you can't beat the view looking out at the sunrise over Florence. It's only a 15-20 minute shuttle/cab ride to the city center as well. Highly recommended for couples!!",5,2022,09,24
04,Exclusive place in the hills around Florence,The people from the hotel makes the experience only better. The scenery and smells of the garden is wonderful. Take a morning in to the city and come back in the afternoon for a relaxing and refreshing stay at the pool.,5,2022,09,21
04,wonderful stay,"Splendid location, great atmosphere, very tranquil, beautiful grounds and view on Florence 
the hotel has its own transportation towards the city, so no stress of driving with your own car in the city.
",5,2022,09,19
04,Great hotel but very slow service,"The hotel is beautiful the staff are very friendly rooms and amenities are all fabulous 

However the service in the restaurant and bar is so ridiculously slow it spoils the whole experience

It is very unfortunate because I was otherwise delighted by the experience of the hotel 

Unfortunately I won‚Äôt be back",3,2022,09,18
04,Professionalism sets the bar!  Breathtaking views!  A must visit!,"A MUST stay for your visit in Florence.  With the city of Florence in the background you wind your way up the driveway to Villa San Michele.   You can sense the anticipation that this property is going to be special.  As you enter through the wrought iron gate the view of the hotel is stunning.  Greeting your eye is a 16th century Renaissance monastery with a modern flair.  With friendly smiles and a polite ""Buongiorno"" you are greeted and escorted into the reception area.  The entire property is first-class and extremely worthy of a 5-star property.  Appointed artwork, statuary, greenery, flowers, antique furniture, and lush immaculate grounds introduces the eye to the impressive details and architecture of the property.  As you walk through the hotel‚Äôs common areas you are impressed with each room‚Äôs beauty and elegance.  Sophia escorted us on an extensive tour of the property and then to our room.

Our guest room was the Greenhouse Room.  A short walkway from the main building leading to a stone staircase, ushers you to a hidden ivy-covered guest room.  The rooms rooftop terrace overlooks the hotel and city of Florence.  What a gorgeous terrace view to share coffee in the morning or champagne after dark.  We returned from dinner and shared in the wedding‚Äôs celebratory fireworks at the hotel.  The guest room itself is very large with a king size bed, sofa and sitting area.  The ornate Italian marble bathroom with separated sinks was spacious and closet space was very accommodating.  The attention to detail continued with the bouquets of flowers, antique furniture, lighting, and rich colors.  Housekeeping kept the room clean and tidy.  We never knew they were there.  You returned every evening to turndown service with the drapes drawn, dimmed lights, slippers beside the bed, and bottled water.  

After a refreshing night‚Äôs sleep our day started every morning with coffee delivered to our room by Filippo.  Thank you, sir!  Breakfast is served at the Ristorante San Michele terrace overlooking the city of Florence.  Breathtaking views.  A la carte menu with an entire room buffet filled with fresh fruit, pastries, cheeses, meats, and breads.  The coffee was exceptional, and our server Anna kept our cups filled and tended to our every need, Thank you!  Our dinner experience at Ristorante San Michele was tasty and savory.  From my fettuccine with wild boar to my wife‚Äôs whole fish (which she asked to fillet herself) our dinner was outstanding.

Complimentary shuttle service to Florence added to a memorable experience.  Drop off / pick up at Piazza della Repubblica made for convenient access to the city.  The 20‚Äì25-minute ride allowed for sightseeing and meeting new friends from around the world.

A special thank you to Concierge Adriano who went above and beyond to make our experience exceptional and magical.  Your recommendations were incredible!
 
A special thank you to Luana for her helpfulness and thoughtfulness.  You added exponentially to our anniversary holiday.  Your smile is radiant!

We can‚Äôt say enough about the hotel‚Äôs General Manager, Sophia Peluso.  Your professionalism and customer service are outstanding and distinguished.  Your staff follows your esteemed leadership.  You went over and above to make our stay memorable and extraordinary.  Thank you.  Judy and I feel we made a lifelong friend.  We look forward to meeting you again.",5,2022,09,15
04,Tranquil surroundings and decadent food,"This has to be one of my favourite Belmond hotels. We had the pleasure of coming here for lunch and the food was absolutely delicious. The surroundings themselves, are incredibly picturesque. A beautiful afternoon with incredible attention to detail on their part.",5,2022,09,13
04,top of the category,"absolutely the top if you want the best in florence. we had a perfect stay, room with a view and top service. we also took advantage of the shuttle service to reach Fiesole, very convenient and quik....absolutely recommended!!",5,2022,09,08
04,Villa San Michele,Excellent place with a romantic and magical atmosphere. The rooms are very clean and spacious. The staff are amazing. The food is really tasty and you get a wonderful experience in Florence you‚Äôll never forget. ,5,2022,09,02
04,Truly unforgettable!,"We stayed 5 nights at San Michele and we didn‚Äôt want it to end. It‚Äôs the most beautiful historical property just outside of Florence in the hills of Fiesole. 

It feels like your stepping back in time but with all your modern day comforts and more! It‚Äôs understated luxury at it‚Äôs best, not trying too hard but it executes everything to perfection. 

Breakfast was an absolute treat, the pizza at lunch was some of the best we‚Äôve had in Italy and the dinner was wonderful - with a fantastic wine list to go with! 

What stood out above all else is the service from the first class and personable employees - each and every single person goes above and beyond, nothing phases them and they genuinely seem to enjoy what they do. We would like to give a special mention to Adriano who heads up the concierge team, who made our stay extra special, he‚Äôs honestly one of the very best out there and by the end of our stay, felt like a dear friend. 

We miss this place already and can‚Äôt wait to return!",5,2022,08,30
04,My son‚Äôs wedding,"This was far and away the most exquisite place I‚Äôve ever stayed. A once in a lifetime experience. From the moment we arrived we were treated like royalty. The gardens, grounds, flowers serve to enhance the magnificent view of Florence below. Every inch of the property was delightful and the food and wine were amazing. The Villa helped make my son‚Äôs wedding a dream come true.",5,2022,08,25
04,Wonderful,"Amazing place and services‚Ä¶ no more
The room didn‚Äôt fit with our expectation but the manager found a solution and upgraded us in a wonderful room. Quite frankly, the price is higher for sure but the dream starts with a junior suite and his private garden.",4,2022,08,24
04,The highlight of my summer.,"Wow. Thank you Sofia, thank you Yasmin. I loved the hotel, the staff, the cleanliness, the well appointed rooms. Restaurant staff know the menu as well as the Chefs. The San Michele restaurant was wonderful. My only recommendation is that given the spread out nature of the property, some sort of communication system is necessary or orders and requests can get lost/delayed. This is hotel is a real gem, I will definitely return and would love the same room. Thank you so much to you all, especially the front desk staff.",5,2022,08,22
04,The only place to stay when in Firenze.,"While located 15 mins outside of Firenze in Fiesole, this will be the only place we will ever stay again when visiting this fabulous city. Located in a 15th century monastery, the grounds, services and people are truly extraordinary. Allows one to easily experience the best the city has to offer, while simultaneously experiencing the beauty of the Tuscan hills. Could not be better!",5,2022,08,07
04,No better place to stay,"From the moment we arrived Adriano, the bell man and the front desk were gracious beyond belief.  We received a special room and were updated on the property.  We cannot say enough about Chef De Martino!!!! We had requested a special appetizer the day before and he went to market to find the Zucchini Flower to make the dish for us as a surprise to my wife Darcy.  If want a to stay at an incredible property with service that makes you feel so special and accommodate your every need the Belmond San Michelle is the place to stay!!! ",5,2022,08,05
04,Best view over Florence,"best view over Florence, luxury experience, the concierge Adriano, make our stay just perfect, I have never saw a more professional concierge in any hotel I have been to so far, taking care about everyone needs. Just don‚Äôt stay in the first category of rooms, you will be very disappointed. Either choose a garden suite of a deluxe suite or just choose another hotel. For the experience to be complete you need to go with a higher category.
The location is just fabulous overlooking Florence, food in the restaurant is ok, not great, the service is fabulous, pool very beautiful, easy to go in the center just 15 min away and they provide free shuttle bus. If you have a car and you don‚Äôt mind driving one hour to have dinner, try La Cantinetta di Rignano. Best dinner I ever had in the whole stay in Italy.",5,2022,08,05
04,A truly exceptional hotel,"Villa San Michele really is the most beautiful hotel. Having stayed at Belmont‚Äôs La Residencia in Mallorca before, we had high hopes  - Villa San Michele exceeded these in so many ways.
The hotel is perfectly located - it‚Äôs close enough to Florence to be able to enjoy the amazing galleries and museums (using the courtesy shuttle bus provided by the hotel). But it‚Äôs prime position in the hills overlooking the city means you can just as easily enjoy the peace and quiet away from the crowds at the hotel.
The hotel has an amazing pool, three excellent restaurants and a beautiful garden in which to enjoy drinks as the sun sets. The staff at Villa San Michele are exceptional - polite, helpful and knowledgeable. Special mentions to Anna in the main restaurant and Michele at the pool. The concierge team are also happy to help with restaurant bookings, excursions and recommendations for Florence.
We‚Äôve just returned from a fabulous week in Villa San Michele and can‚Äôt wait to return next year.",5,2022,07,31
04,A beautiful hotel overlooking a beautiful city.,"We came here for a friend's special birthday celebration and had the most wonderful time. We wouldn't hesitate to come back for another visit. While the bedrooms are a little old fashioned in decor, they were very comfortable and had superb bed linen.  The staff were all wonderful and the food was delicious. ",5,2022,07,26
04,A slice of heaven,"Villa San Michele exceeded all expectations. From the moment we drove down the beautiful drive surrounded by catmint, agapanthus and hydrangeas and entered the cool chapel and were greeted by the fantastic Adriano and Eleonora we could not of had a more lovely special and magical visit. Every single detail was carefully thought about from the views from the loggia  at breakfast time to the delicious pizzas by the beautiful cool  breezy swimming pool garden , the rooms were full of delicious scents and Aqua Di Palma and the special dinner for my husbands birthday was carried out with such grace, humour and attention to detail it made us all enjoy our holiday all the more thank you to all the wonderful staff we will be back! 
We had a jammed packed Itinerary which varied from roaring around Florence on a motorcycles to a private visit to the Uffizi  that blew all our minds. Thank you thank you - we are all in heaven after the most marvellous of times.",5,2022,07,25
04,Wasted of time,"My son got married in Rome and we are in Florence , We decided to go for drinks here , Got here all dressed and having spent 33euros on taxi, they won‚Äôt let us in saying there‚Äôs an event so we can‚Äôt go in no matter what, 
Finally asked if we could go around in the gardens before leaving the guy the front said ok.
The bar area was completely empty and in the garden there were few hotel guests having their drinks.  The guy at garden bar said they were fully booked for drinks . But for 8 people there it was empty.They could have accommodate us for a one drink but no.
So disappointed for my son and his wife.",1,2022,07,23
04,Unforgettable Italy,The ambiance and service were excellent. We could not have asked for more. The views from the terraces were spectacular. From morning to evening you feel relaxed. Everyone was Dedicated and very attentive. ,5,2022,07,08
04,Something very special,"Fantastic hotel! Went there for our honeymoon as part of a road trip through Tuscany. The building and the surroundings are gorgeous, the view over Florence is stunning and the staff is very friendl and helpful.
We couldn‚Äôt have asked for much more and will be sure to go back.",5,2022,07,08
04,Pure Heaven.,"Being in this hotel was pure heaven and I dream of returning.  The staff were friendly and made us feel comfortable and very special.  We found that just living in the hotel for 4 days was a complete holiday in itself.  We visited a few museums in Florence, and then happily retreated back to our home base, Villa San Michele.",5,2022,07,06
04,Incredible Hotel - One of the Best,"We spent four days at Villa San Michele this May. We were also married at the hotel as well. 
It was an incredible experience. The hotel is a destintation on its own and the views are magnificent. The gardens are lush and extensive and the food is wonderful. 
I have read a few reviews about poor management, but please let me tell you the hotel is wonderfully run and the staff are the best. They are professional, kind, and personal. Susanna, our wedding contact at the hotel, went above and beyond for us. We will return over and over and couln't reccomend VSM any higher. ",5,2022,05,31
04,Heaven on earth!,"This hotel was absolutely outstanding.  I couldn‚Äôt fault it in any way.  Everything was exceptional- the grounds, staff, food, room, ambiance and most sensational views of Florence.  Would rate this hotel as by far the best in Florence and a must do experience!  Adriano from concierge was superb and got us best reservations in town.  Sofia the general manager was so helpful and professional.  All were kind and amazing. Well done!!",5,2022,05,26
04,Amazing !!!,"Villa Belmond San Michele is an amazing hotel. There is a painting of michaelangelo at the hotel on the wall, you feel the history everywhere, and the view is breathtaking. Service is excellent! Definitely would advice this to everyone who is looking for a great experience! ",5,2022,05,24
04,Exceptional,I stayed her for my birthday and it was fabulous.  The view; the service; the food; the accommodations were all fabulous.  The attention to detail to their guests‚Äô needs  (including their beautiful birthday gift) and the customer service will bring me back to this hotel in the future.,5,2022,05,21

Car that was ordered from airport didn't arrive, air conditioning stuck on max

A perfect resort to rest in a peaceful place.
We would definitely come back!
Thank you again to all the team for this incredible experience. ",5,2022,05,02
04,Breathtaking location,"We have been slowly working our way round the Belmond chain in Europe over the last few years and stayed here for 3 nights this week. The hotel is a converted monastery with a superb panoramic view across the whole of Florence from the Fiesole hillside. Our room was very comfortable with an excellent bed and well equipped shower room. (the shower lacked power at times however). The corridors are rather austere as one would expect from the previous monastic life, but the reception/ lounges/bar/ restaurants were well decorated in a renaissance style. We were welcomed enthusiastically by concierges and reception staff who were always very helpful.. We stayed half board and ate 2 nights in the Restaurant San Michele, food here and service was excellent. We dined at La Loggia on our last night and both had the the Vegetarian tasting menu which really was exquisite and on a par with many Michelin starred restaurants. Our only real disappointment was at breakfast, where on the first day we were standing around a good 5 minutes before we were seated and  had to order the cooked part of breakfast twice waiting nearly an hour to be served. The second day our hot food arrived at different times. Minor dissatisfaction but never previously encountered at other Belmonds.. The other gripe was that although we had paid half board for 3 nights, there was no credit towards eating at La Loggia rather than the standard restaurant. So we effectively paid twice for dinner.Overall another extremely good Belmond hotel where the positives very much outweigh the negatives and we will certainly return in the future",4,2022,04,21
04,Very disappointing from start to finish,"Short staffed, lack of detail that you‚Äôd expect from a high end hotel. A lack of professionalism at management level.  A huge amount of disorganisation that could easily be remedied.   Just disarray really.  The hotel does offer some splendid views but really doesn‚Äôt warrant the premium",1,2022,04,20
04,Disaster averted‚Ä¶The Art of Belmond is to exceed all expectations.,"We have fallen in love with Belmond hotels and trains all over the world and with the pandemic have narrowed our quest to concentrate on the European  Belmonds. My goodness what an eye opener it has been. The Villa San Michele has to be one of the most surprisingly fabulous hotels anywhere in the world. We were planning to simply travel to The Castello di Casole but my wife persuaded me that a few nights in Firenze would refresh our memories of our visit to the city and our stay at The Four Seasons. I was so surprised by the VSM in every respect. It exceeded all expectations and Elionora made us feel like royalty. Anyone who does not fall in love with this property misses the point of luxury travel. The new Manager Sofia made a point of chatting to us which is very important for Belmond aficionados as each visit is a curated experience to be cherished and the managers passion for their hotel vital. 
We are visiting The Caruso in Ravello on our next trip and already the Manager Alfonso Pacifico has been incredibly enthusiastic about his gem on the Neapolitan riviera. Where next? Taormina is tempting but which hotel do we visit‚Ä¶.The Timeo or The Villa San Andrea or do we avert another potential disaster and visit both. These are  serious choices in the World of Belmond!
We look forward to revisiting this hotel very soon and thank everyone for a remarkably memorable stay.

",5,2022,04,19
04,One our fave hotels in the world,"As discerning travelers who have been to 80 countries, my husband and I know one or two things when it comes to hospitality and excellent service.
We definitely consider Villa San Michele as one of our favorite hotels in the world. If there is a place close to Heaven, this will be it! A former monastery, the architecture is incredible, the view spectacular and the service superb! We want to thank the entire staff for making us feel home away from home. A special thanks to Adriano, Eleonora, Luanna, Sofia, Mauro, Enrico, Sara, Silvestro, Vitto, Anunzio and the rest of the staff! Grazie mille and we look forward to returning soon!",5,2021,11,28
04,The Absolute Best Hotel in Florence/Fiesole!,"Everything you  could ever  want: history, great food, great  service, astonishing views, beautiful location, clean rooms with high end Tuscan decor.  We can't wait to  return. From the moment you walk through the doorway of this beautiful  structure (the facade by Michelangelo himself!) you  are taken care  of in every manner. ",5,2021,11,16

04,Just Perfect,"This is a truly exceptional place to stay in a tranquil spot overlooking Firenze with stunning sunsets. We stayed in a superb suite, made up for our two children. There is a lovely warm swimming pool within the delightful grounds. The restaurant, Loggia, boasts great views and delicious cuisine. The icing on the cake though are the staff who are all so friendly and helpful, they really make you feel welcome. Special thanks to Adriano the concierge for all his help, particularly ‚Äúsaving‚Äù us from the train station after our travel agent had messed up our transfer. Grazi!",5,2021,10,26

The building and gardens are out of this world.
All who work there make you feel special and is if this is your second home.
You will not wish to leave.",5,2021,10,18
04,Incomparable,"It's been years since we've stayed at the Villa San Michele. Yes, we strayed to other properties in the Florence area, and while each of those had their positives, none are the full package  - the location, the room, La Loggia, the staff, everything was fabulous during our 3 night stay. There is no prettier place to have a drink in the evening than in gardens at sunset. We absolutely loved every second and cannot wait to come back. Adriano is the best!",5,2021,10,04
04,WHAT A MARVELOUS WEEK END,"just coming back from 4 nights at Belmond Villa San Michele . the stay was just incredible . the location , the view , the team , the service the restaurant , the pool ... everything was just perfect ? I highly recommend this location . surely the very best around Florence ",5,2021,09,21
04,Another Class,"This hotel is really in a class of its own. It's beyond beautiful and the staff is beyond friendly and accomodating. There are a lot of 5-star hotels to choose from all over the world, but in my opinion, there isn't a better choice than this one.",5,2021,09,15
04,extremely disbalanced,"Outstanding welcome and beautiful hotelrooms, ballrooms, terrasses (the entire infrastructure) BUT the human factor.. (Guests from the other side of the Atlantic Ocean behaved like in Spring Break and totally pissed servants made our stay very disbalanced. For this price I expect best notes in all aspects.",3,2021,09,09
04,An enchanting 3 -day stay,"Everything is perfect, location is amazing and beautifully mantained. Hoping to come back (very) soon !
La Loggia restaurant, the pool, the room service is just perfect; the only slight remark is about breakfast (in room) where a wider choice of French patisserie would be good to reach 10 out of 10 like everything else. Hoping to come back soon !",5,2021,08,25
04,"Killer location and setting, Belmond charme, but room value and facilities to be upgraded","One night stay between business trips. The location, the setting, the views are amazing. Manicured gardens and attention to details are among the best you can experience. Very polite staff, warm welcome and smooth check out. Rooms (we had a suite with terrace and city view) are a bit tired, consider you got to walk several steps (and this might be a problem for older guests or people with mobility issues), but it's still worthy.  A bit disappointing having to share the garden with an ongoing wedding. I normally consider hotels like Belmond should avoid allowing booking while the service and venue is affected by a wedding. Weddings limit the enjoyment of the location and it's not a good service to them too (I guess)... anyway.  We opted for the room service and... it was not outstanding. Cold and a bit average. Since it's not cheap and sells the Belmond brand, you would expect excellence. Staff was great, location and venue were amazing... but not perfect as you would require. Would suggest a visit, but not a long stay... and would love to get back in another season to change my mind. ",4,2021,08,23
04,Unique Hotel in Tuscany,"Belmond service is wonderful.  This is a fairly unique property which is very hilly and constrained by it's unique character.  The floorplans and layout reflect a repurposed villa; both charming yet quirky.  Rooms were a little tight and could use some additional warmth (rugs).  The topography makes for a lot of walking up and down as you circulate the grounds.  The proximity to Florence is very nice, we liked being just outside of the city.  Expect meals to revolve around an Italian schedule (late).  Our kids enjoyed it but this leans more towards adults and couples.",4,2021,08,15
04,Genuine Luxury.,"I dont know where to start as everything was just perfect. No flaws anywhere. Just a relaxing atmosphere and a genuine experience of luxury. 

The staff is the best I've ever seen anywhere. People are nice, friendly, warm, extremely well dressed, especially the ladies, and you will feel like at home the moment you enter the hotel. Nothing more to say. 

The hotel itself, being a 500 years old monastery is amazing, authentic, well decorated and very elegant. The place is just like heaven, with one of the most splendid view you can find anywhere in the world. The rooms are comfortable, elegant and the bathroom are provided with exceptional quality stuff. We had lots of small surprises during the stay: there are always fresh fruit or treats when you come back in your room. The bedding is just exceptional. The hotel as a whole is well conceived. The pool area is amazing as well.  

The breakfast and aperitives are just wonderful; the breakfast is the best I have ever taken in a hotel. The cocktails are also great, and complimentary snacks are excellent as well. We were delighted to  be offered some ham and cheese every evening before diner while having drinks. The music is  also great, and the pianists are amazing!  

If a few critics had to be made, I would just say that the pool itself isa bit old-fashioned. There are not many french channels on the TV. Also the restaurant for dinner is definitely not as good as the hotel, and I have made a different review about it on TripAdvisor. 

But these are all unsignificant comments regarding the level of service of the hotel. Thanks a lot for these wonderful moments, I hope to come back soon!",5,2021,08,15
04,Overwhelming moments @villasanmichele,"The Villa San MIchelel is embedded in the hills and offers a wonderful view of Florence. It is a wonderful retreat and still you can get to the city in no time.
The staff is very friendly, courteous and strives to provide the best service. They made our stay to an unforgettable experience.",5,2021,08,10
04,Special Place overlooking Florence,"My wife and I had the pleasure of staying 2 nights in a Junior Suite at this beautiful property. You can enjoy the charm of an ancient monastery sitting on a hill overlooking Florence which gives you a very special feeling.

What we particularly liked was the restaurant with an amazing view over Florence. The food and the service here were nothing short of exceptional.

I want to personally thank the Head Concierge Adriano for his amazing kindness and the willingness to explain the history of the building and the history-rich region around the hotel. He is one the nicest and most forthcoming concierges we have ever met.",5,2021,08,08
04,Still on the top,"Wonderfull, amazing hotel and area.
The view on Florence is fantastic, service is at the top, live music in the garden very nice,
Maybe breakfast and dinner must be faster and better organized.
Everything else is perfect.",4,2021,07,30
04,"Beautiful view, magnificent property, average food","Our last lunch as a family we visited this beautiful villa San Michelle on the hills overlooking Firenze ¬´¬†Florence¬†¬ª. The property itself is worth the visit, the staff very nice and service impeccable. Everyone seems to speak English or French so communication is no problem. 
The lunch was OK but I would have expected more refinement from such a elegant place. 
We loved to be there as the old monastery and view are beautiful. The view from the swimming pool is amazing.",4,2021,07,25
04,Amazing stay,A dream place to stay. Everything was excellent. We booked one more night. We did not want to leave plus free shuttle to Florence. We definitely come back next year. The views are spectacular and dinner with great music. Very romantic ,5,2021,07,18
04,Purely a gem in a beautiful part of Florence,"When you see the name Belmond in the title of the hotel, you should know what to expect,  pure luxury.  First class service lives here, talked about elsewhere . The grounds as most of their properties has breathtaking qualities, views from everywhere as the rooms are built into the topography to give all a great view. I‚Äôve been in many great p,aces, but this is special. The pool and services are perfect, it‚Äôs quiet, adult and they have very nice entertainment at night usually. It‚Äôs spotlessly clean and you will not care at all if you leave the property.  If your gonna be here in this part of Italy, enjoy the serenity, and get away from the tourist driven center city. IMO, the best place or at has at least my vote for it.",5,2021,07,13
04,One of the world‚Äôs great gems.,"The main part of the Villa is a former monastery. It has charming, weighty old stone work.  The main dining terrace overlooks Florence. The view is one of the world‚Äôs best.  The grounds are very well kept and their is rich decoration in the interior common spaces and immaculate landscaping outdoors. The service in the restaurant is impeccable.  Attentive. Well mannered.  The front desk staff is solicitous and skillful.  The food at dinner can compete with anyplace for its quality and the intelligence with which it is assembled and portioned.  The breakfasts include the freshest fruits and breads and thoughtfully composed egg and other dishes.  The overall atmosphere is sophisticated and serene.",5,2021,07,11
04,Short trip,"The property provides an amazing view over Florence which we enjoyed during each meal. The staff is incredibly positive and manages to create a unique atmosphere. 
Overall one of the very best hotels we have stayed at. ",5,2021,06,29
04,Perfect place for a relaxing time,"We decided to go  back to this beautiful property after more than 15 years after the last visit.
We were welcome by a very friendly and cheerful staff who made sure our short  stay was going to be special.
Service, ambiance and the beautiful scenery make our experience extremely positive.
At the dinner we choose a vegetarian menu degustation ‚Äúfloreal‚Äù very delicate and memorable.
After the long period of closure due to the pandemy, we thought that the personnel were all well trained and happy  
to be back in the industry.",5,2021,06,06
04,Luxury married with true Italian hospitality,"Staying at the Villa San Michele, overlooking the city of Florence, has been a bucket list item for us for years. When we discovered Italy had finally reopened to US citizens who were willing to provide certain documentation and follow directed protocols to enter the country without quarantine, we jumped at the chance to return to one of our favorite destinations.
It‚Äôs hard to imagine a warmer or more genuine welcome when we arrived. The Concierge, Adriano Pecoraro, immediately introduced himself, offering his services for anything to make our stay more enjoyable. Throughout our stay, he was there at every turn, ensuring every detail of our stay was simply perfection. The entire staff seemed genuinely pleased we had chosen to stay there, and I think this is really the heart and soul of the resort. The stunning grounds, the ancient frescoes, the stellar views and comfortable, low key elegance displayed in the rooms certainly adds to the overall experience, but the staff truly sets this place apart. The on site restaurant serves elegant local Tuscan dishes with a bit of an edge. The wine sommelier was delightful and very knowledgeable, and the prices were very reasonable for a resort of this caliber. Whether you choose to have drinks in the garden, overlooking the city, or on the terrace, the cocktail list is both innovative and classic. Try the house made Barrel aged Negronis, as beautiful as they are delicious. When you are ready to explore Florence, there‚Äôs a complimentary shuttle running on the half hour to drop you off at the Piazza Della Republicca. Simply return to the drop off spot when you‚Äôre ready to return to your oasis up the hill. 
If you‚Äôre on the fence about where to re engage with the world, and dip your toe back in to European travel again, I can‚Äôt think of a more perfect place. Andiamo!",5,2021,05,25
04,Breathtaking location!,"This very special hotel is is everything you could imagine to make your Tuscan vacation the best! The staff is amazing - friendly, knowledgeable..
Breakfast has the largest and freshest selection I have experienced in my travels.
The location is breathtaking, with a view of the city of Florence below. 
Walk along the beautiful garden, have a dip in the pool, then have cocktails and dinner on the beautiful terrace overlooking Florence.  
The rooms are beautifully appointed and very clean. Comfortable beds and ample bathroom.",5,2020,10,31
04,"Poor, sloppy service & limited restaurant ","Generally underwhelming hotel service & a poor restaurant - overall the experience was 2 star, rather than 5 star.

Dinner service in the restaurant was glacially slow - we ended up finishing our meal early on the second visit & walking out in despair. Not a patch on other Belmond restaurants we have eaten in.

The dinner menu is extremely limited - with only a few uninspiring menu choices for each course. The menu choice did not change during our stay.

We were told on check out - that apparently you can request alternatives cooked as ‚Äúspecials‚Äù. A bit late - it would have been helpful to have been told this on check in or noted on the menu...

No bar service or help around the pool for 2 of the 3 days we stayed. On the third day we had what looked like a gardener - dirty t-shirt, trainers & a ponytail - very occasionally appearing so you could order a drink.

On the positive side - reception staff are friendly, try to be helpful & removed the lousy meal from our bill on check out.
The breakfast in the restaurant is actually good. Minivan service in / out the city is also regular & useful.

Not sure if the poor service we experienced was because the hotel had recently reopened after Covid lock down or it‚Äôs just hapless hotel management or a bit of both?

It‚Äôs pity because it‚Äôs a nice looking hotel, with a beautiful gardens & view towards Florence - but we would not stay again because the service we experienced was so poor.",2,2020,10,28
04,Great Family Stay,"We had a short but extremely positive stay at Villa San Michele. Starting with the location and the well maintained historic building the first Impression was great and so was everything that was to follow. Wonderful warm welcome and pristine facilities, beautifully appointed Rooms with great views over Florence and such thoughtful amenities, including for our Kids. Such a memorable and Wonderful stay. ",5,2020,10,26
04,A Marvellous Hotel,"For my birthday, we spent 3 nights at the Belmond Villa St Michele.
A wonderful hotel.
The service is excellent-professional but friendly.

04,Absolutely Amazing.,"As you arrive, you know you have chosen the best place to visit Florence, close enough, yet, you get a feel of a lush escape. 
Roberto js the best waiter in all of Italy, hands down.
Thank you Emanuele,  for such a personalized level of attention.",5,2020,08,14
04,Terrible service,"My family stayed here last summer. The resort is beautiful. Our rooms were wonderful. Service was terrible. One morning, I had to ask FOUR times for coffee at the restaurant. Same thing with cocktails on the lawn at sunset. I ended up just going to the bar myself. I love Belmond and am sure they will get this sorted out.",2,2020,05,13
04,best view ,"I spent one night at this amazing property, the view is breathtaking, the food is delicious, the service is outstanding. Concierge team is extremely helpful. I especially love the bath amenities that you have, its from Acqua di Parma if i remeber correctly. The complimentary shuttle is very convenient, it takes you straight to the centre of Florence.",5,2020,02,19
04,A little too tired and old school,"This is a historic property nestled in the Fiesole hills overlooking Florence. It's an ideal place to be close to they city, but get a feel for the country side, landscapes and views. A few things for travelers note that were surprises to us:

1.) We stayed in October, which is the last month of their season and the property is fairly quiet. Due to this, the evening bar and poolside dining options were not available. If you are traveling towards the end of season, know that all amenities might not be available. This was honestly disappointing since it was not disclosed to us this might be the case, especially since we received several pre-trip emails from Belmond hyping these features.

2.) The non-dinner hotel dining options- like lunch in the main restaurant, room service, breakfast, mini bar- were some of the highest prices I have seen, even for a luxury hotel. Get ready to pay ‚Ç¨50 euro for a hamburger. To avoid these prices, we ventured down the hotel‚Äôs driveway to Coquinarius Fiesole, which was delicious. 

3.) The property was a former monastery and the rooms definitely have an old monastery feel- a little too much, in fact. Accommodations are definitely due for an upgrade, especially the decor and textiles.",3,2019,12,31
04,"Old rooms, Reception rude",We had stayed here a few years ago and really disappointed to see how much the hotel had gone backwards. The meal on the beautiful balcony restaurant was a real low light. I work with wine and the water not only made up incorrect facts about he wine he was rude and had to be taken off our table. Its a beautiful location but the staff really let this place down.,1,2019,12,16
04,Has seen better days.. ,"Had not been here in 25 years, and by the looks of it, no remodeling since.  Could definitely use an upgrade. Terrible WiFi and mediocre bathrooms. Overpriced, especially the room service and restaurant which aren‚Äôt as good as the hype would suggest. 
But the service is the best I‚Äôve found in Italy, friendly and efficient, and the setting - with lovely gardens overlooking Florence - makes it worth the journey. ",4,2019,11,03
04,Excellent in every way,"If you have the opportunity to stay here, you absolutely should. 

Amazing location, stunning views of Florence and Tuscany, 20 minute cab ride and free shuttle to city center.

Rooms are well appointed and comfortable. Great bath products 

Breakfast is excellent

The staff was incredibly helpful. Special shoutout to the concierge, Adriano. He took care of us well!",5,2019,10,19
04,Fantastic property,Our experience at San Michele was wonderful. We were able to get a room upgrade with our American Express Platinum card. The breakfasts and dinner were wonderful on the veranda. The view high above the city was fantastic. We took the bus each morning to town and returned in the afternoon. That was very convenient and helpful for walking to places of interest in the heart of the city. We did take advantage of the picnic dinner one evening that I had noticed on the website.  It was wonderful too. The only drawback not making it a 5 was the quality of the bed. It didn't seem to be at the same high quality of everything else we experienced at Belmond Villa San Michele. Thanks to all there for making our 50th a wonderful experience there.,4,2019,10,14
04,Perfect hotel for a couple visiting Florence,"My gf and I spent two days/two nights in Florence. We are late 20s/early 30s. This hotel was perfect. Decor/views/staff/rooms/drinks/bfast all 10/10. We couldn't believe we almost stayed in the noisy congested city...the pool area and outdoor drink areas are special. We had stayed at Splendid earlier in the trip and this setup reminded us of it. Felt like we were at the nicest hotel in Florence for sure. 

4 critiques but none of these made it not worth it. only the AC issue truly detracted from the stay bc we couldn't sleep as well. Might have been a dealbreaker in summer

1) shuttle to/from Florence stops 7:30pm but ideal dinner time is 8-9pm so you're forced to take a 35 euro taxi if you want to leave for dinner. Assume this is an intentional move to keep you at the hotel, which is unfair given so many great restaurants in Florence. So add 70 euro per night to your all-in cost unless you plan on eating at the hotel. Actually add 70 euro per night either way since hotel restaurant pricing is about that much more than good Florence restaurants. 

2) the pool is like 83f which isn't very refreshing if it's hot out

3) the gym is very sparse.

4) the AC sucks. doesn't go below ~75f. It was high 50s/low 60s outside at night when we were there, so the room was actually hotter than outside. you can't open windows or doors bc mosquitoes are bad (in October). This might have been a dealbreaker if had been summer vacay, when Florence gets to 80s even at night. Not sure what happens then...",5,2019,10,14
04,Dinner,"The view from VSM is unparalleled and the drinks and service, while watching the sunset, are sublime. The dining however, leaves something to be desired, particularly at those prices. My salted cod was practically inedible, chewy and almost tasteless. The pasta, while very good, was not at the excellent level I was expecting. Only the desserts measured up. There are many better restaurants in Firenze to preclude the necessity of a 25 E cab ride to VSM, unless one is only going for drinks and the sunset.",2,2019,09,14
04,Peace  and Quiet in the Hills above Florence,"We debated about staying outside of Florence. However we are glad we did. When we visited Florence, it  was hot and crowded. It was wonderful to return to the calm oasis that is Villa San Michele. The room was wonderful. The pool great(could be a little warmer).Breakfast was outstanding. We loved the house dog. Truly a magnificent property. Service very attentive. The View Awesome.",5,2019,09,13
04,Incomparable Villa San Michele,"
We cannot say enough wonderful things about our stay.  The service was absolutely impeccable!  The hotel and our room was a wonderful sanctuary after a full day in Florence.  The shuttle made getting in and out of Florence a breeze.  There is nothing like having breakfast/dinner on the veranda overlooking Florence!  Priceless!!",5,2019,09,11
04,August 2019,"My husband and I stayed here with our two little boys ages 4 and 2, for three nights.
It‚Äôs a magical place, high above Florence and with an old worlde air to it. We stayed in one of the Suites, room 65, which was a great location for us as it was close to the swimming pool. The bathroom was gigantic! 
My husband organised our anniversary meal at the Love Corner in the gardens and it was really beautiful, with fresh flowers and delicious food. I was really impressed at the variety of the vegetarian menu.
The transfer into Florence was well organised and the babysitter was very good.
We would come here again, probably without kids as it is so romantic.",5,2019,09,06
04,A real luxury experience!!!,This is a an excellent hotel if you like to be spoiled. From the arrival to the departure the service level is high and you feel the passion of the people who work hear! Great view on Florence great room! ,5,2019,09,06
04,My stay at Belmond Villa San Michele,"This is the absolute ""hotel-experience"".  Impeccable service and best quality you might expect.  Add to that a superb restaurant (with dedicated staff-members) and your holiday will be a succes.  We will be back...",5,2019,08,30
04,Truly memorable stay,I had a wonderful three nights at Belmond Villa San Michele. Everything about the stay was excellent. I couldn't recommend this hotel highly enough. It is expensive but you get what you pay for. The staff were friendly and very helpful. The food in the pool restaurant for lunch when spending a day by the pool was excellent and the food/the views at La Loggia were simply out of this world. The shuttle bus for Florence was regular and always on time. The whole stay was simply memorable and I will definitely be returning.   ,5,2019,08,15
04,Beautiful hotel,"We recently returned to this beautiful hotel, having visited on several previous occasions.  After a morning exploring Florence, it is a haven of peace and tranquillity away from the heat and bustle of the city, spending the afternoon by the pool with its extensive views over Florence and the Chianti countryside (and it‚Äôs slightly cooler up in the hills).

We arrived very early and our room was ready to check in.  We were also upgraded, which was a very kind gesture.  The rooms, service and general ambience are superlative. 

Set in a former 15th century monastery with a fa√ßade attributed to Michelangelo (how many hotels can boast that), the whole interior has been cleverly designed and styled to respect its heritage while combining modern facilities.  The concierge and reception staff we encountered are all charming and most helpful, so a big thank you for looking after us so well.

The only issue we had was the dining area.  Every night there is live music which is always amplified.  We had a room above the restaurant and most nights we didn‚Äôt really notice it, but on one particular night it was so loud it kept us awake until after midnight, when we lost patience and complained to the concierge, who then intervened to stop it.  When we first visited this hotel they had background music with a pianist.  We were told the change is part of a ‚Äòhappiness programme‚Äô apparently.  Needless to say, we were not happy with it.  We have never encountered this in all the other Belmond hotels in which we have stayed.

The Loggia restaurant terrace has one of the most beautiful dining terraces of any restaurant we have visited.  In previous years, the chef offered up traditional Tuscan dishes.  However, on our recent visit we were disappointed with the food on offer.  It lacked gusto, was bland and very expensive.  Many of the traditional old Tuscan dishes were no longer on offer.  When there are good Florentine restaurants in the area serving excellent Tuscan cuisine at a fraction of the price, there is little incentive to eat in this restaurant (apart from the setting/view) if they cannot serve food that at least matches the standards you get in Florence.

Aside from that, this is a wonderful hotel worthy of its five stars and definitely worth staying in if you‚Äôre looking to combine a visit to Florence with some rest and relaxation, supported by an excellent team.  We will definitely return.",5,2019,08,10
04,Beautiful retreat just outside Florence ,We loved this Hotel . We felt it was the perfect complement to Florence as it is set on the hills above Florence with stunning views. There is a shuttle every half hour into the city. We welcomed the haven of this special place after a hot shopping and wandering around the beautiful city. Especially appreciated the beautiful pool and bar area. A highlight was breakfast on the terrace every morning with the fabulous views. The concierges Adriano and Gabriele were superb. We went to the two best restaurants of our entire trip through Italy at their recommendation. The Restaurant at the hotel was also excellent. The ladies at reception ( both Lisa I think ) were delightful and extremely helpful. We would definitely return . ,5,2019,08,02
04,Amazing and special place,"We visited 30 years ago so went back for drinks while visiting Florence.  It was even more magical than we remembered.....a spectacular view of the city, wonderful service, and delicious cocktails and snacks.  I would highly recommend the trip up to Fiesole....totally worth it!!",5,2019,07,25
04,No attention to the surroundings,"Access street to this beautiful hotel is full of unchecked litter. 
Plastic bottles, cans, other rubbish. Not the kind of entrance you'd expect from such a superb place. 
Management should not have details like unchecked, which are visible if you walk to the hotel on your own. But walking to/from the hotel is also part of the experience, although 99% of guests probably never do this.",2,2019,07,23
04,Legendary hotel still living up to its reputation ,"I have wanted to stay at Villa San Michele since I first investigated Florence as a backpacking uni student decades ago. Then it was many times my budget but the link to Michelangelo and it‚Äôs reputation as one of the world‚Äôs great hotels persisted in
my memory.
Now part of the Belmond group, I stayed there with my way from and two young girls in a garden suite. 
We arrived very frazzled after a flight from Australia and an overnight at a Rome hotel that was well below the usual standard. The welcome on arrival and ambiance instantly made the travel stress a distant memory. The hotel and it‚Äôs position above Florence are magnificent- beautiful views, gardens, rooms and facilities creating the epitome of Tuscan calm. The service at every level is impeccable. 
The pool area is up high and the food and drinks service whether in La Loggia, by the pool or room service on your private terrace was excellent for adults and kids.
Our Garden Suite was large and easily catered for a family of 4. Access to Florence either by shuttle or taxi was easy and staying out of the stifling heat and July crowds is a much better way to enjoy Florence especially with young kids.
The only issue, if you could call it one, was that the hotel was so comfortable we weren‚Äôt that inclined to really do the attractions of Florence.
This hotel was definitely worth the wait loved it.
",5,2019,07,20
04,calm retreat with a magnificent view,"Belmond at it's best. Stayed there for two days in beginning of june. Temperature in Firenze was already challenging, but up in the hills of Fiesole it was just perfect! 
The Hotel is an ancient Villa that you enter by an old chaple after you've passed the wounderful garden through an monumental portal with an iron gate.

Here my pro/contra-List:
+ wounderful grounds around the building
+ fast and efficient reception
+ calm and relaxed atmosphere
+ tasteful interior
+ high quality bathroom amenities
+ incredible views at Firenze (deluxe room)
+ perfectly located restaurant from where you can even see the Duomo 
+ large pool (about 25m?)
+ attentive pool service and bar

o deluxe room was maybe a bit moderately sized ...but, ok it's an historic building
o lunch and diner were very good but a bit overprized (compared to other Belmonds)

- service at lunch and diner was changing between professional snobistic and clumsy

Belmond is always the right choice for us: perfect service, outstanding locations, tastful interiors.",5,2019,07,13
04,Spectacular in every respect,The hotel sits above the city. The rooms are perfection. The pool and gardens are a welcome retreat from the great city of Florence. What makes it even extra special is the staff. The concierge deserves every key they have on their collar. ,5,2019,07,03
04,First class 5 star hotel,"The hotel sits high above Firenze with spectacular views of the city Arno and the Duomo.
Formerly a monastery so full of interesting rooms. The pool is lovely with a great pool bar and restaurant.
The room we had was an upgrade junior suite which was fabulous with its own private terrace and huge bathroom.
The bed was exceptionally comfortable with a choice of 9 types of pillow!
The restaurant is situated on a long side balcony with amazing night views of the city.
The food was excellent we ate there on 3 nights.
A shuttle into town was useful.
The hotel is high up and not easy to find with narrow roads.  Parking is not easy just leave it to the concierge.
All staff were very friendly efficient and made you feel genuinely welcome.
I would highly recommend the hotel but not cheap.
One of the best Bellinis I have ever had!",5,2019,06,29
04,A demi paradise ,"This was our third stay at Villa San Michele and the first since it became part of the Belmond Group. The hotel, the views over Florence and the gardens remain spectacular while the terrace is the most wonderfully romantic setting for a restaurant but  compared to previous stays it seemed that Belmond has compromised on the quality of the food while maintaining prices. None of the meals we had were of the standard expected of a hotel of this category. Breakfast and lunch were particularly disappointing. 

San. Michele is a landmark 15th century building and once a monastery that once combined the spirit of its past with everything expected of a superb five star hotel. The abstract modern artwork and some of the drab furniture added by the new owners seemed to us to be out of place in this  historic building. The new bathroom and furnishings in the bedroom however were welcome additions and the staff go out of their way to please. Still worthy of five stars.

 ",4,2019,06,25
04,Bellissimo,"Amazing - the hotel was truly wonderful, the staff welcoming and helped to make our stay one of the best holidays I have had with my best friend!

04,Fantastic Hotel,"I visited this hotel as part of my birthday celebrations with my partner in May. On arrival I was told that we had been upgraded to a Deluxe room for my birthday. The room was fantastic, spacious and quiet. All the staff at this hotel are outstanding, so friendly and nothing is too much trouble.  The restaurant serves delicious food and there was a great selection of wines and cocktails. This hotel is quite pricey but worth every penny for the efficient friendly service and high quality of the hotel. I thoroughly recommend .  üòÅ",5,2019,05,15
04,5 star experience and above!!!!,"We visited The Belmond San Michele through a recommendation from a friend. We booked the cocktail lesson ‚Äòshake & drink‚Äô and emailed hotel to book. Signor Pecoraro was extremely helpful with answering my questions and booking the lesson. I was also very pleased that we were able to take the hotel bus from Florence direct to the hotel even though we were not staying at the hotel. On arrival the hotel and gardens were stunning. We were greeted by Gabriele gave us a very polite and warm welcome. He also took the time to give us a short history of the hotel  said we could have a walk round the gardens as we had arrived early for the cocktail lesson. The views were amazing! The cocktail lesson with barman Lorenzo Aiosa was fantastic and cannot thank him enough for making our experience unforgettable. His knowledge was incredible as we asked lots of questions & the cocktails he made were the best we‚Äôve tasted. All the staff were so friendly and we loved meeting ‚ÄòAfrica‚Äô the hotels resident dog. She was so soft, friendly & cute! Overall the whole experience was one of the best afternoons we have ever had! I would recommend the cocktail lesson even if you are not staying at the hotel just for the level of service, quality of the food & drinks and the views. I would give the hotel another 5 stars if I could! Grazie mille al hotel Belmond San Michele! We will certainly return the next time we visit Florence ",5,2019,05,08
04,Wedding Destination,Beautiful hotel very good accommodations.  Service is very attentive. Is very well located close enough to Firenze but not that close. The views from everywhere in the property is superb.  My only negative observation is the food. It was ok but prices were ridiculous.  9 Euros for a small diet coke and 40 Euros for a club sandwich is steep.  ,4,2019,04,28
04,Heaven in Florence,"The only way to describe the experience this hotel offers is pure fairytale. From the check in experience, we were treated like royalty. The concierge and the wonderful people at the reservations desk go above and beyond to make sure your stay is magical. The property itself is straight from a hollywood movie. We stayed in the deluxe king room and it is superb, the bathroom is fit for a king, the bed is so comfortable and the views will keep you staring out the window all day! There is a free shuttle the runs every hour to the center of florence until about 8pm. Any taxi trip will run you around 30euros. If you plan accordingly you don‚Äôt need to spend a dime on transportation. Breakfast is included in the room stay and is delicious and plentiful.

I cannot wait to return! ",5,2019,04,08
04,Fantastic Experience.,"One of the best hotels in the Florence area.  Secluded from the hustle and bustle of Florence, overlooking the city, tremendous grounds and service.  Highly recommend.  Shuttle was a great easy way to get into the city and then escape the chaos when you want to retreat from it all.",5,2019,01,22
04,Amazing views of Florence. Beautiful luxury hotel. Amazing food. Very good staff. Free shuttle ride to city center,Amazing views of Florence. Beautiful luxury hotel. Amazing food. Very good staff. Free shuttle ride to city center. Garden rooms have the best views. Good sized rooms. Often when low occupancy you get an upgrade.,5,2019,01,13
04,Out of the fray in cool hills above Florence!,"We are huge Belmond fans, so always glad to try one of their properties. This hotel sits high in the hills above Florence. A regular hotel shuttle runs you in and out of town. Perfect arrangement for taking in all the city while getting out of the fray at the end of the day. We were upgraded to a small suite. Lovely room and amenities. Pool with a city view. Gorgeous view all over the grounds. Many steps, so be ready. Restaurant buffet for breakfast as part of the room rate. Ate one night for dinner. Was fine but not stellar. But why eat at hotel when the food in Florence awaits?! Rooms are pricey. We would book again for a night or two, but hard to say what the property and staff delivered was worth the high cost. I would give it 3.5 rating if allowed. ",3,2018,11,23
04,Absolutely outstanding place to stay,The hotel was extremely clean and the staff provided exceptional service. What you see in pictures are exactly what you see when you‚Äôre here. The views from the hotel are like out of a magazine. The staff will go out of their way to offer suggestions and make arrangements for places to eat based on what you want to experience. Can‚Äôt say enough how amazing this hotel was.,5,2018,10,03
04,Views of Florence that will Take Your Breath Away,"Elegant, five star hotel/relais in Fiesole, overlooking the Tuscan hills ... with Florence at your feet.  One of very few hotels in the world that we just wanted to hang out and relax in... and never leave.  Fabulous breakfasts. Romantic terrace dining at dinner. Seaonal fresh white-peach bellini‚Äôs are superb!  And you are just minutes from the center of town ... in Florence.",5,2018,10,02
04,Dinner visit,This review is about dinner at the hotel not an overnight stay.  We recently ventured out of Florence for an evening at this hotel for dinner. The food was delicious and the service was great! While the drive up and the property are beautiful the dinner was extremely expensive and overpriced. I‚Äôm not too surprised given this is a very high end hotel but 11 Euros for hot water with lemon is ridiculous. I‚Äôve stayed at very nice hotels before and was surprised to see that i was even charged for this.  I would not waste your time visiting this hotel for dinner and probably wouldn‚Äôt recommend staying there unless you are a stuffy environment.,3,2018,09,26
04,5 days in Florence,"From the minute we arrived to the minute we left, we were looked after at the highest level. The views are of course, breathtaking, the standard of service is way above 5 star and the dining varied and interesting, pool and bar and gym all good and spotless with the same  high quality of service.
The shuttle minibus takes you to and from town and runs to time and frequently but after 4 days, a taxi was a nice option.
We must make a special mention of Adrianou the concierge, a mine of information and nothing is ever too much trouble. He was superb.
We just loved it all and met some really interesting people as well",5,2018,09,22
04,Nigel Howorth ,"After 4 nights and now transferred to a sister Belmond hotel nearby. Our summary is as follows:- location and views are spectacular; staff friendly, super efficient & first rate every way; management seemed to ignore the fact that this claims to be a non-smoking hotel in that guests were smoking. Management needs to be more proactive in dealing with issues such this also we & others were kept awake until 4 a.m. by a wedding party - this means there is no alternative location for parties or functions to be separate from guest areas onto which they encroach. 
Some furnishings & comfort were disappointing - bathroom towels were worn, thin and needed replacement; dining terrace chairs were small & uncomfortable; outdoor terrace seating is also poor - the only really comfortable seating being lay-beds by the pool. The many steps; stairs & distance to some rooms make this hotel a challenge for people with limited mobility - a golf buggy is used for transportation of luggage rather than guests. 
The buffet breakfast was surprisingly  disappointing by comparison with other Belmond hotels we have stayed in - including the current one.

04,80 th birthday lunch,Went for lunch to celebrate a friends 80 th birthday. Such a beautiful setting. Drinks on the terrace a little disorganised but who cares when you have Florence before you! Food lovely and service very attentive. A special place.,4,2018,09,16
04,80th. Birthday. ,"I took my family for lunch at the Villa San Michelle. It was to celebrate my 80th birthday. The staff were all brilliant. The view was brilliant +. The service was very good   and the food is very good. We have been before and would honestly say it is worth paying just for the wonderful location the setting and the amazing panarama. Thank you all.

04,Italy 2018,"Great hotel wonderful staff. Thought the food at dinner was not the best. The waiter in the evening was not able to make a small  change on a salad properly.  Disappointing considering the very steep price!
Staff was great in the hotel!",4,2018,09,04
04,Nice Retreat from Florence,"Stayed three nights. Arrived by train from Milan. Paid for hotel transfer. Over priced as Florence cabs are excellent and approximately ‚Ç¨30 to the hotel. However, transfer driver provided a great brief history of the city. Hotel is spectacular in its historic beauty. Our junior suite was well appointed - nice size, bathroom well appointed, bed and pillows extremely comfortable. Hotel staff is first rate from the dining staff to the front desk and concierge. Breakfast buffet is top notch. Dinner at the restaurant was outstanding in as lovely a setting as possible. Don't look at the cost of dinner - super expensive but if you stay at this level hotel it is expected. We had an excellent dinner the second night at a trattoria 5 minutes away recommended by the concierge - ‚Ç¨100 for three courses, best bottle of red I can recall at any price and two glasses of prosecco. Third night ate at Reggia up the hill from the hotel on the concierge's recommendation. Best view of the city and great food as well. Hotel is fantastic but it's best attribute is as a retreat from the crowds and heat after sightseeing. Easy to zip in/out of city either on the free shuttle or taxi. We hope to visit again. ",5,2018,08,27
04,Absolutely perfect hotel in Florence,"If you are traveling to Florence, do not look any farther than the Belmond Villa San Michele.  On a hill overlooking the city, it is a breath of fresh air outside the noise and crowds, while being close enough to reach the city center in just a few minutes.  My husband and I have stayed in luxury hotels all over the world, and both agreed we loved this hotel better than anywhere else we have ever stayed.  The hotel itself is beautiful, with breathtaking views and gorgeous landscaping.  And the staff is absolutely perfect -warm, welcoming and helpful in a way that is hard to find today.  Their attention to detail is superb.  The best compliment I can give is that we are planning to return to Florence so that we can once again stay at this magical place!",5,2018,08,23
04,Amazing,"When we arrived at Villa San Michele we were greeted by the manager who informed us we had been upgraded to a suite.This was a special occasion for us as it was our golden wedding and believe me the hotel made it a very special and memorable occasion in every way.Every member of staff are outstanding and extremely helpful,the hotel is delightful and the views are to die for! We ate at the hotel for the 3 nights of our stay and found the food to be excellent.The hotel also arranged for us to have a 2hour Tuk Tuk city tour with a wonderful guide we would definitely recommend this as it's a wonderful way to see everything.",5,2018,08,19
04,Family in Florence Trip,"Having a wonderful time here at the hotel.  Lorenzo makes a terrific Old Fashioned and a talented piano player and singer croons over a Florence cityscape.  They do a magical job here.  And a first class Concierge, Adriano, makes this stay particularly special.  The staff is friendly and warm, and Africa, the black lab, makes for a great mascot.",5,2018,08,11
04,Terrific experience in Florence,"My wife and I spent two nights there for a friends' event. What a magnificent experience we had! The hotel is overlooking the city of Florence and we had a nice room with fantastic views of the city. Breakfast menu and service were superb. And the entire staff was very helpful and joyful. I also tried, and liked, the outdoor pool located on the hill over the main building. The location some distance from the center of the city is well compensated by the convenient free shuttle bus service connecting the hotel with the Republic Square.",5,2018,08,01
04,Best ever retreat from daily worries,"Florence is certainly a unique place, but once you get to this hotel, you start to doubt if the destination was the city or the hotel itself.
Hard to describe what makes it so unique.Whether it is the atmosphere of the well restored monastery that takes you to the calm of the Renaissance, the astonishing views over the city of Florence from the loggia, the cheering friendly manners of the staff or the lush vegetation in the Italian gardens, everything seems to be there to make you feel like Albius Tibullus or Petrarca, tempted by a ""dolce far niente"" that turns irrelevant whether or not to visit the city that can be viewed from above in the hotel gardens with a refreshing drink in your hand.
Food is another great point of the hotel. Eating at the loggia restaurant is an experience for all senses. Although prices are of those that most cannot afford, service, scene, food and views are worth to pay for them. If one chose to eat at the bar, better be prepared for long, long waiting time. That is Italy at the end...
For those that do not want or have difficulties in climbing stairs, better ask before. Stairs are everywhere as the hotel is in the side of a mountain: stairs for reaching your room, for going to the swimming pool, etc.  My recommendation: ask for the suits 46 to 52, which have lesser stairs and have their own little yard with breathtaking views over Florence.",5,2018,07,30
04,Perfect venue for visiting Florence,"Another excellent Belmond Hotel.

Fantastic views over Florence and an excellent prompt free shuttle service regularly into the city. Much better than staying in the city itself.

We needed a car for our onward visit but once parked by the concierge we did not need the car until we were leaving. 

Food was excellent in both quality and choice and an excellent wine list.

Very nice pool area and al fresco lunchtime dining.

Staff were excellent and attentive to our needs.

Would recommend Belmond for consistent quality.",5,2018,07,23
04,Four days of relaxing bliss above Florence,"Beautiful room, wonderful service, great food and elegance. Dining overlooking Florence with with great food and wine was marvelous.  The gardens are beautiful.  The pool and restaurant was a perfect way to relax after the heat of Florence.",5,2018,07,06
04,A beautiful hotel - highly recommended,"What an amazing hotel.  We loved it.  A former convent, they have kept a lot of the original features (as well as some amusing extras) but still provided a luxurious place to stay.  Rooms are spacious with all facilities and grounds are beautiful.  There are stunning views over Florence.  The reception staff and concierge were very helpful, recommending things to do and local restaurants.  We ate in the hotel restaurant one evening and thought it was lovely.  Some people have commented on Trip Advisor about the cost, yes, it is expensive, but you get what you pay for and the service was first class, food delicious and we had a table outside on the terrace with beautiful views.  We would definitely recommend this hotel and would not hesitate to go back.",5,2018,07,04
04,Beautiful hotel giving the best of both worlds,"There is nothing I can really add to the glowing reviews before mine other than to say that this is a wonderful hotel and I would certainly return. The only negative for me is the quite ridiculous prices charged for basic food or drinks (‚Ç¨26 for a basic chicken salad, ‚Ç¨11 for a jug of tap water with lemon in it and ‚Ç¨40 for a burger anyone?). Despite those prices I still give it five stars as it offers amazing service, lovely grounds and the option of being in the middle of Florence in 20mins, but being able to take in beautiful views of it at night.",5,2018,07,03
04,Amazing location ,"This boutique hotel is in the hills above Florence about a 20-30 minute taxi ride from the airport. The views are stunning and the accommodations very nice. The restaurant is open air with views of downtown. The property is on a hill and all rooms in the main building require walking up steep staircases, no elevators. There are rooms with terraces on the property and these also require walking up stairs or transportation by the hotel staff and a golf cart. The pool is on the upper most part of the property, quite beautiful but quite a walk uphill or transportation by the staff again. The food in the restaurant was quite delicious, the food from the room service menu was not always what we expected and was quite expensive. The hotel staff was impressive and almost everyone spoke English. There is a free shuttle service into town every hour. 
",5,2018,06,29
04,Truly Wonderful Hotel,"This really is a truly wonderful hotel in a fantastic location overlooking Florence. We stayed for 5 nights and it provided a very welcome retreat from the heat and crowds in the city. There is a free shuttle bus that drops you right in the centre of Florence and picks you up when you have had enough sightseeing and shopping, both of which are excellent. We had a junior suite with a lovely garden at the front where we could sit and admire the views.  The food is first class and the views from the terrace at dinner make this an occasion to remember. The hotel itself is immaculately presented.  All the staff without exception were very attentive and couldn't do enough to help. We must extend special thanks to Cecilia, the deputy manager, for helping to make our stay so very special. We will most definitely be returning to this gem.",5,2018,06,28
04,Love it!!!,"We stayed for my husband‚Äôs birthday celebration and I wanted a special place, after reading many reviews I decided to give Villa San Michele a try, and Oh my god! It‚Äôs so beautiful so peaceful, I slept like a baby we didn‚Äôt want to wait for dinner so we had lunch right away in the beautiful restaurant .... anyways don‚Äôt want to spoil the surprise, I s√∫per recommend it! ",5,2018,06,18
04,A true gem stay when you visit Florence,An amazing location overlooking Florence.  An old convent converted to a superb 5 star appearance.  The restaurant has breathtaking views and even if you cant stay there is is worth a visit for dinner or even a drink watching he sunset over Florence.  Very friendly staff who are brilliant.,5,2018,06,02
04,Consistently outstanding.,"This was our second visit to VSM. Accommodation, food and service was 1st class. Gardens and pool are maintained to a very high standard. Some of the newer, younger members of staff seem a little nervous when dealing with guests but the experienced ones will soon get them up to speed. Attention to detail prevails throughout this hotel. We will definitely be back. If I had to make one criticism.... what on Earth possessed them to move the reception area from the breathtaking entrance and relocate it to a nearby corridor???",5,2018,06,01
04,Majestic!,Stayed for first few days of our honeymoon. Absolutely beautiful - the breakfasts on the verandah overlooking Florence were amazing and we loved being able to go into Florence and then retreat back to this stunning Villa in the afternoon and take in the scenery around the pool.,5,2018,05,29
04,Presidents club trip was outstanding!!!,"My colleagues and I loved this hotel! The service, the food, the view, the location, everything was perfection. I will be back!!!
They were very accommodating, the grounds were beautiful, it was a gorgeous, quiet, large old monastery. We will definitely be back! ",5,2018,05,20
04,The sound of songbirds!,"A beautiful hotel set in a lovely garden in the hills high above Florence, surrounded by a forest filled with songbirds.
Elegant rooms, lovely dining room, excellent service, fabulous views.
We were disappointed that the panoramic swimming pool was closed during our visit; but one of the managers showed me a secret scenic path into Fiesole, where there are wonderful walks and vistas. 
Waking up to the sound of songbirds and a distant view of one of the most beautiful cities in the world -- magical!",4,2018,05,17
04,Stunning views,"The hotel is a very old building in the outskirts of Florence. It does have huge limitations because of the structure. A lot of stairs and not very easy if there is adverse weather conditions ,there is no plenty public areas and the only place to resort is inside the rooms. 

However on a sunny day is paradise. The views of Tuscany country side are breathtaking. The garden among the main building and the bungalow suites is very nice and relaxing. It is worth spending a cosy weekend but i dont recommend if you have business in Florence city due to the traffic back and foreworth. ",3,2018,05,17
04,Beautiful hotel with amazing view over Florence,"This hotel has an unbelievable setting, overlooking the entire city of Florence from up on the hillside. The main building is beautiful and the restaurant is cleverly set out along an arched veranda so that every table offers a view over the city. As the lights come on in the evening you could not get a more romantic spot. Our room was lovely in an understated way. The tiled floors and slightly rustic feel are made elegant with crisp white linens and plenty of space (we had a junior suite). The front terrace overlooked the lawns with a partial view over the city too. The grounds are beautifully looked after with an abundance of flowers and we were even lucky to have sunny and warm enough weather to lie by the pool in early April. The view from the pool at the top of the grounds looks out over the whole of Florence in a peaceful spot. 
The service was fantastic. Everyone in this hotel goes out of their way to be friendly, yet they strike the right balance between friendliness and politeness at all times. The food was amazing, we actually ate in the restaurant all four evenings because we didn't think we could beat it for food, quality, service or the view. We also loved the pianist who played in the evenings.Some might prefer to be closer to the city for nightlife but for us this was the perfect antidote to the hustle and bustle of the crowds in central Florence. The shuttle bus is very handy to get down and back during the day. It is also worth walking into the local town of Fiesole, a lovely small place with a village feel but some impressive Roman archeological remains and a monastery at the highest point with the most incredible views. 
We will definitely be coming back to this hotel again, as well as loving our time there, we also got engaged over dinner in the restaurant, so that deserves a return visit in addition to everything else!",5,2018,05,07
04,Exquisite property!,The views are breathtaking! Very quiet location overlooking Florence. The tasting menu with wine pairing at the  restaurant is not to be missed. The rooms are well appointed and very comfortable. The personal service from all staff is first rate. The Head Concierge Adriano made wonderful recommendations for dining and sightseeing and anticipated our every need. We will be back!,5,2018,04,28
04,"Stunning location, first class service, some small niggles","This had long been a dream destination to sample and the actual experience did not disappoint. The villa, our room, the superb gardens and the service were all excellent and enhanced by the cloudless days and the warm spring sunshine. 

A particular highlight was the daily breakfast served in the Loggia restaurant, the perfect combination of quality food, priceless views and excellent service. All staff were friendly and welcoming, topped off by a concierge with a wonderful sense of humour.  The gardens were idyllic and the large pool area ideal to soak up some afternoon sun and the views after a morning in busy Florence.

The hotel shuttle bus was both highly useful but a necessity given the VSM location. We used it each day and with no problems but carrying only eight passengers it's unclear if you'd struggle to get on it in high season.

For us there were a few niggles that stopped thus being a 5* experience:

- the garden was open to non residents (and it appeared just for drinks talking to one couple, rather than dinner) and so finding the best sunset view seats already occupied by visitors rather than residents was a bit galling

- the room service prices are eye watering, I've never seen a single club sandwich listed at $50 

- the evening piano singer was a nice touch but playing through an amplified speaker  until 11pm meant you had to close windows if you did want an earlier night.",4,2018,04,28
04,Beautiful property,"We visited this hotel for 4 nights over the August bank holiday. It is set in a beautiful location in the hills of Fiesole over looking Florence. There is a shuttle bus to take you in and it of the centre of Florence and it was wonderful to be able to retreat from the city heat to the tranquil hotel surroundings and the fabulous swimming pool. We stayed in a junior suite. The rooms private terrace was a great spot for an early evening drink. We dined in the hotel on one evening. The tasing menu and wine pairing was out of this world and surpassed our expectations of a hotel dining room. The views towards Florence are of course beautiful but the hotel is much more than just the views.
Cecilia and her team do a marvellous job. The service is understated and unobtrusive yet they ensure that you are looked after from the moment that you arrive. 
 ",5,2018,03,08
04,Best Hotel Ever,"We had a 3 night stay in the hotel during August.  This was a return visit with our family after being married in Florence & holding our wedding reception at the hotel 10 years previous.  The hotel can only be described as perfect in every way.  The accommodation, the setting, the dinning experience,  the attentiveness of the staff is excellent.  The views from the swimming pool over Florence are beautiful and the views in the evening from the gardens are mesmerising.   Dinning is a must.  The dinning area is stunning, food is excellent and the chef is very accommodating, only too happy to adapt the dishes to suit the younger guests.  Nothing was a problem. 

My daughter had tears when we had to left. ",5,2018,03,04

The place is close winter time.",5,2018,02,24
04,You Don't Want to Leave,"I booked myself into the Belmond San Michele for the final two nights of my trip to Florence over the summer thinking that I might continue my sightseeing from this hilltop perch, but once I arrived I never wanted to leave the property. I was booked into one of the main building hotel rooms but was upgraded to one of the terraced rooms just below with a private terrace. It was very private, quiet with incredible views. Truthfully, I spent most of my time at the pool having lunch there twice. Dinner in the hotel's well-regarded restaurant was an experience; I chose the tasting menu with wine pairings and dined watching the sunset over the historic city below. The concierge was extremely helpful and organized a massage for me that was great. You feel as though you're in someone's private Tuscan villa and the service is attentive, personal but not overly visible/overbearing. The outdoor area where drinks are served was my outpost; I sipped Rossini's there every night.",5,2018,02,21
04,Gorgeous,"We stayed here in October, Villa San Michele having long been on our bucket list, and we were not disappointed.  The hotel has the supreme elegance that is typical of Belmond hotels, but here the entrance fa√ßade, lobby and public spaces are particularly spectacular.  Yes, it is breathtakingly expensive, but we didn't regret it for a second.  We opted to have lunch from the bar menu outside in the enormous garden terrace, looking out over the rooftops of Florence - a cheaper option than lunch in the dining room, but a good option if the sun is shining and the setting is just as stunning.  Bedrooms are beautifully appointed and our bathroom was gobsmackingly gorgeous.  Service is professional and attentive, with that charm that characterises Belmond hotels - all round we have some very special memories.",5,2017,11,05
04,Monestary high above the city,"Spectacular views, outstanding food and a unique setting make this the perfect refuge from the tourist frenzy that is Firenze.  Tuscany at its best in an elegant environment where the cares of the world melt away.  Unique rooms, most with views and a chance for quiet while still offering good access to the museums and shopping. Bring your platinum card.",5,2017,10,16
04,"Superb, Relaxed but elegant ","We spent 5 days here and enjoyed it completely. The staff is attentive but not noticed. The view of Florence is superb at the restaurant, from your room and from the entrance to the courtyard.  We enjoyed afternoon wine in the sun drenched breezy courtyard with an incredible view of Florence from under an umbrella. Breakfast and dinner are superb again with views and dinner with a wonderful pianist. 

Breakfast can be requested in your room and this was perfect as well. Enjoy wine in your private terrace or courtyard or explore the rooms of the prior monastery. 

Room service is superb and we enjoyed the suite. The housekeepers were incredible, detailed and gracious. 

We had everything we needed and more. I was very impressed with the staff and their desire to please. 

This is a wonderful property to be enjoyed and not just a place to sleep. 

Their club sandwich was great as well as other dishes. Veal Milanese was excellent but was saltier on some evenings. 

A wonderful place to think and relax. I would as in most hotels hope for a larger shower but otherwise very comfortable. 

I would return and just  hibernate here savoring the view and serenity.  ",5,2017,10,14
04,Simply amazing,"Words cannot describe how beautiful this property is. The staff were amazing, the amenities splendid and the views spectacular. I‚Äôve never slept so well in my life. The history alone behind the property is worth making the trek for. If you are thinking about booking- do it. You won‚Äôt regret it.",5,2017,10,12
04,"like another world, luxury","Amazing service, but very, very pricey. Quiet, amazing views, close to old town of Fiesole. Room service and dinner is very pricey. But they can get taxis and also have a shuttle down to Florence often. Rooms are quiet, and god size. Bathrooms are heavenly. The grounds make you feel like you are in a time warp. Heck Prince Charles stayed there the week before I did.",5,2017,10,10
04,Couldn't Say Anything Negative,"Visited Belmond for an evening meal and drinks as a celebration with some friends. Upon entering the ground you are blown away with the beauty of the building, followed by incredibly helpful and welcoming staff. We ate outside on Lovers Corner table and the view was simply incredible. Our waiter Davida was equally just as great and our night couldn't have been any nicery. Obviously the hotel prices come with the premium of the view, but still relatively reasonable considering what you get in return. Will be visitng again and staying here next time. Incredible in every sense. You won't be disappointed if you visit or stay here.",5,2017,10,02
04,ITALIAN HOSPITALITY AT ITS BEST,"Villa San Michele is in a perfect location. The property is immaculately kept. We stayed in the limonaia suite and it was beautiful. The view is magnificent. Breakfast,Lunch and Dinner perfect. However what really makes this hotel outstanding is its staff. Belmond should be very proud of their employees.",5,2017,09,29
04,"Excellence , attention to detail . Charming care for the guest experience.","We loved our stay here . This hotel has very dedicated staff who take great care and pride in making sure that guests have a fabulous experience here . The views down into Florence are second to none . The hotel shuttle bus down into Florence ( Piazza Della Republicca ) is a great facility and an enjoyable way to see more of Florence . Breakfast buffet was excellent and of high quality . Our evening meal when we dined in on our first night , was fine but we felt for the money it cost that the food lacked a "" wow factor"" having said that , everything else was perfect for us .  We are already planning to return here in the future , we loved our stay .",5,2017,09,29
04,"BYO kettle, BYO mug and spoon. BYO tea bags or coffee.","On arrival, or After dinner (which was not very good) you cannot retire to your room and get your robe out and make your own tea or coffee. There is no kettle or any tea making facilities. You have to order it from the hotel and wait for someone to deliver, and it will be the hotel's own version of what the coffee is supposed to be. It will be cold. 
I get the old school service thing, and it really is quite graceful to go up to a Lounge and do that from time to time, but sometimes you just want to do it yourself. It's like these guys are still sticking to old service ideals that are akin to sticking with Windows 95 because the old ways are better.
Do both. It will be less irritating for your guests.
Surroundings, Location, Views, Gardens, Room all superb. Somehow, and oddly, do not feel welcomed.
btw - 2nd room keys not allowed. Told it was a hotel security issue.
So, if your wife is in the shower and you want to get a coffee in the lounge you go out the door and leave the room unlocked. (You need to take the key to lock the door from the outside). Something wrong with the hotel's priorities don't you think.

04,Paradise!,"The Villa San Michele is visually stunning.  Everywhere you look, there is elegance and beauty.  From the entry court to the reception area, gardens, restaurant and pool- the vistas are what dreams are made of.  
The concierge, Maurizio Ammazzini,  had assisted me via email prior to arrival to coordinate transportation from Florence, made suggestions for dinner reservations and greeted us warmly to check us in and personally provide us with a tour of the property and our beautiful room.  The service from everyone at the hotel was exceptional.  It feels as if you are staying in a beautiful private palazzo and staff gets to know you and anticipate your every need and desire.  Our room was perfectly outfitted and comfortably furnished in a lovely Tuscan style with every high end amenity desired.  Beautiful marble bathrooms with Bulgari bath products, silky smooth bed linens and an incredible view of Florence from our window completed the accommodations.   Breakfast was inclusive with our stay and was delicious- all enjoyed on a loggia overlooking Florence.  It is simply magical, we loved it.",5,2017,09,24
04,Our Italian home,"Just stayed for the sixth time,  that should speak volumes- a unique luxury hotel without any of the pretensions,  we hope nothing changes because it's perfect. The staff is like family and will accommodate whatever needs you have",5,2017,09,20
04,Amazing,"Fantastic hotel.  Used to be a monastery so some great architecture. Great views over Florence, excellent attentive staff, superb food!
The hotel is set up in the hills above Florence - a short trip in the free shuttle bus and you're in the centre of town (about 20-25 mins). 
Gardens and pool area are beautiful - all have stunning views over the city. 
Highly recommend San Michele & can't wait to stay again.",5,2017,09,16
04,Outstanding view!,"This luxury hotel overlooks Florence, offering splendid views (and photo opportunities) from dawn to late night. They offer a shuttle service to the center of Florence, so visiting the city is easy and returning to the beautiful hotel and gardens (and pool) is a pleasure. While their dinner was expensive for the average quality, the site makes up for the food. And breakfast is divine. 
Their selection of clever contemporary art is really fun!",5,2017,09,13
04,A Memorable Evening,"Located on the top of a hill overlooking the city, this place was magnificent from start to finish.  I would suggest going earlier in the evening and having cocktails and appetizers in the outdoor area with the beautiful flowers and views.  The service there was perfect. 

After the sunset, we were escorted to the dining area and were fortunate enough to sit at an outdoor table overlooking the city.  The food was beautifully presented and delicious.  The service was remarkable.  There was nothing overlooked during our entire evening.  Perfection!!!",5,2017,09,10
04,Serenity and competence abound in the dining room,"First of all, it should be pointed out this is not for the faint hearted with their wallets. However it is an exquisite setting for a relaxing meal. Greeted upon arrival and escorted to dining terrace.  Warm and friendly servers in a well appointed room. Wine list a bit overwhelming both in selection and price points. With some judicious searching there are good wines to be found in the ‚Ç¨45-70 range. Food and presentation top notch. Overall a truly memorable experience.",5,2017,09,09
04,Stunning hotel in a beautiful location!,"We were lucky enough to spend three nights at this beautiful historic hotel, set high in the hills above Florence.  The view from the restaurant is simply stunning at any time of the day or evening, as you look down upon the city.  The staff are wonderful and the service could not be faulted.  Our dining experience in the evening was delightful, with excellent food and many good wines to choose from.  We had a deluxe room, which overlooked the gardens and was of a good size and well appointed.  The shuttle service runs every half an hour into Florence and gets you right to the heart of the city so its easy to find your way around.  Loved our time here and cannot wait to return.",5,2017,09,05
04,Wonderful lunch,"We had lunch on the Terrace and enjoyed everything about our meal, the view and the vibe. Would recommend to anyone traveling to Florence interested in a nice meal with a beautiful view! The service was top notch. We found this gem on our last day but would love to return and stay at the hotel. ",5,2017,09,04
04,Fabulous hotel,"The hotel occupies a prime position on the hillside looking down onto the city of Florence and offering spectacular panoramic views. The bedrooms are luxurious and the breakfasts are delicious, the pool and its facilities are superb. The free shuttle bus into Florence is a regular and excellent service, very well run. The staff are efficient, friendly, knowledgable and welcoming. Nothing is too much trouble for them to arrange. Looking forward to returning!",5,2017,08,31
04,Spectacularly Beautiful,"The most beautiful of hotel properties, the most outstanding service, the most friendly of staff...absolutely magical!
Stayed for 4 nights, could have stayed forever! The Superior Junior suite we had was sublime, with a lovely outside private garden overlooking Florence, the restaurant, La Loggia, was amazing, the views alone were incredible, the staff...we have never known such care and attention shown to us by them all!
The hotel arranged for a car to pick us up from Florence Airport, following a less than pleasant flight on 'CityJet', and whisked us away to the most beautiful of hotels! On arrival, you feel like you are arriving at someones private villa as a very privileged house guest. Be prepared to be 'wowed' on all fronts, the property and the views alone are breathtaking!
There was really nothing to complain about, everything was perfecto! All the staff were magnificent, but special tanks to Mario, the Duty Manager, such care and consideration, to Paolo at the front of house, such a lovely friendly, and warm guy, to Angelo one of the Maitre D's in the La Loggia restaurant, did all he could to make us feel welcome! Also, to the wonderful pianist that played so beautifully every evening, truly special.
All the wonderful reviews this property gets are fully deserved, this is inn keeping on a very special and grand scale/ level....magnifique!",5,2017,08,30
04,Exceptional Hotel and Phenomenal Service,"This was our second stay at Villa San Michele in 3 years.  My husband and I and our two children, ages 4 and 7, stayed here in early August for 4 nights.  Everything about the hotel is exquisite.  From the view, to the grounds, to the dining experience and the second to none service, San Michele is in a league of its own.  It merits mentioning that when we were slightly inconvenienced by having to change rooms due to a mechanical issue, the General Manager and his staff could not have handled the move better.  Indeed, their professional and immediate response spoke volumes about the class of this hotel.  Also, while we were in the minority with young children, the staff went out of their way to ensure that the kids were enjoying themselves.  They went so far as to deliver toys to our room!   In short, I enthusiastically recommend this hotel to those looking for the very best.  We look forward to planning our next visit to San Michele!",5,2017,08,28
04,Complete Perfection,"You could not fault this excellent establishment, outstanding service, wonderful views across the City and fabulous food. The week we spent there was thoroughly relaxing and close to perfection.

If there was one small criticism, our room was a little ""tired"" and might soon need some renovation.",5,2017,08,28
04,Heaven in the hills,"We stayed for 2 nights and wish we could have stayed for 20! The staff was gracious and kind, the rooms were impeccable (we had a room with a view and a balcony ) which was beautiful, the food was delicious and the grounds and pool were spectacular. 
From the moment we arrived into the beautiful hotel in the hills above Florence and drove up the winding path into its lush driveway we knew we were in for a treat. Its an old 16th century monastery with a rich history, in fact the reception is the entrance to the altar...and all the details are in keeping with its history. It has a very special atmosphere, with the amazing gardens that surround it and calm spots to read, and relax into the  view. The best part of all Belmond hotels, however, are the experiences they offer and San Michele did not disappoint. We booked a rafting tour of the River Arno which was a once in a lifetime experience to see the city from such a vantage point, me and my teenage son took a private cooking class with the head chef (delicious and amazing) and we had a little tour of all the young Florentine artists that the Belmond is supporting...in fact a lot of that art dots the grounds of the hotel...
All in all a unique experience made more special by all the wonderful details that they do so well.
We hope to return soon!",5,2017,08,23
04,Best of the best,"I traveled  all over the world and I can say that Villa San Michele is one of the best Hotel that I ever visited.....I really did not want to go and play tourist since  I was so comfortable from breakfast to dinner.....amazing view of wonderful Florence.
incredible service with extremely gentle employees.This is a must place to visit !!!
The 15th-century building and the fa√ßade attributed to Michelangelo will bring you into a perfect Reinassance atmosphere.
",5,2017,08,16
04,An Oasis of Calm and Beauty,"Villa San Michele is one of the great hotels of the world, with impeccable service, lovely rooms and suites, and a setting on the hillside overlooking Florence.  The grounds are spectacular- flower gardens, pool, winding paths, outdoor dining.   The villa has one of the most spectacular verandas anywhere- The Loggia restaurant and bar with great cocktails, and excellent food and wine.  We dined twice during our stay and agreed that we should have skipped the famous wine-centric restaurant in town as the food at VSM is better.  Our suite was full of charm and comfort, and the bath of porphyry marble a serious touch of luxury,  The staff is beyond reproach- friendly, helpful, always there to please.  The shuttle to town is comfortable, frequent, the only drawback being that the service ends at 8:00 pm, so taxis are in order for in town dining and frolicking.  We can't wait to return.",5,2017,08,14
04,Magical place! ,"We had a wonderful meal in this restaurant with extremely attentive service. Pricey but the food and views make it worth it. 
After lunch we went for a walk in the garden which offers the best views over Florence. My partner proposed in what is called Lover's Corner and it was the perfect setting. A magical day! ",5,2017,08,03
04,One of the best in the world. An absolute must for anyone visiting Florence,"This is one of the best hotels in the world. Watching the sunset then dining at their terrace restaurant was one of the most amazing travel experiences of my life. Ever. 

Ana and Luigi from their Food and Beverage department displayed 5 star service and professionalism and the food was the best we've ever eaten in Italy. We recommend this property and dining experience to any friends and family visiting Florence. Even if you don't stay at the wonderful hotel, make a point to dine with them 

Seriously, make the effort to visit while in Florence. It will be one of the best experiences of your trip. ",5,2017,08,02
04,Royal Treatment Under the Tuscan Sun,"The Villa San Michele transported us into a world of gracious living where you are  treated like royalty from the minute you arrive in Tuscany. Our driver,  Joseph immediately charmed us with Tuscan history with his perfect British English. 

As we entered the Villa, Paolo greeted us like family and made us feel like we are coming home to our private villa. Massimo at the front desk checked us in like a breeze. Mauricio, my secretary's correspondent handed us our week long itinerary and walked us through the logistics efficiently.

The Villa San Michele, a former monastery, maintains its old world charm with the amenities of a luxurious hotel. The view from the terrace is breathtaking. You can see the Duomo set in the rolling hills of Tuscany. 

I spent my birthday week there together with very dear friends. On the day of my birthday everyone greeted me and made my special day memorable. The hotel also got us a table at the Enoteca Pinchiorri, the only 3 star Michelin restaurant in Tuscany.

We have found our home in Tuscany at the San Michele and we cant wait to go back!",5,2017,07,30
04,Our wedding experience,"Perfection. I know is an absolute term and absolutes should not apply, but it's the closest adjective I can think of to refer to our wonderful experience at Villa San Michele.
We were serviced diligently and with refined care at every stage of our event: from the preliminary planning stages, throughout the beautiful setting and catering of the ceremony and dinner, to the friendly good-byes and good wishes for a prompt return. Which we will do as soon as time allows. A warm thank you to the incredible staff of Villa San Michele.",5,2017,07,26
04,The most beautiful hotel I've been to,I went here for Dinner and the views are spectacular. You over look the whole of Florence and the staff were outstanding. If you are not staying here then go for dinner for a special occasion - i would suggest booking,5,2017,07,26
04,Amazing location,"Fab hotel in the most amazing location. We only stayed one night but even in high season, they accommodated an early arrival and a late departure, and even gave us a complimentary upgrade on both rooms. The restaurant is fab with the most amazing views. The pool restaurant was also lovely. The whole place is an oasis of calm so close to Florence. The complimentary shuttle bus into Florence is a big plus. This hotel is not cheap but what do you expect for something so lovely this close to Florence. Slight word of warning - this is an old period property in the hillside - with no lift between levels - not for the elderly/infirm. Our kids were made very welcome and even received a welcome teddy bear & cookies - a nice touch. ",5,2017,07,25
04,Incredible Experience,"The Villa San Michele is over the top in every way. The view, the food, the accommodations but most importantly the staff. Exceptional service. Glass never empty. I read a few reviews before we arrived complaining about the prices. Yes it is expensive but that was known in advance so I don't understand that complaint. It is well worth it. ",5,2017,07,22
04,"Great views, highly over priced","This was by far the most expensive of all the hotels for our 14 day trip to Italy. Was certain it would be the pinnacle of our trip, but was not. The views are absolutely breathtaking but that's where it ends.  I'm accustomed to American service levels but this place leaves some to be desired.  

For starters, the entry to the hotel is always congested and a single lane   They allow cars to park along the side so it's always a hassle e teeing and exiting.  The room was just okay, AC would not cool the room down and even after a call to maintenance Irving was not resolved.  The restaurant is beautiful and the food is tasty, yet the portions are microscopic in size.   If you want room service, prepare to be gouged on prices.  I'm no thanks cheap by any stretch, but seriously???  $24 Euros for a SLICE of pizza??   That's gouging.   

The restaurant staff seems under staffed.  Water glass dry throughout dinner and poured our own wine from the bottle we bought because they never got around to us.  

I think they're so proud of the view that customers experience seems to come second.  Again, beautiful property but not worth the expense in my opinion.",3,2017,07,18
04,"Stunning views, great service, great accommodations ","Stayed here three years ago. It's cooler up here than in Florence especially on the summer. Awesome room, large, king, deluxe, semi private patio with view of Florence, unbelievable.  Great restaurant as well with stunning views of Florence. Beware of ancient stone stairs however. Treacherous. The ride into Florence and back can get inconvenient but that is price paid for luxury, view and cooler temperatures. ",5,2017,07,17
04,Beautiful Hotel. Excellent Service.,"This was a part of mother/daughter trip. Very restful location.
The service was great. Staff friendly. The view unmatched.  And we were able to shutttle back and forth to Florence if we wanted. Or just stay at the pool. ",5,2017,07,16
04,Stunning location,"We stayed 3 nights at the Villa San Michele as part of a 10 night holiday in Tuscany
The hotel is stunning, a former monastery that has been sympathetically restored with just the right mix of ancient and modern 
Modern paintings by a local artist set perfectly against old stone. The hotel was hosting an art exhibition during our stay and it was fascinating talking to the artist about his work.
We had a guided tour of the hotel before settling into our room. We had booked a deluxe room which was beautiful, again that mix of old and modern with a distant view of Florence across the roof tops, if you stood on tiptoe 
Great bathroom with a separate shower, lots of bulgari products and lovely robes
Everywhere there were beautiful purple orchids from a huge display in the reception to the restaurant, corridors and in our room, making a stunning contrast against the grey stone of the walls
The pool area is fantastic with great views over the city. The weather wasn't great when we were there but we did spend a morning by the pool. It has lots of trees down one side meaning lots of leaves in the water when windy but the pool staff were constantly removing them
A feature of the hotel is the restaurant with views over the city, amazing after dark. The one problem is that it is an open terrace. Lunch when we first arrived was great, sun was shining, prosecco chilled and super pasta
Dinner on our last night, not so good. It was cold and windy and although Perspex sheets had been installed and the blinds lowered it was very windy on the terrace, pashminas provided by the staff helped but the blinds kept blowing inward and in the end the staff just gave up trying to fix them
I was given the wrong main course and so my friend was left to eat hers and had finished before my correct food arrived some 15 minutes later. Not the kind of service you expect from a hotel of this calibre. We moved inside for dessert as we were constantly wresting with napkins blowing away and our hair 
That was the only criticism of this hotel. 
It is expensive, ‚Ç¨30 for a small plate of pasta and ‚Ç¨20 for a glass of prosecco makes for an expensive lunch but it was excellent pasta
The concierges were brilliant, helpful in sorting travel arrangements, taxis when the shuttle bus time wasn't as we had been told. Letting restaurants know when we were going to be late and just generally providing lots of helpful information
Would I go back again? Most definitely ",4,2017,07,15
04,Lunch,"Gorgeous terrace overlooking the beautiful city of Florence. Absolutely stunning views, and exquisite dining and wining. 
I absolutely recommend this hotel.  

Beautiful garden and also an historical site. ",5,2017,07,14
04,Great hotel on outskirts of Florence ,"We stayed at the Belmond for 3 nights and had a deluxe room.
On arrival we were warmly welcomed and the old monastery had some lovely touches of old and modern mixed in between. Unfortunately the weather was not great while there so we only spent a few hours at the pool. 
However there was a shuttle taking guests into the centre of Florence whereby we were dropped of and again collected.
As far as food concerned the breakfast was average and a bit chaotic. The lunch was good but overly expensive for what you got. The evening menu the same. Overall a nice hotel and very friendly staff.",4,2017,07,12
04,Great hotel also for lunch and the View!,"This charming hotel in Fiesole, Italy is one of the finest in the area. Even if you don't stay here; go for lunch and enjoy the grounds and the views of Florence in the distance. The food is excellent and the wait staff are wonderful.",5,2017,06,26
04,WOW!!!... This has to be the best,"We went here last night with 14 people divised over 2 tables. On the grass in the garden. AMAZING view, food, service everything you can think of.
I wish I could stay and eat here for one month straight.
Absolutely amazing.
5* Plus",5,2017,06,25
04,Bellisimo!!,"Beautiful hotel on the hills overlooking Florence with amazing gardens. Rooms are scattered around the gardens set into the hillside with their own terraces, plus there are some in the main hotel building if you like to be nearer as there a lot of steps in the gardens. Restaurant on the terrace with views over Florence at night is a must do, and a lot of people come in just for this so booking is important. Service was very good but there is a lack of staff in the restaurant and at the pool during the day!
Those that are there are attentive and knowledgeable but they can only do so much, management need to take note as for a 5 star hotel, good service is critical!",5,2017,06,22
04,A Super Mario welcome,"We arrived at Pisa airport and the driver arranged for the transfer to Villa San Michele was waiting. We had arranged with the hotel to call in at Pisa to view the leaning tower en route to the hotel - roughly an hours journey from airport to hotel so a short detour  is well worth it if you are not planning to visit Pisa at any other time.

Our driver phoned ahead to the concierge to confirm our arrival time at the hotel, he said the concierge was probably the best in Florence  and our experience during our stay would confirm that. We were welcomed by the duty manager, Mario, and a very friendly and helpful team. We have never had such a warm welcome anywhere - first impressions 10 out of 10! The location of the Vila San Michele is fantastic high up on the hillside overlooking Florence with beautiful terraced gardens whilst the building itself is full of history and is a real gem.

We had two rooms one was an upgrade to the Michelangelo suite - once used by Napoleon apparently and certainly still fit for royalty - amazing views both over the gardens and Florence, plenty of space, very well furnished and very comfortable bed  - could not be faulted.

We ordered sandwiches as a lets lunch and they took a long time to arrive and were nothing special - probably reflected the fact that the weakest aprt of our stay was the food, it was still very good but not outstanding like everything else.

In general the service was excellent, the staff were very efficient and friendly, Guinevere in reception was a star amongst stars with great service and always welcoming you as if you were a close family friend.

The pool terrace is located quite high up but you can have a driver take you there in a buggy or go through the second floor fire exit if the outside steps are too much for you. Again lovely views and an excellent dining area.

Although it was in the high 20s during the day there was often a breeze at night and in the wonderful romantic open air dining room we were glad of a jacket and wrap for the ladies as it did get a little chilly.

A regular courtesy bus runs from the hotel into Florence, much to far to walk, which was appreciated.

In summary a brilliant hotel, great staff and loacation with very good food",5,2017,06,12
04,Simply wonderful in every way,"What a wonderful experience! Whilst it is expensive it‚Äôs worth every penny! The view is simply breathtaking, steeped in history with modern twists mingling amongst ancient fresco‚Äôs. The staff are terrific, without a question the best service anywhere (including Asia!) Room, whilst smaller than hoped for (XV) was beautifully appointed and couldn‚Äôt really find fault although could have used a few more English language TV stations whilst trying to get through jet lag but only a minor gripe, and who pays to come somewhere like this to watch TV?  Pool area was lovely and super warm. Shuttle service to Florence is a great bonus too! Food was excellent, breakfast‚Äôs delicious and indulgent. Main restaurant stunning at night, very romantic. Would we go back? In a heartbeat!",5,2017,05,31
04,Absolutely Fantastic.,"We stayed recently for 3 nights and loved every moment. The setting in fabulous, a 13th century monastery at the top of a hill overlooking the magnificent city of Florence. We were greeted by the exceptional Mario and looked after superbly during our stay. Food, ambience, service, setting, every aspect has been thoroughly thought through and executed to perfection. Don't hesitate, stay here, its sublime.",5,2017,05,28
04,Wonderful hotel and setting,"Lovely setting in the hills above Florence, Belmond hotels are outstanding both in setting and service. The views over Florence are breathtaking. This hotel is an old monistory and the rooms are vey quite 
   Belmond staff are friendly and give an outstanding service, I would highly recommend them.",5,2017,05,25
04,Halfway to Heaven!,"At some point in the drive up to Belmond Villa San Michele it hits you are not on your way to a typical city center hotel. That feeling is reaffirmed as you wind your way up the hotel's narrow, winding driveway, rounding the final bend to first see the circa 1600 Michelangelo attributed facade of the former monastery. As you step out of your vehicle, you are surrounded by statues, manicured gardens and carefully groomed grounds along with the occasional ultra-luxury vehicle but what catches your eye is the magnificent view of Florence. It is there, the entire city, in all its glory, laid out in front of you. Still, the gardens, grounds and pool area are beautiful ... 

The interior of the hotel is nicely decorated, the business of the hotel winding its way through the ground floor rooms of the ancient building. The Villa San Michele was our second Belmond stop in our twelve day tour of Italy. Our first three days were spent in Belmond's flagship Venice property. The San Michele met any expectation built there and more. The manager's welcome, an upgrade to a corner suite in the main building and a wonderful bottle of prosecco in that suite, set the tone for our stay. Happily, that standard was maintained for the rest of our time there. The staff was ultra friendly and helpful throughout. The suite, perhaps the largest of our rooms in Italy, was wonderfully decorated, well maintained and immaculately clean. Outside the windows, that view of Florence greeted us whenever we cared to look. And if we tired of that, we could look out our side window to the gorgeous grounds. We did hear a little bit of the bar piano at night (the bar and piano were right below our room) but it wasn't bothersome. The morning breakfasts were plentiful with both cold and hot options included. Our only complaint was that the dining room was quite cool due of its openness and the time of year (mid April). We found the other food we had at the hotel, mostly bar fare, was well prepared. Plus, you had to appreciate a bar where merely ordering a drink entitled you to a small tray of finger-food. We did not eat at the main restaurant for dinner. From a cost perspective, Villa San Michele is an expensive hotel, as is expected of a hotel of its caliber. We booked our Belmond experiences using their Grand Tour of Italy offer, timing it before the high season pricing kicked in so that helped some. The bar charges were as expected in such a hotel.

If you want to walk out the door and be at Florence's tourist center, this is not the hotel to choose. However if you would prefer the peace of being away from the crowds, the beauty of the surroundings, and the knowledge you can be anywhere in Florence in relatively short order then please do. It is about a 20 minute drive to the major tourist area of Florence. The hotel provides a shuttle on an hourly schedule, but if you have an early, or late, booking or do not want to wait for the shuttle, you will need a taxi or car. Of course, the hotel will gladly help you with either. For what we did, we found the charm and beauty far out weighed any inconvenience. We loved our stay at Belmond Villa San Michele and would highly recommend it.",5,2017,05,23
04,Belmond excellence,"My partner and I have had the fortune and pleasure of staying at other Belmond Italian hotels, all of which have exceeded expectations. It was difficult to imagine that the Villa San Michele could surpass  its Belmond partners but the hotel and facilities were the finest we have encountered in Italy. A magical location with a panoramic view below of Florence, sets the tone for the experience. A refurbished monastery, the facade of which is attributed to Michaelangelo, nestles in the hillside encased in beautifully manicured terraced gardens, but what made the stay so memorable is this hotel is the complete package. The rooms and suites are stylish and comfortable, the food in the restaurant simple delicious and the entire staff professional but easy-going, warm and friendly. Highly recommended and cant wait to go back!",5,2017,05,19
04,Simply amazing,"My wife and I visited for two days in early May and we have found our new hotel in Florence. Such a unique place. This was a last minute addition to the beginning of a longer trip with some friends and we were incredibly glad to have made the decision to stay at the Villa San Michele. We subsequently spent 3 nights with our friends in another 5 star hotel in the city center of Florence (part of a larger chain of hotels) that was a disappointment by comparison because it lacked the character that distinguishes good hotels from great hotels. I would comfortably rank the Villa San Michele as a great hotel. The staff couldn't have been more accommodating - for a example fixing my breakfast early when I arrived 30 minutes before the restaurant even opened (jet lagged and awake). Very close to the city center with a regular
Hotel shuttle. One of the most relaxing places I have ever been.  The views over Florence are amazing. ",5,2017,05,17
04,World class setting. Romantic. The gardeners do such a beautiful job.,"Wow. The setting is SO VERY VERY VERY BEAUTIFUL. The main building is well kept and very special. It is a special occasion place for sure. Go when you can linger at the property some ---- not when you are just rush, rush, rush. Front desk and gentleman greeting at front door, just perfect. Breakfasts on the STUNNING outdoor terrace (the views) made you want to linger all day. Our Room #50 or L was super spacious with an outdoor green space with view. Linens were fine and crisp and bed so comfy. The bathroom was tremendous in size with shower and a separate tub. The lady who showed us to our room was flawless --- an upgrade for special occasion of our stay was greatly appreciated. Go here for special romantic occasion. Even gardeners and maids look clean, crisp, and work, work, work. Thought great that the hotel rotates their singers in the bar at night. They all play piano and sing. These guys were REALLY REALLY TALENTED (don't miss them), was a treat to listen. Enjoy  :)",5,2017,05,08
04,Hilltop Heaven,"On the second leg of our Belmond Italian 'Grand Tour' we stayed in this beautiful renaissance monastery-turned luxury 5 star hotel. Despite a few initial teething problems (which the hotel's manager dealt with quickly) we had an excellent stay. The suite we stayed in, 'Limonaia' had truly breathtaking views of Florence and the ambience, service and food in La Loggia, the hotel's arched terrace restaurant, was so memorable that we ended up eating there every night. We also felt the hotel had managed to retain much of the feel and charm of its monastic heritage whilst providing all the luxury of a five star hotel - quite a balancing act. Many thanks to the knowledgeable and professional staff who worked tirelessly to ensure we were looked after so well, special mention goes to Juliano who supplied us with delicious cocktails and local beer and really went that extra mile to make us feel at home.",5,2017,04,30
04,Beautiful easter,Beautiful Room overlooking the city of Florence. Beautiful heated swimming pool on the hills. Beautiful breakfast and service...the only negative small point on the dinner food....not as expected...but than again...if Your standards are very high.....,4,2017,04,27
04,A beautiful hotel with a warm welcome ,"This has to be one of our best hotel experiences ever. We knew the hotel was beautiful and historic from the pictures and reviews we had read. However it was the genuinely personable service we received that sets this hotel apart.

We especially mention the wonderful attention given to our son, which is not always the case at some upmarket hotels.
",5,2017,04,25
04,off the bucket list!,If you can afford this... please book there... this is above anything I have experienced. Living in a monastery that Michel Angelo designed in one of the best location in Florence is just beyond anything you can ask...,5,2017,04,22
04,"Dreamy views, fabulous breakfast and authentically Italian",We love this hotel. It is more of a retreat. The staff is lovely and they treat children with so much thoughtfulness. The turn down service is awesome and I could sit at breakfast for over an hour... the view... the tea... the food and friendly service are truly comforting. The shuttle service into Florence each hour makes a stay at St.Michele a perfect balance between city and countryside.,5,2017,04,18
04,Classically Elegant,"From the moment Paolo and his team greet you on arrival, you know your in for a wonderful stay and we weren't disappointed, nothing is too much trouble.
The room facilities are great, good size bathrooms, plenty of wardrobe space and comfortable bed with stunning views of Florence from your quaint private terrace.
The large garden is a lovely place relax, soak in the view and enjoy a drink before dinner. The food was excellent again the staff were attentive and friendly.",5,2017,04,17
04,Heaven on Earth,"Simply the best experience ever. It is a breathtakingly beautiful property from the architecture to the gardens through to the decor. The walls are covered in Jasmine and were in full bloom when we arrived - so we were met with a heavenly scent as all of our senses were filled with beauty. We stayed in one of the Garden Suites with a private terrace. The room is spacious and has a huge bathroom with an enormous closet area. The best part is the private terrace with views overlooking the gardens and Florence. The restaurant is top notch with indoor and outdoor dining - both with spectacular views. The food and service were both exceptional. The staff was polite, engaging and helpful - a perfect compliment to this amazing resort. I highly recommend Villa San Michele to anyone planning a trip to the Tuscany area.",5,2017,02,18
04,An Unforgettable Retreat in the Tuscan Hills,"We are faithful fans of the Belmond brand and had to experience the Villa San Michele for ourselves after reading so much on it. Having stayed in the city center of Florence in the past, we realized how much were missing staying in Fiesole instead. The Villa San Michele offers its guests a resort feel with fantastic Views of Florence day or night. 

Our junior suite was appointed in the typical  Belmond style, something we absolutely love, and offered an incredible bathroom spa experience: Deep tub, huge marble shower with incredible water pressure, decadent bath amenities... One could easily enough enjoy Florence from a distance and not feel the need to venture into town! The breakfast was one of my favorites to date, rivaled only by sister Belmond property Cipriani Venice. I couldn't tell you which was better! Service, as always, was 5 star Belmond-- truly wish I remembered the names all the wonderful staff, from housekeeping to servers to concierge-- thank you again for the wonderful work!!!!!!!

If you do feel ever so compelled to leave this beautiful haven to venture into town, The city center is readily accessible by the complimentary shuttle offered by the Hotel. Having an early morning appointment at the Uffizi Gallery only to finish the day lounging poolside while enjoying million dollar panoramas... now that is TRULY La Dolce Vita!

Thank you Villa San Michele,
Can't wait to see you again soon. ",5,2017,01,19
04,Villa San Michele restaurant is a treat to give yourself when in Florence,"This beautiful old hotel sits overlooking Florence. If your budget allows STAY HERE! If not, at least treat yourself to a sunset dinner like we did. A perfect meal on the balcony watching to sun set on Florence and the lights come up over this beautiful romantic city make for a magical evening. The food and the service are pretty magical too. We sat next to a famous English actor and his wife adding even more excitement to a lovely evening.",5,2017,01,08
04,The best place in town or... Almost in town :-)),"It's a bit difficult to write a comment about ""La Villa San Michele""...
To be totally honest, this isn't the most luxurious property in the world and a few things might be improved especially because this is an old hotel - And I'm not only talking about the rooms in the older part of the building :-)
But this place is just unique because of its location, its staff and, the most important thing, the view over the city !!!
Nothing better than a meal at the restaurant overlooking the city :-)",5,2016,12,25
04,Magnificent views of Florence,"This is THE place to stay if your budget allows.  The ancient building is so well designed architecturally and the rooms with views magnificent.  It is well worth the price.  The dining area was so wonderful and convenient, there's no place else I would consider to dine.  The food is excellent as well.",5,2016,11,12
04,Worth every penny!,"Let me start by saying that this hotel is pricey so it may not be for everyone.  However, if you are fortunate enough to stay here, you will be in for a first class experience in every way.  I have stayed at some of the finest hotels in the world and sometimes the staff can be pretty stuffy, especially when you show up with a 7 ad 9 year old.  They made our whole family feel so welcomed from the moment we stepped out of our taxi.  The view from the hotel is unparalleled and can only be described as spectacular. The breakfast every morning while looking down over Florence was something we won't soon forget.  We will be back here soon!",5,2016,11,04
04,Fantastic hotel but pricey!!,Spent four nights at this fabulous hotel recently. We had a junior suite in the garden which was beautiful but slightly old fashioned. The bathroom was luxurious and really well  appointed. Staff are charming especially the bar staff who made wonderful cocktails.We ate one night in the restaurant and the food was superb.The breakfast served in our garden one morning was magical after a swim in the heated pool. The downside was the price of drinks and food. Two gin and tonics one evening cost over 70 euros and the restaurant food was also very expensive. We ended up going in to Florence to eat when we really would have rather ate in the hotel. We left at 7am in the morning and checked out the night before.We weren't offered breakfast or help with our bags which wasn't good enough for a 5 star hotel. Overall we loved the place and enjoyed our stay but save up before you go!!,5,2016,11,03
04,The most Romantic Hotel ,"I wanted to take my new husband to Italy so I knew it would have to be to Villa San Michele right outside of Florence.. 
it is better than staying in Florence because you are away from the streets and yet your view are the city from above on the hillside.. 
the suites are wonderful.. 
the restaurant is one of the best in all of Florence.. and such a romantic spot to be.. magic! ",5,2016,11,02
04,"Beautiful Florence, Fantastic Hotel","Villa San Michele has stunning views across Florence, amazing staff who ensure your stay is very special, great food and fabulous rooms. I can't recommend highly enough. 
The bedrooms within the gardens are spacious with excellent facilities.",5,2016,11,01
04,Perfect but Pricey,"Wonderful location [out of Florence, but not too far] in a wonderful building. Its five star in every scence - rooms, food, service, ect., are all perfect - but the bill was still mor than I expected! If you have the money you should try it!",5,2016,11,01
04,Stunning hotel overlooking Florence !,"We have stayed at the St Michele for the last 2 years. This hotel offers outstanding views of Florence and is very unique as it is 15 minutes away from the bustling city of Florence  which is bursting with  life but the hotel offers a fantastic heated swimming pool, excellent gardens and a superb restaurant which is difficult to beat in the local area. The service is outstanding and we were offered an upgraded room in the gardens which is highly recommended. The breakfast offered is outstanding and the shuttle bus to the centre of Florence is punctual and takes 15 minutes. If you need a retreat in Tuscany the St Michele is the place to stay. My  disappointments at this hotel are that the fitness centre is small and not well equipped and they still allow smoking in the restaurant as it is a covered in balcony which is partly open. They have stopped the use of mobile phones in the restaurant which is a positive thing. We will definitely return to this hotel  in the Summer months.",5,2016,10,27
04,Sublime,"This hotel has provided the most wonderful hotel experience ever.
The hotel, surrounding, furnishings take you back in time,  But it is so very modern in offerings of food, rooms, amenities.  The service and food were the best we've ever experienced.",5,2016,10,27
04,The best view of Florence one can have,"Only 15 minutes drive from the heart of Florence this ex monastery has been transformed into a luxury hotel so you could enjoy both worlds: Best view overlooking the beautiful city of Florence, extremely peaceful and calm, and at the same time offers you the best food and pampering service. Perfect for honeymooners or any other romantic couples. A piece of heaven!",5,2016,10,18
04,Pure luxury and the best service in the world,"A fabulous hotel, converted from an old monastery and hidden away in the hills of Fiesole, overlooking Florence. This gorgeous place has immediately entered my list of places to return to, as one night was definitely not enough.",5,2016,10,17
04,A perfect experience from beginning to end!,"This place has everything you would expect at a luxury hotel and more!  The staff is incredibly attentive, friendly, and eager to make your stay wonderful and memorable.  The hotel is perched on a hillside with stunning views of Florence from the courtyard and restaurant.  While only a short trip from downtown Florence, it feels like a world away.",5,2016,10,13
04,"""A memorable experience ""","The attention to detail and impeccable service from the friendly staff at the Villa San Michele was the beginning of a memorable evening.    Panoramic views of Florence below with the surrounding mountains was a beautiful backdrop while sipping on a refreshing aperitivo followed by a delicious dinner and dessert.  At times it was difficult to look at my friends and not the spectacular views.  Historically important, the luxurious setting, including the architecture, interiors and hillside landscaping, gently speak of a time past. It's a life experience to remember.",5,2016,10,09
04,Gorgeous! Bellissimo!,"Every detail is being absolutely thought of, from the gardens, the drinks, the succulent menu, the fabulous service, the aperitifs environment, the lush rooms, the exquisite views of Florence, is an experience for every one of your senses. 
We celebrate my fianc√© birthday week there, and was a fabulous life experience for the both of us, best birthday gift I could ever give him. 
Love love love",5,2016,10,04
04,A night to remember!,"My first trip to Florence and I get to experience dinner at Villa San Michele.  WOW!   The view of the city of Florence from a terraced mount is amazing.  And with the best of company, it was truly a night to remember.  The attention to detail during our visit and dinner was impeccable.  Everything about this place screams Italian excellence.  Our meal was extraordinary.  Best ravioli i'll ever eat in my life.  I hope to return one day and enjoy it all over again.",5,2016,09,28
04,*The best hotel experience of my life*,"There really are not enough words to describe how absolutely spectacular this property is.  Every single minute of our stay was perfect, from the moment we arrived.

Both my husband and I lived in Florence.  In fact, this is where we met 3 years ago.  We always knew we would return to Florence for our honeymoon, but never expected we could be so lucky to experience the Villa San Michele.  Belmond is synonymous with impeccable service and the absolute highest level of luxury, in all of their properties, but Villa San Michele blew us away.

Upon arrival, the lovely reception staff were all smiles as they greeted us.  As we were shown to our Garden Suite, it was mesmerizing walking through the grounds.  The perfectly manicured gardens surround you and the view of Florence below is breathtaking.  Our suite was decorated in a classic style with a separate living room and bedroom.  We were the last Garden Suite which allowed us complete privacy with a canopy of greenery over our private terrace.  Our bathroom was absolutely stunning as well, with a mahogany wardrobe and his and hers vanities with Bvlgari products.  The marble bathtub and separate shower cabin were luxurious and we loved the soft slippers (which were necessary as marble can get very slippery).  The turn down service was lovely and the concierge always called to double check what time we would be back at the room to ensure the turn down was done while we were out.  Complimentary water was lovely as some of the other 5-star resorts did not offer this during turn down.  A very pleasant surprise was having a made-to-order breakfast served in our room.  Room service was so professional, almost old-worldly.  

Before visiting Villa San Michele, many had told us about the fa√ßade of the loggia attributed to Michelangelo.  Being here in person is almost like taking a step back in time.  The arches are so grand, it is the perfect backdrop during breakfast or an aperitivo.  

Breakfast in the loggia was wonderful, with both hot and cold offerings as well as prosecco and freshly squeezed fruit juices (both grapefruit and orange).  During our stay, we did also have an aperitivo in the Loggia one evening.  My cocktail was like a work of art! The best reason to have an aperitivo in the Loggia (besides the view) is that every evening beginning at 6PM, a local musician plays music for the guests.  

Although the weather was not ideal, I did have a chance to spend a few hours by the pool the first evening.  As soon as I put down my things and went for a dip, the pool attendant was immediately setting up my chair with towels, and a lovely rounded pillow covered in terry cloth.  Great touch!  Even though I was at the pool after the pool bar had closed, the staff were still very accommodating when I asked if I could order a glass of prosecco.  

We definitely took advantage of the shuttle that went to and from Florence center.  The drivers were also very friendly and accommodating when my husband asked if we could be dropped off en route near the Duomo, since the shuttle mainly goes to Piazza della Repubblica.  We did take taxis back at night, but even with the night surcharge it was only about 25 Euro.

Everyday spent at the Belmond Villa San Michele, I had to pinch myself to make sure I wasn't dreaming.  Thank you to all of the wonderful staff for truly making our stay one to remember.  There could be no better way I could have imagined returning to the city we fell in love than by staying at the beautiful Villa San Michele.  

Grazie mille!",5,2016,09,23
04,Simply stunning property,"What a magnificent hotel.... It is simply beautiful.  Our garden suite was amazing.  One of the highlights was having breakfast in out very own garden overlooking Florence.   The food and wine were good (very overpriced though) and the service was pretty good.  The laundry service was excellent but incredibly overpriced.  Communication within the staff was a bit of a  problem. For example,  The concierge suggested we have lunch by the pool but when we got there it was closed.  They were very helpful with calling taxis and the shuttle service to town was great.",5,2016,09,21
04,Beautiful,Beautiful hotel. Great views. Lovely restaurant (reserve a table on the perimeter with stunning views down across Florence). Stunning suite in the garden. Lunch adjacent the upper pool. Courtesy shuttle to and from central Florence.,5,2016,09,21
04,Magical,"I am not sure that there is a more magical place to stay than a Belmond hotel in Italy. Villa San Michele is true five star. The location, the rooms, the food, the service and the views - it has everything. Total luxury and complete relaxation in a beautiful and peaceful setting. Hope to return soon.",5,2016,09,19
04,Beautiful Hotel.,"We stayed here just over a week ago. Arrived and were upgraded to a lovely garden suite. Just delightful as it was our 30th Wedding Anniversary.The Suite was perfect. 
The Hotel and gardens are an oasis of peace and calm.
Lovely pool and views. Small but good gym.
Delicious food.
Charming and courteous staff.
We will definitely be returning.",5,2016,09,18
04,Nice visit with a great view,"We have visited Florence many times and normally stay in town.  We decided to try something different and more quiet. We had been to Villa San Michele for dinner on several occasions and this time decided to stay here. As usual for a Belmond property, the staff and service are amazing. We had an amazing suite, known as the Michelangelo suite.  Lots of history at this property and the views overlooking Florence are picturesque. Staying here provides the best of both worlds.    ",5,2016,09,16
04,"A slice of Heaven, with hellish prices!!","This is truly a slice of heaven. The setting and surroundings are exquisite, the service impeccable, but the prices are also out of this world.
My friends brought me here for an aperitif before we went into Florence for dinner. I truly did enjoy the experience, The foyer is to be found in the old church, the staff made us welcome, and we thoroughly enjoyed our drinks. My usual drink costs ‚Ç¨7 in the average bar/hotel, but in San Michele the same drink is ‚Ç¨20 (they do serve nuts, crisps and devine olives. Magical but very pricey.",5,2016,09,13
04,As the Eagles See It.....We added lunch!,"There, perched high on a hill overlooking Florence, sits the Villa San Michele.  To say it is beautiful is not enough; to say it is something out of this world begins to paint the picture of this truly spectacular place.  Although we did not have the pleasure of staying at this historic hotel, we recently took a trip there to dine at the hotel's Ristorante San Michele.  

We arrived and were invited to enjoy an aperitif in the garden before our meal.  We sat in the sunshine under an umbrella, sipped spritzes and wine, admired the lush, tailored gardens and took in the tropical air before following our waiter to a table on the expansive loggia.

The view, which encompasses all of Florence, is mesmerizing.  The Duomo and the soccer stadium are easy to spot among the many terra cotta roofs; Italian cedars dot the landscape and the occasional bird swoops across the sky.  As splendid as that is, there is the added ambiance of viewing it while enjoying a great meal.

We were several people so there were lots of things on the table at any given time; carpaccio, burrata, Caterina de' Medici salad - all were beautifully presented and tasty.  Then it was on to pasta, risotto and seafood, really delicious.  Desserts were ordered and passed so each of us could savor their sweetness.  

While this restaurant (and hotel) are not for the budget conscious, it is a place where something special can be beautifully celebrated; for us, it was being with our family and friends.",5,2016,09,08
04,Uniquely Italian Experience,"The Belmond Villa San Michele is located on the hillside just outside of Florence, with an incredible (really breathtaking view) of Florence and surrounding fields. We stayed for 3 nights with our children in connecting suites this past August. 

The hotel is a converted monastery, featuring a loggia where meals are served all day, and dinner each night (really quite expensive, but also with that breathtaking view and old-world service) was the centerpiece of our stay. The decor, service, and guests were refreshingly non-American, and while we enjoyed the glimpse into European luxury/culture, we also had to reframe our expectations of a luxury experience. For example, the pool was very cold and poolside service was haphazard. In fact, all of the service was hit-or-miss (as my husband said, it is a bit like being served by the mafia, you don't want to anger your waiter!)  The rooms felt a bit dated with strange little TVs that rose out of cabinets with remote controls, and peel-off stickers stuck onto the walls to indicate hot/cold. Again, not deal-breakers, but also not 5* luxury, though we paid 5* luxury prices.

The pros: The view, the friendly and kind manager, the Kids club (a highlight and a huge plus as most other resorts did not offer this service), and of course---that view!!!",4,2016,09,07
04,Wonderful,"VSM is simply a magical hotel. Our family of 4 has just spent 4 days there, returning after spending 7 days there 2 years ago. It is the best-located and most beautifully maintained hotel of all. The gardens, the pool area, and the common parts inside the hotel (including the wonderful loggia where meals are served) could not be bettered. The rooms (we had two junior suites) are very good, with excellent bathrooms. The staff are utterly delightful: nothing is too much for them. All in all, this hotel is virtually impossible to beat. We will be back for a week next year.",5,2016,08,29
04,Superb!,"We celebrated two birthdays here within a week. Both times we had lunch. The building is beautiful and the view of Florence stunning. The restaurant is light and airy, a terrazzo open to the spectacular view through huge arched 'windows'. Every table has the view and even in very hot weather there is a lovely breeze and huge cream sails of blinds to shade the table without blocking the view. The service is impeccable yet friendly and the menu and dishes are excellent. Sadly on both visits the restaurant was practically empty which was sad as it deserves to be full. The prices are top end but worth it.  ",5,2016,08,27
04,Amazing tranquility and beauty cannot be equalled,"Sometimes to fully appreciate a city it makes good sense to stay on the peripheral  from where you get an appreciative overview of the centre. Its the most astounding real- estate in fine hotels in Tuscany.   It may require the combining of 3 credit cards to access this sumptuous villa, gardens and lovely parks.  Go through with it, you are worth it.  The sweeping views are memories forever, especially the Cypress-scattered hills looking over Florence.
Sleep is like no other ensconced in an amazing range of spaces and experiences.  Trust me you wont be taking- out around here",5,2016,08,24
04,The Hotel of my Dreams! ,"I never thought such a perfect hotel would exist. In all my travels around the world, this place is #1 for me! I still can't believe I was there a few days ago. Everything was like a dream. I love how they made each day so magical with all the surprises they prepared for us. My room was divine. Their food was spectacular and the sceneries will make you fall in love with life, over and over. No wonder they are #1. 

I look forward in visiting more of their properties soon. It would be an absolute pleasure! ",5,2016,08,16
04,"Bad start, great finish","Wishing to celebrate in style a landmark birthday and wedding anniversary we were recommended to stay at this famous hotel whilst combining an Andrea Bocelli concert.  This was a surprise for my husband months in the saving and planning.   Our greeting at the hotel was excellent but my heart sank when I saw what was considered to be a Deluxe room.  My mother, who had accompanied us, was also very disappointed with her Deluxe room.  (Rooms 5 & 6).  I couldn't bring myself to unpack more than a couple of things as the only hanging space was a open alcove with a rail opposite the toilet.  There were only two drawers underneath.  There was no bath and only one sink.   This room had a definite feel of a monk's cell with a small window and was quite depressing.  We went downstairs for a pre-dinner drink but were ignored by the dining staff.  That was the last straw and I went in search of the manager Adriano.  I explained that our expectations had been dashed, that I had never had to hang my clothes across from a toilet and burst into tears.  At this point Adriano said they only have tears of joy at the Villa St Michele and he would try and put things right.  And oh boy did he.  Mum was found another Deluxe room (room 2) which was as different as chalk and cheese from her original room - much larger, more windows, separate dressing area etc etc.  We were upgraded to the most beautiful garden suite and although we offered to pay, our offer was turned aside and whilst we were having a superb dinner at the restaurant our personal belongings were transferred and unpacked in our new rooms.  The next five days here were an absolute joy.  The staff cannot do enough for you and whilst I cannot praise them all highly enough, Adriano (Manager) and Paolo (front desk) were exceptional.  We have booked again to come back next May when the weather may be a little less hot than the 100F we had every day!  If I can give any advice it would be to book nothing less than a junior or garden suite if you are staying for more than a night or two. The extra expense really is worth it.   Other highlights were the pool area where towels were laid out for you on your arrival, umbrellas opened and you were given aerosols of iced water to keep you cool, listening to the fabulous bar pianist in the evening whilst enjoying a cocktail and the wonderful food, not only in the restaurant in the evening but by the pool for s light lunch.  Take time to admire the architecture of the building and the frescos adorning the walls.
Thank you Villa St Michele and your amazing staff for - eventually - making a dream come true.",5,2016,08,15
04,Above & Beyond...,"And no, I'm not speaking only in terms of the city view below. The team at Villa San Michele truly delivered a night to remember. I visited with a group of 7 on holiday from the U.S. I emailed months in advance, and secured a sunset spot at the Poolside Bar. Even though the venue closes after lunchtime, they staffed a chef and server accordingly to accomodate. Given the pool sits above the main grounds, we sat perched high above the city with exceptional service and the best view in town. We started with pizza, then pastas and finally the Florentine steak (we ordered 2). Admittedly, we could have passed on the gnocchi, but the ravioli was lovely. We then moved down to the gardens for a night cap before. Grazie, grazie, grazie to the entire staff involved. A quality night, and money well spent.",5,2016,08,14
04,FABULOUS,"Just a fabulous location overlooking Florence. The staff are world class. Friendly, helpful, polite and totally professional. Cuisine is excellent along with the balcony/verandah restaurant with stunning views.
The staff really make the difference at this hotel. My son and I were treated as though we were the only clients in the hotel...home from home with Italian chic, politeness and customer service professionalism with a smile...well done the team AND THANK YOU.",5,2016,08,13
04,"Fantastic place, beautiful with real personality ","Lovely, very charismatic hotel, superfriendly and helpful staff, great restaurant (with a VIEW) , beautiful garden 
The weather wasn't that good when we were there, so didn't get a chance to hang out by the pool but it looked very nice 
Would definitely go back. 
We traveled with an infant (5 months) which worked very well, (they arranged for baby sitter for us in the evenings so we could enjoy dinner on the terrace with baby sleeping upstairs) but otherwise it's not really a place where you'd go with small kids rather it's for that mini break away from them ;)",5,2016,08,09
04,Brilliant location great views but a little expensive. ,"This was my second visit and it was well worth it as I brought 5 people for the first time. It's around 20 minutes by taxi from the middle of Florence. But well worth it. The old Monastery has the best views of Florence. Beautiful gardens and incredible historic interiors. Night or day well worth it. The reservation by e-mail was responded to quickly and warm. The food quality and presentation was of a very high standard. Incredible porcelain and setting, the views of the garden and Florence while you eat cannot be forgotten as its so hedonistic. It's has a hotel connected and one day when we go back we will book the hotel which has its own private entrance.",5,2016,08,08
04,Exquisitely wonderful!,"Villa San Michele was a dream stay. From the moment you arrive, you know this will be a first class experience. The hotel itself is a monastery that has been beautifully kept and renovated. The views of Florence from San Michele are breathtaking and you can easily loose yourself while admiring the views from the pool. 
The service in San Michele is perfectly attentive, your wish is their command. I highly recommend dining one night during your stay at the hotel restauraunt as the views are as spectacular as their food.
Dinner is accompanied by lovely love piano music which gives the ambience an extra ""oomph"". After dinner, pass on to the garden for a night cap and enjoy the starry night.
Of course, this premiere experience, comes along with a hefty price tag, but if you wish to celebrate a special occasion, I believe it is definetly worth it.",5,2016,07,23
04,Romantic setting on the hill.,"The beautiful building, it's hillside location and the attentive staff make San Michelle a delight to stay at.

Housekeeping keep the rooms spotless, beautiful linen bedding, immaculate gardens and the shuttle to and from Florence centre essential. If you get a quick run its about 20 minutes.

Breakfast and dinner are served on the arched terrace over looking the city- stunning views. The down side everyone is allowed to smoke, the only escape being eating indoors and losing the views.

At the pool there was no issue getting a bed or towels and the children were mostly under control of kids club or parents.

Lastly concierge can sort anything, private tours, Michelin star restaurants.... Etc they were faultless. 

Loved the experience but would stay in town if you have less than 3 nights as the location feels a bit remote- ‚Ç¨32 in a taxi
",4,2016,07,21
04,A Superb Hotel with Impeccable Service,"We spent a truly enjoyable week at the property in June 2016.  It excels at everything it does. The service was excellent with nothing too much trouble.  The property is stunning, beautifully maintained with breath-taking views and the food.....  something else!  They even laid on a Vespa for us to use!",5,2016,07,11
04,Beautiful hotel,"Fantastic hotel, with the most amazing view of Florence . We had an entry level room which was very spacious and well designed. Issues to be aware of is you are out of town and have to get complementary bus down. Out of season this is only every hour and taxis can get expensive. However it is better to have a sanctuary to come back to out of the hustle and bustle of Florence in our opinion. ",5,2016,07,11
04,Execellent View and amazing rooms &Villas,"Perfect relaxing location when visiting Florence. 
Shuttle Service to the City
Friendly Staff
Amazing rooms, spacious, clean and with great views of the city of Florence.
Lovely Gardens for amazing pictures!",5,2016,07,08
04,Massimo and Paolo made it better,"Staying up on the hills demands some extra planning effort to make sure you'll enjoy Florence at night. On the other hand, the view and the slightly cooler temperature are amazing.
But what really made the difference for me was having Massimo and Paolo helping us with everything, from pre-paid reservations to the museums to great tips and arrangements for the next 4 days we spent in Tuscany. They really made the difference!",4,2016,06,23
04,Beautiful hillside property,We dined here for our anniversary dinner - but walked the property before and after dinner. Perched on a hilltop in Fiesole this property is absolutely gorgeous with amazing views of the City of Florence. The gardens were well kept and rooms all had great views of either the gardens or the City.,5,2016,06,21
04,Outstanding!,"While staying at nearby hotel someone mentioned this hotel just a short walk up. Glad I went to see this top of the line spot. It was originally a monastery, founded in 15 th. century, with facade by Michaelangelo.  It is perfectly set in the hill, with fantastic landscaping and statues set around and about. We were kindly allowed to tour the property, with a lovely dining area, where you could possibly stop for a drink and overlook Florence.  It has been restored to this wonderful present condition. It's just so appealing that if you want to splurge, this is the place!  Wish we could have!",5,2016,06,17
04,Fantastic,This hotel is an oasis of calm beauty hidden away on a hill away from the bustle of Florence. I spent six nights here with my daughter who is recovering from a life threatening illness - where better to recuperate than here. We were lucky to be upgraded to a beautiful suite complete with garden and a Nesspresso machine - George Clooney unfortunately was missing! The food was delicious and beautifully presented. All the staff were extremely pleasant and helpful -nothing was too much trouble for them please pass on my thanks for helping to make our holiday so memorable. Our six days went much too quickly but we will be returning.,5,2016,06,12
04,Beautiful place,"I found this place whilst looking for places to propose in Florence. Once I saw it, I knew this was the place. A quick phone call to the courteous & helpful staff & lunch was booked. It is difficult to put into words the sights that this hotel has to behold, a panoramic view across the whole of Florence and onto the beautiful Tuscan mountains. The staff had helpfully reserved a superb spot in Lovers Corner for us. After drinks, I got down on bended knee and she said yes. Afterwards we had a wonderful lunch, although on the pricey side, it was totally worth it. 

A superb place, if not just for lunch. I will definitely return for a longer stay.",5,2016,06,05
04,Wonderful,"Villa San Michele is absolutely gorgeous! The grounds are amazing, the pool lovely and the outside sitting/cocktail area comfortable and beautiful. The views were beautiful in all directions!

We arrived early for lunch and decided to investigate the beautiful resort. We just loved everything about it! 

We were seated for lunch in a gorgeous veranda in front of an open window with beautiful views. 

Our servers could not do enough for us. The wine and food were amazing. Everything was just perfect!

We absolutely loved Villa San Michele and hope to come back to stay very soon! ",5,2016,06,01
04,Beyond Satisfied at San Michele,"Above and beyond service, wonderful old-world ambiance and views of Venice. Loved being out of the hustle down below in Florence. Exquisitely relaxing grounds. Be sure to opt for their cooking school and relax by the pool.",5,2016,06,01
04,"Great service, unbelievable views","We last visited VSM in 2003 shortly before the birth of our first child.  This time, we brought her and a friend as well as her little sister for a very short stay.  

Hotel was just as we remembered, fantastic service, amazing views from the loggia as well as the gardens outside of our adjacent rooms.  Kids loved the warm pool and we had a relaxing time watching them notwithstanding some of the other guests' sharing their unpleasant music collection with us at high volume.    

Only negative was that we were directly over a wedding on Monday night and when my wife and I returned from dinner/drinks at midnight, the babysitter explained that the music made it impossible for the children to sleep (they were enjoying themselves and dancing when we returned).  Had the hotel given us a heads-up that there would be a lot of noise until midnight, we would have brought the kids out with us that evening.",5,2016,05,31
04,The Most Beautiful Views of Florence,"After spending four magical days at the Belmond Caruso in Ravello we left for the Belmond Villa San Michelle in Fiesole! Positioned in a converted monastery in the hills above Florence, it is impossible to describe how beautiful the property and the surrounding hills are without seeing it yourself! We were upgraded to a junior suite with a large terrace and a bathroom and dressing area that was huge! Everyone was super nice and Paulo especially made us really feel welcome when we left or returned to the hotel from a day of sightseeing. The only small disappointment was the food. Having been to the Hotel Caruso in Ravello where the food was magical, I did not feel the quality was appropriate for the level of expense. Service was superb with Danielo and Angelo taking care of us, but I feel the food presentation and cooking was not up to speed with the prices charged. However, the overall experience at Villa San Michelle was fantastic and I would recommend it to anyone wanting a quieter and more peaceful Florentine adventure.  ",5,2016,05,22
04,"Fantastic location, stunning views, exceptional service, great garden, nice pool, average food and a ""mini""-gym at a ...","... price you should afford at least once in your life.

The hotel is one of the icons of Florence. Located high above the city (the free shuttle bus brings you in 20min to the center of the crowds and whisks you back to tranquility) the place triggers a never ending series of ""wow""s...
We ended up in a junior suite: huge bedroom, large sitting room next to it, huge bathroom with walk-in-shower, tub and two wash-basins. View over the garden on one side, towards the city (including the Dome) on the other).
Drinks and meals on the terrace: stunning views, great service, nice music. A bit cold and windy despite the gas-heaters on the ceiling and the ""curtains"" trying to block the space above the rails.
Relaxing at the (heated) outdoor pool (stunning views again...).
The staff tries to pamper you all around and any question/wish is answered with ""yes"" (e.g. Q: What happens if the shuttle bus is full? A:We will order a taxi and pay for it.)!
We truly enjoyed breakfast ( a huge selection of fruits, cereals, cold cuts, breads, cakes and a full a-la-carte-menu of egg-dishes, mini-steaks, etc.) but were less enamored by dinner (the Hamburger from the bar menu looked and tasted ""pre-fab"", the dinner at the restaurant was OK, but not ""wow"".)
The gym is rather basic, but runnign down the hill and up again will give you a great work-out. So go and splurge and avoid looking at the prices....",5,2016,05,02
04,"Didnt stay at hotel, but had drinks in courtyard","We stayed in Florence on our trip but I wanted to state how perfect the staff was at the hotel for our pre-dinner experience.  We booked the Lover's Corner in the courtyard garden before dinner in advance.  It was perfect.  I arranged for flowers and Asti and the staff treated us like royalty.  The view and ambience was incredible.  For dinner, we went inside to La Loggia and the dinner was exceptional....along with more great views.  The staff was friendly and food tasty.  The hotel does have a shuttle to/from the city center as this hotel/restaurant is in Fiesole.  We used a cab both ways, no issues with that either.  It was well worth the 20m cab ride to this restaurant.  I would stay at this hotel in the future.  It looked spectacular.",5,2016,04,23
04,Food at Belmond Villa San Michele,"We spent over 200 EU on Florentine steak that was tough.  We knew it would be served rare and that wasn't the reason we were disappointed.  The meat was too tough to eat.  Plus, although I only took one bit, leaving a large steak on my plate, the waiter never asked if I was dissatisfied or wanted anything else to eat.  This resort has a beautiful view and grounds, but our experience of the food was very disappointing.",2,2016,02,18
04,"Beautiful hotel, breathtaking views & stellar service...","I stayed here for a couple of days last June and I have to say it is by far the best and most beautiful hotel I have stayed in so far.

The service was superb, food was fantastic, cracking cocktails and a great wine list.

The views are absolutely stunning - sitting in the restaurant overlooking Florence and Tuscany was a delight. The pool and grounds in general are also lovely although can't expect much less from a 16th-century monastery partly designed by Michelangelo...

The absolute only downside was that our room didn't really have a window - just a tiny one right at the top of close to the ceiling so had to stand on a chair to look out!

But all in all, I had an incredible time and long to go back!",5,2016,02,11
04,Beautiful dinner at the Villa San Michele,"We had a lovely dinner at the Villa San Michele in Fiesole just outside Florence. We had drinks at one end of a large loggia with a pianist playing before we were seated for dinner at the other end of the lovely loggia overlooking the city of Florence. The fa√ßade of the VSM was painted by Michelangelo when the building was a monastery. Service was perfect, food outstanding, lovely wine list...just an absolutely perfect evening dining looking at the lights along the Arno below. It is an absolute treat!",5,2016,01,24
04,"Food was not good, service was great!","We came here searching for a beautiful location for our wedding.  The view is fantastic and the service is fairly good! There were some restrictions, but we weren't worried about them... we set out to test the venue foremost by testing the food.

We had a late lunch... the food was worse than some tourist traps in Florence.  Pasta and sauces were flavorless.  Being from Italy, my soon-to-be husband dreams of the mozzarella and tomatoes from his home country.  Unfortunately, both lacked flavor (at least the tomatoes weren't mealy)! We were so upset, because the drinks were delicious and the staff was courteous and accommodating.  If it weren't for the food, we would have chosen this beautiful location as our wedding venue.  Unfortunately, because the food was lower than mediocre, we don't even ever want to stay here.

Please, hire a fantastic, creative chef to go with this stunning hotel!",3,2016,01,04
04,Wow...,"Yeah, you're staying in a former monastery dating back to the 15th century that Michelangelo helped design, but that aside, this is an amazing hotel.  The views overlooking Florence, the staff, the pool, the grounds, the lobby, the food, etc, etc..  I will never forget this place.  Even if you can just get in there for a couple of nights, I highly recommend it and you won't be disappointed.",5,2016,01,03
04,Exceptional Florentine Experience ,"Villa San Michele no doubt one of our favourite hotel in Italy. It ticks of all the boxes of the ideal city break holiday- great location with breath taking view over the Florence; lovely pool area; great cosy rooms (some reviewers found them out of date but it's common in Italy, so it did not surprise us); great breakfast and very attentive service. Once again Belmond group has proved that they can deliver an Italian dream to you. ",5,2016,01,01
04,Stunning setting with first class service,If you want stunning settings and fabulous food this is the place to be ! I came here with family and stayed for one week! The pool is clean and in a one word perfect ! The food and cookery courses are a perfect touch to this stunning hotel ! The staff go above and beyond for you ! I strongly recommend this hotel to anyone on here ! ,5,2015,12,27
04,An incredibly hotel with a breathtaking view of of the City,"The hotel is situated hillside and each villa has an incredible view of the city.  The staff always went out of their way to make sure we were taken care of and the food always amazing.  We were guests for an incredible long weekend away and enjoyed a number of parties on site catered by the amazing chefs of the Belmond.
Located about 15 minutes from the City centre its conveniently situated just close enough but far enough from the hustle and bustle of downtown.",5,2015,12,17
04,A Very Special hotel in beautiful Tuscany !,"We have recently returned from a fabulous 4 night stay at this amazing hotel. On our first night we ate at the hotel and found the food and service to be so wonderful that we cancelled our other dinner reservations at other restaurants and ate at the hotel. The setting was incredible and the views from the restaurant were spectacular.
We decided to take the cookery experience with the chef and had a wonderful morning learning how to prepare and cook Italian food. We then were served our creations at the restaurant. 
The regular free shuttle to the city was always on time and gave us the opportunity to explore Florence and do some shopping. 
It was great to get back on the shuttle late afternoon and return to the calm and tranquility of the Villa St Michele. 
We will definitely return to this special hotel as the staff made us feel so welcome we really didn't want to leave.",5,2015,10,26
04,Beautiful and Romantic Hotel,"This hotel has spectacular views and feels like you have stepped back in time.  It was a former monastery and is rich with authentic frescoes and paintings that makes you feel the richness of Florence.  The rooms are well appointed and very comfortable.  The staff bends over backwards in ensuring your stay is comfortable and meets all your needs.  We loved sipping drinks on their lawns under the stars at night.  They have a shuttle to take you into Florence, which is a great convenience.  It is located outside the city for a tranquil stay, but close enough that it isn't a long commute inside center city.  The only down spot in our stay is their restaurant.  The food is delicious and the service is a little slow, but with the ambience they have there we were expecting the food to match the magnificent views.  It didn't knock our socks off, which would have made our stay perfect.",5,2015,10,24
04,Beautiful hotel,"My husband and I did not stay in this hotel but were given a tour and enjoyed a lovel cocktail party on the grounds and a truly wonderful Florentine Steak for dinner.  By all means, spend some time in this special place.",5,2015,10,22
04,"Spectacular Setting, Spectacular Service","The Belmond Hotels are amazing!  But most important, the people who work at these hotels make you want to come back again and again.  The setting was spectacular, high on a hill over looking the city of Florence. The hotel itself was a former monetary so the building has history and you feel the warmth of the previous owners. The flowers and greenery were perfectly manicured and the rooms were just beautiful. But as I said, the help at the hotel were amazing--warm, friendly and knowledgable. They were always ready to help us, even when we couldn't get a cab one night. We called them and they arranged for a pickup in town. The welcome you get from the front desk is amazing and you get it every time you walk in--we laughed with all of them. The concierge is incredibly helpful and I just can't say enough about this hotel. They have a shuttle into Florence almost every hour so you can stay away from the ruckus of the city yet visit it when you want to go there. We loved this hotel and will return there again!",5,2015,10,21
04,Must come.,"From the time we arrived everything was perfect. 
We could not have asked for more.
Staff were absolutely great, even appologised for the rain, but an umberella was there to keep us dry.
Beautifull bedrooms and bathrooms and well stocked mini bars and an appreciated welcome drink.",5,2015,10,21
04,"Florence, Hotel Villa San Michele and its staff, will steal a place in your heart?","Belmond have wonderful hotels, rightly you should expect excellence but it is still nice to see it delivered in every aspect of the hotel.

Upon arrival you'll be warmly welcomed............ and they mean it.¬†

The ¬†granduer which now exudes from this former monastery, the scenic views across the rooftops of Florence and the personable yet respectful attention, all combine to ensure your stay is quite memorable.

Aaron the manager proudly escorted us to our room and wished us a happy relaxing break and that we find a small place in our hearts for Florence whilst we stay at hotel Villa san Michele

It's fair to say we did just that.

Whilst everyone smiled and wished us good day, the restaurant staff under the expert but friendly eye of Irvine the Matre""d, the jovial barmen especially Fabio and expert long serving pianist Johnny, deserve to be singled out for special mention. To say my wife wished to take them home is an understatement!

However the chef also deserves a special mention. Every dish was superb, be it local cuisine or international. Nothing was too much trouble, every dish better than the last!¬†

Be aware that the hotel rooms are set in the grounds and may require some effort to get to them at the end of the day, but a comfortable bed awaits!

It is true the hotel lacks the atmosphere of the city centre however the hourly complimentary shuttle bus is more than convenient and the peaceful, quiet, panoramic views across Florence more than make up for not being in the centre.

Wonderful staff, delightful cuisine, stunning views. Aaron,we have a place in our hearts for Florence and the Hotel Villa san Michele, we will return!",5,2015,10,19
04,Dream destination ,"What a wonderful hotel and absolutely lovely staff . The reception , the concierge .. Everything was impeccable and a special thank you to the concierge who made any request seem so easy .. We will come back when  the season opens .. This is a dream destination for relaxation and Florence is not far as they provide courtesy shuttles every hour 
",5,2015,10,17
04,Spectacular Florentine villa,"Wonderful combination of a property on the hills of Tuscany overlooking Florence but with the advantage of a free shuttle into town so you're not swarmed by crowds and have a beautiful garden and grounds. The food is great, service impeccable and the rooms are luxurious. We had a deluxe junior suite with the bathrooms larger than many apartments and a outdoor balcony with gorgeous views of the city of Florence. Everyone is very friendly and the staff were wonderful to our little 1 year old. Can't wait to return. Very romantic for couples, but well setup for families too.",5,2015,10,14
04,Grandeur,"Located on a hillside in Fiesole overlooking Florence, The Belmond San Michelle is a 13th century monastery transformed into a hotel.  Service is first class.  Rooms are comfortable.  Toiletries are by Bvlgari.  The breakfast buffet, delicious and more than you can eat.  Not only do you have all the buffet items, but also get to order a vast array of items from the menu.  Our room, XX, was comfortable, although I was flabbergasted when I looked out the window only to see the wall of the building.  This was very disappointed considering the cost of the rooms, as well as the gardens and overlooks surrounding the hotel.  Although I realize not all rooms can have a fabulous view,  advance notification should be give for obstructed view rooms.   My hotel reservation stated complimentary transportation to and from Florence until 11 pm, however that was not the case, making taxis a necessity after 6 pm.  The hotel did credit my charge card for their costs, however it did take almost one month before the credit appeared.  I don't know who was responsible for the delay, the hotel or credit card company, but it was an unexpected delay none the less.  This is definitely a phenomenal place to stay and we would definitely stay here again.  All of this does come at a hefty cost.  In other words, if you are on a budget or have to worry about money, this is definitely not the place for you.  But if you are on vacation and like to be treated royally,  I'd make a reservation right away.",5,2015,10,14
04,Wonderful hotel with great service,"We enjoyed a very relaxing week here in September. Wonderful gardens, great swimming pool and excellent service throughout the hotel. Great breakfast on the terrace overlooking Florence and superb for dinner. Shuttle bus to Florence is an added bonus. ",5,2015,10,11
04,Villa San Michele ... Graciousness & elegance personified,"Perched on the hillside overlooking Florence, this is one of the most beautiful and romantic hotels anywhere... and the history of it is mind-boggling ... (ask the concierge... he will happily share all the details). Truly unique... the reception area was a chapel (designed by Michelangelo) ... the restaurant has a view to die for ... there's a wine cellar.  and the gardens are stunning (and that is where to sit and have a drink: in the garden, on the couches) .  Very expensive as far a hotels go ... but worth a trip if even just for drinks outside and a view that will take your breath away, (Staff is delightful, and their seasonal White Peach Bellinis are amazing!) . Villa San Michele is one of the most gorgeous spots I've come across - anywhere. Love Love Love it !",5,2015,10,07
04,Beautiful And Special,"A special way to be on the ground in Florence and also above it in the hills, looking down at the beautiful city.  Villa San Michele has stunning views.  It is elegant but not fussy - jeans are fine at dinner in the lovely dining room.  Staff is generally excellent - some concierges on duty are better than others.  Adriano was especially warm, enthusiastic, and helpful.  Linen sheets are a luxury bonus, plus the delicious breakfast buffet is pretty much perfection. Hefty price, but there is value in this truly unique way to combine city with countryside.",5,2015,10,04
04,Spend a memorable occasion there and be treated to the utmost in hospitality!,"We decided to stay at this gorgeous place for my birthday.  WOW!  We were so impressed by the level of service, by the graciousness, by the intellect and knowledge of the concierges, by the kindnesses of all the employees. Yes it is special and expensive but worth every euro.",5,2015,09,28
04,Sophisticated ,"We went for a romantic dinner.
The restaurant is situated in Fiesole on a hill with the most gorgeous view.
The atmosphere was sober and was taking you in time like you were some royalty.
We order Baked lamb chops with wild rosemary and sauteÃÅed baby vegetable ‚Äúcaponata‚Äù and Crisp duck breast with orange honey and caramelised peach sauce, served with a fennel and orange salad and it was just perfect.
And for the perfect end the desert was heavenly.

You should definitely try this restaurant!

",5,2015,09,27
04,Excellent service,"I stayed for 3 nights just last week and it exceeded expectations.  As Firenze is a bit claustraphobic, it was great to escape each day to the resort just a short car ride away in the hills overlooking the city.  I like that everything is not brand new.  It was like stepping back in time (except that there was wifi everywhere on the resort).  We received wonderful care from Lorenzo, the bartender, as well as the entire staff.  Each night we sat in the bar area and listened to the talented piano players and enjoyed fine wines and grappas.  One pianist, Claudio, is also a world class singer/performer.   The views are as intoxicating as the cocktails.",5,2015,09,22
04,Stunning Location above Florence,"We stayed at Villa San Michele for 4 nights. It was the perfect escape from the main city. The hotel does provide transportation to the city of Florence, but many times it did not work for our schedule, so we wound up taking a taxi back in the evenings. The grounds are beautiful and the view is amazing. We dined on the property on several occasions and the food was great. We also had amazing cocktails and they have a live piano player most of the nights. The swimming pool area is peaceful and overlooks all of the city. Service was top notch and we would definitely recommend staying here for a luxury getaway.",5,2015,09,20
04,Beautiful hotel and location,"This is a stunning place. It's location is wonderful with views across Florence. The rooms are lovely - spotless, comfortable and well appointed. The front desk, housekeeping and pool staff are helpful and it is the little things like the pool attendant putting the towel on the sun lounger that make this place  really luxurious. Sadly the restaurant staff still have some way to go with their quality of service which was surprising for a hotel of this reputation and price. I would stay here again but would hope they would have improved the dining staff's level of service and also rethought the parking. ",4,2015,09,20
04,very nice location and people. A bit old fashioned.,Very nice people. Hotel with soul. Great pool. Room a bit noisy (neighbour) and hotel is a bit old fashion. But very pleasant. Restaurant a bit pricey for what you get. I would recommende nevertheless this hotel.,4,2015,09,16
04,"Superbly wonderful hospitality, facilities, location, views and delicious food.  You get what you pay for!",We discovered this gem of a hotel on a visit to Florence last year.  If you want to get away from the bustle of the city this is a welcoming peaceful retreat.  The hotel runs a courtesy bus for patrons from the city centre to its hillside location where you can sip a refreshment and look over the historic vista below.  The hotel staff are welcoming and discreet.  We visited for lunch in the restaurant as a treat for my husband on a special day and the hotel organised a taxi to collect us in Fiesole then after having lunch and spending the afternoon enjoying the ambience they arranged to drop us off in the centre of Florence by courtesy bus.   The food was deliciously special - it is the type of hotel where only the bill payer is initially given the priced menu!,5,2015,09,15
04,Exceptional...,"Stayed in August, and had a wonderful time. The hotel itself is fab, breakfast and dinner out of this world (and what a view!), rooms kept in perfect condition. The staff could not do more for you, all very welcoming. My one criticism would be that location wise, it is quite the trek down to florence itself, and the pool is fairly small considering the size of the hotel-all small niggles though. Would thoroughly recommend for a retreat!",5,2015,09,14
04,"Elegance, Vistas and Magnificient Cuisine","From the moment we arrived, met by Adriano Pecoraro the reception manager, impecable service that the Belmond is renowned for delivering at each of its properties. Escorted to our table on the veranda with views of Firenze that can't be duplicated, we were treated to cuisine that was remarkable, accompanied by a white Tuscan wine that was dry but delivered the fruity result that made our experience memorable. The experience has a proce point that is also memorable, however when celebrating that special occasion on our first visit to Firenze, this experience is not to be missed.",5,2015,09,13
04,Lunch with a View,"First let me say, I didn't stay there. We went for drinks and lunch and wound up spending the whole afternoon there. Expensive but worth every penny.  The grounds are stunning and the hotel staff were so kind they took us around the property.  I could not think of a better place to spend my time in Florence at and when I go back this hotel will be on the top of the list to stay.",5,2015,09,12
04,Unwelcome,"First time I've written on this site.  I not a ""complainer"" by nature. .   We visited Villa San Michele for lunch last week.  Granted, we weren't staying in the hotel, but when we arrived and said we fancied lunch we were shown to the main restaurant and then directed to the pool bar when we said we fancied something lighter. .  We ordered food and some wine, all very pleasant , very attentive staff.  This changed very quickly when they realised we weren't staying at the hotel. Clearly the food was on it's way, but we couldn't have been made to feel less welcome..   I was asked for my credit card so they could write the number down.  We were told we shouldn't be there.  They didn't ask us how the food was, offer us the desert menu / coffee.  We couldn't have been made to feel less welcome if they'd tried. A total contrast to when we arrived.  My wife and I have eaten in fantastic hotels all over the world, and it was the first time we've seen anything like this. We paid and slinked out. actually feeling like we had broken the law. The hotel looked lovely, the food was good.  We might have gone back there for a holiday , not now.",2,2015,09,11
04,"Lovely service, fantastic location","I would highly recommend this place for travellers who, like me, prefer to be slightly out of the main tourist areas and dip in and out at your leisure. The hotel is in a beautiful spot with a wonderful view over Florence, the atmosphere is extremely relaxed and the staff were lovely. There is a free hourly shuttle into Florence which we used a lot and drops you off right in the centre (it does stop too early to bring you back after dinner so you will need taxis at night).

The room was fab and the bathroom spectacular!

I would note that for me, the restaurant is overpriced - for people not staying at the hotel maybe it's worth it as you're paying for the view, but not for residents who wake up to it anyway! Go to Fiesole and eat at the trattoria on the square instead, it's great.",5,2015,09,10
04,"Fabulous views, services and food","This was a first visit, and we were booked into a suite with a terrace on the hillside. A beautiful big room, with double bathroom, exquisite bed linen (very fine real linen with picoting and entre-deux detail around the pillow shams). It couldn't be faulted, except perhaps for its access. As it is a converted monastery, the number of rooms in the main building are limited, hence the terraces cut into the hill with rows of suites. The outlook is wonderful, but if you are navigating the stone steps between levels in high heels and a long dress, you have to hold on if you pause to admire the view! In cases of need, the hotel will drive you up aback service road to your level, and this we availed ourselves of on occasion... 
Breakfast was a big treat, sitting in the cloisters, and gazing out overthehillsidedownto Florence... Although it is a breakfast buffet, the service was excellent, and the selection simply outstanding. The other meals we had at the hotel, lunch by the pool (lovely pool), a big outdoors pre-wedding dinner, and a brunch were all terrific. The only shame was having to leave.
It is certainly expensive, and one might say the laundry charge was extraordinary for pressing a shirt and steaming a dress, but the service was impeccable andeven charming, with absolutely beautiful views... We were so lucky to have sunny weather to enjoy it!",5,2015,09,04
04,WHAT A BEAUTIFUL PLACE !!!!!!,"Up on the hill this magnificent old monastery makes you feel impressed as soon as you stepped in. The gardens , the swimming pool and the patios are very well kept and beautiful . Views of Florence are impeccable in the morning but in the evening .... wow!!!!  You can have dinner at the veranda and see the lights of Florence sparkling just in front of you . It was one of the most romantic dinners we had with my wife . Food was excellent and service perfect . Villas overlooking Florence were very well decorated and outside covered with plants . It's a very expensive hotel but believe me it is a great experience .",5,2015,09,04
04,Lunch,"We visited San Michele during a family holiday to Tuscany. We had been to Pisa to see the Tower in the morning and had booked for lunch at 1:30pm on the Terrace over looking Florence. The Tom Tom did send us through some narrow back roads to get to the hotel, luckily we found a more direct route down the hill back in to Florence.The location and view of the hotel is amazing and beautiful. The staff are very attentive and all spoke good English. Our food was to a very high standard and enjoyable. The only negative point of our visits was the Euro14 (¬£10) for an apple juice for one of our children (ouch!). We would definitely return and recommend the hotel.",4,2015,08,31
04,5 Star Elegance!,"We just returned from a 3 night stay at VSM.  The property is everything other reviewers have stated.  It's just beautiful.  The driver who met us at the airport explained that Fiesole is the Beverly Hills of Tuscany/Florence.  If that is the case, then VSM is equivalent of the Beverly Hills Hotel!

We were upgraded to the Michelangelo Suite upon our arrival.  The room is steeped in history - Napoleon used it as his HQ when in Florence!  All of the period details are intact (plus exceptional views) with a few modern updates - such as an amazing bathroom and shower.  The hotel has done a great job blending old and new in all private and public spaces.

The service is outstanding.  Many gracious thanks to Maurizio, Massimo, Fabio, Dennis and all the other staff who are exceptional at their jobs.  We did not encounter any flaws in the service whatsoever.  In fact, Maurizio arranged to have our rental car delivered to the hotel a couple of days after our arrival.  It was more convenient as we didn't have an immediate need for it and didn't have to pick it up in the city or the airport.  

There are more outdoor areas than the photos show online.  The property details and views are magical.  We sat on the terrace every evening, having drinks and admiring the Florence lights below.  One night we ate in the restaurant and the food was excellent.  The shuttle into the city is very convenient and a great complimentary benefit.  The entire position of the property allows you to enjoy the convenience and views of Florence without the crowds 24/7.

We would recommend VSM to everyone.  Yes, it is expensive - including meals and drinks on the property - so go in knowing beforehand.  If you factor this into your budget, you will not be disappointed on ANY level!",5,2015,08,27
04,5 stars if it was 250e a night! ,"Rooms are small or tiny for the price and don't bother with a deluxe room unless your bothered about your small window having a view, the one we had on the second night was smaller then our standard room on the first night! 

Service is mixed some amazing staff there some terrible. The key for our room did not work and the female receptionist was very uninterested to help when she eventually decided to come and check there was no apology just blamed it on the previous guests in the room. 

Wifi is terrible and does not work everywhere eg the pool and our first room had no wifi! 

Food in the main restaurant is good especially the pasta however the pool restaurant is below average.",2,2015,08,24
04,The Setting is Magical - Overlooking all of Florence,"We did not stay in the hotel, only spent an hour there as recommended by our driver.  The views of Florence were spectacular...the hotel and bar staff was amazing and helpful.  The hotel is built into the side of the hill (or mountain), with rooms sculpted into the hillside.  Unbelievable.  It looks like actually staying in an ancient site.",5,2015,08,23
04,Tasting menu fiasco,"Highly recommended by everyone , we decided to go there ...
Magnificent views , beautiful setting and surroundings ,,,,
Decided to have the tasting menu with wines to pair .
Either the wine came before or after the food was served , the sommelier ( in a rush ) read the label of the bottle and quickly dissapeared to upsell to other tables .....
Food quality very poor , the king prawns described on the menu were just standard prawns on a bed of unriped tomatoes ....the translation from Italian to English was terrible.
Insipid service , they do triple sittings in one night , if you not happy , what is the big deal ?
Will never come back , do not recommend it to anyone even if in honeymoon !!!!!rather eat at the four seasons in town , somebody recommended it too and happened to be fantastic !!!!!!!

04,Truly Outstanding!!,"The Belmond Villa San Michele may truly be ""heaven on earth"".  Tucked away in the hillls of  Fiesole in what used to be a monastery, this boutique hotel still possesses an aura of peace and serenity.  The hotel overlooks the most spectacular views of Florence, surrounded by luscious trees and gardens.  My suite (needed the extra room for my son) was perfect - perfectly large, perfectly decorated and per my previous posts when I had mentioned that I prefer large bathrooms, well, we had the most perfectly large bathroom as well.  The restaurant serves the celebrated Tuscan cuisine cooked to perfection.  I've never had better minestrone soup in my life! The view from the outdoor/indoor terrace dining room is romantic and beautiful in its simplest form.  The pool is at the highest point of the hotel - not the most convenient to get to, but when you get there, you never want to leave.  I've traveled to many beautiful places and stayed in many great hotels - this actually may be the BEST yet! Okay, so it's also one of the priciest places, but if you're looking to spend - spend it here at the Belmond Villa San Michele!",5,2015,08,12
04,Heaven,"We stayed for four nights in July in the Garden Room, which is a beautiful room in its own building and with its own terraces to the side of the main hotel.  This hotel is just wonderful.  We came from the buzz and excitement of the Cipriani and found the Villa San Michele the perfect contrast.  It is so serene and beautiful; we wanted never to leave.  Both the main restaurant and the poolside one are excellent and have breathtaking views of Florence.  The waiters take great care of you and make excellent suggestions regarding choice of wine and food.  The staff are all very charming and cheerful; it seems a very happy place.  In the height of summer it is lovely to be able to take the hotel's minibus for the 20 minute drive down into Florence in the mornings and escape back to the hotel for an afternoon by the pool.  The gardens are very charming too and we couldn't recommend it more for a relaxing and romantic holiday.",5,2015,08,06
04,Bellissimo,"My wife and I stayed at the Villa San Michele for 4 nights as part of the final leg of our honeymoon and having stayed in 2 amazing hotels in Capri and Ravello we weren't disappoint in the slightest!
Nestled in the hills of Fiesole on the outskirts on Florence amid lush trees and terraced gardens, the hotel affords enjoying unparalleled vistas of Florence and the Arno Valley. 
Dating from the 15th century, the Villa‚Äôs fa√ßade is attributed to Michelangelo. Step inside and you experience the peace and tranquillity of a former Renaissance monastery which now feels like a private home. Rooms are traditional but comfortable with large bathrooms and all the mod cons you need for a relaxing stay.
The concierge service is impeccable with Michael on hand to organise all your day trips and restaurants and there is a scheduled courtesy shuttle bus which operates between the hotel and Piazza della Repubblica in Florence‚Äôs historic centre.
The pool area is beautiful and very peaceful and whilst we didn't eat at the hotel the Cloister Bar is perfect for an pre-dinner aperitif or night-cap before bed.
The hotel really is amazing and we would highly recommend it and would love to return soon.",5,2015,08,04
04,Outstanding Hotel,"The Belmond Villa San Michelle delivered on all fronts.  Staff were attentive, knew us by name despite our short stay and quickly adapted to our needs.  Rooms are well sized with excellent bathrooms and facilities.  Would have liked coffee making facilities though.
 
Breakfast and dinner were excellent with well flavoured dishes although we were surprised that hollandaise sauce for eggs benedict was not available.  However the staff promised it for the following morning.

Highly recommended for the short break in complete privacy.",5,2015,08,02
04,Wonderful Stay,"Upon arrival we were shown to our beautiful suite, the service in the hotel is outstanding as is the view from the terrace. A big thank you to Maurizio, the concierge, who organised all our activities. Nothing is too much trouble and you are made to feel like one of the family, ",5,2015,07,26
04,"Perfection, Simple and Elegant","This is a fantastic property in the hills immediately north of Florence.  The views to the city are breathtaking.  Equally alluring is the hotel itself- small, intimate, historic, elegant, friendly, beautiful and calm.  This is a luxe oasis not to be missed.  Our suite (upgraded from a Jr Suite) had views of both the city and the gardens, the latter spectacularly splashed with the vibrancy of roses, oleander, bougainvillea, etc., that cascade down the terraced hillside from the pool at the top to the bar lawn below.  The restaurant, La Loggia, has exceptional food and the same magical views over the city.  The fish is fresh and perfectly cooked.  The bistecca ala Fiorentina is delicious but truly enough for four.  Great wine list at fair prices.  Service is exceptional- the staff in the dining room and at the pool and concierge desk cannot do enough for you  and always with a smile and a bon mot.  Mention also of the small terrace restaurant by the pool- charming and simple fare that is delicious, and with the same level of service.  The pool itself is one of the best- large, deep and cooling with ample chaise longues, and plenty of towels.  The ride into and our of town is every 15 minutes so very convenient.  Only suggestion is that it run later into the evening for those who want to dine in town- alternative is driving or taxi (the latter recommended).  We cannot recommend this place more highly.  It is heaven.",5,2015,07,23
04,Fantastic property!,"This was a stunning location and most excellent staff.  The views are incredible, the food is fantastic, and the staff could not be more professional and genuine.  I also loved our room, but the AC was a bit weak in the heat wave.  The shuttle service to town was very handy.  Common areas of the hotel are just spectacular!  This is a gem of a place!",5,2015,07,20
04,Excellent Staff save the day,"The best views imaginable; brilliant pool; the restaurant fantastic but oh dear oh dear the rooms! Tired decor, poor air conditioning - just not good enough at this price. On the plus side brilliant staff on reception make you feel welcome from the start and this level of service is there throughout.",4,2015,07,15
04,As good as it gets,"From the service at reception to the general quality of everything in the room, the views, food and wines this place is the best.
We had the tasting menu and wines. Both the food and quality of wines were magnificent.
Some restaurants are mean with quality wines on a tasting menu but not the case here.",5,2015,07,11
04,"sadly, they have lost the mojo","the view in amazing, yet sadly, this amazing property has lost it. 
1stly, try to avoid room 70; the hotter the day, the greater the sewerage smell. The apology seemed manufactured; shock;horror; surprise; yet when we were moved to another room, someones else was moved in room 70.

secondly, we asked for a walking track; we were advised to walk outside the property, yet inside this property is an amazing walking track; just needs some minor groundwork; even outdoor chin up bars, and sit up equipment is there.

finally, how can one justify 12 euro for frech fries!",3,2015,07,08
04,25th Anniversary Worthy,"We came from a Belmond property in Sicily to this Belmond property and so we expected the best and were not disappointed. The setting is unique and magnificent. There is a quiet elegant charm about this hotel. While there are others here, their presence is soft and you feel that you have this enchanting location to yourself. 

Our room, number 30 is special. Private entrance and front porch.  Having just been redone the bathroom is beyond spacious and elegant. Great strong shower and powerful hairdryer are two things that I always look for, and again, I was not disappointed. 

And, clean,clean clean. 

The breakfast is entirely and dinner at the hotel on the terrace is a treat. 

The staff is friendly and warm and helpful. All I can say is that we will be back. ",5,2015,07,07
04,Gorgeous property with stunning views of Florence,"Originally a monastery, this hotel is located on top of a hill overlooking Florence.  The rooms are spacious, with huge bathrooms.  The grounds are gorgeous.  It was a little fancy (the hotel restaurant is apparently well known and has a dress code), but not overly pretentious.  To get to the center of Florence, it is a 20 minute drive, but the hotel has a complimentary shuttle.",4,2015,07,05
04,OMG!  Breathtakingly spectacular views and impeccable service!,"This place is located at the top of the hill on the outskirts of Florence, Italy.  They have an outdoor covered patio area which is lit and heated.  They serve amazing hors d'oeuvres of several types of fresh olives, and homemade chips.  The view will take your breath away as you can see all of Florence perched so high above the city.  It is very high up there and it tends to get cool and windy.

In the inner dining room, they have the original fresco of the Last Supper, what a sight to behold.  This is place is A!, Top Notch and definitely worth the time, effort and money.  The food was not only perfect and delicious, but served and presented impeccably.

The wait staff are very attentive and professional in starched white, yet never intrusive.  This location not only has a dining room worth the trek, but they are also a 5 star hotel.  The rooms and balconies made me want to check out of the Westin Excelsior and check in at this establishment.  Alas, they were full...if I had to compare it to anything, I would say the Ritz Carlton!

All I can say, is that we are going back and this is where we intend to stay!!",5,2015,07,03
04,Great location but you need deep pockets,"Beautiful location and pool. Great for combining sightseeing with relaxing. Free shuttle bus into the city fantastic but not the every 20 minutes as advertised on the website. Really friendly staff.
 
However, silly prices for drinks (‚Ç¨7.50 for a coke, wine starts at around ‚Ç¨40 a bottle) and snacks (pizzas from ‚Ç¨17) however the set tasting menu in the restaurant is expensive but better value. 

Rooms average, could with a refresh. Booked one delixe room but has no sofa, bath or safe. Standard garden view room just had a view of a wall.",3,2015,06,29
04,Heaven on earth!,"We have been traveling for 2 weeks thru Croatia and Italy, ending in Florence at the villa san michelle. Our rooms are
Large but cozy, sumptuous linens and sheets, ac that works, a shower that works wonderfully, without spraying the room!
Pool is lovely, breakfast generous and delicious. 
But what stands out were the people: Michael and Clio at the front desk are helpful, gracious and warm. We feel like friends, not clients, and they both find us excellent restaurants and greet us sincerely as we pass thru the lobby.
It is an oasis of grace and beauty in a city of beauty: how can it be?
Worth the splurge.",5,2015,06,29
04,World class,"I highly recommend this beautiful hotel in every way. The ambience, the service, the character, the breathtaking views, the food, the gorgeous rooms. I cannot fault anything here. Our stay at the San Michele will be remembered forever and we will certainly be back.",5,2015,06,28
04,What a birthday treat,"Many many good things are said about this hotel and they are all true. Its exceptional view, great food and wine and the beauty of the hotel and its setting. We had the pleasure of five nights and three exceptional dinners with the finest wines from great wine makers and an exceptional choice of vintages to suit all pockets. All delivered with the most impeccable and friendly service from a great team our thanks to the Sommelier for his passion for his wine list.
Florence itself is provides a wealth of history which I will not cover here as all the travel guides provide sufficient in these matters but for shoe fanatics you should not miss the Salvatore Ferragamo museum. All in all one of our best holidays yet and plans are already afoot to return.",5,2015,06,27
04,Loved it!,"This was the second part of our honeymoon and soon put an end to our sadness at leaving gorgeous Portofino!  Another spectacular hotel and location.  We were greeted by the Manager on our arrival and found all the staff there to be friendly and charming - and we can't thank Michel on the desk enough for sourcing my husband's required contact lenses (he forgot these and we were desperately trying to find them in Italy before he ran out completey!) AND arranging to fetch these for us!! The grounds were breathtaking and we loved the peace and quiet - but the shuttle bus into busy Florence was great and meant we had the best of both worlds! Wonderful room, amazing hotel and gorgeous food whilst looking at the most amazing views.  Finishing the night with a cocktail and listening to the brilliant pianist was perfect....",5,2015,06,20
04,Quiet and beautiful,"We stayed at Villa San Michele for 3 nights in June, before traveling on to Belmond Hotel Caruso in Ravello. The hotel is very beautiful and situated in the very quiet hillside town of Fiesole.  Our room was located on the hill, with a private entrance surrounded by pretty ivy and vine. The room was very spacious and spotless, and we had a private patio with an amazing view.  

The property is very quiet, in fact we rarely saw other guests at breakfast or walking around.  The view of Florence is just amazing, especially in the evening. The hotel offers a shuttle to Florence (about 20 minute ride) and we took advantage of that service on a couple days.  We loved Florence, however we were pleased that we decided to stay outside of the city. We spent an afternoon at the hotel pool, which was very nice.  We had cocktails in the piano bar in the evening which we really enjoyed, and the service, while a bit slow, was very good.  We chose not to eat dinner at the hotel, and instead, enjoyed some of Fiesole's local restaurants.   

Thank you to Michael at the front desk for his kind and helpful hospitality.",4,2015,06,17
04,Best hotel experience!,Cannot say enough good things about this hotel and their incredible staff. Paulo the concierge made our trip with his excellent service and recommendations. The hotel has breathtaking views of Florence. The bed and pillows were the most comfortable I slept on in all of Italy (15 day trip). There's a private van for the hotel that takes people into town every hour on the hour. They really do think of everything here. I was sad to leave because it truly was a magical trip to Villa San Michele,5,2015,06,03
04,best hotel for every occasion!,"The view is amazing, rooms are clean and I mean that! 
Food is always fresh, good portions and very tasty. 
Staff is helpful with a smile, any time you need something. 
The very best hotel so far and I have been in a lot!
I went three times at 2014 and 2015. I will go back!",5,2015,05,28
04,amazing experience - absolutely stunning,"We were a group of friends who had come in from Australia to celebrate a friends birthday in Florence. 
Vittorio and his staff were attentive, courteous and so professional. The food was amazing and buildings, gardens and surroundings were awe inspiring. The views of Florence were just breathtaking.
The car services that picked us up from our apartment and took us back after dinner was so professional and prompt. Francesco our driver was so nice and gave us helpful and interesting information about different places in Florence we drove past on our way to Fiesole. 
I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for somewhere special in Florence to celebrate.",5,2015,05,23
04,Stunning,"With the facade and loggia said to have been designed by Michelangelo, this puts you in the picture. The former monastery, elegantly set on a hill overlooking and on the edge of Florence is just stunning. The gardens are beautiful, too. Being just out of Florence you can avoid the hustle and bustle, but the hotel's shuttle runs regularly to and fro if you need it.

As with our experience of Belmond so far, service and food is excellent. We had an executive junior suite with a view over Florence and the whole experience was very memorable. Expensive perhaps, but well worth it. Look for Belmond special deals.",5,2015,05,16
04,A wonderful and relaxing weekend,"We spent a long weekend here celebrating a significant birthday.  The hotel staff are wonderful.  Everyone greets you warmly, English is not a problem if your Italian is as bad as ours is and nothing is ever too much of a problem for them.

The location and views over Florence make this a very special place indeed.  I had wanted to come here for years and am glad we finally were able to stay",5,2015,04,27
04,A very special hotel,"Having stayed at the Villa San Michele on our honeymoon, we decided to come back again to celebrate our 20th wedding anniversary. The hotel did not disappoint. Its location is of course magnificent with breathtaking views over Florence. We were lucky enough to be upgraded to a beautiful junior suite with our own private terrace. All the staff are friendly, attentive and professional, and couldn't donenough to help us. Of course it's expensive (dinner particularly) but if you're looking for a truly special hotel, there can't be anywhere better in Florence. There's also a free shuttle bus taking guests to and from the city every hour.
We finished our stay with a brilliant cookery course with the head chef, Attilio, learning the secrets of making gnocchi and tiramisu!",5,2015,04,18
04,Family Vacation,"Our family of four stayed at Villa San Michele for 3 nights.  We had separate rooms, one for our two children and one for my wife and I.  Everything about our visit was truly 5 star.  Of all the international travel we have done over the years, this hotel, the staff and the entire experience remains as #1.",5,2015,04,08
04,"Hotel Belmond Villa San Michele, Long name; Totally worth it","Our one night stay at Hotel Belmond Villa San Michele in Fiesole, Italy, was one I‚Äôll never forget. At first glance our room seemed elegantly simple with a rustic theme, but upon further inspection a double door leading to a terraced porch could be found. When standing or sitting on the porch, a magnificent view overlooking the entirety of Florence opened up, and when night came, the city became a shadow pocked with millions of multi-colored lights. None of us will forget that view. 

The elevation of Hotel Belmond Villa San Michele is what made it special. Florence sits in a valley surrounded by mountains, and this ‚Äúpot‚Äù shape accumulates heat in the summer. Because of its location on the lip of the North mountain range, the Hotel Belmond Villa San Michele avoids Florence‚Äôs sweltering summer heat. 

The coolness of the resort of course is complimented by its lush gardens and greeneries. Not only is the hotel surrounded by gardens immaculately groomed by the hands of the hotel daily, but wisteria plants have been strategically allowed to grow onto the face of all the outside surfaces of the hotel, giving it a calm and hidden atmosphere. 

The architecture of Hotel Belmond Villa San Michele must also be discussed. The fa√ßade of the building is based upon a Michelangelo painting, and was modeled with an open atrium that overlooks the city. The hotel itself is ancient, and was used as a Catholic monastery for hundreds of years. 

Finally, the services offered by Hotel Belmond Villa San Michele are incredible. The food was exquisite and offered three times a day. The hotel staff weren‚Äôt interruptive or pushy, and the room was neat and tidy after a long tiring day adventuring in Florence. 

I would highly recommend this hotel to any friend, the impeccable atmosphere and more-than-convenient services were the best I‚Äôve ever experienced. The hotel was beyond recuperative, and left every member of my family, even my younger brother, wanting more before we left.",5,2015,02,17
04,"Unique and Gorgeous, very expensive but worth it!","This exclusive hotel is tucked into the side of a mountain and was once a 15th Century monastery.  Old fresco's are still seen in the main building.  The rooms in the main building are small so make sure you ask for one of the rooms built into the hillside underneath the lawn.  Remember, Monks lived there for centuries!  As you walk through the property, you can actually pick huge lemons from the vines growing along the walkway.  The food is amazing and the view is even better from the Terrace where you can start your day with a delicious Italian breakfast.  This is a very expensive hotel.  Many celebrities stay there for the privacy and excellent service.  In fact, Kim Kardashian stayed there the night before her wedding.  If you want to really to experience old Italy from centuries ago, don't miss this Villa.   We loved it!",5,2015,01,28
04,breathtaking and very romanic,"I was so lucky to spend 2 glorious nights at Villa San Michele and my only complaint is it just flew by too quickly. This place is just heaven and the chief really deserves a Michelin Star as I had the best White Truffle Risotto i've ever tasted. The quality of food, wine and impeccable service is 10/10
All the staff are super friendly and the rooms are also spacious and filled with lots of luxuries. 
I would also highly recommend this as a venue for intimate weddings and private parties. 
I really hope I get to come back soon and celebrate a special occasion.",5,2014,11,23
04,beautiful hotel with an amazing view,"We really enjoyed our stay at Villa San Michele, Our room was very spacious with a small private garden and an amazing view of Florence. The hotel is perfect if you want to avoid the heat and the crowd! The service was fantastic and they very happily accepted our tiny Chihuahua. Breakfast on the lovely terrace with stunning views of Florence is a must.The only disappointing things where the pool with its plastic lounge chairs and the main restaurant which we found expensive for its menu. Overall an experience to remember.",4,2014,11,07
04,DON'T GO !!,"We booked for 3 nights in July 2015, at a cost of almost 1000 euros per night, about 3 months ago, when we learnt that some friends were getting married nearby. They were also planning to stay at Villa San Michele on the nights before and after their wedding. Imagine our annoyance and their heartbreak, that we've now been told that somebody has booked exclusive use of the property and they cannot honour our booking. They didn't even have the honesty to admit this, they just fobbed us off with some story about a 'glitch in the system', so they had 'mistakenly' been showing availability on booking.com. How can a reputedly 'world top 10' hotel have systems that are so poor. More likely they made a commercial decision to accept an exclusive use booking for commercial reasons, at the expense of the little guy. TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE. If you do book, be prepared for this to happen to you. .",1,2014,10,31
04,Probably the best hotel room I have ever stayed in,"Stayed here for 3 nights and was in a room suite located in the beautifully landscaped grounds adjacent to the main hotel building. Our room was unbelievable. You entered through your own private glass doors, with privay blinds and pass the elegant lounge furniture and the super king sized bed was in the middle of the room. Sumptuous decor and very romantic. Behind the bed was a feature wall with entrances on either side which lead through to a 'his and hers' bathroom with seperate sinks (and wardrobes). Fantastic marble bath and power shower. As mentioned before this is the best room I've ever stayed in. The hotel itself was lovely and staff cheerful and attentive. We found service to be very good and breakfast on the terrace overlooking Florence was breathtaking. Would definately recommend this hotel.",5,2014,10,30
04,"Stunning views, indulgent accommodations","In what used to be a monastery, Villa San Michele is an exquisite example of la dolce vita.  Located in Fiesole, the hotel offers unparalleled views of Florence combined with the peace and tranquility of the Tuscan countryside.  Simply gorgeous.",5,2014,10,29
04,"Amazing views of Florence, beautiful property, so what's wrong?","We were hoping for very relaxing stay in an ancient  VILLA  with the most beautiful surroundings, definitely high end. This property was highly recommended by the hotel's preferred agent Virtuoso. I personally researched it too and emailed with guests who stayed in the villa recently. 
We knew exactly what we wanted- room  INSIDE  the villa with a view of Florence. Virtuoso made the booking for us specifying this requirement.
 When we arrived we received a very exuberant welcome and the ""amazing good news"". With three people at the reception telling us that we received a triple upgrade, we were just a little overwhelmed, but no one told us at first, that the room is not in the villa. We were taken back by this approach, just a little stunned too. It is definitely very awkward when you are awarded an upgrade ( Jr. suite) you don't want. 
The Jr. suites are a ""new"" addition built into the hill in the eighties and are beginning to show their age. The one and only glass door opening to the outside, has to have blinds drawn for privacy, as people are walking by. There are no windows. After 2 nights we spoke to an assistant manager and moved to an inside room with a beautiful new modern bathroom.  And yes, for me staying inside even if only for the last night, was a totally different experience. I am sorry we did not speak up sooner.
The good side: 
The views are amazing no matter where you are on the property. The buffet breakfast is very nice on the terrace. The dining at night on the terrace is an amazing experience and we enjoyed two great dinners and count them as some of the best we ever had.  

Because of the misunderstanding with the room, we were disappointed. It took up our valuable time and the last thing you want is stress on vacation.  
Take my advice, make sure you know where you want your accommodations to be and be very specific about it. 
The outside Jr. suites may be just fine for younger people or families with kids.",4,2014,10,11
04,Possibly best Hotel we have stayed in,"We stayed in the Villa San Michele for two nights in September.  It is in a lovely location overlooking Florence.  The surroundings are beautiful and staff are exceptional.   We have stayed in top hotels and this is one of the best.   It is not cheap but it is worth it.  There is a shuttle bus which makes travelling into Florence easy, with the benefit of relaxing in a garden upon returning to the hotel.  Excellent restaurant with stunning views.",5,2014,09,23
04,So beautiful !,"I loved it there,me and my husband fall in love with the old monastery,with the amazing staff,the excellent Prosecco and fried zuchinni ....the pool it s amazing,the gazebo for the spa moment has a breathtaking view..
The restaurant food it s very good ,nouveau cuisine ,excellent taste.
The room was spacious and very clean ,amazing views..
The concierge very helpful and nice!
Next year we re back!!!",5,2014,09,15
04,"The ""Triple Crown""","This was the third and final stop, as well as the third Belmond hotel that we stayed at on this trip to Italy. We began the trip at the Villa Sant Andrea in Taromina, Sicily, then on to the Hotel Caruso in Ravello and ended at the San Michele in Florence. I will call it our ""Triple Crown"" experience!! I would highly recommend doing this as Belmond goes out of their way to take care of you at the highest level! The San Michele is a fabulous hotel. You could not ask for a more beautiful view of any city than the one that you get standing almost anywhere on the property. We completed a survey for Belmond and as I had done in the 2 previous surveys, there were almost too many people to mention. The staff at each of these hotels are so well trained and put you in a position that you could write forever about the good encounters with them. The training at this company is obviously superior and one of the standout things that they do is constantly call you or your spouse by name. This is one of the nice things about a smaller hotel as well. I cannot speak highly enough about our stay. It was the best!!",5,2014,09,08
04,Charming Property that gives useful balance to Florence Visit,"This property had a great promotion with 30% off rack on Room #1 with an adjoining room for the kids for free. Can't say we didn't get our money's worth. The property is visually stunning and the views all around and especially the pool are killer ones. The rooms we had were junior suites and were spacious with large showers and lots of places to put stuff. Housekeeping could do better at inspecting rooms before people check in. We found several things needing repair when we checked in that we reported (TV's not working) and several other things we just lived with and didn't report such as leaky toilets and broken night lights and different TV channels showing up on different TV's. The gym here is tiny and well hidden at the very top of the property; there is also an outdoor workout area but the bugs are aggressive in the woods. The kids camp is in a windowless chapel and not up to par with other Belmond properties such as the Cipriani and only open 5 hours a day from 12:30 to 5:30 but it was decent enough just barely. Food was very good but we had better in town. We enjoyed the piano players and you could hear the music all the way to the hotel rooms which was really nice and livens up the place which would probably be more creepy in the silence of the night. The concierge staff was helpful and the people were pleasant. Massage by the pool is a nice treat at the end of the day, and the shuttle service to and from town was useful. We enjoyed making pizzas at the pool and walking into Fiseola village. It is a lot of steps walking around here -- over 120 to get from our room to the pool. At least it keeps you fit while you eat all the good food. The restaurant has good breakfast and dinner and they gave me no trouble getting dinner tables at the last minute; the prices for dinner are expensive but it is safe enough to leave the kids in the room while you eat here. So that gives you a 115 Euro head start (against 3 hours babysitting and a taxi back from town) to make you feel less upset about the high price of dinner (just the cost of water and cover seating for 2 is 25 Euro before you even start). The 20 Euro pool drinks are another matter -- lowering the price of them might make people order more of them. My main beef here is that they don't offer water at the pool and I don't really want to be expected to pay over 10 Euro a bottle. You can get free water from the machine in the gym, but I think the hotel should be more hospitable to its guests on this point.  I would advise anyone interested in the hotel's cooking school to avoid visiting in August when it is closed. Hotel arranged a city tour for kids in tow which was expensive but was worth it -- great way to get oriented and to see the city's sites. We chose not to take a car and driver to local areas such as Siena because you can go to Florence for free with the shuttle and we weren't up to paying 700 Euros for a car and driver for a day -- something that costs 200 Euro a day in southern Germany. These ridiculous prices abetted by greedy concierges help kill the options of seeing sites in Tuscany for those who don't travel with their own car. But as it turns out we found plenty more to do in Florence and 2 days in town with the kids was fine.Otherwise, I found this to be a great respite from the city of Florence and it is a great place to feel relaxed and to enjoy the feel of the countryside along with the amenities of a hotel and the closeness to the city. You just don't get that sitting inside a city hotel and I think that getting a villa in this area would be more trouble than it is worth which is why I chose to stay here.",5,2014,09,03
04,Perfect,"Best villa hotel in Florence surrounded from an amazing country side.
Amazing food and nice service.
I enjoyed it for just two day, but I will always remember that view of Florence city from the private swimming pool.",5,2014,09,03
04,Saving FLorence,"For many years, in my estimation, Florence has been a very worn-out, smoke-choked,tourist-ridden capital. No matter where you stay, hotel or rental, you cannot escape the lines, the dirt and the noise. I say all of this to properly set up the importance and promise of San Michel. Clearly a respite in a place that needs escaping from. Whether you decide to book at the hotel or merely visit for a dinner or cocktail, being there will prove to be the highlight and savor of your mis-guided trip the ever-famous, now failing Florence. My suggestion is staying there...but it not be sure to arrive on the veranda in time for a stunning view of the city below and book a romantic dinner at La Loggia...every thing about it will be expensive and in the end you will think it was truly worth it.",5,2014,09,02
04,Absolutely Beautiful!,My husband and I stayed there for three nights as part of our first trip to Florence. It is in a town called Fiesole which is about 15 minutes outside of Florence. There is a free shuttle service from the hotel that runs until about 8:30 at night. We did use cabs for the most part to go into the center of Florence.  The hotel use to be a monastery and is located at the top of a hill which gives beautiful views of the countryside and Florence. There was nothing about this place that we did not enjoy. The staff is friendly and very accommodating. The pool area is magnificent with beautiful gardens and seating areas throughout the property. The room we had was well appointed and had a lovely patio in front with comfortable furniture. The views from the restaurant are fabulous and the food was delicious. I can't say enough about Villa San Michele. I will never forget this place and hopefully will be able to return.,5,2014,08,28
04,Never fails to impress!,"We have just enjoyed our second stay at Villa San Michele with our two children (12 and 15). Having had an amazing experience the first time round a few years ago we were slightly nervous as to whether it might not live up to our memories. Happily we were proved wrong. Everything was perfect. All the reviews talk about the view, which is of course unique , but it is the wonderful service - not too formal and not too casual - and attention to detail that underpins a great  location.  Hospitality is more than a place -  it is the people who  work there who make it a great experience. They even remembered where we had stayed last time and we felt as spoiled as before!
I found the standards excellent everywhere- and I am really fussy! I was baffled by the review that said it was difficult to have a light meal - the buffet at the pool bar is  very light and healthy and the bar at the main restaurant offers sandwiches and snacks. I was even offered  a very simple salad not on the menu as a lighter alternative when dithering over what to have.
As others have said the transfer service to Florence is brilliant; punctual and helpful about where to go - but do go first thing and miss the crowds. 
This is quite simply one of those life enhancing experiences that you should not miss. We will certainly be back!",5,2014,08,26
04,"Wonderful, near perfect and with tweaks would indeed be perfect","We have recently returned from 7 days at VSM with our 2 children (15 and 14). It was wonderful, near perfect and with a few minor improvements could indeed be perfect. The greeting on arrival was absolutely marvellous - warm, friendly, everything one could want; and those checking us in at the front desk did a marvellous job. From there on, it continued to be magnificent. The hotel is as beautifully situated as any I have ever seen, it is stunningly decorated, the gardens and outdoor seating areas are sensational, the pool area is gorgeous, and the dining area overlooks Florence and is breathtaking. The staff are absolutely top quality, nothing is too much for them, and they are always friendly (particular thank you to Michael). The food is very good - although there could be a little more variety in the restaurant in the main menu eg some interesting salads would be good as. My one disappointment was that the junior suite that my wife and I stayed in was just a little tired. It was nothing like the junior suite in the pictures, and was really somewhat disappointing. Having said that, it only marginally diminished the wonders of the hotel and our stay there. We will return on a regular basis, and unequivocally recommend it to anyone. It's very expensive but well worth it for an absolutely wonderful stay.",5,2014,08,25
04,One of life's great experiences,No description will do this justice. You simply must stay at Villa San Michele to understand how incredible this place is. With sweeping views over Florence and staff with incredible attention to detail to ensure your stay is memorable. Eating dinner or breakfast on the covered terrace is a breathtaking experience and with a shuttle to transport you to Florence your every need is met. I guarantee this will be a stay you will remember for the rest of your life.,5,2014,08,07
04,"Good but ,","Ok if you visit  this hotel you will not be disappointed let me assure you. However when you are paying considerable sums none of us should be afraid of requiring the very best because that's why one visits places like this. I ,like most of us ,enjoy the good things in life and am prepared to pay for them so I was maybe being a bit critical but thought the large coffee stain on the sofa in the room and  stained bed cover a bit strange, water dripping from the roof of the bathroom when the bath is run is also disappointing ,poor staffing at the pool with litter on the floor around the sun loungers was also out of keeping.
That said the staff were generally all excellent and will all have undergone the standard top notch training. The location is to die for and the food is truly excellent and I did enjoy the hotel. Would we go again ? yes if i were needing to visit Florence its an interesting place to go,but worry that the reliance on location over old fashioned standards a little worrying.",4,2014,08,04
04,Ridiculously amazing view!,"We went to this hotel on our honeymoon approx 17 years ago and for sentimental reasons, we recently returned with our three children.  The restaurant is still amazing and the rooms are now in need of redecorating.  The grounds and the pool are still beautiful but the pool drinks and food were outrageously expensive.  We loved the soft beds, air conditioned rooms, and black out lined drapery.  We all slept well and felt refreshed enough to take on Florence the next day.",4,2014,07,31
04,What a wonderful property,"This was a our first visit to the hotel and we stayed for 4 nights in mid July, 2 adults and 2 children. We had 2 adjoining suites which were fabulous, each with plenty of space and very comfortable beds!  The shuttle bus to the city centre works really well - if its too crowded, that happened to us only once on 6 trips too and from, then the hotel organise a taxi to take you (at their expense). After the heat and bustle of the city centre the gardens and pool are a welcome haven of tranquillity, not crowded and plenty of space, all with breath taking views of  Florence. 

There is a great outdoor terrace  / garden for pre and after dinner drinks and the main restaurant is in a stunning vaulted terrace at the side of the hotel, and every table has a great view of Florence. The food is good and the staff are very attentive. My only quibble is that I found the menu a little limited and the food perhaps unnecessarily fussy (no simple or 'light' dishes) so that It was a bit of a struggle trying to choose something by the 3rd and 4th night. If you plan to eat 3 courses each night then the half board supplement (‚Ç¨) is a must.  Good kids menu. Lunch menu at the pool restaurant is limited and pricey for what it is.

The front of house staff are great and have a genuine friendliness and passion for their property. Would we stay again?  Yes!",4,2014,07,27
04,Birthday celebrations,"When I was trying to decide what to do for that all so important birthday - did I want a party, or just dinner we friends - well neither hit the button until I decided I wanted dinner with friends here.

The setting is magnificent, and on a hot night in July it was perfect.

The food and wine here never disappoint, and whilst we having a pre dinner drink in the garden, they did there very best to ensure that we had plenty of 'snacks' to keep us going. My husband had arranged a wonderful birthday cake - which was gorgeous. This place really isn't cheap, but for special occasions it's worth every ‚Ç¨",5,2014,07,22
04,absolutely beautiful,Charming sophistication with a spectacular view.  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay.  Next time we would like to attend the cooking classes.  The food was delicious especially the breakfast.  The shuttle to Florence center was convenient.  It was worth staying just above town for the gorgeous view.  Loved it!  Concierge was so helpful too.,5,2014,07,21
04,"Wonderful view, but a little disappointing overall","My wife and I spent 4 nights here as part of an Orient Express 1-week package. We have been to Florence at least annually for the past 20 years and always thought that we would stay at VSM on some occasion, but we have always stayed either in one of the few 5* city centre hotels or in a rented villa in the Florentine countryside.

Our first impressions lived up to our expectations: we stayed in a junior suite separate from the main house which enjoyed its own outside private seating areas with full views of the city. The pool, also separate from the main house area via a series of steps to the uppermost terrace, was set into woods with amazing views of Florence. The food too was delicious. The main strengths of this hotel are (1) the views, and (2) the food.

However, our overall impression is that this is a hotel that is not quite as good as it's reputation suggests. Most of the staff are excellent but attention to detail and anticipation of guests' wishes is better in some of Florence's other top hotels. When we were disappointed to learn that the courtesy shuttle bus only runs between the hotel and Florence until 8:30pm, we were very pleased when the hotel made convenient arrangements for us via taxi. Our main disappointed was that it was not possible to eat from the different hotel menus in each dining area of the hotel, particularly given the prices that are charged for the delicious food.",4,2014,07,04
04,One of the best in the world,"We had high expectations of this hotel and the staff did their utmost to make sure it delivered. It's not inexpensive but then why should it be - it's an experience and a perfect one, and all the staff work tirelessly to make sure it is the best it can be. Go with it, enjoy it and come back refreshed.  ",5,2014,06,30
04,A small corner to escape the world,"It is located on the upper hill with a stunning view on Florence. The place keeps this ancient spirit, you can feel it everywhere. We stayed in a junior suite, a very nice room, enough space, great service, we really enjoyed the dinner at their restaurant. The pools are nicely located in the middle of this abundant cultivated vegetation. It is really worth going there.",5,2014,06,28
04,An Exceptional Experience in Every Way,"We stayed at Villa San Michele for four days in June. It was our second stay there. We were with our daughter, son-in-law, and their one-year old. We had two junior suites overlooking Florence. The experience was exceptional in every way. The staff is warm, friendly, highly competent, and could not have been more helpful. (Before we arrived in Florence, it appears the baby had started to develop conjunctivitis, and when her eyes got puffy on our third evening there, i called the front desk and was told they would have a pediatrician to us in a half hour -- and indeed a half hour later, the pediatrician arrived.) My daughter and her husband, who are foodies, said the dinners were the best they and ever had, and we agree the dining experience is hard to match. Even their more informal dinner option by the pool was outstanding. The rooms, beautiful setting of the hotel, and the facilities (great pool) all combine to make this hotel a gem. We heard from other guests who had just been to the Belmond hotel in Ravello that it too is outstanding, so we plan to try that as well.",5,2014,06,26
04,"The best ""monasteries"" of Italy","Many similarities between this Belmond Villa San Michele of Fiesole and the San Domenico Palace Hotel of Taormina, a distance of nearly a thousand Km also this beautiful hotel is a former monastery and very expensive too, but it is worth all the money it costs.",5,2014,06,21
04,Quirky medieval building with fabulous views of Florence,"This was the Second of three Belmond hotels we stayed at on our 'Grand Tour' of Italy, the others were the Belmond Hotel Caruso in Ravello and the Belmond Hotel Cipriani in Venice.

Transfer from and to Naples rail station were included at the Hotel Villa San Michele when booked on the 'Grand Tour'. The driver met us on the platform, helped us to the car(with free WiFi) and was pleasantly chatty during the 30 minute drive to the hotel.

The welcome at the hotel was like arriving at Downton Abbey with the staff lined up to greet us, very special.

Our room was large and spacious with a private terrace. Doors either side of the bed led into the joint bathroom with massive shower room, bath, wardrobe, the 'usuals' and his and hers sinks.

Florence! wow. Got to go back again again.....
Again, the hotel provided a shuttle bus between the hotel and Florence that ran hourly.
We'd booked a tour of Florence and the Uffizi with Dr. Alessandra Bernabei(see Facebook), you need a guide to point you at the salient pieces or you'll just overload! Alessandra was fabulous, you need to book her!!

The other days we just jumped the shuttle and walked our legs off around the city for hours.

The last day we were transferred back to the rail station.
WiFi and VPN worked fine in the hotel buildings.",5,2014,06,10
04,Fabulous dining experience,"We recently had the opportunity to dine at the Belmond Villa San Michele while spending time in Tuscany. My husband and I have dined there in the past, and loved it.  This visit was just as spectacular and memorable as our past visits. We had a 7 year old in our party and the staff could not have been kinder to her - a shawl when she was chilly, a coloring book to entertain her. The food was excellent and the service superb. I had an asparagus appetizer and the sea bass - just wonderful. All in all a fabulous restaurant in a remarkable location.",5,2014,06,02
04,A wonderful night,"We decided to comemorate our 20th anniversary  with a special dinner on the restaurant of Belmond Villa San Michele, in Firenze. It was a splendid night , full of surprises: a VIP treatment, 1st class food in one of the beautiful places we've visited.",5,2014,05,25
04,Fairy tale wedding,"We were married in the grounds of this beautiful hotel nearly 9 years ago and it was wonderful! Stunning venue, food and drink to die for and the service left me feeling more of a princess than possible! Our then 1 year old was no trouble for anyone and our family and friends still talk about how amazing it was- need to get back for an anniversary visit  and to see the fresco again - thank you.",5,2014,05,24
04,"Worth a Visit, But Not a Stay","The grounds at Villa San Michele are remarkable. The flowers were in full bloom, the citrus trees were beautifual and the views overlooking Florence are spectacular. The service was great, as everyone went above and beyond to make our stay enjoyable. We found the rooms to be a little tired, but we were not surprised by this. The shower was extremely tight compared to other hotels we stayed at on our honeymoon, and we found a huge bug one night. The restaurant is extremely overpriced and the food wavered between pretty good and mediocre. They even charged $15 for a bottle of water! The complimentary breakfast was quite good though. In general, the views, grounds and service are far superior to the hotel itself.",3,2014,05,17
04,A room with a view,"We had a wonderful trip to Villa San Michele - the service was top notch and we were made to feel welcomed from the moment we stepped foot into this beautiful hotel.  The villa is magnificent and the view incredible.  We took the shuttle in to Florence two times during our 4 night stay - to see the PItti Palace, shop and to explore the city and we explored Fiesole restaurants and just enjoyed the San Michele on other days.  This was my third trip to Florence area and I had already enjoyed the high points of art and culture in Florence and was content to simply take in the beauty of Fiesole and this special hotel.  I would recommend staying in Florence for a first-time trip in order to easily see the sites and then possibly add on a few nights at the San Michele for pleasure.  I rate the hotel as excellent and value as average because it is pricey but you are getting an extraordinary experience for the price so value is appropriate. If you are not staying at the hotel but would like to enjoy the ambiance, come for drinks and snacks at the piano bar - this was a high point for my girls (13 and 19).  We were picking up our 19 year old from a semester studying at Villa Le Balze, a Georgetown campus in Fiesole. I look forward to coming back to the Villa San Michele sometime again with my husband and son along too (they stayed home while we traveled this time.)  This would also be a nice get away with a group of girlfriends for special birthday and definitely a nice choice for honeymoon or anniversary trip.  Well done San Michele - hope to visit you and Fiesole again soon!",5,2014,05,14
04,"Lovely hotel location, pity about the restaurant.","A beautiful location, high above the noise of Florence. We had previously stayed in Florence hotels close to the shops and restaurants but this time wanted to try a different approach. The hotel has fantastic views back to the city, room was fine ( but expensive), but the remote location can be frustrating. 
The hotel runs a shuttle bus into the centre of Florence which takes about 20-25 minutes. Not too much of an inconvenience, but a couple of days was enough. The last pick up in the city is 8pm so a taxi is required if you wish to eat in town. Therein lies the problem. For such a fine hotel it's a pity that the restaurant isn't better. A lovely view is not enough. We thought the menu unimaginative and food was uninspiring. It should be much better in a very high end hotel. The attitude of the Ma√Ætre d' on our first night didn't help. He was pushing hard to seat us at a back table despite window tables still being readily available through the evening until we left. Fortunately we insisted & the view of Florence on a fine evening did go some way to offsetting the disappointing food. 
Next time in Florence we'll stay closer to the city. ",3,2014,05,11
04,Historic hotel in beautiful setting overlooking Florence,"Villa San Michele, a historic monastery, is set on a hilltop overlooking Florence and surrounded by lovely gardens. The rooms are spacious and well equipped, many with private terraces, and the staff is highly professional while at the same time very welcoming.Villa San Michele is located approximately 1/2 hour from the centre of the historic district and the hotel offers an hourly shuttle, but this means that you will lose an hour a day  (or twice that if you are dining in town) commuting.
The hotel's restaurant is very good (but not true gourmet quality) and also very expensive (as is the hotel itself). If you are constrained in any way, this is not the place to stay. Otherwise it is a delight and I suspect that many of the quests spend a lot of their time within the hotel grounds.",5,2014,04,08
04,"High level service, attention to details","This is truly an exceptional property, service is first class, the view amazing... You can relax in the gardens or by the pool and be able to reach Florence downtown easily. We'll come back for sure!
Don't miss a Bellini at the Bar!",5,2014,03,23
04,Fantastic romantic hotel,"We have stayed in this Hotel several times. It is wonderful. The last time we stayed there was when Michael Caine was there with his wife and his good friend Michael Winner, who is no longer alive. It is situated in a beautiful country setting overlooking Florence. There is a good hotel shuttle service which takes their guests to and from the centre of this romantic city. The service is excellent. Dining in the enclosed terrace area is very relaxing and the food is good.",5,2014,02,10
04,"Mesmerized: Priceless ""Device Time-out""","In your life, if you are lucky like us, you find yourself so engrossed in a scene or a moment that you ""lose yourself.""  Your brain has taken a ""device time-out"" like a computer that is having issues.  Sitting in La Loggia, the restaurant that is essentially an open air balcony, staring down to Florence and the Domo and some smoke billowing from a house on the hillside-my device took a t time out.  The scene is breathtakingly indescribable and you have to look through the beautiful grounds and bright red flowers around you to even get to that point.  The smell combines fresh flowers and centuries old walls and grounds.  

We got upgrades on our rooms so they were in the hillside with a similar view of Florence.  You have to walk up some substantial stairs so if you have challenges with that - this could affect your room choice.

The wine selection is extraordinary and the food is as good as Italy has to offer.  The service is formal, but not pretentious.  They custom made some entrees for some of us that were on special diets.  I had a pasta, off menu, with various sea food that I want to have again soon and I got help pairing it with an extraordinary Brunello de Montelcino.  Don't be afraid to ask for what you want or be intimidated by the formality.

But my favorite part - the piano player at the back of the restaurant.  We sang fun songs together with our group of 6 while we sipped champagne and toasted my wife's birthday.

I know the 3 days there were expensive - but honestly at checkout - I just folded the bill and put it in my pocket.  That is the highest compliment I can give.",5,2014,02,05
04,Disappointment,"I always wanted to stay at this hotel because of its reputation, but could not justify the cost.  This year we spent one night here when our favorite hotel closed for the season.   The view is beautiful and the room was lovely.  The dining room was a disappointment. We were wedged at dinner between a family with a screaming child and smoking parents and a group of loutish Russians who were smoking like chimneys and totally disruptive of our dinner.  There was no attempt to do anything for us so the dinner, which may have been ok was totally ruined.  Staff was generally professional but impersonal.  At this level I think a hotel should be exceptional and not indifferent.  We agreed we would not be inclined to return.  Hideous mustard colored towels and robes.",3,2013,11,05
04,Very nice stay,"Peaceful with great views and wonderful attentive service. If you don¬¥t care to be away from the center of Florence, this is your perfect hideaway. After staying here and Ritz in Madrid I am becoming an Orient Express fan.",4,2013,10,28
04,Breathtaking!!!!!!!!!!,"This hotel is simply the best!  The staff is so friendly and helpful, they upgraded the in-laws room as well as ours, we were in the garden level suites and I have to tell you the bathroom was larger than most hotel rooms in europe!  we were only here for 2 days but they were the best two days hotel wise of our two week trip!  I highly recommend this hotel if you've got the bucks!  I feel very fortunate to have been able to stay at such a luxury hotel!",5,2013,10,28
04,Heaven on earth,"From the moment we entered the long driveway, lined with trees and lush sculptured shrubs, and welcomed by friendly, attentive staff, our entire stay at the hotel was nothing short of magical. 
The elegantly decorated suite featured the conveniences that you would expect from a luxury hotel. But it was the trimmings for the kids that really made it stand out. The kids were given cute t-shirts and a stuffed toy lion to match the mascot of the kids club, and to match mummy and daddy, they had their own kid-sized slippers and bathrobes. So cute!
The motorised recessed television was neatly stored in the end of the master bed and could be summoned with a press of a button. But the bathroom was definitely the showstopper for the adults. Featuring double marble vanities and an enormous walk-in shower room, it was the largest I‚Äôve ever seen anywhere in the world.
Villa San Michele really captured our attention as they cater for families with a daily kids program called the Smile Club. Running from 10:30am to 5:30pm for 4-12 year olds, it is perfect for parents who desire a little kid-free quiet time or to take a romantic day trip around Florence. Our kids loved it!
Breakfast was served each morning in The Loggia Restaurant, situated on a terrace overlooking Florence. Along with a buffet spread of fresh fruit, cold meats, pastries, yogurts, juices and cereals, a hot breakfast could be ordered from the menu. And the dinner & lunch - to die for!
A convenient complimentary shuttle operated by the hotel transports guests to the centre of Florence and back on a regular basis.
A luxury hotel would not be complete without a lavish swimming pool. In this case, an outdoor heated pool overlooks the terraced garden and scenic Arno Valley.
I highly recommend a stay here, even with the kids it is truly romantic. You can read more and see all our pictures on our blog.",5,2013,10,23
04,Understated elegance with one of the most beautiful views in the world.,"Orient Express do holidays very well, when combining this with the natural beauty of Tuscany and the joys Leonardo and his contemporaries, it makes for a very special combination. When you are stood by the pool or in the lemon gardens looking into the horizon, over the hills and cast your eyes across the Duomo and Florence itself, it feels good to be alive and that you are blessed to be able to experience such a spectacular setting.

The food in La Loggia is excellent and the work of a proud and diligent head chef. The service is very good, particularly thanks to Vittorio, the Food and Beverage manager and Adriano on the front desk. The rooms are classical.

There are other hotels which may have been more recently refurbished such as the Four Seasons and Il Salviatino but the location, charm and history of this converted monastery do make this establishment quite unique. It is great to be able to walk around Florence and amble back to your hotel by foot, gelato in hand. However, a hot Summer's day, the cool breeze across the gardens accompanied by one of Villa San Michele's amazing Bellini's, this is after all the sister to the Cipriani in Venice of Harry's Bar fame, makes for an endearing respite from the heat and the wonders of the city are still only ten minutes away.",5,2013,10,13
04,Phenominal...but 2-3 days max,"The grounds of this 600 year old property are above 5 star. The biggest highlight would have to be dinner outside overlooking all of Florence for an Incredible meal‚Ä¶top5 all time. Rooms in the hotel are small but the suites in the garden are far better but far more expensive so you choose. The reason i say for three days max is because it is annoying getting into town whether on their free shuttle or via taxi....traffic even in this off season was tough. They do their best with a friendly driver, a/c, cold waters etc but split up the trip with a 2-3 days at san Michele and enjoy the property,  pool and restaurant and then book another hotel where you can rollout the door into cafes, museums shops et al. 

To qualify the review I am a 35 year old traveler who has been to 52 countries in my life. I started out on semester at sea in the fall of 1998 and got the travel bug then followed that up with backpacking europe in 2000 for two months. Left those rougher travels behind since 2000 and have saved up to enjoy properties like this one ever since.",5,2013,10,10
04,When you want it to be special....this is it,"This was a big treat for me and I could not have asked for anything more special. The hotel is small in its feel but has many classic facilities. But it excludes style and panache. Nothing is too much trouble. The view from a ""Firenze view"" room is the best ever. Ask for advice at the desk for places to eat in Fiesole as there are some real gems of the most rustic sort. And I think it was J P Morgan who said of his boat, if you have to ask how much then you probably can't afford it!!!!!!",5,2013,10,07
04,Spectacular location,"The location of this hotel atop a hill provides the picturesque panorama of Tuscany and Chianti and is breathtaking.  The grounds are lush and aromatic.  The staff is extremely friendly and want to please.  Dinner overlooking the veranda was magical and the breakfast is excellent.  The Jr suite was to die for.  We were upgraded gratis so if the hotel is not full..ask.  We took a private tour of the Accademia and Uffizi with Mauritzio from Florencepass and he was outstanding. Highly recommend him.  Did not want to leave this 5 star hotel.  FYI, they even have outlets for North American electrical plugs.",5,2013,09,30
04,A aream amongst the clouds,"PHENOMENAL! To find a hotel/resort that can give you the experience of a lifetime is not something that seems possible. The Villa San Michele may be what the Franciscan Monks truly meant it to be, a godsend.

From my family to yours, I Thank You  for making our trip to Italy that experience of a lifetime. For those who wish a more in depth description and reference, by all means leave a contact. I could talk for hours regarding the experience. Five ***** Stars are not nearly enough!",5,2013,09,27
04,Excellent,"Orient-Express do it again! 
 
Excellent hotel, in a great location! 

We have stayed here twice in two years, The service is exceptional and the hotel is fantastic. 

We also stayed at Il Salviatino and still came back Villa San Michele for dinner. The view over looking Florence whilst dining is one of my favourite! 

Would we return, Yes!.....Would I recommend this place, Absolutely!",5,2013,09,25
04,Excellent lunch! Beautiful hotel with fantastic service! Stunning View of Florence.,"My boyfriend and I stayed in Florence city centre and decided to dine for lunch at the Villa San Michele on my parents recommendation after staying there a few years ago. We were absolutely blown away by how beautiful the hotel and gardens were, a true oasis from the hustle and bustle of the city below and the view of Florence was stunning! The service was 5*, we were greeted from our taxi with a huge warm welcome and received excellent table service throughout. The food was a little pricey, which is expected, but we were not disappointed by the quality. A thoroughly enjoyable experience I would recommend to anyone visiting Florence! I'm so pleased we made the trip up.",4,2013,09,02
04,Breathtaking and Soul Restoring,"Bravo guys, you are now my official favourite hotel in the whole of Italy. Perched on the hill overlooking the city of Florence this hotel offers a simply stunning aspect. To go with it you get a brilliant hotel bus shuttle service into the city every 30 minutes.    The rooms are spacious and offer a stunning views.  The service and food in the hotel restaurant was excellent. I appreciated the team work and large menu selection.  Taking either long breakfast on the balcony overlooking the garden or sipping on a Bernini cocktail in the evenings listening to the resident pianists was a great treat.  

Also what impressed me about this hotel was the staff and the guests.  Sometimes when you stay in the up market hotels you find people become very closed off and almost cold. The opposite applies here, where staff and the guests combine to make a relaxing and truly happy vibe.  So many of the people I met had family and had been coming there for years.  More for the family than the honeymooners I think, but if you want to get back after a long day of sight seeing then this is the place. One good sign I found was the genuine happiness of the staff in the morning, even after they had worked the dinner shift the previous day, for 7 days straight.  The staff remembered all the little things you preferred at breakfast, lunch and dinner.   

Well done to one and all at this hotel for making me your guests feel so very special.  I can't wait to return and would highly recommend you to anyone looking to have a soul restoring holiday.",5,2013,08,26
04,A little slice of heaven,"Villa San Michele is a must stay hotel. The staff was extremely friendly, the grounds were beautiful, and the food was exceptional. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to Florence!!!",5,2013,08,18
04,It felt like we were in a movie - best night in Florence!,"We didn't stay at the hotel but made a reservation for dinner on August 10th, known as the night of the ""Falling Stars"". What a night it was - no words can describe te experience we had. Dinner was setup under the stars on the terrace - a baby grand piano played all night and everything from the food to the staff to the service was excellent. If we could have afforded to stay here we would have. What a place! To top it off and to add credibility to the quality of the food - British chef, Nigella Lawson, and her family were sat next to us on the terrace - if Villa San Michele is good enough for her, it's good enough for us!! Views of Florence were also amazing, make the trip and do a dinner here!",5,2013,08,10
04,Wow! Truly Breaktaking,"This was our second stop on our Italian honeymoon. We splurged on this hotel and it was the highlight of our trip. The rooms are large, and the bathrooms have a closet area, large tub, shower and sink area. The building itself and the grounds are absolutely breathtaking. The pool area is stunning and the views of the city below can't be beaten. The service was outstanding and we were greeted by name every time that was passed the front desk. They knew we were on our honeymoon and  surprised us with rose petals, candles, and champagne after we arrived back to our room one evening. The candles and rose petals even continued into the bathroom and his and hers slippers were set out on opposite sides of the bed. We arranged for massages, under a canopy in the pool area. If you are staying in Florence, don't miss this hotel!",5,2013,08,05
04,Classical Italian Luxury,"This is one of my favorite hotels, ever.  Service is absolutely impeccable - I have a lovely image in my mind of jacketed waiters walking across the garden with my bottled water on a silver tray.  The food in the restaurant is excellent and again, the service was great.  (And the waiters were handsome.) Amazing wine.  Large, comfortable rooms.  Perfectly romantic location and public spaces.  Classic luxury.  Highly recommend.",5,2013,08,03
04,Highlight of our Grand Tour of Italy,"Villa San Michelle was absolutely one of the highlights of our ""Grand Tour of Italy"". We stayed there for three days and wished it was longer. The location of the hotel is ideal and offers views of the entire Florence. The staff were absolutely wonderful and accommodating. During our stay, there was some traffic congestion due to roadworks on the road leading to the hotel and as a result, the free shuttle service was late. Instead of being made to wait, a taxi was arranged to take us to Florence for no-charge, a gesture that went down very well with us. The service at the hotel and the restaurant was  impeccable and really enjoyed having dinner at Loggia. Will definitely stay at the hotel on our return trip to Florence.",5,2013,07,21
04,Unforgettable stay,"This is one of the most beautiful places in the world.  Wonderful old world charm.  Breathtaking views of the city.  The terrace where you take most of your meals has an idyllic setting.  If you book in advance you can get a table that juts out of the mountainside, feels like you are floating above Florence.  There is some pressure to be 'elegantly dressed' for dinner but the food is worth it.  All very expensive, but we are excited about going back again some day.  We had a car and drove up but didn't really need it at all, the shuttle is convenient.  All told, it's one of our happiest memories.",5,2013,07,17
04,The highlight of my trip to Florence,"We didn't stay at the San Michele, but one day my friend suggested we go there for lunch.  We arrived by 12 and were invited for a cocktail in the gardens before going to the restaurant for lunch.  It was so beautiful with such outstanding service.  I would consider this paradise on Earth.  During the 3 hours we were there, everybody took care of everything we needed impeccably.  The food was outstanding, as it usually is in Italy, and the service was perfect.  The setting was gorgeous....",5,2013,07,03
04,Classic Italian,"A true Italian classic. San Michele does not wow you with opulent rooms nor does it have amazing facilities however it has romance in abundance. If you want flashy or brand new with gym facilities, this place is not for you.
We had a garden suite which had its own garden overlooking florence. The rooms are a good size but not flashy (of course with an italian price tag). What you get here is career staff who really know how to treat you. We were looked after by Vittorio and his staff like nowhere else before. The restaurant in the summer overlooking the lights of Florence is spectacular. The food again is classical but excellent. The whole place oozes charm, from the frescos inside to the beautiful lemon garden. Having a bellini on the lawn at sunset is one of my favourite memories. It offers the perfect launch pad to visit Florence without being stuck in the sweltering heat of the city.",5,2013,07,01
04,Understated brilliance,"15min drive from the heart of Florence but providing breathtaking views across the City from a secluded and romantic setting in Fiesole. We found it hard to leave the hotel due to the freindly staff, large pool and brilliant restaurant. I will certainly be coming back.",5,2013,06,29
04,A friendly hotel overlooking Florence,All the management and staff were extremely friendly. The service is excellent. Most suites in the main building are great with nice view overlooking the city. Good location outside the overcrowded city of Florence. The cooking class with the very friendly Chef Attilio Di Fabrizio was really a great experience.,5,2013,06,24
04,Elegant and Serene,"We just left the Villa San Michele and had a wonderful experience. The staff was so friendly and helpful that we immediately felt welcome and comfortable. The hotel is in an old monastery that has been decorated beautifully, but without destroying the history. The views from most of the property are a spectacular panorama or Florence. Upon our arrival, we were upgraded to a superior room. The room was furnished nicely and had a lovely marble bathroom. The dining area includes an outdoor covered terrace that feels very magical in the evening---delicious food with stunning views. My husband and I arrived feeling slightly under the weather and the dining staff prepared special items for us to aid our recovery. They made us feel like they truly cared about our well being.",5,2013,06,10
04,Heaven,"When I arrived at the front of the hotel, I knew it was a special place, but when I walked out onto the terraced gardens on the way to our junior suite, I thought that I had died and gone to heaven. Was it the scent of the wisteria that climbs the villa wall or was it the perfect realization of landscape, architecture and design? They run shuttle buses into Florence for guests, but why would you want to leave this place for any reason? This is a destination hotel so the perfect trip would be three days in the city and then three days at the Villa by the pool. Did I mention it is romantic?  And private? And discreet? With perfect service? And great martinis? Did I mention the view?",5,2013,06,09
04,Wonderful Villa with a fabulous staff,"Excellent, excellent, excellent. Expensive, but worth it! The Junior Suites are wonderful. The staff
is fantastic and the GM is the best, caring and attentive. So nice to be out of Florence in season.
Very busy and crowded.",5,2013,06,01
04,Outstanding service and grounds but over priced.,"The first night we were in a junior suite. Very nice. The next night it was booked and we had to move to a regular room. VERY disappointing and over priced!! Tiny and view was of the roof top. We ate almost all our meals at the hotel and all were Fabulous. Mauricio at the front desk was so helpful and provided outstanding service thru out our stay. Our waiter, Dennis and the maitre made our Resturaunt visits fun and offered excellent suggestions. We will return to this property but will be sure to book ahead for the suite. ",5,2013,05,28
04,A destination,"If you have the opportunity to stay at this wonderful villa - you will never forget the experience.
The atmosphere is incredible.  Short jitney ride to Firenze.  Quite expensive but most of the better things in life are.",5,2013,05,12
04,Away from it all!,What a great hotel away from the hustle and bustle.  We had a fabulous room with a huge bathroom that seemed to be built into the side of a hill.  Room 62.... Nice!  When we arrived we had cocktails in the garden.  I could have lounged there for days soaking up the beauty and seeing Florence in the distance.  This was the third Orient Express hotel we stayed in on our trip and it was perfect!,5,2013,05,07
04,lunch at villa san michelle,"We were not staying here,but went for lunch,we were told to pick up their shuttle after waiting thirty minutes we rang and were told that was cancelled, and we had two choices wait for the next shuttle,  which maybe in 30 minutes or take a taxi which we did, no apology then or on arrival,lots of well dressed staff but they had little interest in serving us.The food was unmemorable except for the prices,over 30 euros for carpaccio for a starter! the other dishes were similar needing very little skill to prepare.We decided to take coffee outside and waited a further 30 minutes.Understandably there were only 3 other diners.Sadly living on past reputation in need of a good manager.Hard to understand how they justify these prices.",1,2013,05,07
04,"ƒ∞f this is Villa San Michele,it must be Florence!","The Villa San Michele in Fiesole,one km, from Florence is definitely a destination hotel.This 600 year old monastery has a magnificent loggia where you eat overlooking Florence,above is the hill where Michelangelo tried out out his planeur.Most rooms are in the main building itself,but some are also hidden in the gardens.These rooms have little private gardens.Mine had a white wisteria over it.
The Loggia,the main restaurant is airy though a bit breezy.The manager Mario Novella,runs a tight ship.rare for these luxurious hotels,the Villa San Michele has a fantastic children's programme,ranging from making pizza to visiting Florence on a bike.
There is a shuttle service to Florence for those who might want to leave the hotel!",5,2013,04,29
04,heaven on earth !!!!,"What an amazing property !!!!!!!!!!!! from the terraced gardens with super awesome views ,bursting with tulips and other beautiful flowers, to the rooms with view of Florence to greet you on waking up in the morning, to the comfy mattress with high quality cotton linnen, to the beautifully done up verandah restaurant and bar, impeccable service with the best meet and greet attitude......i could go on and on. Oh !!! cannot miss the Bellinis with fresh peach, made by Dennis !!!!",5,2013,04,24
04,Not worth the price,"We stayed at Villa San Michele for 4 nights on our honeymoon.  The hotel staff was genuinely courteous.  However, the rooms are dated and definitely not worth a 5 star rating.  Our room in particular (#30) had no ventilation, worn furniture, a rock-hard bed and thread bare towels.  If this is Orient Expresse's interpretation of a quality hotel, I would definitely short the stock.  Lastly, dinner at the ""fine dining"" restaurant was poor and the maitre de treated us like second class citizens.  Definitely the worst meal of our trip.",3,2013,04,23
04,Aristocracy and a half,"What a way to stay in Florence! Sitting under the arches of the al fresco dining area, and looking at Florence below, is worth whatever exorbitant price the hotel usually charges for anything. We were extraordinarily well looked after by everyone. The general manager greeted us twice, and all the staff remembered us by name. The pool area is wonderfully laid out and serviced, and the breakfast, served in a magnificent indoor dining room, is literally the garden of plenty. The only criticisms are: beds are super old, mattresses feel like planks of wood. Also, internet service is spotty, as is cell phone reception. But maybe it is all for the best, keeping in character with the hotel's monastic past. Please experience this hotel - it is a wonderfully relaxing time warp, despite some shortcomings.",5,2013,04,20
04,Excellent view on Florence,"Were here for a diner. 
View was excellent. All Florence at a glance.
While food was very ordinary. 
I would not say they have 2 Michelene stars - nothing special.
Very difficult to get by car - no parking.",4,2013,04,19
04,Italy at its Best,"From the time of check in - Adriano so friendly - we were made to feel welcome and at home ...an elegant, not glitzy, yet so comfortable home - being there felt like you were drinking a fabulous bottle of a great older vintage of wine. We had booked a nice room to get beautiful views from the main building but we were upgraded to an even larger and prettier room with a corner view of the hillside gardens as well as Florence. The staff was solicitous and professional, aiming to please and accommodating our special requests at meal time - oatmeal just how I like it. They even arranged with Hertz to deliver our rental car to the hotel. The wine list was wonderful- a deep list of older vintages which we enjoyed at dinner. The terrace is gorgeous and we had breakfast and dinner there. We also had tea/wine in the garden with delicious snacks of chips, nuts, olives in what was truly a spectacular setting. Hor d'oeuvres at the bar- prosciutto, little shrimp, bruschetta - all delicious. Breakfast buffet was great with fresh fruit, dried raspberries!, cereals, wonderful cakes, cheeses, breads, etc. While my fish at dinner was a bit too salty for me, my husband's pasta dishes - gnocchi so light - were outstanding. The bread at dinner deserves special mention as they were freshly made - the little muffin with radicchio was really outstanding. The gym was small but had just enough for a good workout. A large window opened in the gym letting in a wonderful breeze with a to-die-for view. An HD tv in the gym would be nice. The pool setting is spectacular. Free wi-fi made staying in touch easy. Everyone made a point to address us by name, a nice touch. Water offered each time we went out, a power adapter already in the room. Many other really nice touches too numerous to point out. We have stayed in Florence many times at a hotel we love and decided to change it up and stay here. Trip into town was 20 minutes on the hotel shuttle - a simple trip. Coming back to tranquility with a view is wonderful. We are glad we tried a new place. We will be back!",5,2013,04,15
04,Best of both worlds,"For the second half of our trip we headed to the Villa San Michele in Fiesole, a short (20 minute) drive from the centre of town. The grounds of the hotel recall the rustic luxury you come to expect of Tuscan countryside.

The ace up the hotel‚Äôs sleeve is the view; overlooking Florence, the majority of the rooms and certainly the pool offer beautiful vantage points, as does the hotel restaurant. 

A convenient shuttle bus runs hourly between the hotel and Piazza della Repubblica at the heart of Florence, making the villa a perfect option for those who have visited the city before and for whom a stay in greener surroundings is appealing.",4,2013,01,25
04,Extraordinary.,"VillaSanMichele is a gem. From the moment we entered the building to when we drove off, it was flawless. At the check-in, the receptionist showed us couple of room alternatives and ended up upgrading us. The room that we stayed in had a wonderful garden. 

We had both lunch and dinner in VillaSanMichele, which were great. Especially the dinner is a true gastronomic experience with a lot of flavors, and a huge wine list. Again next morning, the breakfast was amazing, loads of very fresh. very delicious  stuff, it was hard to refrain myself from overeating. 

Pool area is absolutely stunning. So calm and relaxing.The hard thing is to choose between staying in the pool for the entire day vs going to Florence.

Indoor spaces are full of character. A lovely, lovely place. we will definitely go back there. In my review i always add some negatives to balance the review out a bit but it is very hard to find a negative about this place. 

Please keep it as it is forever!",5,2013,01,14
04,Beautiful views,I spent an evening at the hotel and we had dinner which in my opinion was Michelin standard. The staff are very attentive and the food was equally fabulous. it was nice to get out of the centre of Florence and experience what I would describe as an amazing hotel with a breathtaking view.,5,2012,11,27
04,Awesome!,"If you want a special place it doesn't get any better than the Villa San Michele.!  The room are very spacious,the bathrooms are the best I've ever been in, and all the people that work here  cater to you. I can't thank Marcello,Adriano,Dennis and chef Attilio and Danielo for making our cooking class so fun and informative.  Can't thank you all enough for making our trip very special!  And did I mention the views of FlorenceWOW!  Everywhere you look is breathtaking.  Xxxooo",5,2012,11,12
04,Fabulous Luxury Hotel,Probably one of the nicest luxury hotels I have ever stayed in. The old world ambiance combined with the beautiful gardens and outstanding view of Florence makes this a once in a lifetime experience.  Ask for the Cardinal's suite for a little bit of a twist for your stay.  The views of Florence are absolutely outstanding.  It is a bit of a distance from the center of Florence but well worth the few extra blocks to get there.,5,2012,11,08
04,The Best Meal In All Of Italy & The Best Service,"If you want the ""most perfect"", ""most romantic"", ""best service"", and ""greatest food"", then make a reservation at the Villa San Michele for lunch or dinner.  The sommeliers do not ""talk down"" to you and the waiters are efficient and not pretentious.  Now to the food:  Everything that came to our table of six was delicious.  The risotto was the best of all and from the fresh and tasty salad to the excellent desserts it was the best of the best.  Cannot say enough in praise of this lovely spot.",5,2012,11,07
04,Magnificent hotel,Wonderful staff. Magnificent hotel with view over Florence. Glorious gardens. A really luxurious hotel with 5 star staff attention wonderful food . Beautiful rooms. Great views over Tuscany luxurious place to stay with amazing service. Would recommend to anyone wanting a luxurious hotel in Florence.great food and service.,4,2012,11,04
04,Amazing...from the first moment you arrive.,"My wife and i had the pleasure of staying a  couple of days just recently in Villa San Michele and considering this to be my 3rd visit to Florence, this has to be the most amazing one by far..

The Hotels is impeccably presented inside and more importantly outside as well as the property is situated in the hillside on a little mountain next to a forest. caters to a discerning customer who appreciates comfort, quality and peace and quiet(apart from the birds) 

The views are unrivalled.

The amenities are quality driven.

Service is amazing from the first step into the property, to attending to our needs, to the complimentary transport to and from Florence centre......amazing.

Definitely will go back again.",5,2012,10,31
04,Unrivaled Luxury and Service.,"We recently had the good fortune of spending a few nights at Villa San Michele and are still giddy over the experience.  From the moment one arrives at VSM and is met by staff, until one (sadly) departs, every possible attention to detail is given in order to make for an unforgettable stay.
VSM enjoys a privileged location in the hills of Fiesole, a charming and quiet town with a fantastic view of Florence below.  The suites are large, airy, elegantly furnished and have private patios.  The bath area was comprised of three rooms: one containing a large tub, surrounded by marble and mirrors, fresh flowers and bath salts, his and her armoires, double vanities, plush towels and the finest Bvlgari toiletries; a separate room was a walk-in shower and the final room contained the commode and bidet.  The bed was blissfully comfortable and adorned with the finest linen sheets, which were changed daily.  Turn-down service was provided nightly and slippers were presented bedside.  Towels and toiletries were replenished twice a day. 
Breakfast at the villa can and should be enjoyed at The Loggia, where one can dine on the beautiful terrace with breathtaking views of Florence. Do have dinner at the villa -  the Tuscan cuisine is fabulous and the service is impeccable. 
Villa San Michele is a former 15th century Franciscan monastery, with a facade attributed to Michelangelo.  (I can't help but think that the monks who once inhabited the monastery are somewhere having a good chuckle over what has become of their cloistered digs.)
I can go on and on singing the praises of this elegant and sophisticated hotel, but in the end, what sets Villa San Michele apart from all the rest is the unrivaled service bestowed upon each and every guest by the discreet and gracious staff.  A special thank you to the General Manager, Marco Novella, as well as to the fabulous Adriano and sweet Sara, for giving us wonderful memories that will last a lifetime.",5,2012,10,16
04,Heaven!,"An amazing stay in an amazing hotel! We went to celebrate our 15th wedding anniversary, and it was everything we could have wished for. As an old Monastery, the hotel has an understated elegance, without the over-the-top frills and bows some 5star hotels rely on.
The staff were lovely, nothing was too much trouble, they seemed to genuinely want you to enjoy every single minute of your stay. Blissful food, wine, views to die for, 100% linen sheets (changed every day), marble bathrooms and sunshine. What more could anybody want?",5,2012,10,04
04,Incredible setting and exceptional service,"We spent a few days in Villa San Michele and I have to say that our stay was absolutely fantastic. By staying there you are able to live Florence ( use their complimentary shuttle to the city rather than drive ) and then retreat to the peace and tranquillity of the Villa at night after a day of walking. We particularly enjoyed the garden with it's splendid view and peace. Service was impeccable and attentive, the staff seasoned and the General Manager, Mr. Marco Novella, a refreshing young and talented manager, was there to ensure our stay was flawless. Many thanks to all the staff for a wonderful stay.",5,2012,10,01
04,The famous house-museum,"Villa San Michele is an Italian landmark, which has worldwide fame. The famous house-museum is located on the outskirts of Florence, near Fiesole.

The exact date of construction of the house-museum is not known, but most scholars are inclined to think that construction began in the first half of the 16th century. At that time, the monastery, which became the foundation for the house-museum has been expanded and completely renovated by Giovanni di Bartolomeo. In 1980 the company ¬´Orient-Express¬ª started a large-scale reconstruction of the building: the work of employees were involved in the Museum of Fine Arts in Florence. In recent years, much attention is paid to the state house-museum is not small money spent annually on the repair of complex Villa San Michele.

It allows the guests to the house-museum, and stunning, the hotel, enjoy the cultural heritage and the real beauty of this magnificent building. The refined architecture Villa San Michele stressed the magnificence of the landscape: the tandem formed by nature and tenderness, while at the same time, the grandeur of an architectural masterpiece. In this regard, the park at Villa San Michele, plays an important role in this composition. Statues, entwined with ivy and moss-covered, are scattered in the garden. The number of objects in the park, executed in marble, stone, mosaic is approximately six hundred fifty-five. Composition of wood, metal, ceramics and textiles - were about six-thirty. Such is the nature that surrounds one of the most popular tourist destinations in Italy. It is worth noting that all these songs, did not meant to attract the interest of visitors: each sculpture - a work of art, with its history, created by craftsmen of different eras, ""living"" in the Villa San Michele for many years.

Today, the walls of the house-museum expositions of various ages, from antiquity to the early 1900s, classical antiquity - Roman, Egyptian and Etruscan. There are archaeological details and frescoes.",4,2012,09,20
04,Not for me,"The views from and the history of VSM are extraordinary (facade by Michaelangelo, no less!) but all else needs work to warrant the price and reputation, in my opinion.
We had two connecting junior suites and both were in need of some modernization and beautification. The AC was glitchy, causing the temperature to flucuate greatly during the night. There was only one light switch for the whole multi-sectioned bathroom (so it was all on or all off with no possibility of a nightlight). The tubs and showers employed a dial to control water temp that was very hard to adjust.  The TVs were embedded in oddly placed, unattractive, table-type things that didn't work very well.  The doors could only be locked from the inside with a key, and the locks were sticky and hard to use. The decor of the rooms in general was old-fashioned and bland. The beds were hard and the sheets were rough.
There's a way to maintain a historical, authetic look and feel while still making things pretty and highly functional.  VSM could learn a lot from the Four Seasons Florence down the road where they have masterfully converted an old palace and convent into a stunning, modern hotel. The rooms at VSM were just not very comfortable or attractive, aside from the gorgeous views.
Oh and the gym was one of ths saddest I've ever seen at a high caliber hotel.  A tiny room filled with flies and bees (fresh flowers in a gym the size of a bathroom don't make sense).
The service was good but not exemplary.  Some folks were very nice (gentleman serving at pool restaurant was wonderful, for example) but many were stiff and unfriendly.  Because we were on our honeymoon, they put candles and ""rose petals"" in our room for us when we were at dinner one night.  A very nice, unexpected treat.  But the ""rose petals"" were made of paper which struck me weird, surprising and a little tacky?
The food was decent but hugely overpriced, especially at dinner.  12E for a bottle of water?!
Speaking of water, the ones in the minibar were also 12E, which seems exorbitant.  And we were charged 6E for the Wall Street Journal, though there was no mention of that cost when we were asked at checkin which papers we preferred.  
We visted many 5 star hotels on this trip to Italy.  VSM had by far the highest room rate and was the only one to charge for water and newspapers.  I don't like feeling nickeled and dimed when I'm spending thousands of dollars a night somewhere.
All in all, it was a rather disappointing stay that did not nearly live up to the cost or the reputation of the place.  We'll happily remain at the Four Seasons next time (an absolutely FANTASTIC hotel in every way).",3,2012,09,12
04,"Great for a romantic getaway, but not for sightseeing Florence OR the ambulatory challenged","It is a beautiful place, no doubt about it.  And the staff were friendly and attentive and the setting magnificent, but we ended up moving to the St Regis after two days instead of the originally booked seven days and were so glad we did - even though we lost a lot of money with the booking, not a very friendly gesture as my companions could not get around the facility due to physical impairments.
If you're the least bit ambulatory challenged, as my companions were, it's the LAST place you want to be.  My companions were unable to enjoy the setting and were pretty much stuck in their suite; one being very afraid of falling (no lifts) and since it's in the hills above Florence, in Fiesole, there are countless levels to contend with.
To their credit, they do provide an hourly shuttle to the center of town, but I taxied in and out at between 25 and 35 euros a trip (it was more to go down into town than up for some reason - perhaps there's a surcharge for getting up the hill? I couldn't figure it out) 
I had no problem getting around and enjoyed my time, but when we got to the hotel in town, I realized how much I had missed being around shops, museums, people, tours, etc., in those two days.

Again, if you're looking for a getaway and not into easily seeing the city and people watching, and you have a lot of money, it's THE place to go  For me that wasn't the case.  I loved the city after I got into it.

The hotel could have been gracious in our obvious situation with one of my party with Parkinsons, the other with a bad knee, but they weren't, which is too bad and speaks poorly of the company's policy.",4,2012,09,11
04,Review for our stay,"my wife and i just returned from a 4 night getaway to Florence where we stayed at the VSM. We must say that we found the hotel to be very warm, inviting and well maintained. the grounds were kept in excellent condition and the buildings/rooms were also in top condition.  compared to many of the hotels we have stayed at during out 5 years of marriage, both my wife and i acknowledge that this was one of the best experiences we have had.  a special thanks to the outstanding concierge Mauricio who spared absolutely no efforts to organise the hot air balloon trip we wanted to do.  the F&B service both breakfast and dinner was also very professional yet not cold. the servers used our names and we always felt important and that they cared.  finally, i would like to mention that we ended up eating every night at the hotel simply because the food was outstanding. the ingredients were all local and the cuisine was simply yet elegant. extremely tasty, making you want to eat more and more.  this is my first review of any hotel but i really feel that one should give credit where credit is due, hence my review above.
i hope this helps anyone that is debating about visiting this hotel.
thanks

04,Breathtaking - Simply Beautiful!!,"Decided to visit Villa San Michele as a dear friend spent her honeymoon there many years ago.  When she heard we were staying close by she said we must pay a visit even for a glass of bubbly as the view of Florence was stunning.  We decided very late in the day to try for lunch. We turned up in our hire car to the most beautiful hotel and location ever!  The concierge came out to greet us and took our key and parked for us and showed us into the  hotel .  It was 2.30 and the restaurant which was on a beautiful terrace was empty and possibly at the end of lunch service but despite this the headwaiter greeted us with such a warm welcome and sat us at a table overlooking the whole of the city of Florence.  The menu was amazing and the selection of wines to compliment were exceptional.  ""Lovely touch was my menu had no prices on as I was the lady of the table - small detail but 5* all the way!""   The food was simply delicious and the sommelier recommended the most wonderful Rose to compliment.  This experience I will treasure for the rest of my life and hope one day to go back and stay!  Thank you Villa San Michele.",5,2012,08,27
04,Perfect getaway.,"Villa San Michele is located in Fiesole (a famous scenic height outside Florence) and it offers one of the most relaxing and most romantic spots I have visited.

This former monastery lies on a hilltop amid lush trees and terraced gardens with fantastic views over the surroundings and Florence. 

Service was perfect and the food just fantastic. Villa San Michele is quite expensive but I must say I have understanding for their rates. It is a one of a kind hotels that you will remember for years to come.",5,2012,08,20
04,Simply PERFECT,"We stayed there for three nights before moving for a couple of nights downtown in Florence. We wish we could still stay there, what a shame! We are really missing everything, the location, the food, the swimming pool, our wonderful junior suite in the gardens and the delicious breaksfasts every morning in our privace terrace. But most of all we miss the staff! The service is simply perfect and we felt like being hosted by our family. Everybody was constantly taking care of us 24/7. We have never felt so pampered in a hotel and we use to travel a lot. We definitely recommend this hotel if you are looking for the right place to relax during a city break, you have both the city and the feeling of being in a resort plus the complete relax. We will come back soon!",5,2012,08,19
04,truly wonderful experience,"We had a wonderful time at the San Michele, my husband was a bit worried when we started up the hill and thought oh no where are we going but he was gobsmacked when we arrived - the views over Florence were amazing.
Our Garden suite was also amazing as were the staff especially Paulo he couldn't have done anymore for us. All the staff were very good - very attentive and pleasant, we will definitely return.",5,2012,08,17
04,Memorable Experience,"For a very long time, I've dreamt of spending a week in a Tuscan villa taking cooking classes. On my recent trip traveling with my 19 year old son, that was not an option.  After researching online, I saw the cookery class at Villa San Michele.  Look at the photos online.  What you see is exactly what you get.  I think even better.  Although I was not a hotel guest for more than a few hours, I was treated with the utmost kindness and sincerity.  As I was waiting for the class, the General Manager, Marco Novella, came over and introduced himself handing me his card and offering his assistance should I need anything.  Nice touch!  As for the cookery class, it was one of the  highlights of my trip. I had a great time while learning to cook three typical Italian dishes (traditional Tuscan panzanella, Fiesole potato dumplings with fresh tomato and basil, tirami su') taught by a super chef of Europe. Chef Attilio Di Fabrizio was so kind and seemed to be genuinely interested in making sure that we had a successful experience.  

After the class, while waiting for lunch on the loggia, we were offered drinks which hit the spot on such a warm day.  My son and sister joined me for lunch and were served the same meal that I had prepared in the class along with a beautiful wine.  We all thought it was the most delicious lunch that we had while in Florence. The service was impeccable.  I hope to return and if so, I would love to stay at Villa San Michele.  The short time I spent there will always be remembered fondly.  It wasn't a week in a villa, but I felt like I was living my dream.  A sincere ""Thank You"" to everyone at Villa San Michele for making my short time there so special.",5,2012,08,15
04,"5 star hotel, 6 star service!","My wife and I stayed for 10 days at this beautiful hotel in a junior suite. The hotel, being an old monastry is quite unique, it's position in the hills gives a fantastic view of Florence from the balcony of the room, from the pool, gardens,  bar and restaurant.  However, the most memorable point has to be the quality of service. From the welcome as we arrived through to leaving All the staff,from front desk to housekeeping were exceptional. Friendly, helpful, polite, professional. Can't praise them enough. We have stayed at several 5 stars in the same Orient express chain, and this had the 5 star quality with something extra made by the quality of service.Truly beautiful hotel with exceptional staff and management. A gem",5,2012,08,15

04,Beautiful hotel with stunning views and excellent friendly staff,"We spent four days at this stunningly beautiful hotel in the hills above Florence and couldn't recommend it highly enough. The loggia restaurant (breakfast, lunch and dinner) has breathtaking views out across the city and the Duomo. A great place for relaxing (pretty terraced gardens lines with lemon trees and geraniums) after a day of sight seeing and its elevated and sheltered position provides a welcome relief from the heat of the city. The swimming pool on the top terrace was a massive hit with my seven year old daughter (and husband!). Staff couldn't have been more welcoming, friendly and engaging and the hotel is very family friendly.",5,2012,08,08
04,Heaven On Earth,"I spent four memorable days at the Villa San Michele in Fiesole, Italy.  Why unforgettable?  I had a suite overlooking the garden with a two hundred and thirty year-old wisteria vine still in bloom outside my window; a terrace table looking down on a jewel-lit Florence for my superb dinners; afternoons in the Fitness Room or the heated infinity pool to work off the rich cuisine; strolls in the scented garden before cocktails.  How does one say it but perfection.  A brief visit by hotel car to clogged Florence had me beating a hasty retreat back to my heaven on earth. We are promised in the Gospel a mansion in the celestial home of angels and saints.  The Villa San Michele makes the transition easy: from one paradise to another.",5,2012,08,05

04,"Awful Service, below average food, great view","My wife and dined at Villa San Michele on July 4th during our honeymoon. We were very excited about the dinner as we have several friends that have stayed at the hotel and absolutley loved it. We were planning to stay at the hotel but since it was our first time in florence, decided it might make more sense to stay in town and just stop by for dinner one night instead. 

We had reservations and we were seated outside with a fantastic view. Unfortunately, everything thereafter was a huge disappointment. 

We both ordered salads and then the Steak for 2 people. Of all the steak i ordered while in Florence, it was by far the least flavorful. Highly disappointing, especially at 100 euros for just the entre (the 2 person steak). It was a complete and total ripoff. To make matters worse, the service could not have been any slower. From the time i asked for our check to the time we finally received the check was 30 minutes. They told us early in the night that to get a cab to the hotel, it would take 15 minutes, so let them know 15 prior to leaving. Once we finally got the check, we asked the waiter to call us a taxi. Fifteen minutes later, we went outside and they had forgotten to call, thus we waited another 15 minutes. 

It was crazy, i would never, ever go back. It ruined our night...And it is too bad, because it is a beautiful hotel.",1,2012,07,23
04,Unfortunately the most unfriendly hotel on our Tuscany trip,"We were guests in Villa San Michele in june 2012 
and had a dinner on the wonderful balcony on the first evening. 
Unfortunately the whole stay was not what it promised 
or what Villa San Michelle is supposed to be famous for. 
Five stars are correct for the environment but 1 star is enough
for service and support service !
First of all the room was not very nice, 
giving us an outlook on several other roofs 
and many cigarette buts in front of our window. 
Also the furniture was a bit dirty and partly splotchy. 
We still cannot imagine how Villa San Michele can charge 
some hundred Euro for that quality of room ? 
Compared (for example) with the Regency Hotel Florence,
where we stayed the nights before, it was a really poor room. 

But what was really more disappointing is the way, the staff 
of Villa San Michele is used to handle any complain: 
They just  ignore it or they let you feel (and let you know) 
that you are incompetent. 
But the dinner topped still topped it: 
We had such an untasty dinner with baby lobsters  for my wife, 
which were really not fresh  (wrong: one was fresh, 
the other one was old, untasty and like rubber). 
For to be true, my wife is surely that kind of woman who knows 
the difference, because ahe eats seafood all over the world, 
where ever we are ! But the waiter ... let me say ... just 
let her feel to be a little bit ignorant and unknowing. 
He said, the kitchen assured to him, that it was fresh 
and he really had the brashness to call a guest a liar. 
Also he was not able to serve a high quality rose wine by 
glass, but try to force us to a bottle 
(my wife dont drink alcohol, so why?) 
We never felt so poor in a restaurant ! 

Second subject: Next morning, we had breakfast (which btw 
was really excellent in quality and selection!!!). The waiter 
advised us a table, which was the only one without pillows 
on the iron chairs. Okay, no problem at first. But the chair was dangerous.
When I stand up to get some breakfast from the buffet, the iron 
chair made a big crack in my shirt,  which is some years old, 
but of an unreproducable quality ... The waiter gave me a pillow 
- after the accident - but again no word of sorry... 
When we checked out, I gave this shirt to the receptionist 
and asked him to repair it and send it to my home address. 
Till today:  No shirt ! No word of regret ! What a wasted moment
of holiday for us all in all...
I will not exclude that other guests have different opinions and 
experiences because the staff was excellent in picking out the 
really rich and important guests, - or what they mean to be like that.",1,2012,07,21
04,Amazing dinner with equally amazing views...,"Was invited to Villa San Michele for dinner with a client, what a sincerely wonderful treat.  The service, meal, atmosphere and view over Florence at night was all absolutely stunning.  Without hesitation I feel I could suggest this place for dinner, lunch, or a fantastic stay.",5,2012,06,07
04,A rare gem of a hotel!,"For those travellers that know Orient Express Hotels, it will come as no surprise that Villa San Michele lives up to everything you expect (and more!) from Orient Express!

I am fortunate, through my work, to spend a lot of time in 5 star hotels but when travelling on vacation  I am notoriously ""picky"" about where I stay. So it was with very high expectations that I travelled to Florence with a friend recently. 

Villa San Michele lived up to it's incredible reputation in every respect. The combination of the location, the hotel itself, the views and the stunning gardens is something in itself. However when you combine that with  excellent service from highly professional and truly welcoming staff, the combination is quite simply unbeatable.

Some reviews question value for money and are negative about prices etc in the hotel. Clearly, the hotel is at the premium end of the luxury hotel market and the prices reflect this. Perhaps it might be argued that the rooms are not the largest and bathrooms not the most glamorous in Europe, but that's not the point. It's the combination of all the unique  elements of the hotel combined the fantastic service, that makes Vlla San Michele so stunning and unique. Treat yourself, go stay at Villa San Michele - you won't regret it!",5,2012,05,31
04,HEAVEN- the view of Florence is breathtaking !,"This hotel's facade was designed by Michaengelo. It was a monestery converted to a hotel. It's a small property- great for weddings, a romantic break, family vacation. The pool has such fantastic views of Florence, its just so beautiful. I stayed at the Executive Jr. Suite- with a terrace , and sweeping views of Florence. 
The restautants are fantastic, the wine cellar just spectacular, service was sharp and attentive. Concierge, GM everyone there, really was super nice and kind. 
The shuttle bus to and back to Florence is a nice touch- or you can always take the short taxi to get away from the hustle and bustle of Florence.",5,2012,05,07
04,A Second Wonderful Stay at Villa San Michele,"I have just returned from my second long weekend at the wonderful Villa San Michele.  My last stay was two years ago and I returned with the same friend this time. We chose to return to the VSM because of the setting, service and breakfast and weren't disappointed this time.  It was just as good as the first and I would give this hotel 10/10.

We booked a room using a special offer and, on arrival, the charming reception staff told us we'd been upgraded to a room with a view of Florence.  Even though we were paying the basic rate there were flowers and a fruit bowl in our room and the view was lovely.  The shower was weak which we asked the hotel about the following morning.  They responded by upgrading us again, this time to a very comfortable junior suite, two flights of steps up to the heated swimming pool and, again, overlooking the city of Florence.  

Breakfast remains a highlight of our visits to this hotel.  There were no less than four types of mozarella available and more varieties of tea and honey than I've come across anywhere.  The dining room staff, like those on reception, are delightful.  They were able to provide us with a full range of gluten free products when we asked if they had any available.

Another advantage of the hotel is their frequent minibus shuttle service to Florence, which is free. The minibus takes and collects guests from outside the Hotel Savoy where guests of VSM are usefully able to store their luggage if they need to.

All in all this is a hotel that deserves its five stars and seems to pride itself on old fashioned service.",5,2012,04,23
04,Simply the Best,"From the concierge to food to the views of Florence below, this hotel rates as one of the best.",5,2012,03,27
04,Stunning romantic hotel,The villa has amazing views over Florence from the restaurant and pool which makes it the most incredible setting.. The rooms are comfortable and staff professional and polite. Only downside is that it is difficult to leave the hotel to go into Florence as it is so nice there ,5,2012,03,13
04,Stunning,"The view takes your breathaway, the bar man makes a fantastic cocktail, the chef cooks a delicious Tiramasu and our room was stunning - if you want to spoil yourself stay here, fabulous.  The hotel even runs a little shuttle bus into town, so when you have had enough of relaxing by the pool you can go into town and explore the sights.",5,2012,01,04
04,VILLA THE BEAUTIFUL -VILLA THE WONDERFUL--VILLA SAN MICHELE!,"If you are looking for a peacfull, authenicly original Florence experience and don't mind paying a little more for it, then the Villa San Michele is a MUST. Its about 20-25 munites out of Florence center city, but they provide shuttle service into the center city.It was a 15th Century Franciscian Monk Monastary nestled in the foothills. As you go up the winding road to the property....be careful your ears may pop. The facade of the property is very ""Old World."" It was designed by Michael Angelo. One of the suites in the main building is called the Michael Angelo Suite....it's comfortable so old world. The furnishing are do ornate and tasful. There are three other structures up from the original building mostly  suites and Jr. Suites  The Chef Lucca, is a Rock Star. Every this is great. They even gave Cooking lessons. You learn to prepare authenic Itailian fare...S0 So GOOD. The views are breathtaking. There are no elevators you walk up to the pool area...you can see forever!!! The staff gives true five star service. The bathrooms are extremely spacious--soaking tube and showers big enoungh for .....many! The art on the walls are great! This property is owned by The Orient Express. I had dinner with the Marketing VP for the Orient Express one evening. Very Italian-Very Personable.  EXPERIENCE THIS PROPERTY!",5,2012,01,02
04,Absolutely breathtaking hotel!,"The Villa San Michele is absolutely remarkable. The grounds are gorgeous and picturesque. The service and the staff were attentive and always greeted us by name. We absolutely loved all of the hotels recommendations and thought the cooking school was a lot of fun. My only negative comment would be that our room was a little small for us despite the upgrade. However, it was incredibly well appointed. The furnishings were beautiful and unique. I highly recommend this property and if you should visit ask the concierge for dinner reservations at Tullio. It was the most incredible meal and surprisingly it was the cheapest restaurant. We were told it is where the chefs eat when they want a great dinner.",5,2011,11,12
04,The most stunning views of Florence,You will be hard pressed to find a more sensational and breathtaking view of Florence. This hill top hotel set into the rocks is incredible. THe garden suites are literally built into the rocks and wit their private patios to enjoy breakfast and the city of Florence they are a must! THe staff are attentive yet discreet and ensure your every request is taken care of with efficiency and speed.  A wake up call followed by fresh coffee in the morning in your room should be a standard in every hotel. The swimming pool overlooking the hotel and the views down to the Duomo makes swimming even more pleasurable!,5,2011,11,04
04,The famous house-museum,"Villa San Michele is an Italian landmark, which has worldwide fame. The famous house-museum is located on the outskirts of Florence, near Fiesole.

The exact date of construction of the house-museum is not known, but most scholars are inclined to think that construction began in the first half of the 16th century. At that time, the monastery, which became the foundation for the house-museum has been expanded and completely renovated by Giovanni di Bartolomeo. In 1980 the company ¬´Orient-Express¬ª started a large-scale reconstruction of the building: the work of employees were involved in the Museum of Fine Arts in Florence. In recent years, much attention is paid to the state house-museum is not small money spent annually on the repair of complex Villa San Michele.

It allows the guests to the house-museum, and stunning, the hotel, enjoy the cultural heritage and the real beauty of this magnificent building. The refined architecture Villa San Michele stressed the magnificence of the landscape: the tandem formed by nature and tenderness, while at the same time, the grandeur of an architectural masterpiece. In this regard, the park at Villa San Michele, plays an important role in this composition. Statues, entwined with ivy and moss-covered, are scattered in the garden. The number of objects in the park, executed in marble, stone, mosaic is approximately six hundred fifty-five. Composition of wood, metal, ceramics and textiles - were about six-thirty. Such is the nature that surrounds one of the most popular tourist destinations in Italy. It is worth noting that all these songs, did not meant to attract the interest of visitors: each sculpture - a work of art, with its history, created by craftsmen of different eras, ""living"" in the Villa San Michele for many years.

Today, the walls of the house-museum expositions of various ages, from antiquity to the early 1900s, classical antiquity - Roman, Egyptian and Etruscan. There are archaeological details and frescoes.

Franciscan Monastery of the 15th century, now turned into one of the most amazing, beautiful, European hotels. Just a short drive from Florence, Villa San Michele appears before the tourists, like an oasis of beauty, surrounded by its own gardens and woods on the hills of Fiesole. In addition to the great room, always open to guests, deserves special attention service Villa San Michele: staff have built a reputation, which, now, very proud. Most of these specialists worked at the Villa San Michele for many years, creating a unique system of care, concern and attention to guests hotel ""families"" of the guests. For this reason, tourists regularly come back to, again, to dive into the idyll: delicious Tuscan dining, and superb location, exceptional service and the sun.",4,2011,10,27
04,Overpriced Fawlty Towers in Florence with a view,"This hotel has fabulous views of Florence and staff who are nice but mixed in ability. In every other respect it is a throwback to the seventies, when hotels got away with poor service, rooms and cuisine. When we arrived we were given room 19, which adjoins room 20 & has a view of a wall. It was explained we could upgrade for a price. We quickly realised that the wall was so thin you could hear everything in the adjoining room. The decor is very dated. This room should never be offered in a 5 star hotel, let alone one charging $1000+ a night. After complaining we were given a better room. As the hotel was half full it is unclear why we got this room in the first place. Dinner was a disaster. We asked for a balcony table but arrived to find all were taken. Our waiter & his assistant had 6 tables to look after so service was poor. The food was poor, over salted overcooked veal and overcooked, soggy vegetables the worst example in a restaurant charging over 30 euros for a starter & over 50 euros for a main course. The hotel needs a new chef if this is the best that can be produced. We were overcharged for our wine. We would have complained to the maitre'd but he left early. No one asked if we were happy with our meal. In fact no one enquired as to whether we enjoyed our stay. I won't list the other 2 & 3 star moments. Suffice to say if you are wealthy, lack a discerning palate & do not mind slipshod service, you may enjoy your stay. For everyone else take a car or the number 7 bus to Fiesole, enjoy the views then head back to the living. ",1,2011,10,14
04,OLD ITALIAN SCHOOL,"STRUCTURE: like all the Orient Express was awarded the best location in the hills of Florence, skyline views, landscaped gardens, historic building with annex and church, free parking in front of the hotel, staff ready to welcome you with a smile on your door. Some rooms are located in the main building, others overlook the garden. 
LOBBYING: lovely small lobby in a converted church with an adjoining living room and breakfast room. Great character and charm of Florence arrival. Do not miss. 
ROOMS: The room I was in the main, well-kept, as always with great bath products, bath salts were exceptional. Fantastic view from the bed of all of Florence, the Tuscan-style decor, impeccable cleanliness. Linens smelling fresh. 
RESTAURANT: Located in the lodge is a classy restaurant, the view from here is spectacular, perfect for romantic dinners, or representation. Quality of course good not great and definitely overprice. Discreet table service and fast, always on candle on the table, chairs very uncomfortable highly recommend changing them as soon as it affects a lot of the evening. 
POOL: The pool location privileged in the highest part of the hotel, surrounded by green plants and trees. Swimming pool excellent. 
PERSONAL: friendly professional elegant and very available 
What I disliked: for the first time in the orient express are not treated as a frequent guest, I was not made any upgrades, no welcome note in the room, no bottle of welcome, no fresh fruit, things I've always found in all other Orient-Express Hotels. Although this has left me amazed, I was also very pleased with my room and services. 
OVERALL: Hotel with a capital H",5,2011,09,20
04,absolutely phenomenal but definitely not for those on a budget,"My husband and I just returned from our honeymoon in Florence. We had the good fortune to stay at VSM for an entire week. Our parents had booked us a double room, but upon our arrival, the hotel gave us a complimentary upgrade to a Junior Suite because of our ""special occasion.""

I have stayed in 5-star hotels across the world, and this one does not disappoint. The staff is incredibly friendly and accommodating. They obviously cater to wealthy Americans - most know a lot of English. The views of Florence are just as the website pictures depict. The ambiance is well-suited to both honeymooners and families alike. Usually, this is not the case with high-end hotels. We saw families with 2 or 3 children and also witnessed a man propose to his girlfriend in the gardens.

The bed was comfortable, and the bathroom was lavish, with two separate sinks, two separate ""closet"" areas, a private toilet/bidet, a private shower, and soaking tub. All of the linens were of Frette-quality or better. We were also pleased that the room had an in-room safe. The shuttle to Florence is a HUGE plus. The concierge, Maurizio, is happy to coordinate restaurant reservations and tickets to the museums. When we checked out at 4:30am on the day of our departure, Adrian, one of the front desk staff members, seemed horrified he did not know we were leaving so early and made sure we had coffee before we left - otherwise, they would have prepared breakfast for us.

As far as the food goes, we enjoyed the breakfast spread immensely. It included some of the best meats and cheeses we've ever had. We also dined at the Bar for lunch on a few occasions, ordered room service, and ate dinner at the Loggia once. The food was delicious overall, but the prices are simply outrageous (our ""reasonable"" dinner was over 350 euro.)

The pool is serene, and is apparently one of the only heated ones in Florence. We also took a class at the ""Cookery."" The class was fun, but geared more towards amateur cooks and not true enthusiasts. We came away with delicious recipes and the best tiramisu either of us have ever had.

Overall, our stay was as close to perfect as it could have been. Our main gripes were the outrageous food prices (30 euro for a bowl of pasta) and the fact that the prices on our room bill were higher than the menu stated. We were also told that the DVDs at the front desk were complimentary, but got charged 8 euro per day for each of them. 

If either of us becomes independently wealthy in the near future, we will definitely return!",5,2011,09,07
04,UNFORGETTABLE EXPERIENCE,"I went to Florence with my wife for a couple of days. One friend of mine suggested to go to Villa San Michele. It was really the best choice. Beautiful location, wonderful  building, excellent the service. All employees were nice and professional at the same time. It will be an unforgettable experience for us and we'll be back if we decide to come back to Florence. 
Thanks to evrybody!!!",5,2011,09,03
04,Paradise in Fiesole,"My husbdand and I stayed at Villa San Michele for 3 days end of April 2011.  Perfect experience. Superb place on hills of Fiesole, totally relaxed and quiet and yet only 20 minutes away from City Center by a very convenient hotel car taking you there and back every hour. You spend the day in Florence doing whatever interests you and the evening and night you are on another planet, where you see Florence at some distance but live in the quiet and rarefied atmosphere of a 15th century monastery. 
Concierge service, so useful in deciding the many choices to be made during your day in the City, is top quality.  As are pre-dinner drinks and cuisine (could improve a bit on the desserts, however). 
Would we go back to Villa San Michele? No doubt we will. 
Would we advise our friends to go there? We have done so already and have been thanked for doing so.",5,2011,08,31
04,Beautiful location,"The Vila San Michele is nestled in the hills of Florence and has the most spectacular views of Florence - easily the best I would say. It is enchanting. We stayed for one week with our two children - in the Orangerie House which has been newly refurbished and I can strongly recommend these rooms, as they are perfectly positioned to enjoy the incredible views - the gardens and of course they are newly refurbished and are very nicely decorated in soft creams and golds which are in keeping with the tradition of the hotel.

We used the shuttle to Florence on various occasions (with two young children in the middle of August), there are so many things to do in Florence, this is a service you will be using alot. It is simply excellent, on time, air conditioned with courteous staff providing cold water on our return and a refuge from the hot and busy streets of Florence. It felt wonderful being whisked away after a happy day sightseeing and taken to our retreat in the hills.

It is the perfect combination of a city break with the opportunity to sleep and truly relax in the hills. The rooftop pool is maintained well, peaceful and has incredible views and a little restaurant providing pool service, lunch etc.

The restaurant and the staff were highly trained, but so warm and kind. Always saving our favourite table without asking, including our daughter's highchair - remembering to provide plastic cups. Overall the ambience was lovely, I think listening to the piano and enjoying the beautiful sunsets was one of the highlights for me. The food was good and on occasion very good. The chef made a wonderful mushroom rissoto for me with truffle oil which was excellent and always made such an effort for my children - which I really appreciated. Although I have to say if I were the hotel manager I would be thinking of hiring a world class chef, and attempt to make the restaurant michelin starred - it could easily be once of the most celebrated restaurants in the world given its location.

The gardens were so pretty, and we enjoyed a rather wonderful jazz night with canapes and champagne. Everything felt timeless. This concept is more appealing to us in many ways now, modern life is so busy and rushed.

On the last note, we were a family of four with little children (3 and 6) and I have to say it was a true family hotel - in the sense that our children were made to feel completely welcome and cared for.  They loved playing with fairy Alice some afternoons and enjoyed the pool. The children's menu was well thought out, we appreciated the baby robes and slippers, the DVDs for an hour or two when we needed to be out of the sun and lots of small touches. It is right to have proper beds for the children with crisp linen sheets changed every day (Not always a given sadly in other hotels despite having a five star rating). It is a romantic hotel without a doubt - perfect for couples looking for a weekend away in Florence - the perfect spot for a proposal or some time together.

Overall a gentle, wonderful hotel with a heart with exceptional views and service levels. I would highly recommend this hotel for a stay in Florence. We will most certainly be going back.",5,2011,08,20
04,No longer worth the prices,"Our fith stay at the Villa San Michele, as it use to be be  my wife and my favourite hotel in Europe.   No longer,  since we found out that new recent management has obviously changed a few things for the worse.  

Firstly, the prices are near enough obscene by any standard.  And this use to be just acceptable a few years back as one felt that there was a lot of generosity on their part, especially to regular visitors, as ourselves . We generally were upgraded,  had a bottle of spumante on ice waiting, and quite a few complimentary extras and services.  Not now though, they seem to count every centime.  Just a small bowl of cherries awaited in our room, not even a hand written card for the first time. Water was only put in our room on the first night etc... This may all sound petty on my side, but when you part with 4500euros for three nights, (with one diner),  you expect the moon, not penny pinching measures. 
I will add that the rooms are more than ever in need of updating; they also need to change that ludicrously cheap and tiny television that pops up and down automatically from its cabinet. (impressive 20 years ago no doubt)  And renew the dated fabrics and worn beds. There is a fine line between rustic and shabby

Not surprisingly, I was told by an employee that they found it more and more difficult to find guests who stay more than one or two nights  (hence their so-called third night free offer).  

On the positive side, the breakfast is still the best anywhere, with an enormous choice, and also,  more importantly,  the staff;   they really do an amazingly good job, despite the unfortunate changes in management style.  Also, the beauty of the main areas is timeless.

So I am rather saddened to write a negative review of  a once splendid place, but I feel such critics are constructive when wanting to preserve, or in this case find again what once was a rare jewel of a hotel",3,2011,07,27
04,Wonderful hotel but food and service not up to standard,"We spent 2 nights in the hotel with family as part of a family golden wedding anniversary.  The hotel itself, a 16th century monastery,  is spectacular with panoramic views of the whole of Florence from the gardens and the restaurant.  Our room was on the top floor with convenient access to the pool and terrace and this is where we had our meal on the first night.  The second night we dined in La Loggia restaurant, overlooking Florence.  Although the breakfast buffet was the most comprehensive we've experienced in a hotel, both the dinners were disappointing.  The quality of the food and standard of cooking was not 5-star and the prices unjustifiably high (I have eaten better and cheaper food in restaurants on my home island of Jersey many times).  There were no potatoes or vegetables to speak of and everything, which I know is never piping hot in Italy, was luke warm or cold.  The service was extremely slow and, although we sat down just after 8.00 p.m., we were still eating at 11.20 p.m.!  If you are passionate about food, this is not the place for you.  The staff were very charming, attentive and always available.  All in all, a pleasant experience but a hotel which is clearly catering for a wealthy Amercian market.",4,2011,07,26
04,"Fantastic location, great service, but very pricey","A special hotel for a special trip - my husband and I have just celebrated 25 years of marriage, so we took our offspring to this splendid hotel.  I doubt it can be beaten on views and ambiance (it's a former monastery up in the hills overlooking Florence) and the service was superb.  Pricey, but rather wonderful!",4,2011,07,25
04,Perfect hotel. The best Experience I've ever had at a 5 star hotel.,"The staff is fantastic, they make you feel as if they're so happy to have you be a guest.

Best part about the hotel is that you never feel as if it's crowded",5,2011,07,12
04,Splendido,"Well, this place is amazing and we are so lucky to have stayed here for a second time in less than a year, however this trip was extra special as we were married in Maiano 1km away and spent time before and after our wedding at Villa San Michelle. You will certainly never be disappointed but expect to pay very  high prices as the quality and attention to detail is excellent. Thank you to Victorio and his team for the cocktails we had in the garden the night before my wedding, the guests loved every minute of it and Gabriele on reception thank you for your warm smile and constant help. 

See you all perhaps next year!",5,2011,06,01
04,The gold standard.,"This was my second stay at the Villa San Michele and it exceeded even the very high standard set by the first. Everything - from the beautiful junior suite in the gardens to the exquisite food; the fabulous (and peaceful) pool overlooking Florence; that view; and a staff that is unrivalled in its professionalism, charm and friendliness... everything at this property is nothing short of perfect. I should make a special mention of the cuisine, which is delicious - homemade pastas, gorgeous fresh meat and fish... all top-notch ingredients, expertly cooked and served in a room that must be one of the most elegant spots to eat anywhere in the world. If you're looking to experience Italy at its very best, this is the place to go. Yes, it's expensive, but some things are worth it - and this is one!",5,2011,05,29
04,The Perfect Place For A Surprise Engagement - Exceeded Our Expectations,"I surprised my now fiancee to 5 days at Villa San Michele after months of careful engagement planning as I wanted to find the perfect place for her. Nothing quite prepared me for how beautiful this property was when we arrived and also how friedly the staff were. We were instantly greeted at the entrance by the concierge team - one by one and in person so we knew exactly who was who and who we would need to speak to in any circumstance.
We were staying in a Junior Suite which was very nice, very oldy worldy and simple but Italian chic at the same time. The bathroom was lovely with underfloor heating but at night for some reason alot of the heat seemed to dicipate into the bedroom and we couldn't cool the room down no matter how cold the (noisy) air conditioning was, on top of everything else which was amazing this we could easily overlook and not worry about. The heated swimming pool is very nice with once again stunning views and a great little eating area, we spent pretty much 1 day up there and were the only ones there which makes you fell like you have the Villa to yourself.
The views you get at the VSM are amazing and I mean amazing and nothing quite beats a glass (some nights a bottle) of champagne or a bellini in the garden before dinner, I defy anyone to find a better view! Incidentally, Marco in the bar/garden area was a great guy, very polite, chatty, extremely knowledgeable and highly attentive at all times - thank you, you helped make our time there very memorable.
Moving into La Loggia Restaurant in the evening is extremely elegant but without the stuffiness you might find in 'Fine Dining' restaurants, when you look around everyone is there for the same reason - to enjoy good food and good wine with the people they love whether it be couples or big families and the atmosphere didn't disappoint. We even cancelled two other dinnner reservations at restaurants in Florence as we noticed that people tended to be coming to the restaurant here, so why would we go out? The food is amazing in La Loggia and they have a great chef, the specials changed daily as you would expect and were very diverse, the duck liver foie gras sticks out in my mind as being surprisingly light, as does the suckling pig and the green pasta filled with goats cheese, in fact we didn't have a medieocre meal here in 5 days, all of it was great, including breakfast!
I could go on typing all day about how great this place is, the setting which is so romantic with breathtaking views over the city of Florence, the attentiveness of the staff, the service, the exclusivity all of which were of the very highest standard. A BIG Thank you to Patricia Soriano who helped with my engagement plans and put alot of very special touches in place, like a very nice bottle of wine in our room and yellow and red rose petals on the bed in the shape of a heart. We often stay in many high class hotel chains when we go away - Four Seasons, Fairmont, The One & Only, etc and this was the first time we had experienced an Orient Express hotel, needless to say - this is a new standard, the bar has definitely been raised!",5,2011,05,17
04,"""Top Class and Exclusive Hotel""","We spent 2 nights at Villa San Michele end of July and it was a very nice experience.

We got the chance to be upgraded to a luxurious Garden Suite and the room was quite nice and very comfortable.
We appreciated the large bathroom (bath tube and shower) as well as good bath products (Penhaligon's, Bulgari etc)

Furnitures (sofa, table, carpet etc) are a bit ""old"" but I guess it is part of the history (Villa San Michele is a former Monestary overlooking Florence on a hiltop)

La Loggia Restaurant was very good with an exceptional view. Service was quite ""high class""

The Swimming pool has also a panoramic view and it was a pleasure to dive into it before our checkout.

Front Desk & Concierge staff were very kind and friendly. As late checkout was not possible, they proposed us to move to a ""guest"" room located in the main building after our checkout.

We definitively recommend this hotel for people who are looking for romantic trip as well as high standard service.",5,2011,04,12
04,Where art meets soul...,Tuscany romance at it's best with Michelangelo art and breathtaking scenery. Staff gives a new meaning to the word services. BRAVISSIMI !!!,5,2010,10,24
04,"If I could add more stars, I would!","This hotel villa is a true gem!  We have stayed at many five-star hotels but have never had an experience quite as amazing as the one we had at Villa San Michele.  The property is incredibly beautiful and well maintained.  The staff were unbelievably  attentive, friendly and helpful.  They deserve the very highest rating available!",5,2010,10,21
04,"Great Views, Fabulous Service, Relaxing Stay","My husband and I stayed for three nights in early October, 2010.  We actually stayed the first three nights at the Four Seasons in central Florence and then moved here to enjoy a more relaxing setting.  We stayed in a junior suite (#62) that was built into the hillside above the gardens.  The suite was very quiet and the smallish terrace was lovely for early morning reading.  The suite was more of an over-sized room than a suite with somewhat dated furnishings.  I do not like ""bright and shiny new"" interiors but this was something almost rustic -- and not elegantly Italian rustic.  In fact, the interior is why this hotel has 4 stars and not 5 from this review.  It is just a little odd.

The service, however, is superb.  The staff can't do enough to make you comfortable.  From the minute we arrived they made us feel welcome.  The dining room staff were efficient and friendly, the pool staff just ""appeared"" from no-where with clean towels and the bar staff were spot on with drink recommendations.

My husband and I took the cooking class and had great fun!  The class was small (4 people total) and the chef was hands-on in teaching us.  Fun if you have the time.

We probably would not stay here again just because we like trying different places.  But everyone should give it a try one time!",4,2010,10,10
04,Wonderful place with the friendliest service I've come across,"I stayed at the Villa San Michele with a girlfriend for a long weekend in mid-September.  We both lived in Italy in the past and loved this hotel.  Despite being well known, 5 star and full of American guests, it has retained an old school charm and understated luxury, the result being that it feels very Italian and rather timeless.  The standards are high and the staff delightful.  Nothing was too much trouble.

Our room was in the most basic category but was very comfortable with a large bathroom with bath, shower, wardrobe area and Penhaligons and Bulgari toiletries.  The beds were very comfortable too and we both remarked on how well we slept on the first night.

The views from the Loggia bar and restaurant are lovely.  It is worth booking a table in advance as even in September it was very busy and it isn't a huge space.  The staff in the restaurant and throughout the hotel are charming.  On the first night our flight to Florence had been delayed and we arrived at the hotel at half past midnight.  The receptionist took us straight to the bar to get some supper and we heard him whisper to the barman that it would be nice to ask the pianist to keep playing until we'd finished eating, even though he was meant to go home at 1am.  The barman was very friendly and chatty and made us feel very welcome, even though it was late.  

We liked the food and atmosphere in the restaurant so much that we ate there again for the next two nights of our stay.  I told the staff that I can't eat gluten and they disappeared and came back with different types of warm gluten free bread.  The hotel also has gluten free pasta available and can cook it with any sauce. 

The buffet breakfast was the best we'd ever seen. There was everything you'd expect (cereal, toast, bread etc) but the selection of fruit and yoghurt were huge and on the cheese table there were three different types of mozzarella and even burrata, all served with delicious fresh figs.  We also noticed that there were eight different varieties of honey available!  Everything was included in our room rate, including cooked breakfast.

I would wholeheartedly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Florence or the surrounding area, who doesn't want to stay in the heart of the city.  There is a very efficient minibus service to take guests into Florence which runs approximately every twenty minutes.  On a morning when the bus was full, the hotel booked a taxi for us so that we wouldn't be kept waiting.  I'd also recommend this hotel to anyone who has found the service at other Italian hotels to be on the surly side.  After disappointing summer stays at the Castel Monastero, my visit to Villa San Michele has reminded me that when Italians do service well, they are unbeatable.",5,2010,09,28
04,Amazing oasis overlooking Florence,"Villa San Michele is one of those places that even when you're there seems too good to be true. My wife and I spent part of our honeymoon at VSM and couldn't be happier with our decision to stay there. Upon arrival, we were told that our room had been upgraded from a ""deluxe double"" to one of the suites. We were thrilled because the suites had cost too much for our pretty large budget. The was a spacious corner unit on the 1st floor (2nd floor to most Americans) overlooking Florence on one side and the gardens/cabanas on the other. The suite consisted of a large bedroom, nice living room and an immaculate bathroom with beautiful marble and large bathtub. It was hard for us to leave the room in order to enjoy the rest of the hotel and Florence. 

The hotel offers a shuttle into the very center of Florence, next to the Duomo, every hour and a ride back from the same spot every hour. The ride takes maybe 10-15 minutes, but you enjoy the scenery of Florence the whole way. If you're worried about not staying right in Florence, this shuttle service makes you feel like you couldn't be closer to the center of town. It's also easy to arrange a cab to pick you up at the hotel, but I will warn you that a taxi driver gave us a fake 5 euro bill when we returned from dinner pretty late one night and I didn't notice that it was fake until the next day. Also, when we took a cab to the airport, the driver added several extra charges so that our ride cost 50 euro whereas it had only cost us 30 euro to get there. This might be standard practice in Florence, but I felt ripped off. The hotel can't control the cabs though, so I'm not blaming them at all, just a warning to watch out for the taxi drivers. 

We ate dinner at the hotel one night out of convienence and not wanting to leave the glamorous atmosphere at VSM. It was a good dinner, but we had been spoiled by amazing dinners in Tuscany and Florence, and this was the most expensive dinner we had on our whole trip. So, even though it was a good dinner, I guess the value for the dinner did not seem worth it with sooo much great food in the area at a reasobale price. I'm sure most people that stay here don't care about the value, but I think they can get away with the high prices at such an expensive hotel. The restaurant's atmosphere, however, might make up for the high cost. The open-air restaurant has views of Florence through the archway designed by Michaelangelo, so it's a great experience even with the high price tag. 

I recommend going to the town of Fiesole during your stay. We ate at a restaurant called Fiesolano on recommendation by the hotel and had a great meal for about a third of the cost of the hotel's dinner. We walked to the town center by taking a small, steep footpath with amazing sunset views of Florence. Ask the hotel's concierge about the path, but make sure you are clear on where the path starts (just outside the hotel's gate) because we missed it about four times before finding it. It's not the easiest hike, but it's brief and the views make it worth it if you don't mind a little extra effort. 

VSM is definitely worth it if you are comfortable with the prices! I'll never forget our amazing stay there!",5,2010,09,15
04,Superb......,"Excellent setting ,superb service,charming staff. A top hotel.",5,2010,09,04
04,Perfection,"I have just returned from my holiday with my husband and two younger children (9 and 13) and we spent the first week at the Villa San Michele. I have wanted to stay here for a long time and despite looking forward to it so much, it did not disappoint, in fact it surpassed expectations. Probably the best hotel I have ever stayed in.  Everything about the hotel was faultless and I would (and will) return in a heartbeat.  Dining (and having breakfast) on the terrace is marvellous and despite eating there for 7 nights in a row, the menu is always inspirational with several  'dishes of the day' which are well worth trying.  Thank you to all the staff, headed by a wonderful front desk, for a great start to our holiday.  We will definitely return.  The children had a great time too.  Also, if this is an example of an hotel from the Orient Express group, I can't wait to try some more. Grazie!",5,2010,08,25
04,"Luxury, elegant, romantic charm of Florence",Fantastic service from check in to check out.  Amazing views.  Not cheap but well worth the extra euros for a truly special hotel which you will not forget.,5,2010,07,18
04,The place to stay in Florence,"We stayed here in 2005, but I can't select that year on TA!

I booked a long weekend at the VSM in order to propose to my fiance (and now Wife) and I was not disappointed with that decision - what a truly amazing place - a place we had both wanted to stay at.  I booked flights to Pisa and picked up a hire car and drove into Florence, my fiance had no idea where I had chosen to stay.  When we hit Fiesole and turned right to head up the winding drive to VSM, my fiance spotted a sign for the hotel and couldn't believe her eyes, shedding a tear at the same time.

from the moment you check in, you know this is a special place and very Italian with all it's history.  I booked the room category below a suite on my AMEX, and was automatically upgraded to a junior suite with views over Florence.

The service is typically Italian, the food is amazing and every table has a great view.  We had breakfast on our garden terrace overlooking Florence  - very romantic and the best breakfast I've experienced - fresh eggs, tomatoes, cheese, bread, fruit and parma ham served with Italian coffee.

Lunch and dinner is typically had in the main restaurant and on the famous and often photographed terrace overlooking Florence - again, food is amazing, just don't look at the prices on the ladies menus.

The hotel runs a shuttle service into beautiful Florence if you fancy a change of scene.  The pool is located on the highest terrace, again with amazing views and surrounded by amazing and lush flora and fauna.

I do intend to return perhaps for a wedding anniversary.  It costs a small fortune to be part of this magical place for even a brief period of time, but there are certain places that you must visit during a lifetime, and the Villa San Michele is one of them.  They also have a large herb garden and offer Italian cooking classes - certainly one to try in the future...",5,2010,03,24
04,A luxurious & magical experience,"I absolutely loved this hotel.  I've stayed in some of the loveliest hotels in Italy, and I can say without question that Villa San Michele was my favorite.  Firstly, the setting is remarkable, the views stunning, and the vibe, utterly charming.  We had just spent the last week at the Lungarno and we'd heard of the Villa's lush scenery.  From the minute we arrive we were treated as if we were the only guests there.  We were given the utmost of attention by all the fabulous staff who consistently made it their business to ensure we have everything we needed to make our stay comfortable.  Everyone who worked there, from Managers to waiters to housekeepers were incredibly friendly and lovely.  The food was impeccable (yet pricey), and the rooms were large and comfortable.  I should mention that the design of this Villa is not at all modern.  It's very modest and old world, but very clean and charming.  They also have free internet in the rooms and ALSO outside in the gardens! This hotel certainly isn't cheap, but if you want to treat yourself even for a couple of nights, you will not be disappointed!  This is PERFECT honeymoon hotel!",5,2009,11,13
04,Wonderful Italy,"what an amazing trip! We stayed 5 nights at Villa San Michele at the beginning of october to celebrate our anniversary. We had an incredibe time in Italy, the hotel staff could not have been nicer and always ready to comply with any request. Luca the manager met us on arrival and provided an unexpected free upgrade to a junior suite with private garden with a huge marble bathroom. Housekeeping service was very good.Vittorio the restaurant manager organized an unforgettable private dinner under the star with spectacular view of Florence, the food was great and especially the tagliolini with white truffles.We had dinner also the following day by the terrace restaurant, excellent again,The pool was stunning and had good lunch there. We used the complimentary shuttle to go shopping to Florence, the ride is 20 minutes, it was very efficient.Did not tried the cooking school.We will defenately be back..",4,2009,10,12
04,Fabulous view but....,"I'd like to be really positive about the Villa San Michele but I think that it does not deliver what it should. It is a very expensive 5 star hotel but it seems to be trading on the fact that the view and setting is fantastic and so has lost sight of providing good service. The rooms are nothing wonderful. They are large but the furniture is not particularly nice or even comfortable. The bathrooms are lovely and the Bulgari toiletries are lovely but when I turned on the basin tap I had to wait for some time before the water stopped running brown.  So maybe they need new plumbing. They also have an insect problem. There are mosquitos in the rooms and at breakfast there were dead insects in the stewed fruit and on the pastries. Service was off and on. At times there was no one at the pool to give you a towel or put a cushion on a lounge and you had to do it yourself. One morning at breakfast we were just ignored - no dirty dishes removed or menus offered. If you made any comment to the staff about service faults they suggested the fault was somehow yours. For example we waited 20 minutes one night for a drink that had been ordered and when we asked about it we were told it was because they were squeezing fresh juice for it as they didn't use bottled. It was implied that we were just impatient when it was quite clear they had just forgotten. The hotel has a no mobile phone policy in public areas but this wasn't enforced and everyone seemed to be either on their mobile phones and or taking pictures of themselves, which was annoying and not very relaxing.",4,2009,10,11
04,Everything you would expect,This hotel is expensive but worth every cent!  The view can't be beat.  The staff is very gracious.  The facility is gorgeous.  I can't wait to go back.  Every room is beautiful and the food in the restaurant was fantastic.  Another beautiful Orient-Express property.,5,2009,09,19
04,most beautiful in Florence,"No place in Florence can you get an experience like San Michelle. Ive stayed in many hotels in the city, but staying in Villa San Michelle is a totally different experience. We had the most peaceful stay & couldn't help but continue to stare at the views overlooking the city... just beautiful! The staff was everything you'd expect from a 5 star hotel as every single need is waited on... even if you love being in the city itself the hotel makes it so easy to get back and forth. Nothing beats spending a busy morning in the city and a peaceful afternoon relaxing in San Michelle... perfect combination! if you love Florence but also want to feel like you are relaxing on vacation San Michelle is the place to go.",5,2009,06,19
04,High price and sleepless nights with no A/C and bugs and heat!!,"We stayed in early May and the air conditioning had not been turned on  for the summer.  When we arrived I thought that the heating unit had been left on, the room was so hot.    The temp outside was in the mid 80's and at night we had to keep the windows  open (sunrise around 4:30 am with lots of bugs coming into the room) to get relief from the heat.  Other patrons at the hotel experienced the same discomfort .  Given the price of the room, in excess of 1,000 euros a night, I think that we paid too much.

The meals were expensive given the quality of the food and be sure to get a quote for a taxi,  we spent 40 Euros for a trip that was less than one mile.",4,2009,06,14
04,tradtional italian elegance,"I stopped here for lunch a few years back and decided to stay next time i went.  We stayed in the napolean library suite.  It was very original.  I wouldn't say that the hotel is on par with a four seasons, because it is a different animal.  If you are looking for traditional european elegance with incredible views of Florence this is the place to stay.  very romantic setting.  The staff was sufficient, but not by any means over the top with service.  If you are in Florence for a few nights or even one I highly recommend staying.",5,2009,05,17
04,Breathtaking and Top Notch Service,"My husband and I just came back from spending 5 glorious nights at Villa San Michele.  It was my first tiem to Italy an they made it spectacular!  I envisioned being in the country and in privacy and surrounded by beauty...and that's exactly what I got there.  Our room was magnificent, the staff was very accomodating, our view was out fo this world, and the food and drinks were outstanding.  Some of the best meals I've ever had, and we've dined in alot of fine restaurants.  I highly recommend the cooking class they offer.  We had so much fun, the Chef was great, and the kitchen the class is held is gorgeous!  It's an old greenhouse and while cooking you have an amazing view of Firenze.  It doesn't get any better then this!  This should be a MUST DO on anyone's list.",5,2009,04,25
04,"Fab Service, great location....tiny suite","Second time at this hotel and a pleasure 2nd time around.   The location is fabulous - above the hussle and bussle and heat of florence but only a 20min drive away from the centre.    The atmosphere is very welcoming, the staff are delightful over the top italian....everyone is beautiful, nothing is too much trouble and all make an effort to ensure you have a fabulous stay.   i think the service is probably the best part of this hotel which nowdays has many other fabulous venues to compete with (the one small michaelangelo isn't enough to tempt you to stay here..).    food was very good although not as excellent as i remember.    the pool area and pool lunch bar are fabulous, the freshest of pasta or fish served with a spectacular view and the staff here are probably the best of all.   the two downsides are 1. the cost, it is not worth what you pay and 2. the rooms, they are so small and bog standard ""orient express"".    i stayed with a friend who had been twice before and between us we've stayed in 4 rooms/suites....all small and uninspiring.   we had a junior suite which was probably the size of a superior room in most places.   you pay for the service, the location and probably the michaelangelo.....",4,2008,09,01
04,needs updating,"Me and my partner stayed at Villa San Michele for 3 nights in May 08. 
The hotel is beautifully located on the hillside of Florence but it does need some updating when it comes to furnishings. Our room had a gorgeous view of Florence but knowing how expensive the hotel is the room looks more like a 3,5* than a 5 * hotel costing nearly 1000 euros a night. The bathroom was  nearly as big as the bedroom with 3 different brands of toiletries including Bulgari and Molton brown. Really need some updating though.
We arrived late and were hungry so we asked to order some food when we checked in.. sandwiches (ham/cheese and roast beef) were delivered to our room - 20 euros and 29 euros each.. for sandwiches - no truffles no foie gras.. just plain sandwiches and not even that nice.. incredible! 

Breakfast was served on the terrace with the wonderful view. There is a la carte which also includes the buffet. All very good. Do ask for a latte or cappuchino instead of the nearly cold coffee they put on the table.
 
The hotel also runs a shuttle bus every 20 min or so down to central Florence. Very efficient and punctual - and free of charge :-) Takes about 20 min each way.
Had dinner one night in Florence - wonderful restaurant called la Giostra.. the best spagetti with white truffles... highly recommend. We also had dinner one night in the hotel on the terrace.. very beautiful and romantic. The food is good but over priced for what it is and service is a bit hap hazard.. the hotel staff did remind me a bit of Faulty towers..so willing to please but easily confused. Quite endearing. 
The hotel has got a very nice pool and gardens. 
Highly recommend the outlets outside of Florence - easily reachable by hire car about 30-40 min drive from Florence.. The Prada outlet in particular was excellent and massive. 

It was a nice experience staying at Villa san Michele because of the views.. but i'd rather stay somewhere else next time i go to Florence.",3,2008,06,14
04,Best dessert in the world,Unfortunately we didn't stay at the hotel but I took my husband to Florence for his 40th birthday and booked dinner on the balcony at VSM.  I had spoken with the hotel previously to arrange a special dessert as a surprise.  The hotel was fantastic in helping arrange our special evening.  I chose the Limoncello Souffle to which there was great pomp and ceremony when the dessert came out and deservedly so.  It was outstanding and I have yet to have a better dessert anywhere in the world.,5,2008,03,07
04,Overpriced and out of touch,"If you have more money than sense, and don't mind a trip back to the 1970s, then you'll love Villa San Michele.  If you are under 50, and not yet a millionaire, save your money and look elsewhere.

Our bedroom was as well furnished as my grandmother's. Quality, I suppose, but of another era. The old-fashioned TV rising out of a chest at the end of the bed prompted me to look for a long-haired white cat to stroke.

The restaurant has a fantastic view, but the food was simply good and not what you'd expect for the price. You are, after all, paying for the view.

I recommend staying in Florence and taking a trip up to Fiesole for the views. Take a picnic from Procacci, Via Tornabuoni, if you want fab food up there.

Overall, this place is completely out of touch with modern hotel standards, and needs new owners for a new lease of life.",1,2007,09,30
04,"Beautiful, another world....","I took my boyfriend here for 3 nights for his 30th birthday and had a wonderful stay apart from the first day. We arrived after our flight being delayed for 3 hours and our baggage being badly damaged and ready to relax! The receptionist took us all the way up a winding path to the little chapel and got inside the room and discovered it was the wrong room and guests clothes were in there! After waiting outside for 20 minutes they eventually came back and showed us to the right room in the main building. Later that night we had a 20 minute wait (we asked 3 waiters for menus) just for a drink. i was upset and the receptionist was extremely nice and couldnt do enough. The next day they upgraded us to the Michaelangelo suite (2100 euroes a night) and the meal in the restaurant that night was exceptional. The setting is beautiful - breaktaking view over florence, gorgeous pool and overall good service. Dont go there without money to spend. They booked us in to museum and added a heft booking fee ontop! Great shuttle service to and from town.

04,Simply the Best,"Having read some of the reviews on the Villa San Michele I do wonder if I have been staying at the same hotel. If there is a better hotel with better service in Europe let alone Italy I have yet to stay in it. 

I recently spent a week at the hotel with my wife and two daughters aged 6 and 12. I can not think of anything negative to say about the hotel. On arrival we were upgraded to 2 adjoining junior suites with terraces that had the most wonderful views over Florence. We stayed on a half board package which was very favourable for a couple with two young children. 

The food at the hotel was excellent and the waiting staff as good as it gets. The pool and pool service were also first class. In particular anyone who thinks that the hotel in the Summer is not suitable for well behaved kids is mistaken. The children had a fantastic time and were warmly welcomed. However I am sure that many families would not enjoy this type of holiday.

Yes of course the hotel is expensive but what do you expect? In fact the cost was the same as week spent at the Augustus in Forte Dei Marmi where the rooms were worse than I would expect in a 3 star hotel.
I look forward to returning.",5,2006,08,29
04,An expensive view of Florence,"We have stayed at many of the best and most luxurious hotels in the world, so we have some idea of what we should expect when staying in a 5 star hotel charging from approx. 1000 Euros per night.  However, the Villa San Michele was not up to the usual 5 star luxury standard. Having stayed in 5 star hotels in other parts of Italy, we know that the standard of accommodation and service is often different from other countries and the interiors are mostly on the 'needs to be rennovated' side.  The VSM is a beautiful hotel with the most fantastic view of Florence you could find.  A rennovated 15th century hillside Monestary with a stunning view of Florence is a unique staying experience,  but this is all you are paying for.  The food is not bad, but mediocre.  We expected it to be expensive as it would be at similar hotels of this class, but it was not worth it.  You can get a fanastic meal in the center of Florence for less than 50% of what you pay here and the food is much better.  Again, you are paying for the view.  The accommodation is not bad.  It is quite basic as they seem to keep a traditional Monestary style decor. The pool facilities were good and also the free shuttle service into Florence was good.  The overall service was friendly but often very slow and inefficient. We felt the hotel was very understaffed in all areas.  We had to carry part of our own luggage into reception as there was only one guy on the door who was handling all the concierge requests. We had a good time in Florence, but were dissapointed at the lack of service for hotel of this quality vs. it's peers.
",2,2006,06,27
04,"This is heaven, right?","We stayed at the hotel from May 23 to the 28th.
Where to start?  It was just incredible.  Service was amazing.  Rooms were excellent.  Food to die for.  And the view? Words can't do it justice.

Nothing to complain about at all.  Front desk was great, the towel guy at the pool was attentive (a little boy broke a plate by the pool.  The towel guy goes over & picks the kid up & carries him away from all of the glass, then puts a towel on him...), and even the driver of the shuttle bus to town was great.

If you're going to stay in Florence, do it right.  I know it's expensive, but well worth it.

We've had the pleasure to stay at some of the finest hotels in the world.  This way out-classes the Four Seasons, the Bellagio, Fairmont hotels, etc.

04,Our Version of Heaven,"We just returned from an 8 day trip to Italy, 2 nights at Villa San Michele.  In a nutshell, this place is stunning, romantic, scenic, and everything we ever could have wanted.  We will definitely return as soon as possible.  

We stayed in a Junior Suite, which was spacious, but didn't have a separate sitting room.  Frankly we think those are overrated anyway, and was more than made up for by the huge and beautiful bath.  Moreover, out front of the room was a large, beautiful and private garden with views of Florence and it's famous Duomo.  We spent every spare moment together in the garden.  It was like having our own villa atop a Tuscan mountain.

The grounds are amazing.  First of all, it's a former monastery designed by Michelangelo.  I'm mean come-on, how can you miss that?!  And everything about the main building and the grounds are absolutely gorgeous.  There are flowering vines crawling up the ancient walls, lovely gardens with fruit trees, hundreds of colorful potted plants, manicured lawns as well as overgrown and lush gardens, a pool carved out of the hillside . . .  It's a landscape lovers dream.  The restaurant has an interior room, as well as a long patio overlooking Florence.  Each morning and evening we found ourselves parked at a table on the patio looking down onto one of the most beautiful cities in the world.  As the sun sets, the red roofs and hills change colors and cast long shadows across the valley.  It left us speechless.  And since Fiesole is on a hill overlooking the valley in which Florence is tucked, it gets cool breezes while the town is roasting. 

And the staff was incredible.  The restaurant staff is attentive, helpful, friendly, but reserved.  While some writers have complained about the food for the price, our meals were incredible.  Simply wonderful.  The front desk was perfect.  But our favorite staff member was Maurizio, the concierge, who hooked us up with everything.  Last minute tickets to see David at the Accademia, the Uffizi, a limo through Chianit, a private tour of a 1000 year-old farm, dinner reservations . . .  Since we didn't have but two weeks to plan our trip, Maurizio proved to be priceless for us.  

I have read the other reviewers complaints about VSM, and I simply cannot agree with them.  Some people feel it's for an older crowd or that it was too pricey.  I think they simply felt out-classed by this incredible place.  My husband and I are in our mid-thirties and have the privilege of traveling quite a bit, and to very nice places.  We found that for the money, which was quite expensive, there was great value.  The views, the setting, the comfort, the privacy, the romance, the food, and the impeccable staff were worth every penny.

04,Wonderful hotel,"This hotel is unique.   It is in a fabulous setting with awesome views of Florence.   The gardens are immaculate.   The service is great - attentive at all times without being oppressive.  When the hotel bus was full we were immediately offered a complimentary taxi paid for by the hotel/  The food was very good though not exceptional.  Our room was very nice - again not exceptional.  I liked the rustic furniture but the room was disappointingly small and our bathroom rather cramped.  We had a fabulous view though and we enjoyed the care taken to keep our room serviced at all times.   The pool was wonderful - admittedly up a few steps but gorgeous with views over Florence and excellent poolside service.   I made use of the simple but pleasant gym facilities.  I am surprised that anyone felt that they were packed off to bed as we stayed up partying to the small hours without a hint that we were in any way unwelcome.   Overall the hotel is full of character, in a beautiful setting, with spectacular gardens, delicious food and the best service you could hope for.  We had a magical time there and I would absolutely recommend this hotel to anyone.  Our stay was paid for by my husbands company and I must admit that I would not want to pay the advertised rates.   The hotel while luxurious does not really justify those rates.

04,Historic with views and bugs,"I scanned some of the comments on the Villa San Michele before I wrote this piece (one of them claims to be by a travel writer!) and I wondered if we stayed at the same hotel.  

The villa is situated in the hills of Fiesole with beautiful views across Florence and the valley. The facade of the old monastery building was designed by Michelango and that is the hotel‚Äôs finest feature.  

My wife and I visited in August 2005.  We stayed in a room in the main building on our first night and subsequently in a junior suite in the grounds for the remaining time.

Many of the rooms in the garden area have small semi-private terraces with views of Florence.  Some of the garden ‚Äúcottages‚Äù have private spaces.  The location therefore is ‚Äúpicture postcard‚Äù perfect.  The downside is that the hotel is built into the hillside, so that any rooms in the main building facing the rear have a view of a stone wall a few feet from the window.  No sun permeates this chasm and the rooms with this aspect have very little daylight. They are gloomy and in semi darkness at all times of the day to such an extent that one needs to leave the lights on no matter how bright a day it is outside.   We were offered one of these rooms for the first night of our vacation and paid over ‚Ç¨1,000 for the privilege of staying in it.  They should have paid us!   

I may on a bit of a rant here, but I hate hotels that give you the worst room in the house when you arrive late in the afternoon and think that you should find it acceptable.  Normally this occurs when one is the last to arrive and everyone else has rejected the room‚Ä¶..leaving you to draw the short straw.  On this occasion it was because of a full house and a late booking.  However, they should have told us what to expect.

On our second day we were moved to a junior suite in a terrace of outside rooms set back into the hillside with large (floor to ceiling) front windows, containing a glass door inset into the window, overlooking the garden area.  There are no windows to the rear or sides for obvious reasons.  The glass door opens up onto a small semi private terrace with public walkways to the front of it.  The d√©cor of the room is tired and sparse - the most notable feature and conversation piece being a television that rises out of a box at the bottom of the bed.  The room was furnished meagerly in a rustic manner (as is most of the hotel).  There was nothing comfortable or chic about it.  However, it was very clean.  Although described as a junior suite, it was in reality a slightly larger than average sized bedroom.  For this we paid in well in excess of ‚Ç¨2,000 per night.

As the room was set into the hillside, it gave the feeling of staying in a cave ‚Äì complete with bugs!  The design,landscaping and the setting attract mosquitoes in abundance.  I still carry the scars.
 
Again, because of the hotel‚Äôs location there are steps everywhere.  It is not suitable for someone who has ambulatory problems.  The swimming pool has stupendous views, but it is 90 plus stair-steps up the hillside. There is no lift, so you need to be into hill walking.

The restaurant with its external cloistered balcony has the most beautiful and romantic view over Florence.  The food was average, not of Michelin star quality and nothing like it is possible to experience in France.  Do not stay too late enjoying your companions or sipping wine slowly.  The member of staff left to ‚Äúclose up‚Äù takes a dim view, scowling at the night owls.  

Which brings us to service:  It was polite and pleasant (except late at night, as above) and especially so during the lunch period.  The Maitre de was professional and polished with the demeanor of a ‚ÄúHudson‚Äù and would not have been out of place in Buckingham Palace.  The front of house staff were welcoming, helpful and informative; the only exception occurring when we voiced our resistance to staying in the villa‚Äôs ‚Äúdark room‚Äù for our first night.

Would we go back?  Definitely not.  I value my comforts too much.  And in return for a 5 star price, I expect 5 star accommodation, comfort and service; not an overpriced, mosquito ridden, monastic cell.

04,This is a very special place,"Just returned from our second stay at the Villa San Michele and were delighted to find that it remains a very special place indeed.  Not only is it situated in a perfect location, with breathtaking views of Florence, the place itself is stunning.

We were very well looked after from the moment we arrived and have seldom had such consistently good service.  The restaurant serves dishes of the highest quality and the menu never palls.  We booked a class in the cookery school and had great fun learning to make four classic recipes with the Executive chef - this is a great feature and definitely to be recommended.

Our Garden suite was lovely, well equipped and with a memorable bathroom/dressing room.
",5,2005,10,27
04,Overpriced,"We had a deluxe double in the main building whith an excellent view of Florence.  The sitting room section had been a corridor and the wardrobe, (clothes closet), had no doors and was in the bathroom.  The marble tub was very small.
Excellent service, free minibus to and from Florence, excellent swimming pool and dining.
",5,2005,09,20
04,Wonderful view of Florence but severely overpriced,"My partner and I just returned from a 10 day holiday in Tuscany, 3 nights of which we spent at Villa San Michele.  (For perspective, we stayed our first 3 nights at Locanda dell'Amorosa in Sinalunga outside Siena, and our final 3 nights at Il Pellicano in Porto Ercole.)  Although we enjoyed our stay at San Michele, we can comfortably say that we will never return.

First, the positives: San Michele is quite a stunning retreat outside Florence.  The views from the property over the city are amazing--quite possibly the best views of a city we've experienced anywhere, reminiscent of those from Ellerman House in Cape Town.  The property is also a wonderfully tranquil escape from the city, despite the fact that you are only a 15 min drive into the historic center.  

Now, the negatives: For the money, San Michele isn't worth it, in our opinion.  

We reserved a junior suite and were told we had been upgraded to a nicer junior suite.  For 1600 euro a night, we would expect more from the room.  It was a nice enough room, but for that price we would expect a separate living room and bedroom, which this did not have, and a much bigger bathroom--though by European standards, and considering the historic nature of the property, that may be a bit unfair.  

The restaurant was overrated.  Food was good, but absolutely not worth the outlandish prices charged.  We had dinner there the first night only, and it was unimagineative in our opinions, particularly compared to the wonderful restaurants in town the concierge recommended for our final 2 nights.  (This seemed odd, considering the fact that the hotel has a well-regarded cooking school!)  Despite the formal jacket requirement, they did not require us to wear our jackets, at least--a notable concession for such a stuffy place.  Breakfasts were nice, however, as they would prepare whatever extra dish you requested beyond the wonderful buffet they offered.  

Service was usually very good but a bit stuffy and business-like in our opinion, as noted in a previous review.  As we are in our 30s and 40s, perhaps our relative youth might have been a factor here.  Certainly, we feel that the hotel is more appropriate to an older set in their 50s at the youngest and in their 60s and up on average.  

Basically, we are glad we experienced San Michele but would never return.  For the money, we would get a bigger suite at one of the nicer hotels or villas in Florence with nicer and friendlier service and with better dining options.  If you are considering Florence and feel like-minded, you may consider coming up to San Michele for lunch one day to get the escape without paying for the overpriced rooms and dinner!

04,"Romance, Redefined...","Forget the sandy beaches on the Caribbean, forget the sunset cruises... if you want to experience pure romance, this is your perfect hideaway. Do as I did, book the romantic junior suite in the former Chapel and forget the rest of the world... after two days hidden in your suite, you may as well use the complimentary shuttle and go explore the beauty of Florence at just 10 minutes away. However, we could have spent 5 full days without leaving the resort, between the stunning restaurant, the excellent cooking school and the gorgeous swimming-pool!
",5,2005,08,27
04,Have to try this place at least once,"I just returned from Italy and stayed at Villa San Michele for three nights of our trip.  Overall it was an extremely nice hotel and it is also VERY expensive. We had arranged one of the package deals with a superior room and the staff upgraded us to a junior suite upon arrival at no additional charge. The room was very large especially by European standards and very tastefully decorated. The bathroom was huge having two separate sink areas, a large walk in shower, jacuzzi tub, separate room for toilet and two separate dressing areas.  In the junior suite, there was a very nice terraced outside sitting spot as well.  
In some of the earlier reviews I read, there were complaints about thin walls and hearing others in the next room.  We did not have that problem and there were people next to us all three days.  We did have a 7 year old with us so perhaps we got put in one of the quieter, better insulated, rooms.
The pool area is as nice as any I have been to with a staggering view of the city of Florence and the surrounding Tuscan hillsides.  It is heated, large and has more than ample amount of lounge chairs, towels etc.
Breakfast is included in the room rate and it is an enormous spread with all kinds of fruits, pastries, meats, cheese, champagne, juice, eggs and just about anything else you can think of.   The outside eating area is in a cloistered terrace and overlooks Florence. Its very beautiful.
We did not eat dinner at the restaurant having a child with us as it is very formal. Jackets are required for men most of the year and some had on tuxedos for Saturday evening.
The staff was very attentive to any needs or questions we had however, they are somewhat businesslike and not ones to chat amiably with guests. 
Overall, I enjoyed our stay and am glad we did it once. I doubt that I would go back though as having been to Italy several times, for a similar amount of money, I would rather rent a villa for a week or two in a small rural village.  If you are looking for a beautiful and luxurious place to stay and get treated like a VIP as you tour Tuscany and/or Florence and are will to pay for it, then this place is for you.

04,San Michele is good but not perfection............,"The arrival to VSM is very nice, the location is private and quiet, the views are excellent and importantly, the concierage is simply outstanding.

To dine on the terrace at sunset was very nice.  The food was good but not inspiring and more expensive than desired.

Our main complaint about Villa San Michele was room quality for the money.  We paid ~US$1,000 per night for a room in need of improvement.  The ceiling of our bathroom was decidedly below reasonable standards.  The furnishings were in character but not terribly comfortable.  The view was wonderful!

To sum up, there was much to like about VSM but we would explore an alternative on future visits to the Florence area.  Ciao

04,Stunning,"This is an absolutely fantastic hotel set in an amazing location. Our room was a junior suite in the garden which is set a few yards away from the main house. The room was lovely and it had its own pattio sitting area outside. Excellent all round. Everything about this hotel is first class. The service and the food are top notch and the views and decor are stunning. The shuttle service into Florence is also a major plus. We only experienced one problem and that is the walls are VERY thin in the junior suites and you can hear your neighbours in the adjoing rooms. Something woth considering at the price. However, the hotel is so good in other respects that even this did not spoil our stay. I would certainly stay again.

04,Stay in the Greenhouse Conservatory- Its WONDERFUL,"We stayed here for five nights during our 20th wedding anniversary trip to Italy in September 2004. We reserved a suite & upon arriving were shown a 2 room suite with great views of the dining terrace and Florence, but the walls/floors were very thin and the furniture heavy, not to my wife's taste. We requested another room and were shown the Greenhouse/conservatory that faces the hotel entrance with views of the eastern hills of FIRENZE and FIRENZE itself.

It was a beautiful room and wonderfully decorated with a private terrace.  We loved it and the views from the terrace we fantastic & there are lovely, and I mean LOVELY! garden views from the room.  Another plus is that you are in a stand alone VERY private room.  

The hotel service was superb the concierge very helpful with tickets and tips for Firenze.  The restaurant (despite reviews in some travel guides) was fantastic, the views were wonderful, the ambience, especially at night superb. 

Be warned, the grounds are wonderfully maintained and the gardens beautiful, BUT the terrain is much steeper than the brochures indicate. Be prepared for very steep stairs at almost every turn!
We looked at rooms in the main house, very nice and pretty but very very small, even by EU standards.

The other downside is location.  The location is great for daytripping into FIRENZE. I suggest using the shuttle, but taking a cab back (20 Euros).  Arriving back to this sanctuary after the hustle of FIRENZE is delicious! But, if you are taking trips to Chianti or Sienna the drive back through the eastern reaches of Firenze to Fiesole can be time consuming and harrowing.  My recommendation is to base out of VSM for touring FIRENZE and then head south to stay for touring Chianti or Sienna Volterra etc.  Of course, what I HIGHLY recommend is spending at least one day doing NOTHING but enjoying the ambiance and beautiful views of Villa San Michele (the pool area is NOT to be missed, there is a small restaurant there as well!)
If your pocket book can afford reserve the conservatory & don't forget the pool!!!!!!!",5,2004,10,21
04,"Splendid, Stupendous, Simply Awesome!","This hotel is one of the best, more incredible hotels in the world. And I know, I'm a travel writer. If your budget allows, stay in one of the junior suites. Not only do you have a private patio overlooking all of florence, the bathrooms are large and gorgeous. But everything is beautiful at the hotel. And that doesn't even begin to describe it. Also, the restaurant is a superior dining establishment and should not be missed, not only for the views but also for the food. And now they're offering cooking classes on site with some of Italy's most famous chefs. This place has got be seen to be believed.

04,PERFECTION doesn't accurately decribe it!,"We stayed at San Michele for two nights in Sept., 2003.  Upon arrival, we were dumbfounded by the sweeping view of Florence from the hilltop location in Fiesole. We had reserved a regular double room, which was exorbitantly expensive, but which we were willing to pay for for the experience of staying there. On a whim, upon check in, I asked if they had any suites available, fully expecting to pay the extra price.  After a few moments, we were advised that we were being upgraded to the Michealangelo Suite (Rm. 8), their largest and most luxurious accomodation, for the same price which also included breakfast each day and one gourmet dinner. From San Michele, we were taking a train to Venice.  They advised me that they would return our rental car for us, presented us with the train tickets I had requested via e-mail and offered to drive us to the train station upon our departure from Florence. I thought to myself, now that's service.  I have no anxiety about what could be a complicated departure from Florence, and I haven't even checked in yet.  

With a flourish, they escorted us to our room where, upon entering, you could hear both of our jaws hitting the ground. It was positively baronial! It stretched the entire length of the front of the Villa and measured about 20x60. The ceilings were 17' high, fireplace was big enough for three people to sit in and we had 3 huge windows with unobstructed views of Florence lying below us. Magnificent is an understatement. The bathroom, (actually 2 bathrooms,his and hers) contained a Jacuzzi tub for 4 people. The room was graced with a huge bouquet of fresh lilies and, shortly thereafter, a waiter arrived with a chilled bottle of spumonte and a tray of various cheeses and olives, compliments of the conceirge. We spent about an hour in a daze just sitting around the room wondering what we had done to deserve this before we could bring ourselves to unpack or even think about what to do next.

We had our price included dinner in our room that night. Room service, yes, but an unbelievable dining experience nonetheless. They proceeded to serve us a four course, gourmet dinner complete with linens, china, crystal, silver, white glove service and candlelight in our room. The waiters were back and forth to our room at least 5 times setting up the table and delivering various courses. They piped in classical music and the setting was complete. It was so amazing that I couldn't even concentrate on the food which was marvelous. I felt like I was living a dream.

The next day was spent lounging at the beautiful pool gasping at the grounds, the remarkable views of Florence from every angle and the manicured loveliness of San Michele.  The refined beauty of this place is simply breathtaking and unsurpassed, at least in my experience. Everything was top notch and we actually started feeling strange about the staff continually fawning over us. 

Our room also included a breakfast buffet every morning, or room service. Unimpressed with the breakfast buffets at the other places we stayed, we had our breakfast in our room both days, which was great. However, on the morning we checked out, we caught a glimpse of their buffet. Wow! There were two tables about 20' long each set up with every breakfast food imaginable, and seating on the spectacular loggia overlooking the city and rolling hills beyond. We were so impressed and sorry that we had missed it that we actually sat down and had a second breakfast at the buffet that morning before we left. 

In the end, despite our huge bill, we actually felt like we had gotten the most for our money. I don't know that I will ever have the means to stay here again, but it is surely an experience that I will always treasure and I would recommend to anyone who truly wants to treat themsleves.  A very special place indeed!

04,Sheer Heaven.,"The Villa San Michele is THE benchmark by which all others will now be judged.

Of course the location is wonderful and the main building historic. 

But that's not it. 

Of course the rooms [at least the junior suites] are wonderful and the bathrooms verging on the colossal. 

But that's not it. 

The gardens are wonderful. 

But that's not it. 

The pool is wonderful too. 

But that's not it either. 

The loggia restaurant, of course, is so wonderful it's beyond comparison. 

But even that's not it.

What is it then?

Actually I'm not quite sure, because whatever it is it's much more than the sum total of all of those parts multiplied by two. 

The fact that I'm struggling to describe it evidences the magic. 

It's almost beyond definition.

It is indeed all of these things plus an aura of restraint, exclusivity, privacy and [it doesn't seem to fit, but it's true] warmth too.

The Villa San Michele is in a class of it's own. It is incomparable. 

Hugely expensive, it's worth every last penny. I'd pay double and still say it's a bargain, because it delivers what it promises.

I want to award 10 stars, not a measly 5.

Taking breakfast lunch or dinner  on the terrace affords the most breathtaking views  of the  the beautiful Tuscan hills onto the  ancient red rooftops of Florence in the distance. The room we had with its own terrace was enormous, the T.V. popped in and out of a wooden cabinet at the touch of a button, the bathroom , enormous! Food and service  were faultless.

Poi si entra e si passa attraverso un primo ambiente che in passato √® stato una chiesetta e ancora conserva un altare che mette un po‚Äô di soggezione ma affascina ulteriormente.

04,Un sogno ad occhi aperti,"La catena Belmond sa come prendersi cura dei suoi ospiti.
Prima li ammaglia offrendo scenari mozzafiato e poi li vizia con mille attenzioni.
√à il caso di Villa San Michele di Fiesole, a pochi minuti da Firenze, ospitato nelle antiche mura di un monastero del sec. XVI la cui facciata, si racconta, essere stata ispirata da un disegno di Michelangelo. Nella cappella sconsacrata si trova il lobby.
Le camere, dotate di ogni confort, sono tutt'altro che celle monastiche. Alcune si affacciano verso la valle dove sorge Firenze offrendo allo spettatore una vista ineguagliabile che si apprezza anche dalle molteplici aree di cui dispone l'hotel come la piscina, il giardino a terrazze e il ristorante ""La Loggia"" che merita di essere provato.
Lo staff √® professionale, cordiale e sempre pronto  a soddisfare le richieste degli ospiti. Villa San Michele di dispone di un servizio navetta, a partenze programmate, che collega l'hotel al centro di Firenze (Piazza della Repubblica).

Era un evento privato costato parecchio . La gente per lo pi√π straniera ha dovuto chiedere per ben 4 volte a diversi camerieri un drink che gli e arrivato dopo ben 30 minuti ....lo stesso e valso per mangiare qc. A una signora non volevano darle un gin and tonic a meno che non lo pagasse.. ( nota bene che tutto era gi√† pagato!) e dulcis in fundo verso la fine della serata qc chiede se possono portare dei dolcetti e il cameriere risponde senza nessuna esitazione che era tutto finito!!! e no!!! qs non si accetta neanche da una trattoria figuriamoci da un albergo del genere!!! sconsigliatissimo a mio giudizio per eventi di alto livello!!! ah dimenticavo ... per un caff√® abbiamo chiesto anche l√¨ a 3 diversi camerieri e ci sono arrivati dopo mezz ora due caff√® invece che uno √® sbagliati!!!! ,2,2018,05,09

04,"Man sollte diesen magischen, verwunschenen Ort oberhalb von Florenz einmal aufgesucht haben....","Seit Jahren plante ich nun einen Besuch in der historischen ""Villa San Michele"" oberhalb von Florenz. In diesem Jahr klappte es nun auf unserem Trip durch die Toscana, und wir waren voll begeistert von diesem traumhaften Ort. Jeder Winkel des Hotels strahlt diese unnachahmliche Atmosph√§re der Vergangenheit aus und man wird in eine andere Zeit versetzt. Das Originalgeb√§ude diente Anfang des 15. Jahrhundert den Franziskaner M√∂nchen als Kloster. Im 19. Jahrhundert wurden durch den Amerikaner Henry White Cannon das Geb√§ude restauriert und die wunderbaren G√§rten angelegt (vielleicht erkl√§rt das die vielen amerikanischen G√§ste...?!).
1982 haben die Orient-Express Hotels die Anlage zum Hotel umgebaut, die sp√§ter durch die Belmond-Gruppe √ºbernommen wurde. Diese Kombination aus der fantastischen Lage oberhalb von Florenz, dem alten  restaurierten Klostergeb√§ude mit der gepflegten Gartenanlage und dem Service-Personal auf absolutem Weltstandard sind f√ºr mich un√ºbertroffen. Dann vergisst man gerne den vielleicht zu hohen Preis des Aufenthaltes, aber man muss wissen, was man will..... Der Mittelpunkt des Hotels bildet der wahrscheinlich ehemalige Kreuzgang des Klosters, der zu einem Restaurant (La Loggia Restaurant √ºbergehend in die Bar....) umgebaut wurde. Man sitzt hier t√§glich bei exzellenter Klaviermusik und Ausblick auf Florenz bei einer guten und klassisch italienischen K√ºche und kommt immer wieder ins tr√§umen....Auch das gute Fr√ºhst√ºck am Morgen wird hier eingenommen, so da√ü dieser Ort zu einem wirklichen Erlebnis und Highlight unseres Aufenthaltes wurde... Unsere Junior-Suite war dem heutigen, hohen Standard entsprechend eingerichtet; insbes. das Bad hat uns sehr √ºberzeugt. Es sollte aber nicht unerw√§hnt bleiben, dass sich die Zimmer in einer relativ weiten Gartenanlage auf verschiedenen Ebenen verteilen, so dass man ""gut zu Fu√ü"" sein sollte......In einer absoluten Panorama-Lage hat man den beheizten Pool angelegt. Auch der Pool-Service war auf einem sehr hohen Niveau und hat uns √ºberzeugt. Man sollte diesen magischen, verwunschenen Ort einmal aufgesucht haben, wenn man schon in Florenz ist.",5,2017,10,12
04,Ein Juwel in Florenz,"Die Anlage liegt traumhaft sch√∂n in den H√ºgeln mit tollem Blick auf die Stadt Florenz. Das Fu√üballstadium nimmt den traumhaften Ausblick ein bisschen von der ""Unwirklichkeit"" ;-) Zwei kleine Wermutstropfen sind die darunter liegende Stra√üe, die je nach Verkehr etwas L√§rm macht und dass das wundersch√∂ne alte ""Klosterhotel"" sehr bald im Schatten liegt.
Wir wohnten in einer gro√üen sch√∂nen Suite mit Blick auf Florenz (kostenfreies Upgrade!!) sehr ger√§umig mit bequemen Betten, einem gro√üem Badezimmer mit getrennter Toilette. Auch unser urspr√ºnglich gebuchtes Deluxe Zimmer war wundersch√∂n und gro√üz√ºgig! Man wird mit einem kostenlosen Shuttlebus st√ºndlich (zu gewissen Zeiten auch halbst√ºndlich) mitten ins Zentrum von Florenz gebracht und abgeholt, ohne Voranmeldung. Das ist sehr fein, denn man kann nach einer anstrengenden Sightseeingtour am Pool in herrlich in Ruhe entspannen.  Ganz besonders hervorheben m√∂chte ich die wirklich au√üergew√∂hnliche Freundlichkeit des Personals. Empfangen und w√§hrend unserem Aufenthalt betreut wurden wir vom Reception Manager Adriano mit einer authentischen ungek√ºnstelten Freundlichkeit, wie ich es in Europa noch nicht erlebt habe!!!!  GRATULATION an das Management zu solchen Mitarbeitern!!!
Das Hotelrestaurant unter den Arkaden mit TRAUMBLICK auf die Stadt ist hervorragend - das Service PERFEKT!!! (leider ein bisschen teuer). Doch gibt es  alternativ in der Umgebung zahlreiche tolle Lokale, wenn man sich das nicht jeden Abend leisten m√∂chte.
Die Empfehlung des Reception Managers, das Restaurant Cave die Maiano, erwies sich als absoluter Geheimtipp, wo wir mit ebensolcher Freundlichkeit empfangen und mit hervorragendem Essen bewirtet wurden. 
Wir k√∂nnen dieses Hotel auf jeden Fall f√ºr P√§rchen als auch f√ºr Familien empfehlen!",5,2017,09,07

Meine Frau und ich hatten hier eine unvergessliche Zeit um unseren Hochzeitstag, unterst√ºtzt besonders vom Concierge Mauricio Ammazzi, dem ich stellvertretend f√ºr alle anderen danke. Alle taten das Ihrige  daf√ºr da√ü so manche √úberraschungsidee in die Tat umgesetzt wurde. Aus tiefstem Herzen zu empfehlen.

Il Signor Adriano del Front Office e' entrato particolarmente nel cuore dei miei figli con la sua gentilezza e disponibilit√†. Le camere erano molto raffinate e grandi e vi erano amenities speciali per i miei figli. Abbiamo quasi sempre cenato in albergo poich√© il ristorante √® a dir poco meraviglioso con una vista fantastica su Firenze. La cucina e' semplicemente eccezionale ed abbiamo provato ogni sera pietanze diverse in modo da avere un' idea globale dell' offerta culinaria. Segnalo tra i miei preferiti come antipasto la Cheesecake di mozzarella, come primo lo Spaghettone con Alici e pomodori e come main course la Chianina che era semplicemente unica. Durante il giorno siamo stati nella bellissima piscina riscaldata e ci siamo davvero riconciliati con il mondo. La prima colazione a base di prodotti squisiti fatti in casa ed una selezione di frutta meravigliosa.

Innerhalb kurzer Zeit wurden wir in unser Zimmer im Obergeschoss des Haupthauses gebracht.

Auf der obersten Terrasse ist ein wundersch√∂ner gro√üer Swimmingpool der beheizt ist. Auch hier ist der Service sehr zu vorkommend und der Ausblick atemberaubend. Im Hotel gibt es zwei Restaurants eines am Poll und eines im Haupthaus in dem auch das gigantische Fr√ºhst√ºcksbuffett serviert

Auch eine riesige Auswahl an Landes typischen wie auch exotischen Obstsorten. Wir hatten hier einen traumhaften Aufenthalt und w√§ren gerne noch l√§nger geblieben.

04,"Sereno, tranquilo , un refugio mon√°stico","Belmond Villa San Michele, ubicada a unos 15 minutos del centro de Florencia, sobre las colinas de Fiesole, se despliega desde su port√≥n de hierro forjado , la belleza de este antiguo monasterio , hoy uno de los hoteles m√°s exquisitos del mundo.

Fiesole, el bello desconocido , como lo llaman los locales, es un peque√±o pueblo 700 a√±os m√°s antiguo que Florencia, establecido sobre los recintos de un antiguo asentamiento etrusco.

La construcci√≥n e inmueble original de este √∫nico hotel, monasterio franciscano establecido en el S XV en terrenos donados por una prominente familia florentina - los Davanzatis- cuyo blas√≥n a√∫n se puede apreciar sobre la fachada, atribuida a Miguel √Ångel. 

Con diferentes remodelaciones y adaptaciones que datan desde el S XVI, el monasterio como tal se mantuvo bajo la orden franciscana hasta 1808 cuando Napole√≥n orden√≥ la disoluci√≥n de √≥rdenes mon√°sticas . Durante este tiempo el mismo Bonaparte fue hu√©sped y ocup√≥ la suite Michelangelo - inundada de luz del amanecer al atardecer - se encuentra a todo lo largo de la fachada, sin duda la habitaci√≥n m√°s grande y m√°s rom√°ntica , digna de un emperador.
El gran sal√≥n -enorme- acomoda una cama con baldaqu√≠n y sala de estar, una enorme chimenea  domina una de las paredes, mientras que por sus ventanas se aprecia en la distancia la silueta de Florencia, el Valle Arno y las colinas chianti. 
Uno de los atributos m√°s bellos y dram√°ticos de Villa San Michele son sus jardines: verdes de √°rboles , cipreses erguidos, limoneros cargados de perfume y esencia de rosas. Fue el neoyorquino Henry White Cannon , quien en 1900 compr√≥ la Villa y se dedic√≥ a plantar y desarrollar jardines y construir invernaderos. La Villa fue restaurada al estilo victoriano que incluye el gran port√≥n de hierro de la entrada y se aplic√≥ un tono rojo oxidado a los muros y paredes. 
Durante la 2a Guerra Mundial, La propiedad sufri√≥ considerables da√±os, para 1950
Lucien Tessier adquiri√≥ la misma como su residencia personal. Se aboco a restaurar las 20 habitaciones del primer piso, mientras √©l viv√≠a en el segundo. El costo de la reparaci√≥n y Restauracion result√≥ muy elevado , por lo cual Tessier convirti√≥ a Villa San Michele en un discreto y encantador hotel. 

En 1982, Belmond hotels reconocido por sus propiedades √∫nicas en todo el mundo, su tradici√≥n y excelencia hotelera , adquiri√≥ san Michele . Una vez m√°s , una exhaustiva y minuciosa remodelaci√≥n se realiz√≥, esta vez , con la colaboraci√≥n y asistencia de la Autoridad de Bellas Artes de Florencia. 
En este proceso , se decidi√≥ no cambiar las muy deterioradas piedras de la fachada - dise√±o atribuido a Miguel √Ångel- respetando la simplicidad y la austeridad , m√°s preservando y conservando las piedras de mayor deterioro . 
En el interior la logia, el claustro, la capilla, el refectorio con su imponente mural al fresco ""la √∫ltima cena"" de Ferruccio Nicodemo, no s√≥lo fueron rescatadas , sino integradas a la vida de la Villa. 
Siguiendo el minucioso plan de restauraci√≥n y ampliaci√≥n m√°s habitaciones fueron creadas - 45 en total en todo el hotel- en la terraza del jard√≠n italiano. 6 junior suites fueron a√±adidas en la ladera de la colina y la alberca , siendo sin duda la m√°s impactante el antiguo invernadero ""limonaia"" que se transform√≥ en 2 suntuosas suites.
Las 45 habitaciones  poseen terrazas, patios o jardines privados que ofrecen las vistas m√°s bellas de Florencia. 
Cada una es √∫nica en estilo y decoraci√≥n reflejando los toques locales de la artesan√≠a, cultura e historia. 
Amplias , c√°lidas a la vista, decorados con un claro estilo toscano; techos de vigas y tejas rojas, candelabros de hierro forjado, muebles de madera de nogal o cerezo, espaciosas y sobrias, con destellos de color de los ricas telas y brocados sobre las camas con dosel
El restaurante la loggia  con una arcada de 10, no s√≥lo ofrece la mejor cocina Toscana, sin duda la mejor vista de Florencia 
Villa San Michele la mejor manera de descubrir el desconocido lado de Florencia
Muchas actividades dentro del turismo natural de la zona y un plan de actividades que incluye cocina, recorridos en vespa, ruinas etruscas, valle de chianti

04,Quando la bellezza non ha tempo,"La struttura √® quella di un convento, la loggia, che affaccia su Firenze √® disegnata da Michelangelo
Si accede per una rampa silenziosa e da un viale di ghiaia  limitato da rose e lavanda, e vasi di limone, come da tradizione locale. Dalla loggia stessa si pu√≤ accedere a un'area delimitata da cipressi in cui  vi √® una tranquilla piscina. Dall'ora dell'aperitivo alla cena , la musica √® suonata dal vivo e con garbo. Per la cena √® bene affidarsi ai suggerimenti del maitre: inutile intestardirsi su tigliose chianine se la mattina si son svegliati all'alba per andare all'areoporto a prendere carne argentina.  Bistecche di quel livello  ne ho assaggiate solo nei migliori ristoranti di New York- quelli frequentati da Di Caprio, per intendersi- Di vini hanno ottimo assortimento e la serata non pu√≤ che avere una magnifica riuscita. Le camere, molto belle, son arredate con elegante sobriet√† utilizzando anche la manodopera esperta di artigiani locali.

Il fascino dell'ex convento, il ristorante porticato che si affaccia sulla citt√†, le camere splendide (ho pernottato in una camera grande, bella, arredata con cura, che si affacciava sulla limonaia e vedevo Firenze). Il servizio davvero all'altezza della loro fama, con una capacit√† rara di farti sentire praticamente a casa mantenendo una qualit√† complessiva eccelsa.

Veramente tutto di livello eccellente. Il contesto, la facciata, la vista sono veramente unici. Ovviamente, qualche limite connesso alla struttura antica che pone dei chiari vincoli logistici e dimensionali. Ma tutto √® veramente fantastico. Molto caro, ma certamente giustificabile dalla unicit√† del luogo. Ottimo (e caro) anche il ristorante. Se riuscite a trovare un tavolino nella terrazza all'aperto con la vista sulla vallata, non dimenticherete l'esperienza per tutta la vita. Se non avete problemi di budget, andateci senza dubbio.

-La stanza proiettata a 2 secoli fa
-Quando ci hanno telefonato per dirci che la cena era pronta, abbiamo avuto un sussulto,         come se fossimo passati dall'800 al 20012 in un ''Secondo''
-La nostra camera dava sul giardino dietro-prato verde all'inglese e piante di rose

Vi abbiamo passato di recente un paio di notti ed abbiamo apprezzato, oltre alla bellezza indiscutibile della struttura (la terrazza con vista su Firenze, che meraviglia) la cordialit√† e disponibilit√† del personale, la quiete del posto, l'ottima (e vastissima!) colazione del mattino. Ottimo ed efficientissimo il servizio di navetta per il centro di Firenze. In questo hotel si arriva e ci si sente davvero benvenuti, accolti da persone sorridenti, gentili ed attente all'ospite. Un posto di grande fascino, dove sar√† un vero piacere tornare.",5,2012,11,14
04,Fantastico!!,"Certamente non e' alla portata di tutti (e lo si capisce appena si arriva nel parcheggio) ma altrettanto indubbiamente e' uno dei posti pi√π belli, lussuosi e ben curati che ho mai visto. Il servizio e' ineccepibile e la terrazza che affaccia su Firenze ha un fascino superlativo sia nel porticato che nel giardino curatissimo. 
Anche d'inverno, comunque, trascorrere anche solo una serata a villa San Michele, nelle accoglienti stanze con arredi classici/antichi e con la ""compagnia"" del pianista che allieta la serata, e' veramente incantevole.

La camera, una Junior suite esattamente sotto la piscina, lungo un breve crinale che si affaccia sul giardino dei limoni con vista Firenze, √® una gran bella esperienza, proporzionata alla vastit√† - pi√π che apprezzata -  del suo bagno (credo in totale quasi una decina di mq). il sorbetto al lampone dello chef, seduti a contemplare le luci di Firenze, in una notte di estate, sorseggiare uno ottimo whisky nel giardino odorando il profumo dei limoni, lasciarsi assecondare dalla perfezione del servizio...tutto questo non ha prezzo...per tutto il resto beh, master card, visa, american express fate voi, l'importante che il plafond sia adeguato!!(attenzione!)",5,2011,10,19

Le due notti successive le abbiamo trascorse in una Junior Suite, il bagno grandissimo, la camera abbastanza grande con letto a baldacchino, niente di eccezionale, avevamo una terrazzina privata con vista sul giardino all'italiana e parte di Firenze.
