212,Excellent luxury experience,"We traveled around Ireland and The  Green was the best place we stayed!!! The feeling of luxury and attentiveness from the rooms, breakfast and bar were a 5 star experience, quite similar to the Ritz Carlton.  The location was extremely convenient to restaurants and shops.  
Sophie at the front desk was extremely pleasant, helpful and professional.",5,2024,10,14

The rooms are very comfortable and eco-friendly. The staff were all very friendly and helpful. While not inexpensive, this was a great place at which to finish our Ireland trip.",5,2024,10,13
212,Visit the bar!,"Our stay at the Green was an excellent end to our trip. The location was great for Dublin and the staff was very friendly. The breakfast selection was great. The bonus was the Bar after dinner, we went back both nights to see Thales - an expert mixologist who is very friendly and fun. He definitely elevated our experience!",5,2024,10,11
212,Excellent hotel in Dublin,"Room was well laid out, bed very comfortable. Breakfast area is light and airy with a good selection of food. Hotel is diagonally opposite the park and two blocks from the main shopping area. Restaurants are also close by, though you need to book. Staff were all pleasant and helpful.",5,2024,10,11
212,Our trip to Ireland,"We enjoyed our stay at at The Green Hotel in Dublin. In fact we began our stay at the Green and ended our stay there also. The rooms were clean, spacious , quiet and centrally located. We were within walking distance to attractions, pubs and shopping at Grafton Street.  On our return visit we were greeted (in our room) with a hand written welcome back note and a tray of sweets!  Do very thoughtful.  When our flight back to the US got cancelled, the front staff went out of their way to secure our party of 8 accommodations. ( The Green Hotel was booked but the front staff found us rooms at their sister location, The Alex, which was about 10 minutes away.  The staff also got cabs for our group to get us to the Alex).
Thank you The Green Hotel. You made our stay in Dublin extra special.",5,2024,10,08
212,Great Location and Fantastic Staff!,Great location with an upscale feel at a great price. Large rooms and the beds were so comfortable. The staff and team were so helpful with dinner and tour choices. Every suggestion was perfect. Staying near Stephen's Green made us feel in a safe environment and like we were one of the regulars.,5,2024,10,07
212,Awesome!,"Exceptional hotel near Stephan's Green! Staff were all very knowledgeable and helpful.  We loved our room and the convenient location, nice walk to the Temple Bar district and restaurants! We even walked to The Brazen Head, Darkey Kelly's and Guinness Storehouse.  We will stay at The Green upon our return to Dublin!!",5,2024,10,07
212,Good hotel and walking  distance to everything,"Good hotel close to everything.  Staff very friendly.  Room was nice.  Staff very friendly and breakfast was very delicious and plenty of options to choose from.  Right on St Stephen’s park.  Not sure of parking, but car was not needed. Would recommend if staying in Dublin",4,2024,10,03
212,Highly recommend,"The location, staff, gym, rooms, and everything was just perfect. I have nothing but good things to say. It rained quite a bit on our stay but the staff allowed us to use umbrellas for free which was a lifesaver. The gym is also very good. Highly recommend.",5,2024,10,01
212,Comfortable accommodation with nice esthetic,"We had a wonderful stay at The Green. Located across from St Stephen's Green and 20 minutes walking distance from many major attractions, we were well situated. The room was nicely decorated/outfitted, and very comfortable. One section of the room was just big enough for a canopy bed, and the bathroom was very big. I appreciated that there was a desk chair, an armchair, and an upholstered bench. The continental breakfast was delicious, had a good selection of food, and the quality was excellent. Front desk staff were always very professional and helpful. 

I didn't rate the sleep quality because I suffered from terrible jet lag and my sleeplessness wasn't caused by the accommodation. As for value, it is hard to say as this depends on the cost of the competition and one's budget. If you can afford it and don't mind walking a little bit extra, I'd say go for it.",5,2024,09,30
212,Amazing stay at The Green,"This was the last of 4 hotels on my friend and my trip to Europe. This was definitely the favorite. The hotel was recently renovated and was very nice. The room was a decent size, we ended up on the top floor and even had a small balcony which was cool. The bathroom felt newly updated. Everything was very clean. We did not pay for the breakfast option. Definitely would recommend this hotel. It was off the main roads, so even for Dublin it was quiet and relaxing.",5,2024,09,30
212,A Very Warm Irish Welcome,"We are enjoying a wonderful stay here at The Green. Everyone is exceedingly friendly, eager to help in any way they can. We want specifically to recognize Natalia and Peter in reception, Jonathan and Patrick in the breakfast restaurant, and Louie, Thales, Elcid, and Anna in the lounge. Warm, friendly and engaging at every interaction. I only hope we will be able to come again!",5,2024,09,29
212,Couples trip to Dublin,The hotel is located in walking distance of restaurants and bars. The check-in process was simple and quick. The room was tidy and clean. The breakfast has good selection but the service was slow when ordering from the kitchen. ,4,2024,09,28
212,"Perfect hotel, near all the cool stuff and sustainable too!!","I had the time of my life at this hotel! I got upgraded to a gorgeous top floor with a balcony. I enjoyed the gym, which is super clean and well stocked with everything you need for an incredible workout. I walked to Grafton Street and all over the park which is neighboring the hotel. I walked to lovely restaurants and shops. it is just a highly walkable area. The staff is super kind. The hotel is gorgeous. My room was amazing and the bed is super comfortable.
I loved the Nespresso machine in the room as well as having a kettle. They even surprised me with some lovely chocolates at the end of my stay thank you so much guys. I had the time of my life.",5,2024,09,26
212,Don't think twice about booking,"A perfect location from which to see everything. Great staff (shout out to Tanya and Jessica) and very comfortable beds with down duvets and wool blankets. The on-site restaurant is good as is the adjacent cocktail lounge.
Big plus--American style plugs, no converter needed.",5,2024,09,26
212,Great stay at The Green,"I stayed at The Green for three nights in mid-September with my husband and sister, and I don't have a negative word to say. The front desk staff could not have been friendlier or more helpful; they were even able to find us a place to eat after we returned late from a day trip to Belfast and most things were closed. The rooms are clean and spacious, and the central location makes getting wherever you want to go easy.",5,2024,09,25
212,First Experience in Ireland,Excellent location to walk to everything! Very excellent recommendation for a Coffee Shop from Concierge to the Brew Lab!,5,2024,09,23
212,7 nights in Dublin,"The hotel was clean. The room was great. The bed was comfortable. The staff was very helpful. The location of the hotel was perfect. Close to the airport, city center and Luas. The park was nice to have so close. ",4,2024,09,23
212,city break in Dublin,"My husband and I enjoyed  a great short break in Dublin. We went to see two cricket matches so wanted a centrally-located hotel, with good public transport links. The Green was ideal for us. Friendly and professional staff provided excellent service in this stylish hotel. Our room was in the upgraded annex: very comfortable once we got used to how to find it (up 1 floor in the lift, along the corridor, then up 2 more floors in another lift!). We went out for breakfast as we like a light coffee and a pastry, not a big meal. There was a  big choice of independent and chain coffee shops within 10 minutes walk: same distance to find restaurants, shops, bars and transport links. Having St Stephen's Green on our doorstep was also a big advantage as we enjoyed lovely Autumn sunshine.  A 7 minute walk to the Dublin Express coach stop made getting to the airport easy. There was some late night noise from students going out, but it was Freshers' Week so no big surprise  and things went quiet at a sensible time for such a city centre location. Also, the bed was awesome: huge and comfortable! Thank you, The Green: we will be back!",5,2024,09,22
212,Great place,We stayed at the green for 3 days at the end of our trip and the staff as well as the room was great. Location was perfect to walk anywhere. I would recommend ,5,2024,09,20
212,Central location and great staff,"Hotel is centrally located in Dublin. Excellent staff, very helpful front desk. We had access to the executive lounge which could have had more variety in terms of food choices but still nice. Restaurant for breakfast was good and efficient.
Staff recommended restaurants and spas near by. Little touches like bottled water upon departure was nice. Hotels tend to have the same hardware, it’s the little personal touch that makes you feel welcome. The Green succeeded.",5,2024,09,19
212,Great choice for a Dublin trip,"I’ve stayed here several times over recent years while visiting my company’s Dublin office. Great location and really great staff, from front desk to the restaurants to the team looking after the rooms. Rooms are large and very comfortable.",5,2024,09,18

212,Best business hotel,Very conveniently located for St Stephen’s Green. Beautiful rooms and common areas.  Friendly efficient staff. Needs a bit more fresh fruit at breakfast but otherwise great food and drink. Room had a bit of noise from outside traffic as windows are not perfect with sound insulation. ,5,2024,09,15
212,What more could you ask for,"We have stayed here previously  but this was our first return visit since the hotel was renovated. What a beautiful job they have done. The hotel and the rooms  are gorgeous, with exceptionally comfortable beds. Your every need and more, is catered for in your room  We  received such a warm and friendly welcome from each and every member of staff we encountered.

 A huge variety of fresh breakfast fayre awaits you every morning again with the most caring helpful staff. Nothing is too much trouble.

The reception team are really second to none, even the smallest of issue is dealt with without question. I can honestly say I never walked past the desk once without one of them saying hello and asking if they could do anything for us.  Sophie on the desk is  such a lovely friendly person , her warmth and passion for her job along with her caring nature just shines through, Marcella who is in training will be another great asset to the  already wonderful team. Peter the reception manager is so helpful and friendly he should be very proud  they really are a great team..  

The location is great its very easy to get to all the attractions from here. Stay here you won't regret it.

We can't wait to return in November. 

Thanks for a great stay.

212,A grand place to stay in Dublin!! 5 stars!,"This was the first stop of our 10 day trip of a lifetime to Ireland… and it did not disappoint! We were greeted by a very friendly and efficient staff who were all attentive to our needs. We were exhausted upon arrival and the staff helped us with storage of our bags, a place to freshen up, and a phone call when our room was ready. The rooms are high quality with great linens, coffee and tea bar, mini fridge, and were quiet and comfortable. The breakfast was lovely…. Everything you could imagine with Irish, European, and American options. The food was delicious and the coffee was wonderful! Great location - walking distance to all attractions in the heart of Dublin. The front desk staff was outstanding… Peter and his team took great care of us. I would highly recommend The Green for a great stay in Dublin!",5,2024,09,11

212,"The Green Hotel, what a gem!","We recently stayed at the The Green Hotel in Dublin.  This was our first time to Dublin, but we ended up making a fantastic choice of places to stay.  The front-desk staff was incredible.  A trainee was working the day we checked in, and she guided us to our room (a little complicated depending on which side of the hotelyou stay on).  Another front-desk staff member, provided us a light breakfast a day we had to leave early before the breakfast buffet opened.  Everyone at the hotel was very friendly and accomodating.  It made our stay in Dublin absolutely delightful and we can not wait to go back to this hotel.",5,2024,09,07
212,Gorgeous evening bar - luxurious,"Lovely bar with lovely staff. The Ambiance is so peaceful and the popcorn adds a nice touch :) It's a very chill place to be with luxury and the lighting, staff, welcome drink, pictures and everything about it makes it a truly lovely experience. The aesthetics are beautiful and gives the place such a nice vibe.",5,2024,09,06

The hotel is located close to the city centre and easily accessible by public transportation.",5,2024,09,06
212,Elegant yet warm stay in Dublin,"From the moment we booked our stay, the Green Hotel team made us feel at home. Not only was the location perfect, but the decor is elegant yet cozy in all parts of the hotel. We visited for our anniversary and the team made us feel so special. The booking specialists and the bartenders were notably kind. I recommend staying here for anyone visiting Dublin!",5,2024,09,05
212,Couldn't have wished for more!,"Stayed here with my daughter for 4 nights, and it was nothing short of excellent. The location of the hotel is perfect, about 5 minutes walk from the quieter end of Grafton Street, opposite St Stephens Green. Although the hotel is on a fairly busy road, once you are in the hotel you wouldn't know it, The rooms are superbly sound proofed, in fact we never heard a peep from other guests or traffic ( soft close doors, amazing, why don't all hotels have these!) We had a twin bed room which was beautifully decorated, super comfy beds, and everything you need ( hairdryer, ironing board and iron, Nespresso machine, mini fridge ( which didnt hum and keep me awake!) The breakfast was lovely, huge choice of cooked, pastries, fruit, yoghurts, cereals, smoothies, even a fresh honeycomb!
The staff were super attentive and friendly, and even surprised my daughter with a selection of dainty cakes to celebrate her completing her Masters!
I have stayed in many hotels and I can honestly say that The Green was one of the best I have ever stayed in, I can't wait to visit it again and would highly recommend it. ",5,2024,09,05
212,Dublin City Break,Great location.  Large clean modern rooms.  Friendly and helpful staff.  Great breakfast with egg selection and gourmet coffees provided upon request,5,2024,09,02
212,Great hotel.,"The delux room we stayed in looked newly remodeled. I asked at the front desk and they said it had been remodeled 2-3 years ago. We enjoyed it, it had great air condition (American here) and close to the places we wanted to go. Clean and peaceful, I could have stayed an entire week.",5,2024,09,01
212,Book this hotel!,"We loved the style of the hotel, the staff was super friendly and helpful, the beds were comfortable, the location was good, and the rooms were clean and spacious. Appreciated the outlets to charge electronics.

212,A gem!,"A beautiful designed, and carefully maintained hotel with wonderful staff. And it is in a great location.",5,2024,08,31
212,"Comfortable, stylish & clean. with a warm welcome & terrific staff. Convenient to everything.","Excellent experience at the Green.  Comfortable, clean, stylish & well- designed without being over the top, nice products in the rooms, and consciousness of environmental impact, which we much appreciate. Excellent location, which allowed for easy access - mostly walking. some short taxi rides - - to restaurants, pubs, key sites, museums, parks (including the very pleasant St. Stephen's Green, right across the street) & other destinations on both sides of the river (e.g. we had tickets at the Gate Theatre, just north of the river).
 When we were first considering hotels for our 4 days in Dublin, we called the Green with a few questions & coincidentally wound up having a really nice conversation with Caio, the night manager.  Caio's abundant information about the Green (as well as other hotels and suggestions for  activities & destinations in Central Dublin), warm welcome, customer focus, and genuine interest in seeing that we were well situated for our interests and plans in Dublin made it clear that the Green was where we wanted to stay. Our stay there confirmed that Caio was exactly right. Candidly, we very much credit him with suggesting the Green for us, which proved to be an ideal & comfortable base for our time in town. 

Terrific welcoming and helpful staff, from the front desk. Shout out to Sophie, who literally ran outside with an umbrella for us (in Dublin's recent endless rain!) & Natalie as well as Jonathan & Raul at breakfast.  We'd not hesitate to stay at the Green again, and likely any property the O'Callaghan Group operates.",5,2024,08,29
212,The Best,Never lets us down and this time round front desk were ran off their feet and would give special mention to Marcela and Natalia.,5,2024,08,29

212,FSU Football In Dublin,Overall a pleasant and enjoyable stay at this very nice and conveniently located hotel. Staff is very nice and accomodating.,4,2024,08,26
212,Your Best Friend in Dublin :-),"Excellent service, room, and location! You are welcomed with pastry treats (loved!) upon arrival, and the same goodies your last night's stay. Beds are comfy, shower area is spacious, clean, and aesthetically pleasing. The Green is located where you can walk anywhere central to Dublin that are ""must see"" sites. I was here for a conference at RCSI and the location could not be any more convenient. We were welcomed with smiles and a helpful attitude from the first to the last day of our stay. Highly recommend. We arrived super early before check in time, but they stored our luggage and directed us to the bathrooms located downstairs from the lobby. My husband and I could not believe how fabulous those ""freshen up"" spaces were for the hotel guests--very impressive. Perhaps the only recommendation I have is to consider automatically including a microwave and/or mini fridge in the suites.
Thank you Green. Hope to see you soon.",5,2024,08,25
212,Outstanding hotel,"This hotel is superb!  The location is perfect. The staff is outstanding. And, the buffet breakfast is second to none.

212,Stay at The Green Hotel,"My boyfriend and I booked our stay here at the beginning and end of a family trip around Ireland. We arrived early due to our flights from the States, and they graciously helped us check into our room sooner. While waiting, we enjoyed breakfast at Bistro on the Green, which we ended up returning multiple times because we loved it. They had fresh honeycomb we were obsessed with and options for a hot traditional Irish breakfast. It was a wonderful way to start our trip, allowing us to relax and truly enjoy our vacation!
At the end of our journey, we eagerly looked forward to returning after seven days of traveling around Ireland. We were welcomed back with a handwritten letter and some chocolate, which made us feel incredibly special. We also tried Pen and Player, and it was fantastic! The bites and cocktails were delicious, and we even received a complimentary cocktail of the day. We were visiting from New York where the standards are so high and we left very impressed!!!
This has truly been the best accommodation experience We’ve had in a long time. I would definitely come back here again and highly recommend it to anyone staying in Dublin!",5,2024,08,23
212,An excellent choice for our Dublin stay,"The Green is an amazing hotel and we are extremely happy to have spent time here.  From the time we checked in, Natalia and Sophie seemed to be our personal concierge service.  The rooms are tidy and neat.  Great location to central Dublin.  Attractions and various food choices are nearby.  Directly across the street from St. Stepens Green, which provided many enjoyable walks.  All the staff are helpful and cheerful.",5,2024,08,23

They were always willing to help with directions, recommendations, getting a cab, etc. I would definitely stay again.",5,2024,08,22
212,The Green Dublin Review,"Enjoyed the stay. Bed was comfortable.  The cocktail bar was lovely.   The bartenders know how to make a legit cocktail.   We also enjoyed dessert both nights and they were wonderful as well.  Great location, very walkable and we felt safe staying here.    Great restaurant options nearby that are not in the heart of the touristy area.",4,2024,08,20

212,The best kept secret in Dublin,"An outstanding, friendly hotel.  From the moment we arrived to our departure we were given so much valuable help. Our holiday in Dublin was made by the staff at this hotel.  The receptionists were perfect and Tanya was so helpful.  Anything we asked for was provided for us.  Our bedroom was so comfortable, the largest double bed I have even seen and the housekeeping staff kept it spotlessly clean.  Breakfast was delicious, we could have the full Irish breakfast or a more 'healthy' one.  The hotel is so central we could walk everywhere and especially through St. Stephen's Green.  A BIG Thank you to you all.",5,2024,08,18
212,"More posh, less personal stay.",More posh than the hotels on the other side of the park but less personal too.  Breakfast more extensive buffet than most.  The costs were higher here than arthaus. I liked the breakfast choices more than some other Ireland hotels but my travel companions thought it was the worst we had the trip. A fine choice though if you need somewhere with availability.,4,2024,08,15
212,Wonderful stay,The Green is in the perfect location! Being directly across from Stephen's green park was such a gem. The rooms were clean and beautiful. The executive lounge also was a hit with me and my fiancé. Would definitely stay again! ,5,2024,08,14
212,Some of the most exceptional hospitality I've experienced,"The Green goes above and beyond for guests. We were randomly awarded ""Guest of the Day"" upon check-in and had our room upgraded, access granted to the Executive Lounge, and free breakfast. When our flight home was canceled and we had to spend an extra night in Dublin, The Green went over the top in accommodating us with an extension of our stay. Not only were they able to make the process incredibly seamless and easy to manage, but we were surprised with a personal note in the room expressing sympathy for our travel woes and inviting us to a pair of drinks on the house at the bar.

Note: breakfast, while not included, is extremely reasonably priced and one of the better-stocked buffets I've seen at any hotel (we chose to add it for our second morning after receiving the upgrade on day 1).",5,2024,08,12
212,Excellent location and attention,"The location is perfect: just across the street to St. Stephen's Green, within walking distance of almost everything and in a quiet enough location that I was able to sleep at night despite my usual difficulty to fall asleep. The staff at the front desk was really friendly and helpful. The room was clean, the beds really comfortable and we made good use of the fridge, the electric kettle and the coffee machine. The tap water had a bitter afteraste unless we heated it, but the hotel provided free water bottles for us.",5,2024,08,12

They really helped us to make our vocation so lovely and comfortable ",5,2024,08,11

212,Perfection!,"This was my first trip to Dublin and I couldn't have picked a more outstanding hotel. The location is perfect - diagonal from St. Stephen's Park which is beautiful and walking distance from shopping, bars and restaurants. I was greeted warmly by the staff at the Front Desk (Peter and Jose) and was fortunate to have my room upgraded. The hotel is lovely, my room was spacious and the breakfast was delicious. I cannot say enough about how wonderful the staff is at the Green Hotel. Special thank you to Evie, Jessica and Marcela too (I hope I didn't omit anyone). They have all really raised the bar when it comes to exemplary customer service. I highly recommend this hotel - for me, it was perfection across the board!",5,2024,08,11

212,"Great Hotel, Wonderful Breakfast, Simply the BEST staff!","I recently brought my girlfriend to Dublin for a surprise visit and chose The Green to stay for a long weekend. What a fantastic choice I made! The hotel was beautiful and from the moment we arrived we new we were in a first class establishment. The room itself was more than we could have asked for, the breakfast in the morning has such choice, and everything was so clean. However, the best part, by far, was the caring and helpful members of staff. They gave excellent restaurant suggestions when asked, and even came up with a list over-night of places for us to visit and slipped them under our door to find in the morning. 

As my partner is a huge Westlife fan, I couldn't resist in asking the hotel to put a picture of Shane Filan in our room just to put a smile on her face. Tanya, a member of the front desk team, went above and beyond for us, placing pictures in every room, with captions, rose petals, and really put in work, in her own time, to make our visit perfect! I cannot thank Tanya, and her accomplice Tamara, enough for making our stay so memorable! I am sure the hotel owners/management know what an asset Tanya is to the team, but I felt it needed reminding just what a wonderful job she does. We would come again in no small part to the experience she gave us as guests. 

The stay was so wonderful I just had to take the opportunity to propose to my partner Sarah, and she said yes! so now she's my fiancé!

We will be sure to visit again, to relive our wonderful stay, in a gorgeous hotel, with the BEST staff ever! Thank you!",5,2024,07,29

The location was convenient for walking to Grafton Street and across the street from St. Stephens Green. The hotel has been nicely updated and the rooms are clean and comfortable. The staff at the desk were helpful in arranging cabs. Due to miscommunication, our room was not serviced when we returned after a day of sightseeing. (There is a switch to turn on a light requesting service.) It was quickly taken care of while we enjoyed a stroll in St. Stephen’s Green. Breakfast, which was included in our stay, was very good.

There are two (2) Hotel staff members that stood out as exceptional in customer service. They are Jose and Patrick. Jose works at Reception/Check-In and could not be more pleasant, helpful and accommodating. He always has a smile on his face and goes out of his way to help. Patrick is a younger lad who works in the hotel's restaurant. He is outstanding in his treatment of the hotel guests. He has a very bright future.

Stop in to the Bar/Longe area and visit with El Sid. He is an exceptional mixologist and a very fun dude. 

If you're like us, you will enjoy this place very much!!

The property is very elegant, clean, perfectly located",5,2024,05,19
212,Family vacation,"This hotel was beautiful and the location was perfect!  The rooms were nice and clean and the staff were so friendly and
Professional. We enjoyed our breakfast every morning and the service was excellent!  We all loved how warm and friendly the staff made us feel and
We loved the location. It was perfect for us to be able to walk around and also get to the hop on hop off bus for a tour of the city. We loved it and we will be back!💜",5,2024,05,17
212,Vacation Ireland,A very nice hotel the people that help me was CAIO great in the bar! Sophia when we checked in was such a big help and helped me up to my room with all the luggage because my husband had to park the car five blocks away. The hotel is very close to all the shopping districts and the room was very clean.,5,2024,05,17
212,The perfect place,"We had the pleasure of staying here 3 times during our Ireland trip...beginning, middle and end!  We had been traveling for over 29 hours and were met with a warm welcome and an upgraded suite. Back in the middle of the trip and again an upgrade to a room in the Harcourt Wing with access to the Executive Lounge. Totally unexpected and such a nice touch. Our final days were spent in Dublin so the Green was a perfect place to stay. Jose went above and beyond for our final stay! Breakfasts were exceptional, food was great and lots of variety. The Brown bread was our favorite out of the entire trip but the recipe is a closely guarded secret! The staff were all very efficient, calm and incredibly helpful. Highly recommended!",5,2024,05,17
212,What to do with wet towels?,"Central location, close to St Stephen’s Green, bars and restaurants and Grafton St. shopping. Clean, comfortable. Pen & Player bar is excellent.
Everything else was perfect and staff are friendly and professional.

Only negative points are:
Some street noise can still be heard as windows are not double glazed.
Simple design issue in the bathroom, there is no towel rail or hook for towels. There is no space even if we booked a junior suite. This has to be easily and quickly rectified.",4,2024,05,15
212,Good hotel for tourists,"This was a great experience. We stayed 4 nights. The staff were friendly and welcoming, nothing was too much for them. We were very impressed. Our stay included breakfast and that was exceptional, catering for all tastes. Our rooms were clean and well equipped, our room maid was lovely and again nothing was too much for her she was great.

The situation of the Hotel on the  edge of Stephen Green was close to the centre and well placed for touring Dublin either on foot or bus. It is also a 5 minute walk from the bus stop for the express bus for the airport. Plenty of eateries around for all purses.",5,2024,05,15
212,This Is The Place,"We chose this place for its location - which cannot be beat.    But it is so much more than a convenient location.   The staff is amazing - to say they went above and beyond is putting it mildly.   They were all very efficient, calm and incredibly helpful.    The breakfast is wonderful - we were not sure if it was worth adding, but it ends up saving you money in the end because of the variety and quality - there are two levels, continental and hot food and both were delicious and fresh.    We also went into Pen and Player one evening - the cocktails are unusual but really great - regular drinks offered as well.    The rooms are comfortable, clean, and the housekeeping staff is definitely on top of things despite the ""tourist"" schedule of coming and going.   They are also very observant, adding extra water and caffeinated coffees seeing that this is what was used the most.   They have a recently upgraded ""Harcourt Wing"" - which is where we stayed.    

I would stay here again in a heartbeat!    Do not pass this one up!",5,2024,05,15
212,Great Hotel and location,"I can't say enough about this hotel. The Green Hotel was wonderful! The staff could not have been nicer. Jose at the front desk was so courteous and accommodating making for a good first impression for the hotel. He went above and beyond to accommodate our needs, always with a friendly smile. The rooms were spacious, clean and comfortable.  We had the buffet breakfast each morning and were greeted by Patrick. He took great care of us, making sure that we had everything we needed each morning. The fresh pastries and scones were amazing. They also have a cozy bar somewhat hidden that we would enjoy a drink before going out for dinner. The bartender, Elcid was also so friendly. The hotel is located near Grafton Street area with shops, bars and restaurants and across the street from St. Stephen's Green Park. You could walk to everything.  We would definitely stay here again. Jose,  Patrick and Elcid made our stay so enjoyable!",5,2024,05,14
212,Excellent across the boards!,"The staff was helpful and kind. Fantastic location within walking distance of many pubs, restaurants and green spaces! Didn’t try the hotel restaurant and bar aside from breakfast, but it was good. Loved the quirky, modern design of the hotel and decorating style. Would definitely stay here again!",5,2024,05,14
212,Great Stay,"Loved this cool, modern, boutique hotel, Decor is slightly Art decor. Service upon arrival is excellent, parking and unloading a bit tricky. The breakfast restaurant is fabulous. The Pen and Player bar/restaurant is a bar and not a restaurant. It has tapas, small bites and great cocktails. Not great for dinner. Rooms are small, but extremely well laid out. Bathroom huge. Comfy bed and quiet room.",5,2024,05,13
212,Wonderful Stay at The Green,"Wonderful stay here at the Green in Dublin!  We arrived at the hotel too early to check-in and Evie at the front desk took such good care of us!

Thank you Evie for your kindness and sincere care in making our stay at the Green such a memorable one.",5,2024,05,13
212,"Amazing! High end, simple, but elegant","Amazing stay! The hotel is simple yet elegant. The pillows and bed were soft and supportive. The room was stocked with coffee, espresso, tea, water, and local cookies. The breakfast was phenomenal, with a huge selection of pastries and meats.

212,nicest mid week break,"We had the nicest mid week break to celebrate our engagement at The Green Hotel and couldn't recommend it enough. The location was perfect, it was so clean and fresh and stylish, the staff were so professional and friendly and made us feel so comfortable the whole stay. A special mention is needed for Jessica and José Pedro who made our engagement really special and were both so thoughtful and couldn't do enough for us, we were spoiled!

Comfortable, bright and air conditioned.  Will definitely stay here again next time we are in Dublin!",5,2024,05,05

212,Excellent staff and hotel.,"Stayed one night and it was excellent. Room cleanliness impeccable, all the staff were polite and enterprising.  A great night’s sleep, blackout curtains. Brilliant amenities. Very good breakfast. A highlight was my coming back late from meeting Irish friends near Temple Bar and I got in at 1am. I asked the night reception if they had any convenience machine for me to buy a packet of crisps due to my being peckish.  Instead, Caio brought to my room some complimentary crisps and I was so grateful.",5,2024,05,02
212,Would recommend to my friends,Didn’t expect much. But it was a really nice experience. I liked the food and the staff. I would recommend it to all my friends and family.

212,Great staff!,"I had a particularly great time as this hotel. A sincere thank you to Jonathan at breakfast, and Thales, Marco, and the other bartender that I apologetically forget his name who entertained me multiple evenings over a number of unique and well crafted cocktails in their modern and moody bar. They were great chat and made the stay all the more memorable. The reservation staff were exceedingly friendly and helpful as well. All around the service was wonderful.

Location is fab, walking distance to many of the main sites, restaurants, shopping and bars. I love Dublin and will certainly return.",5,2024,04,29
212,The Green,Perfect stay. Helpful and friendly staff. Great breakfast wide variety of choice. Very clean extremely comfortable bed and spacious room. Easy ten minute walk to temple bar.  Great value. Would definitely recommend.,5,2024,04,29
212,Good hotel close to shopping and attractions,"The hotel is in a very convenient location, close to shops and attractions. Also easy with the bus from the airport. Great room, good bed, bathroom is beautiful. the only minus is the air-con. Not very reliable. We also had the room on the street side so we could not keep the windows open due to noise from the street. ",4,2024,04,29
212,The Green,Beautiful hotel in a great location!  We were upgraded to rooms in a recently renovated section of the hotel and it was so quiet and beautifully appointed.   Would definitely recommend staying here in Dublin.,5,2024,04,28
212,Beautiful hotel in great location,"I stayed at the Green Hotel back in March for my birthday with my mum. This is a newly refurbished, beautiful hotel within perfect walking distance to all attractions in Dublin, very centrally located with a tram stop outside should you wish to go further afield. I was very kindly upgraded to the suite with a beautiful box of my favourite butlers chocolates - the room was very feminine and cosy, i actually didnt want to leave the room and I felt like everything had been well thought out. I can't comment on the hotel facilities as we didn't eat in the hotel but the staff were extremely friendly and most welcoming. Will definitely stay here again.",5,2024,04,28
212,Top hotel experience,"We had quite high expectations after reading the website, and were not dissapointet: the staff was really nice and helpfull, the room cosy and delicately furnished. Warm and light colours, a good madrass and a soft and beautiful wall to wall carpet made use feel welcome and comfortable. The bathroom was perfect. Everything gave us the impression of high quality materials. The cleaning staff did their jobb perfectly every day. The gym and the toilets downstairs were excellent, and the breakfast delicious. All in all one of the best hotel experiences ever :)",5,2024,04,28
212,Nice Hotel in Dublin 2,"The room was nicely sized and arranged and the bed and pillows were comfortable. I loved the shower and towels. The staff were all terrific - friendly and helpful.

212,Lovely experience,"Wonderful hotel, super friendly employees. Special thanks to Aaron and Tamara (she was still in training, but if that wasn't on her name tag, I would have never noticed). Loved the room, food was nice and just loved the whole vibe. Would definitely recommend!",5,2024,04,25
212,Fine Hotel near St. Stephen's Green,"Not to be confused with the College Game Hotel about a half mile away, the Green Hotel is a nice place to stay. The process of notifying the staff whether your room needs to be cleaned with a button that turns red (not needed) and green (room needs cleaning) was not explained to us properly and resulted in our room not being cleaned one of the days we were in Dublin sightseeing. Also, it is located on a pretty hectic street corner that gets loud at night with a busy intersection of drunks coming home from the bar and traffic. You can hear the walk signals from your bedroom. The rooms are fine and the staff are nice.",4,2024,04,24
212,Highly recommend,"I had a pleasant stayed. Tamara and Jose outstanding service at the reception during my check-out. Also, Aaron (I think) did my check-in on 23rd April night! And the breakfast people incredible service, like Ana!",5,2024,04,24
212,Great spot,"Super place for a quiet coffee or drink with excellent service, only minutes away from the hustle and bustle of grafton street, thanks Peter!",5,2024,04,24
212,Impeccable stay in Dublin,"Upon Checkin, the experience was wonderful:  Jose at the front desk was charming and helpful.  Taking care of my luggage, he offered suggestions for things to do.  He took the time to call me personally as soon as my room was ready and greeted me with a genuine smile each day.  So many personal touches.

In the evening I enjoyed a smart and elegant martini in Pen and Player. An elegant deco lounge and bar. Franco, my server on several occasions, is a true gem.  Always so friendly and personable, I look forward to forward to a nightly drink in his service. 

For breakfast. Peter was stellar. Always offering me coffee and asking if I needed anything.  He asked about my day and made me feel truly welcome in Dublin. 

My room is appointed so smartly. Plenty of drawers. Safe at eye level, thick black out curtains and walk in shower.  Modern comforts and an elegantly appointed room on a 5 star level.  

Rachel in Sales is always ready to engage, offers my guests everything they need and seems not to know what the word “no” is.  She’s the perfect coordinator for events and group bookings.  

The Green with its newly refurbished rooms and personal charming service is now my go to hotel while on Dublin. The location, directly across from St Stephen’s Green and close to the newest restaurants and bars, cannot be beat.  I recommend it whole heartedly.  Special thanks to everyone here",5,2024,04,24
212,The Benchmark of Irish Hospitality.  No craic need apply. Seeking heads for beds.,"To love Dublin is to love the craft, the artisan, the drive to overcome any obstacle or barrier - and show it to the world.  This is staff and the beauty of The Green. No, it is not a multinational conglomorate chain with a ""rewards"" program to screw you over later.  It is one of a handful of boutique hotels that are affordable, luxurious and offer what hotel hospitality should be - regardless of ownership.

Our stay was for 2 nights and I wished it was longer.  Greeted at the front door on a typical Ireland day with rain and wind, the Green's staff offered to help us get situated, store our luggage - and even provided hot coffee as we got our bearings in this city.  

The room was absolutely fantastic, the bar was wonderful (even serving the local stout of choice if you don't feel like going on a $30 tour for a ""free"" one - but really, spend the $30 on a few rounds and give it to the bar crew!). We had breakfast on the last day (more on that soon), and I will say this:  It was the BEST breakfast selections I have ever seen in 30 years of travel.  No, that is not an exaggeration. 

And the star of our visit, Evie.  I want to highlight this bright young lady, who always greeted us with a smile, helped us with tickets, gave us the best ""local"" information (LUAS, good pints, great food, places to check out), even surprised my wife and I for our 20th Anniversary, and was an absolute gem. If she is not in a hospitality management program, get her in one, FAST!  Evie is a fount of information, absolutely delightfulness and the definition of hospitality in an industry that is losing its luster to social ""venues"" - but The Green has someone your AirBnB won't have - they have Evie.  And the best part, Evie is one one of MANY staff members at The Green who were friendly, very helpful and made our first nights in Dublin memorable.  If you are someone who works in hospitality, the team at The Green is your benchmark.  This is The Bar, and it is high, but for a reason. They have a craft, a passion, and they are dedicated to making your stay enjoyable.

Thank You Evie (Tanya and the team at the Green Hotel)!! We absolutely enjoyed our stay, and if YOU (the reader who has stayed glued to this lengthy read) are looking for *THAT* hotel in Dublin to not just visit a town but explore a city with history and a living soul and create memorable experiences  - you need to book your stay at The Green.",5,2024,04,23
212,Beautiful Dublin Hotel,"Very beautiful hotel - newly renovated with super comfy beds and showers. Decent sized rooms for Dublin.  Across the road from St Stephen’s Green and easy 5mins walk to Grafton St.

212,Favorite Hotel in Dublin,"The Green Hotel has a great location, close to shopping, hop on hop off bus stops along with public transportation. St Stevens Green is just across the street. We were just there 4/17/24-4/19/24 with 9 family members. Great Breakfast. The staff is very helpful. Nice clean bathrooms. The King size beds are very comfortable. This is the second time I have stayed there & I highly recommend it. I would stay there again.",5,2024,04,22
212,Birthday trip,"Absolutely fantastic hotel in a great location, the hotel is great from top to bottom, the rooms are beautiful and the bar/ restaurant area looks fantastic, the staff were great for our whole stay, the breakfast is really nice and we even got a complimentary room upgrade when we arrived which was incredible! the hotel is a 2 minute walk to Camden st (half the price of temple bar with all of the live music) but if you did want to go to temple bar than its still only a 15 minute walk via the south-east inner city, all in all I highly recommend The Green.",5,2024,04,22
212,A fabulous start,"We were not hotel guests but stopped for breakfast and were warmly welcomed.    Food choices were excellent as was the wonderfully strong coffee.  Staff was terrific and helpful with our travel needs and questions.  Yogurts were fab, breads delish and meat/cheeses excellent.  A most marvelous way to start our holiday.",5,2024,04,22

Our room was quiet, clean and comfortable The location was perfect, right across the street from St. Stephen’s Green park and within walking distance to many of the great pubs, restaurants, shopping and public transportation.  Also not too far from some of the museums, churches and many other sites.  One of the very best parts of our trip was the hotel staff. Everyone was always kind, friendly, professional and helpful.  They went above and beyond to ensure our stay was excellent…and it was.  Jessica was exceptionally wonderful, very kind, professional and welcoming.  We enjoyed the beautiful cocktail lounge as well as the delicious breakfasts. We would highly recommend The Green Hotel and will stay there again on our next visit to awesome Dublin, Ireland!",5,2024,04,21
212,Simply incredibly!,"Stayed here for 2 nights as we decided to embark on a well earned city break in Dublin. From the moment we arrived all staff were incredibly helpful and gave us a nice warm welcome to the city. 

The hotel is being refurbished floor by floor and features a luxury art deco style throughout. Our room was gorgeous, clean and very spacious, with everything we needed for our stay. The complimentary water bottles, Nespresso machine, biscuits, hot chocolates and mini fridge was a touch of class. The bathroom has been nicely designed and came with little toiletries which were then replenished during our stay. 

All in all I can’t fault this hotel at all and would happily stay here again when we next visit. It is in a perfect location with the main centre being a short walk and St, Stephen’s Green being situated next to it. 

We didn’t have time to try the restaurant or cocktail bar but both looked very busy with a nice atmosphere when we walked passed. 

Thank you The Green Hotel for a lovely stay! I can’t recommend this place enough!",5,2024,04,21
212,Great Central Hotel,"We loved this hotel.  The front desk staff, Sophie, Aaron and others were so helpful for first time Dublin visitors.

We were given a room that looked to be brand new with loads of modern tech. Beds were comfy and the room was quiet. The staff were most accommodating with recommendations and Peter in the breakfast dining room was especially attentive and congenial, a real pleasure to meet.",5,2024,04,19

212,Great introduction to Dublin,"We stayed at The Green Hotel in March 2024.   We picked this hotel because of it's walkability to most everything we wanted to see and do.  Also,  we saw a vlogger on You tube give the hotel high marks.  We were not disappointed.  The front desk agents were friendly and professional.  The room was clean and comfortable.  There were no issues with our room.  We had breakfast each morning with a good selection to choose from.  Friendly and professional wait staff including Peter who we enjoyed talking to.   We would definitely recommend this hotel to others and also stay here again.    Lydia F",5,2024,04,12

212,Top-notch hotel and staff,"I've stayed at The Green three times since October, for a total of 9 or 10 nights, and each experience has been perfect. The hotel is great--clean and stylish and centrally located without being noisy--and the staff is the best. They're friendly and curious and really lovely to talk with. Jessica at the front desk is a superstar; she goes out of her way to make me feel welcome and at home every time I'm there. The breakfast is amazing, too. I can't imagine a better place to stay in Dublin, and will likely be back a few times this year.",5,2024,04,05
212,The perfect choice,"Very pleasant and helpful staff.
Really lovely room -  quality furnishings and an attractive, well equipped bathroom. Very clean well presented hotel.
A really nice touch was the addition of mineral water and biscuits on the tea/coffee tray. Also pleased  to find that the windows actually opened - preferable to the air conditioned /sealed windows so frequently found in city hotels. Great location too - very central and convenient to main attractions.",5,2024,04,04
212,"Great hotel, great location","We loved the hotel. The room was spacious and clean. We had 3 folks so we booked a superior room. They provided a comfortable fold out bed. 

The breakfast was very good. A continental and full Irish. The hotel is very close to a LUAS stop on the green line, so getting around was very easy. 

The staff were all very friendly and extremely helpful. This will be our hotel for the next trip.",5,2024,04,04
212,Perfect stay,Absolutely brilliant hotel. Lovely staff. And I got an amazing upgrade on arrival which was just what I needed on a business trip. Treated myself to room service to enjoy the room. Food was fab. I would defo stay again if possible. Great location too ! A 5 min walk from all the shops and restaurants.,5,2024,04,03
212,Stay at The Green,"We received amazing service while staying at The Green.  Hotel is very much up-to-date with all the appropriate amenities, including updated outlets for technology, including a single international (US) outlet.   Rooms was great and styled nicely.  We would definitely stay again.",5,2024,04,02
212,Great experience,"Tamara is an excellent person, she is the receptionist but for sure she think out of the box and have a brilliant jorney! She made the difference in our time in this hotel and for sure will do to others! The hotel is amazing and have a great staff! I truly recommend!",5,2024,04,01
212,Welcoming and friendly,"Just had a wonderful lunch in this beautiful hotel. Excellent location next to St. Stephen's Green. The service was fantastic. Jonathan and Peter took excellent care of me and were super-friendly and attentive. As a frequent business traveler, I wish the service was this good everywhere I travel. Well-done, Green Hotel!",5,2024,04,01
212,Incredible Experience at The Green!,"I just had the most wonderful stay at The Green. The room was gorgeous, the breakfast was so tasty and the staff were super friendly.

I want to make special mention of Tanya who went above and beyond to make my stay special. Our daily debrief made traveling alone far from lonely. 

Thank you to The Green and Tanya. I would highly recommend this hotel and will definitely be back myself!",5,2024,03,31
212,Beautiful hotel in a great location. Staff very helpful. Highly recommended.,"Lovely experience. And a special shout-out to Jefferson for helping me clean a pair of shoes! Quiet, great location. Clean room, comfortable bed. Friendly and knowledgeable staff with helpful recommendations for dining in the neighborhood.",5,2024,03,31
212,"Great service, but room furnishings could be improved.","We stayed at The Green for about 5 days.  As a family with a young child, the staff were very accommodating and helpful, and went above and beyond in several different ways.

First, a note about the room itself.  We stayed in a suite.  The room was comfortable, but I got the impression that the furnishings had recently changed:  there were spaces with missing baseboards, as if a dresser had been removed, and a cluster of  electrical outlets midway up a wall, as if a desk had been removed.  Bathroom vanities were narrow in width, even though there was about 25 centimeters of empty space on either side, and sink drains were slow.  There was limited drawer space.  Even the walls seemed strangely bare, with minimal decor.  There was a noticeable food stain on the room's carpeting.  

There are no refrigerators in rooms, but the staff very kindly allowed us to store some milk for our child in a refrigerator behind the front desk.

In my opinion, any shortcomings of the room were outweighed by a great location, excellent breakfast, and wonderful staff.  Breakfast was a buffet-style Irish breakfast, with continental offerings as well.  We really enjoyed the sausage, eggs, croissants, and yogurts.  The breakfast team was very friendly and professional, and the manager Jonathan went ""above and beyond"" to help us when we were pressed for time.

The front desk staff was also very helpful.  José, Sophie, and Tanya each helped us with specific things that made our time in Dublin much easier.  Another staff member, Jessica, was most helpful when we randomly needed several things in one night, and was very kind to our child.",5,2024,03,30
212,Great Stay,"Our stay at The Green was great. The hotel was clean, check in was easy and staff were super nice. We liked that there was a pull off in front of the hotel to drop our bags off. 

We wish the parking was less expensive because we stayed 4 nights and that was a large expense. It was discounted by the hotel but still was about 25 euro per day. 

The hotel room design was amazing!",5,2024,03,30
212,Great hospitality and overall stay!!,"The hotel has a great location, beautiful, clean & spacious rooms, professional & friendly stuff!! I highly recommend it for leisure and business trips!! I will most certainly choose this hotel on my next trip to Dublin!",5,2024,03,29
212,Pefect Stay,Its an exzellent hotel to be. Friendly staff. Peter and his colleagues are very friendly and mindful. Rooms are comfortable. Good located. Thumps up. Good breakfast. Clean rooms. Nice atmosphere.We will certainly come back for our next Dublin Trip.,5,2024,03,29
212,Lovely place for a tea in Dublin,"Had a lovely tea in the Green Hotel on a Thursday afternoon. Big thank you and shout out to Peter H, who was very kind, good fun and has good chat. The kid has a massive career in hospitality ahead of him.  A tea is always much better when you are well looked after, so I will definitely be back :)",5,2024,03,28
212,Super service and location,I can highly recommend The Green. It has been recently refurbished and both the room and the bathroom were huge for an European hotel. The bed and pillows are super comfy and the service l received was wonderful. Jessica at the front desk is a STAR! She came to my rescue when trying to book train tickets online for Belfast and the Titanic Museum. She was so patient. She also offered great suggestions for where to eat. Would love to stay here again.,5,2024,03,27
212,Beautiful property in an Ideal Location,"Overall this was a very nice property. Stayed in one of the Executive King Rooms which is worth the additional cost when considering having a Nespresso Machine in your room, additional space in the room and access to a well stocked Executive Lounge.  The beds were likely comfortable for most, just not for us. the bedding however was fluffy and warm, and the rooms well appointed. The room was in the Annex of the hotel, so it was a bit of a maze remembering how to get to our room or back out to the reception. The Staff were all very friendly but not the most knowledgeable about the area when asked things about afternoon tea or places for anniversary dinners. The location is wonderful for walking to anything you may want to see while in Dublin. ",4,2024,03,27
212,Quality Hotel,"Our overall stay was excellent and the staff were friendly courteous and professional at all times. Our only slight complaints (Well comments really) our room was cleaned and we found cups and glasses not cleaned, the gym size although adequate for a couple of people, any more and you have a problem, Unfortunately we were woken at 8am on Monday noise with the builders. But as we say overall a very enjoyable stay",4,2024,03,26
212,Great Hotel,Great hotel and staff. Highly recommend. The Hotel and staff are extremely courteous and make you feel welcome. The Hotel is updated and extremely clean and the restaurant has excellent food. End of review.,5,2024,03,26
212,Friendly and comfortable,"This is a very comfortable hotel and the staff are friendly and helpful. The cocktail bar is stylish, drinks are well constructed and the small bites we ordered were delicious and great quality. Our breakfast server, Peter H, was attentive and helpful too! The bed was really comfortable and big and we loved the easy to use shower (no clambering over a bathtub here!). I would definitely recommend this hotel and would stay here again for sure.",5,2024,03,26
212,Only place to stay in Dublin!,"From the gorgeous spaces, to the amazing service, to the extremely convenient location, I don’t know why anyone would stay anywhere else. It was so easy to walk anywhere in the city. You’re right across from Stephen’s Green, a gorgeous park that’s perfect for a morning walk after eating a delicious breakfast in the breathtakingly beautiful restaurant. I’m obsessed and cannot wait to return.",5,2024,03,25
212,Dublin in The Green…,"I stayed at this hotel twice in March 2024, my first and second occasions at this establishment.
It’s so well located, on the edge of St Stephen’s Green, and an easy walk to the city centre, Trinity, and its next to the Luas (tram) if you are feeling weary.
It’s a really lovely place to stay. Very nicely (and freshly) decorated, a small but well-equipped gym (anywhere with a rowing machine immediately gets my vote) and breakfast was plentiful and extremely good.
What really stands out is the staff at the hotel. They were universally approachable, charming, well-informed, and effective. I was made to feel super welcome and being remembered on my second visit just added my sense that this will be my ‘go to’ hotel in Dublin.",5,2024,03,24
212,I've stayed here before and I will most certainly stay here again!,"This hotel is great as is its central location.  My room was spacious and bright with plenty of storage, the bathroom was fantastic and the bed was very comfortable.  A nice touch was the complimentary beverages.

However, it is the staff that make The Green Hotel such a lovely place to stay.  I was travelling on my own (lady in her sixties not a glamorous model) and they couldn't have been kinder and more helpful.  

Starting with Evie and Jose on reception who were so welcoming and when there was a slight problem with my shower ensured that it was fixed promptly also giving me a box of chocolates to make up for the inconvenience.  When Rui, the Bar Manager, discovered it was my birthday on Wednesday he gave me a complimentary glass of wine and a plate of delicious cakes and on other evenings Franco served me wine and cocktails with a smile and friendly chat.   There are others whose names I do not know on reception, in the breakfast room and the chambermaids who also made my stay such a good one.

If you are going to Dublin I can't think of a better place to stay.  I highly recommend this wonderful hotel.",5,2024,03,23
212,Wonderful Stay,"Lovely, modern hotel with warm hearted staff. Peter was especially friendly and welcoming during our stay. Tasty restaurant and swanky cocktail bar. Beautiful, recently updated rooms. Absolutely fantastic location. Would visit again!",5,2024,03,22
212,Green hotel stay,"My experience at the green hotel Dublin was very pleasant and a lovely stay overall, the rooms and facilities were honestly amazing in my opinion and the breakfast was out standing with such a range of food to choose from, the staff was very helpful especially Malena at breakfast.",5,2024,03,21
212,Good hotel to stay in!,The green is in a very good location near a lot of local bars.  Perfect for walking around St. Paddy’s day.  The breakfast was good and the staff was very friendly.   Our room on the second floor was a bit tricky to get to because you had to take two separate elevators but overall not bad.   I’d stay there again ,5,2024,03,21
212,Most attentive and welcoming,"Everything was 5 star quality. Plus when they realized it was a special occasion for us, we received several thoughtful treats with lovely messages from the staff. And when they found something we left behind in the room, they immediate called and solved the problem. One of our best experiences ever!",5,2024,03,21
212,When Business and Pleasure Collide!,The pictures are fantastic and it’s better in real life! I’m so stoked our friends picked The Green for what was a 3 day stay for St. Patrick’s and business conference on 19th!  It was an excellent room and Sophie at the front desk couldn’t be sweeter!  We would stay again in a heartbeat if back in Dublin!,5,2024,03,18
212,Truly impressive hospitality,"From the moment I arrived at The Green hotel the service from all staff was truly exceptional; warm, welcoming and interested in their customers. 

I had booked two rooms for the occasion of Mothers Day weekend. The room booked for my parents was upgraded and I must say they felt like royalty staying at The Green. My parents are in their late 70s and expressed their disbelief at their room - saying had never been treated so well. It was simply outstanding! A complimentary gift had been left in my parents room which was so thoughtful.... 4 small desert cakes on a plate that had ""Happy mothers day"" written in chocolate and a lovely hand written note from the staff welcoming them.

The twin room I booked for myself and my sister was also fabulous; so clean, comfortable and spacious. The comfiest bed and pillows I've ever had at any hotel (and I have travelled alot for both business and leisure over the past 2 decades).

I had booked a bed and breakfast rate. The breakfast room was modern with a really upmarket feel. I had breakfast with my parents and sister and loved how we were not rushed by staff in any way and loved that the waiter could not have been more helpful to us.
I simply cannot wait to return to this hotel again. Top marks on every front to the hotel staff. Thank you for making our stay so amazing!",5,2024,03,18
212,Perfect Location,The Green is perfectly located in central Dublin on the SW corner of St. Stephens Green.  The rooms we stayed in were newly renovated and very nice.  I would definitely consider staying here during future visits.,5,2024,03,17
212,A wonderful hotel in Dublin,"I had a great stay at the Green. The staff were super kind and helpful. The rooms were clean and very comfortable, the breakfast was very good and the location was great!
I would definatly stay ther again if I return to Dublin.
Thank you!!!",5,2024,03,17
212,The Green on St Patrick’s!,"We had such an excellent time at The Green on St. Patrick’s Day! We were able to catch the end of the parade and we had AMAZING service from both Peter and Jonathan! Top notch service with a great view. You can’t go wrong by stopping in for lunch, dinner or just a drink.",5,2024,03,17
212,Best hotel in Dublin,"A fabulous hotel. Jose, Sopie and Tamara  wonderfully efficient on check-in and so welcoming. Ensured we had everything we needed. We were upgraded and given VIP services. The room was great and in a quiet area. Comfortable bed and pillows, coffee and cartons of water provided and the cleanliness and refreshing of towels was top class. We had a lovely surprise on return to our room compliments of the Reception team. Wonderfully appreciated. We had a fantastic choice for breakfast and were brilliantly served by Peter and a lovely Brazilian girl with assurance from Jonathan that again we had top class service. We would recommend the Green hotel to anyone and will most certainly be staying there again.
John and Virginia Davis",5,2024,03,16
212,Stay in Dublin size,All perfect and very good location. Size of the room cramped for 2 people. Very nice employees and good service. Good quality food. Very clean. Next time we will chose a bigger room if there are. Will come back. ,5,2024,03,16
212,Great Experience,"The Green was a lovely, affordable hotel. Great amenities and location close to all downtown Dublin, shops, and restaurants. Extremely kind and helpful. Staff made the stay Very pleasant. The hotel was kept immaculately clean, and our room was kept up daily. Highly recommend 

",5,2024,03,16
212,Amazing Location/Experience,Wonderful location and hotel experience. Staff were so attentive and helpful and it’s close to everything for Grafton Street and surrounding areas. Make sure you check out the free comedy show nearby at Stag’s Head. Can’t recommend the hotel enough! We’ll be back.,5,2024,03,13
212,The Green Hotel,"Great value, clean and friendly staff.   Also convenient to local spots.  Having the park across the street was a nice touch.    Rooms were clean and comfortable.   Next time in Dublin we will book here again!",5,2024,03,13
212,Fab central hotel,"The hotel was super clean and the staff were all delightful, whether a cleaner, on Reception or in the bar (we didn’t get a chance to eat in the hotel). The extra long luggage rack was helpful and there were plenty of well placed sockets. Sustainable packaging was good except we missed having some conditioner provided. We have recommended the hotel to friends and hope to return next year.",5,2024,03,12
212,One night in Dublin,"Great stay at the Green. Room was great, breakfast was amazing. Staff were very helpful. The location is great and very central to most attractions, I will definitely stay here again if I’m ever in Dublin. Highly recommended. Thanks ",5,2024,03,12
212,Horrible experience,"We checked into the Green Hotel and from the beginning, staff seems to be distracted and not very attentive. We were informed we would be staying in the new section of the hotel. Usually this is a great sign, but not so in this case. Final touches were being completed during our stay.
Additionally, the room was very cramped, the shower had very low pressure and hot water was mostly lukewarm throughout our stay. Overall, I would not recommend staying here.",1,2024,03,10
212,Usual high standard,"Took my wife away for her birthday. We love this hotel. Fabulous staff and a great location. Can't comment on food as we didn't dine. But the rooms/ bed guarantee a good night's sleep.
Would highly recommend.
Dublin is an expensive city but felt like we got good value here. No car park but a concession for the nearest QPark.",5,2024,03,10
212,Excellent,The hotel was quality. The room was beautifully decorated and the attention to detail including handwritten notes was lovely. All the staff were helpful. It was very clean and had a lovely atmosphere.  We will be back! ,5,2024,03,10
212,The Green Hotel Bar with Peter H,Peter H was so amazing and helpful in the bar. Great personality and so kind greeting us at our first day in Ireland. He poured the best Guinness we’ve had in Ireland. He was quick and efficient in helping us. The decor in the green hotel is beautiful!!!,5,2024,03,07
212,Perfect stay.,"I have no clue as to where they get their staff from, its like they were wafted in from an unknown planet full of exceptional people. Every single one of them were truly delightful. Nothing was too much trouble. We would have to thank the exceptionally friendly reception team for making our stay so lovely.  Jessica, Sophie, Jose, and Peter you were an absolute credit to The Green, we felt like we had known them for years. (also the young lady whose name escapes me she only works weekends such a lovely young lady).  Peter H in the breakfast room will be an asset wherever he goes and whatever he does after his internship.  Thank you for being so bright & cheerful every morning.  Of course we cannot fail to mention the exceptionally talented Ruei and his amazing cocktail making.  Its like an entertainment show in itself.

The staff is what makes this hotel just that little bit more special.  They cannot do enough for you.

 Its location if just great for the city. Anywhere you want to go is easy from here.   The rooms are clean spacious with everything and more that you need for a great stay.   We wished we could have stayed longer.

We will return very soon.  Thank you your hospitality shows no end. ",5,2024,03,06
212,Lovely stay in Dublin!,"Our recent stay at The Green Hotel in Dublin was nothing short of extraordinary. From the moment we arrived, we were treated with the utmost care and attention, making our romantic getaway truly memorable!

The hotel's location, in the heart of Dublin's city center, provided the perfect backdrop for our stay.

Overall, our experience at The Green Hotel was nothing short of magical, we surely recommend The Green Hotel if you want to truly enjoy your stay in Dublin!",5,2024,03,04
212,Wonderful family trip to Dublin,"Everything about The Green Hotel was wonderful ! Check in was accommodating when we arrived early morning. Front desk staff  are very pleasant and helpful in every possible way . Thank you Jessica , Sophie , Jessica, Arron , Tamara for all your help during our stay . We upgraded our room and it was worth it for more space and access to club lounge . Bed very comfortable and we slept longer than we do at home. Bathroom shower and condition is modern well appointed and very clean. In fact the entire hotel is exceptionally clean. Every single person we interacted with at the hotel was so help and enjoyable to speak with .
 We added breakfast to our room for the trip and it was worth it . Food was delicious, special requests were taken and delivered with a smile. Amazing omelet every day ( probably should not have eaten that many eggs but I couldn’t resist ) . Special thanks to Johnathon the breakfast manager who made our mornings extra special everyday !!                   The hotel has an upscale bar which was recently remodeled , very trendy and beautiful inside . If you’re looking for a professional craft cocktail - this is the  place . Quality , style , personality was on full display. We stopped here every night after dinner and enjoyed the staff . Special thanks to Carlo from Naples our bar tender . Amazing to watch his talent as he creates craft cocktails with such skill and passion. Summary- The Green is a great value for what you get and the people who work there are the best we have seen anywhere and we travel all around the world . We will absolutely be retuning . Sadly our 8 days in Dublin came to an end - but not forever .",5,2024,03,02
212,Excellent Stay,"Arrived early but checked in straightaway as our rooms were ready. Staff at reception were efficient , polite & very friendly.

212,Beautiful location,"Stunning, hotel and the staff are SO NICE!

212,Dublin away stay,"We stayed at the Green last Sunday 25th February and we cannot fault it . Sophie from reception went out of her way to make sure our room was what we wanted . Thank you again Sophie. 
Our executive room in the new wing was  indeed excellent. Bed very comfortable and a great bathroom. 
Very good breakfast and lovely staff.",5,2024,02,28
212,Awesome place! Absolutely loved our stay! Thank you,"The hotel is beautifully decorated.  We came to stay for 4 days recently and have had the most amazing time. The staff at the hotel reception were extremely welcoming and even engaged with our toddler finding things for her to do.  The enquiries we made about the area were supported with a local map and everyone we met there day or night were wonderful.  
The breakfast at the hotel was also beautifully done and felt like a real treat, the staff here were also equally welcoming and helpful.
We had a few night caps in the hotel cocktail bar and also tried the light bites, which were very tasty.   We found the barman here making the drinks very knowledgable and he was able to make the most amazing mixes 😊
The location of the hotel is super central and the vast majority of attractions are within a 15 min walk.  
we would highly recommend The Green as a place to stay when visiting Dublin and the staff here are a real credit to you - very well done and thank you! A very happy customer, looking forward to visiting again soon ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️",5,2024,02,26
212,Nice hotel in great location,"Nice hotel, comfy beds, lovely bathrooms, great late night cocktail bar.  Strange smell downstairs in the reception area which seem to be coming from the toilets on the floor below.  Some refurbishment going on in the lower floors so was awoken by banging and drilling at 9am.  But overall a very nice stay.",4,2024,02,26
212,Great hotel,"Great hotel. My new favorite place to stay when in Dublin. Staff are amazing and friendly. Location is so close to everything. Perfect for families or solo travel. Breakfast is nice. Wish there was a little more variety each day, but perfect for a bite to eat before starting the day. ",5,2024,02,25
212,Fantastic Experience,"My wife and I had a wonderful three night stay here. Great location; great Irish breakfast; very good room; and wonderful, friendly, and helpful staff!  Highly recommend.

Amazing room: modern and absolutely comfortable, equipped with anything you need from Nespresso professional machine to desk to work on. The best bed I have ever slept in. Breakfast: top quality ingredients and choice.",5,2024,02,24
212,Eimear and Joe Healy,From the moment we stepped in the door we found the whole experience very enjoyable. Staff couldn't be more helpful and pleasant to deal with. We would have no difficulty recommending The Green Hotel to friends. ,5,2024,02,23
212,Green oasis in a busy city,"The Green is a beautiful hotel with everything you need for a short city break. The staff were welcoming, full of knowledge and really elevated our experience. All of the cleaners, reception staff, porters and restaurant staff were full of smiles and couldn't do enough to make sure we enjoyed our stay. The hotel is visually really appealling and beautiful to stay in, but the staff bring it to the next level. Thank you!",5,2024,02,23
212,Dublin Trip,Great hotel to stay in Dublin Downtown. Location is fantastic and the beds are simply amazing. It´s 5 minutes away from Graffton Street and all the services are fantastic. I will repeat for sure when I am back in Dublin,5,2024,02,23

212,exceptional all round!!,"i received a room upgrade, which was unexpected, but welcomed. the hotel is exceptional in all aspects, the rooms, the comfort, the decor. the staff were insightful, courteous and very helpful, i do prefer my tequila chilled tho, the bar area was very chic, warm and inviting. the gym is well fitted with good equipment to get a good enough workout",5,2024,02,15
212,Will only stay here!!!,"Absolutely amazing hotel.. had two bathroom choices, balcony and amazing bed. Staff are so great and so much complimentary items received. Couldn’t ask for a better hotel! Perfect location to everything and if you are part of the LGBTQ+ community so many local bars and clubs nearby all walking. Wouldn’t stay anywhere else now in Dublin. First time visiting as a couple and we will be back and only staying here. 
Only downfall is the carpet was slightly stained but apart from that - OMG…. INCREDIBLE!!!!",5,2024,02,14
212,Rugby weekend,"Super location, very central to shopping, eating and bars.  Only a 30min walk to Aviva and Connolly train station. 
We were delighted to be given a room r upgrade and complimentary breakfast. Lovely touches. ",5,2024,02,13
212,Construction and traffic noise,"The hotel looks lovely from the outside and the lobby. The larger beds are two smaller beds pushed together which is something to be aware of. 

We were placed in a room on the third floor and at approx 15:30 we could hear lots of banging and tool noises upstairs. In the morning we realised there were construction works going on above us. This completely disrupted our sleep and made for an unpleasant stay. My partner complained and was informed that the works were directly above us. If we’d had known about the works we would not have booked this hotel. We were moved to a room on the top floor, where there were stains on the carpet and the room faced the street. We had lots of traffic noise during our stay and could still hear the construction work, albeit not at bad. Disappointing that customers are being checked into the rooms below the work and it’s almost like the hotel is either hoping they don’t complain or ready to move them because of the disturbance. We were given vouchers for the hotel bar but we’re not big drinkers and therefore didn’t find this very compensatory. 

Also, there is no main light in the rooms which makes them very dark, especially on days when there is no sun. 

It’s a shame because the hotel looks beautiful online, the beds are comfy, the facilities (tea/coffee) and toiletries are great, just a let down by the noises. ",3,2024,02,12
212,"A++++++STAFF, HOTEL, LOCATION","First impressions!!! The most welcoming, warm, friendly,helpful, professional and fun reception staff.  Such lovely personalities. Felt relaxed and just at home immediately.  The LOCATION couldn’t be better, literally at one corner of St Stephen’s Green, 2 mins from the Luas ( city tram) with Grafton St at the other corner. The hotel  is modern and beautiful , with lots of seating and big windows in the foyer. Great cocktails in a stunning cocktail bar. Check out the  wow downstairs' bathrooms. Bedroom was lovely and spacious, bed comfortable with a brilliant bathroom en-suite. Would have loved to have been able to stay longer.   Highly recommend.",5,2024,02,12
212,Great place to stay,"Great hotel with fab breakfast and lovely clean rooms. Good gym as well. Friendly staff who go above and beyond. 
Excellent breakfast with unique items like granola, yoghurt and fruit mix. 

Will definitely return. ",5,2024,02,12
212,Amazing Hotel,"Great room and great staff, thank you Dimitrie a d Jhon for making a great night for us, we loved our room and the shower was amazing , and the hospitality was top notch, great location as well  lose to everything we wanted to visit during our stay!",5,2024,02,11
212,Perfect location,"Lovely friendly hotel, bedrooms very good size, bathroom has a great shower - the switch is to the right so you don’t get the shock of the water when you switch it in and are under it! perfectly located to be able to walk to the shops and temple bar. Highly recommend it.",5,2024,02,11
212,Excellent visit,"We paid for early check in and the room was ready for us to check in extra early. The king room was large and the bathroom very nice.  The staff was friendly. The breakfast buffet was delicious.

The location was ideal. It was a short walk to the St Stephens Green LUAS stop. 

The only complaint was the carpet was stained and looked dirty.

We could hear lots of street noise if the windows were kept open at night but it was quiet with the windows closed. This wasn’t an issue since it was the winter but might be a concern in the summer. The AC was not turned on during this time of year so the thermostat in the room did nothing.",5,2024,02,11
212,"Well situated, nice hotel.","Really nice hotel. We were not lucky with the amenities (shower gel/coffee…) and the bathroom but I expect it is not usual. The only thing I didn’t like was the executive lounge. No interest, very few offer (even no water except one filled bottle of still/sparking), very dark. Nothing to eat except chips and some snacks…. Not very healthy!",4,2024,02,06
212,Very positive,"We stayed for one night at this hotel.  From the moment we arrived at reception a few hours early the staff were friendly and kind.  I'm a wheelchair user and find travel very difficult.  I have to say the kindness of the staff at every interaction was exceptional.  I felt cared for throughout.  Nothing was too much and always with a smile.
Our room was lovely and very spacious. 
We had a quiet couple of hours in the bar on the night of arrival.  It was just what we needed.  
Sleep was excellent and the bed very comfortable.  As we live in the very quiet countryside we expected being right in the centre of Dublin it would be noisy and sleep might be difficult, we were so wrong.  It was so peaceful.  
Breakfast was one of the best hotel breakfasts I've ever had.  A lovely touch with the honeycomb.  
Staff in all areas were lovely.
On departure the reception staff gave us a little box of chocolates which really sealed the experience.

212,Enjoyable stay,Had a lovely stay here. The room was very comfortable and clean. Staff were very friendly and helpful. It's a great location for exploring Dublin. The inky downside was the cost of parking in the multi storey carpark. Would stay here again.,4,2024,02,05

The breakfast is very good, the rooms are very cosy and it has a well appointed gym. Having been to Dublin in January for 10yrs for business and each time in a different hotel, this one is definitely my favorite!!!",5,2024,02,01
212,Great Value and Location,"Great hotel and location.  We stayed here for one night before leaving Ireland. We were upgraded to a suite which we really enjoyed. Special call out to Matheus and Leandro at the Pen and Player Bar.  Excellent drinks, service and conversation.",5,2024,01,31

212,Excellent 1 night Stay,"We had a fantastic 1 night stay at The Green Hotel. As we were only there for a short while and wanted to take full advantage of the hotel, we paid 40 Euro to check in early. Sophia on reception was very welcoming and even drew us a little map to show where we got the Airport bus from. We had booked an Executive room for my Birthday and we were complimentary upgraded to an Executive Suite. The room was huge with a separate lounge area, Good size bedroom with massive comfortable bed and well appointed bathroom. Having an Executive room gives you access to the Executive Lounge where there were a selection of snacks and wines , beers and soft drinks. A nice little bonus. Breakfast was very nice. there was a good selection of continental options and of course the full Irish. While the breakfast was obviously used very good quality products, I was a little disappointed with the quantity having only 1 sausage and 1 slice of bacon. Overall a wonderful stay and we will definitely be back. Thank you to all the staff",5,2024,01,26

We had booked an upgrade for our overnight stay - a large corner room with a massive bed and a comfortable seating area. And two bathrooms!

212,The Green in the Heart of Old Dublin!,"Immaculately clean and a super nice staff. The Green is located in the heart of the old town Dublin and easy access to museums, parks, shops, pubs and restaurants. I am vary glad I stayed here. Although in the heart of it all it was quiet  and peaceful and the bed was amazingly comfortable. 

I totally messed up and had my do not disturb light on and thought while I was out all day the room would have been cleaned. Well once I noticed my error I quickly flip the switch and while I was out for a quiet bite of dinner the staff came and tidied up my room. 

If I have any criticism it has to do with the hot food at at the breakfast buffet. Although I found out the cook would prepare anything upon request and in doing so I had some great breakfasts while staying there. Also, even though it was one morning only, they had the best sausage rolls I ever had. 

Keep up the great work.",5,2023,11,22

212,Cloud 9,We spent two nights in Dublin on our way to a wedding in Sligo. The trip started off on the right foot when we checked into The Green hotel. We arrived a bit tired after an overnight flight from Canada at 730 am. Knowing our arrival time we did request the early check in but of course it was still very early. We were pleasantly surprised that we were able to get into our room shortly after enjoying a wonderful hot breakfast and yummy cappuccino in the very cool restaurant. The room was perfect and the bed was amazing!! In fact for the rest of the trip at every other hotel I was wishing I was back at The Green. The location of this hotel is perfect. Easy access to EVERYTHING!! I loved that we were right on the park. My only suggestion would be to have conditioner...but this seems to maybe be an Irish thing as I only had shampoo at all of the hotels we stayed at. None the less I loved this hotel and would definitely go back again. ,5,2023,11,15
212,Amazing people and location!,"The Green was in the perfect location - I walked absolutely everywhere. It was clean, and the wonderful people who work there are exceptional. The room was clean and perfect for staying the night. It was a tad bit noisy outside, but that's not something the hotel can control.

It is quintessential Dublin.",5,2023,11,13
212,Perfect location and great room.,Would highly recommend based on the great value of the room and perfect location. Area was quiet but easily walkable to most areas. Staff was very helpful.

212,"Husband said ""best hotel EVER!'","My husband and I had been talking about a trip to Ireland for a very long time, to celebrate his retirement from Firefighting and our 35th wedding anniversary. I randomly chose The Green Hotel (Dublin) due to it's proximity to St. Steven's Green. It turned out to be one of the most lovely hotels we've ever stayed at. The room was spacious and clean, the amenities were quality, the bath towels were so lush, the bed and pillows extremely comfortable, and the breakfast buffet DELICIOUS. But what I most appreciated was the extremely kind and helpful staff and how even though we were just one of countless couples to stay there, we were made to feel very special and cared for.  It was truly a four night stay that we will always remember with joy.  ",5,2023,11,06
212,Weekend break in Dublin ,"We had a fantastic stay at The Green. The staff were wonderful and so helpful. This hotel is not perfect but I still gave it 5/5 as the few flaws didn't impact my stay. I got the impression this is a hotel that is evolving and growing it's customer base. We really loved the new cocktail bar Pen & Player, definitely a must.
Breakfast was lovely, the hot chocolate was much needed after the night before!!
Looking forward to coming back. ",5,2023,11,05
212,Amazing staff and hotel,"I loved my room. Tastefully decorated and comfortable, and nicely quiet. The restaurant was great, too. I had two top-notch breakfasts.

Our room was located at the rear of the hotel, through a short labyrinth of lifts and hallways. The room is a decent size, comfortable, and quiet. Bed was comfortable and we slept well. 

The location is great, nearby to Grafton Street, no shortage of shops, from basics to luxury. Airline lost my fiancé’s luggage, so we were in a scramble to acquire toiletries (Boots) and undergarments (H&M). 

We were happy to learn a Wagamama was nearby Grafton Street, so a tried and true tasty meal after shopping was guaranteed.

The staff at the Green Hotel were so kind and helpful. We will definitely stay here again,",5,2023,10,24

212,Birthday Celebrations in Dublin!,Loved staying at the Green Hotel as it had the feel of being in a conservatory-styled space with the design and color palette. The rooms were clean and spacious with a large cozy bed and a lovely ensuite. We had a kettle and coffee machine in our rooms.  The communal areas were interesting and comfortable.  The breakfast was delicious with traditional and continental choices. There was quiet efficiency in operation with no fuss at any point of our weekend and all the hotel staff were just lovely.

212,Green all the way,"We were very happy with our choice for a long weekend in Dublin - The Green Hotel, with its stylish modern deco, featuring the colour green, of course. Everything was very clean, a huge comfortable bed, and a lovely shower. The breakfast at The Green was delicious! There was a big choice of hot and cold food, including Irish specialities. Our favourites were the Irish soda bread and banana bread. I have to try and bake those at home now! All staff at the hotel were very pleasant and super helpful. At breakfast we were looked after by Diana, who was just so lovely! We would certainly stay there again.",5,2023,10,14
212,"Perfect Location, Lovely Hotel","Located right off St. Stephen's Green, this recently renovated hotel couldn't be better situated for visiting Dublin. It's close to absolutely everything (walking distance to literally everything we wanted to do) and the rooms are comfortable, with individually-controlled heat and AC and nice modern bathrooms. The staff are very helpful and welcoming. I would definitely stay here again.",5,2023,10,12
212,Recent stay at The Green Hotel,"For the price, I wouldn't say the room was worth it. The staff was very friendly and helpful. We booked a junior suite and it was on the first floor, which is fine, but the room was dark and felt a little claustrophobic. Everything was very clean and bed was comfortable. Also, the rooms didn't come with any fridge or mini fridge option, which is usually standard in a junior suite. We have stayed at other hotels part of this group, and I would go back to those first next time.",4,2023,10,12
212,We'll be back!!!,"The team at the front desk was amazing.  This was our first trip to Ireland and we couldn't have asked for a better place to stay on our first few days in Dublin.  Ines was delightful.  We can't say enough about her and the client service she provided.  We were celebrating our 25th wedding anniversary and she sent up a beautiful display of desserts with a lovely note.  The team at the desk was fun and enjoyable to talk with as we came and went each day.   The hotel is right on the edge of town so it's quiet with an easy walk to all the shops, pubs and restaurants.  

Thank you for a truly wonderful stay.

We'll be back!",5,2023,10,08
212,Excellent Hotel,"Excellent hotel, location and front desk staff.  Very clean.  Beautiful park across street.  My only complaints were the awful fish smell in lobby all day and evening.  It was strong and overpowering. Literally made my stomach turn  each day and I love seafood.  Also it would be nice to offer  after 9 snacks.  We often got released from tours late and there was nothing but bar drinks avail after 9.  Maybe a vending machine or light snack area could be offered.  Other than those items it was a great place to stay. ",4,2023,10,08
212,Return visit to this wonderful hotel,"We stayed at The Green Hotel earlier this year for an extended visit and had a wonderful time.

When we had the opportunity to stay in Dublin for a night in October, we didn’t hesitate to return to this hotel.",5,2023,10,07
212,Great last night in Ireland,"We really enjoyed our stay at The Green, which we booked last minute. The lobby is very welcoming as is the bar, and the employees were wonderful and accommodating, especially Jessica and Jose. The bed was big and comfortable and the bathroom clean and updated.  The location is great a close to Grafton Street, Temple Bar and St. Stephens Green. The room smelled a bit stuffy, but opening the windows helped. There is a coffee maker in the room, and they had forgotten to leave the coffee and cups, but again, they brought them to use right away.",5,2023,10,06
212,Disappointed Stay,"Stayed here recently for business and while the hotel has been nicely decorated there are some issues.

Check in was fine and our room was ready.  The room was on the 1st floor which I later discovered would lead to little sleep, from the road and street noise, from being located beside the doors near the lifts and from general noise.

Breakfast the next morning was one of the worst I've experienced in a 4 star hotel.  I travel regularly and to Dublin but this was beyond d a joke.  Breakfast was set up on the bar where various trays of food were laid out where they could find space, trays were missing and the hot breakfast not only was limited but cold with a very limited offer.  Waiters were thin on the ground with plates left on our table throughout the time we were at breakfast.  We were unable to get additional cutlery or coffee.  

Overall for the price being charged there are many better options than this hotel where attention to detail and service are lacking.",3,2023,10,06
212,The Green Hotel Dublin,"We recently stayed at The Green on two occasions during our recent travels around Ireland. Our second occasion was to celebrate our wedding anniversary with an upgrade to a suite before we departed Ireland. We found the staff to be extremely courteous and helpful, and the location of the Hotel in central Dublin is within easy walking distance to main shopping precinct and tourist attractions (i.e. Trinity College, Arlington Hotel-Celtic Nights). ",5,2023,10,06
212,We had a delightful 3-day stay in spite of the rain because staff went out of their way to make our stay enjoyable.,This was such a wonderful place to stay with 5 star service everywhere. We were able to check in early to get out of the rain. Dining host was so gracious and accommodating. The evening bartenders and waiters were so personable and efficient. The food was a welcome change from bar food menu and breakfast buffet was awesome. The location was very walkable to everything we wanted to visit.,5,2023,10,05
212,Green Hotel is a Great Stay,"Had an amazing stay at the Green Hotel! The staff was extremely helpful and friendly. Special shout out to the receptionists Jhon, Gareth and Tanya for all of their efforts and kindness to us and our extended friends during our stay. There was not a single day where it felt as if we had to do too much. I’ll say it again, the stay was above/beyond my expectations: 

amenities
food
service 
location

All of which were fantastic, thank you all again for making our first trip to Ireland one to remember by being so welcoming.",5,2023,10,05
212,Business Trip,"The Green is an excellent hotel in a beautiful location close to a lovely shopping area. Plenty to do around St Stephens Green. Hotel was 10 /10 and the team were so helpful and looked after me very well, a well deserved 10/10 for the whole team.",5,2023,10,05
212,A Perfect Accommodation,"We vacationed in The Republic of Ireland for 2 weeks in September, beginning (3 nights) and ending ( 2 nights) our trip in Dublin, but spending 8 other nights in three other cities in the western parts of the country.  The Green Hotel in Dublin was by far the best accommodation we stayed in on all counts - beauty, cleanliness, service, style, staff, food, room size and furnishings, etc.",5,2023,10,03
212,As Good As It Gets- Highly Recommended,"We travel a lot and tell you that this hotel is not to be missed.  Boutique spot centrally located. Clean, spacious, and great breakfasts. The highlight however is the staff. From the moment we arrived from our overseas flight to the final farewell (and many interactions in between over a week-long trip) they could not do more for us and this is simply not common anymore in the hotel industry. You will always have numerous options in a city like Dublin, but I can tell you without hesitation, you will love it here. ",5,2023,10,01
212,Would recommend,"We enjoyed our three-night stay at The Green very much--the service was terrific, the staff was very friendly and helpful, and the room was very clean and comfortable. The location was convenient, as well.",5,2023,10,01

212,"Hat Tip to Hotel Management, a Job well done","Our trip to Dublin was fantastic, and the stay at The Green was great. From the 2 Ladies the ran the front desk ( They were very friendly and personal, helping us looking for  shops and for food experiences, the Guinness Beef Stew and Fish & Chips). The night bar staff of the Young Lady & Lad were great, it was like a Brother and Sister team that worked great together ( I even told them so, they truly were fantastic to watch)",5,2023,09,29
212,I’d stay at the Green every time!,"The room was a nice size, comfortable and clean. The location is great -close to good restaurants and easy walking distance to the main sights. Jessica and Evie greeted us every time with big smiles and a friendly, helpful attitude. They arranged taxis and recommended local restaurants. Matheus waited on us in the restaurant and was friendly and accomodating. Rui was the chef and was helpful to meet our dietary needs. The Green is a great hotel. I would stay there again - for sure. We even found a plate with desserts in our room on our last night. Thanks. ",5,2023,09,26
212,Great place to stay,The staff was incredibly friendly and helpful! Our bed was very comfortable and loved the size of the room and the rain shower head in the bathroom was a nice touch! Would definitely stay here again! Great location within walking distance of all the best spots!,5,2023,09,26
212,Great stay in Dublin City centre,"We had the best stay at the weekend - really recommend for a weekend visit to Dublin.

The selection of cocktails is fantastic and we had a few lovely evenings in the bar area - thoroughly enjoyed!",5,2023,09,25
212,Great location…,"Great location that was walkable to so many areas in the city centre. Rooms were clean and comfortable. Front desk staff were amazing and went out of their way to help us out. The only complaint I had was that we paid for the breakfast, but there must have been a problem with the restaurant as there was hardly any food put out to choose from. That was my only disappointment. ",4,2023,09,25
212,Excellent Hotel at St. Stephen's Green,"The room was very clean and spacious, and check-in was fast.  Breakfast buffet was plentiful and tasty.  Hotel is at entrance to St. Stephen's Green and is within about a 20  minute walk from Trinity College, St. Patrick's and Christ Church Cathedrals, and Guinness Storehouse.  Karyn and Ines, the evening receptionists, were very helpful and informative, and gave us great suggestions for finding pubs that serve Sticky Toffee Pudding.  A grand stay,  and we recommend this hotel.",5,2023,09,24
212,The Best!!,"Absolutely loved our stay at The Green. Lovely staff, spacious modern rooms with a huge comfortable bed.

212,Wonderful Stay,"The bathroom is absolutely stunning and the shower was wonderful. The staff was very friendly, and the breakfast was very good. Would definitely stay here again if I ever come back to Dublin. The location causes a little bit of noise on the weekends do to the rowdy bar goers but other than that it was a great stay. ",5,2023,09,21
212,Excellent hotel,This hotel was a favorite.  The staff is wonderful.  Very helpful.  The rooms were beautiful.  Loved the walk in tubs.  The breakfast is to die for.  Anything you could want and more.  Gave us an opportunity to try local food without having to waste a whole serving since it is self serve. The location is great for exploring Dublin.  We went through St Stephen's green on our way to several other destinations.  Grafton street was a short walk away to enjoy the singers and shops.,5,2023,09,20
212,Welcoming and extremely comfortable,"I recently had a very short stay in Dublin and needed somewhere comfortable and convenient to stay for just one night. The Green was perfect. Its location is super central, just off St Stephen's Green. The room was gorgeous (they gave me an upgrade) and the staff are lovely. Big thumbs up from me. ",5,2023,09,19
212,Great stay at The Green,"A beautiful room, loved the pink tones. Really spacious and good value for money compared to some other hotels we looked at.

212,Nice hotel in a great location,"Very nice hotel across from St. Stephens Green.  Good location and the hotel is good.  King  sized bed is a nice touch in Ireland.  For some reason they don't provide face clothes.  Good sized rooms, well equipped, friendly staff.  Parking is about 3 blocks away but there is a drop off zone outside the hotel.",4,2023,09,16
212,Excellent choice,Perfect location for walking around Dublin.  Just far enough away that you can have a quiet night but close enough to walk.  Staff are very friendly and go out of their way to be helpful.  Breakfast is very good.,5,2023,09,14
212,Wonderful Dublin Hotel,"We were very happy with this hotel! It has comfortable & clean rooms. We loved the restaurant/bar. Definitely add-in the breakfast option! The staff is very friendly & professional. They recommended several fun places to visit. It’s a short walk to Grafton Street & of course, St. Stephen’s Green. ",5,2023,09,12
212,Fantastic hotel!,"This was our favorite hotel on our recent trip to Ireland. The location for exploring Dublin was perfect- central, but still quiet. Being so close to St Stephens Green was lovely and there's lots of great restaurants within easy walking distance. The room was clean and comfortable, the bathrooms were spotless and spa-like, the general vibe was elegant and interesting, and the staff were kind and friendly. It really was pretty much perfect. I'll definitely stay there again next time I visit Dublin!",5,2023,09,11
212,Staff was smug and rude.,"Room not ready for hours and staff was condescending.  I called ahead and emailed my request for an early check in as we flew overnight and arrived at 7:30am local time.  They were unable to accommodate unless we agreed to pay a fee.  Fine, I agreed to that and upon arrival was told there were no rooms ready.
There were 3 people at the front counter all with smug smirks on their face. They looked like plastic people.  Very gleeful in telling us nothing was available but took our bags and left in the lobby unsecured for an hour. When I inquired about this they said the baggage room was full, but that they'd clean it out to make room.  We walked around cold and tired then laid around the lobby waiting, They were going to call when ready, but never did, saying the phone call did not go through, however we had other calls.  They never rang us.
Hotel was centrally located but had NO electrical outlets in the bathroom, which was incredibly small.",3,2023,09,11
212,Great location with everything you need,"I had a lovely stay here. It’s located next to many restaurants and several other attractions and/or the train are only a short walk away. 
It’s very clean, modern and has a good sized gym. The staff were exceptionally helpful and friendly. I would highly recommend and plan to return on my next visit to the city.",5,2023,09,11

212,Perfect stay,"We were impressed with every aspect of The Green. The location is perfect, the staff was wonderful and the decor just beautiful. We especially liked the atrium lobby workspace and used it every night to review our trip plans and relax. The room was quiet and luxurious, the gym just right for fitting in a workout and a stretch. The hotel is within easy walking distance of the attractions and the park as well as the Luas train station which connects to other parts of the city. It is a light rail electric train system that was not noisy or sketchy as train stations can be. All safe and easy to use. ",5,2023,09,08
212,Overall a nice experience but …………..,"Stayed 6 nights while on business in Dublin. Have also stayed here 2019. Since then the common areas appear to have been upgraded. Overall the hotel is nice with large suites, courteous reception, and most amenities available. The available light in the rooms was poor but Overall my accommodation was great. 
However my daily experience at the buffet breakfast was awful. Basil Fawlty and Manuel live. An attempt to provide feedback to one of the staff members just led to avoidance of me for the remainder of the breakfast. The breakfast room opened at 7. The hotel seems reliant on tours leading to high breakfast demand at 7. So 20 people wait in the foyer for doors to open. But every single morning staff spent the first 30 min setting breakfast up. Not sure what time they start! So hot food ran out in 10 min, toaster hadn’t been put together until 720 and not warmed up, no butter on table, dirty cutlery, missing tray of fruit etc etc. Constantly having to ask stressed staff for a plate please, butter please, milk please, my coffee that I ordered 25 min ago please etc. this was not isolated to 1 day. It kind of became a joke with my fellow travellers. I think the manager would benefit just sitting in the restaurant and just observing because although each of my complaints are relatively minor, these issues are not rocket science, are cumulative and frustrating when you are on a busy schedule to get breakfast and get out to our business. It certainly spoils the overall experience for a moderate cost hotel.",4,2023,09,07
212,Good location. Small room for a twin. No bathrobes.,Nice room although small. No Bath robes or slippers. Congested check in and check out with only 2 reception staff as people were leaving bags to check in later at 9.30 am while others were trying to check out. Could have done with a concierge desk. Good location. Good breakfast. Quiet room on 6th floor.,4,2023,09,07
212,Great start to our anniversary trip ,"We were only here overnight but it was absolutely wonderful! We had a junior suite which was perfect and the staff was incredibly kind and helpful, the morning breakfast was delicious! A perfect start to our 25th anniversary trip. Thank you ",5,2023,09,07
212,Exceptional Staff,"Everyone of the staff are exceptionally helpful, a rarity today.  They truly understand the meaning of great customer service. The rooms are spotlessly clean. No hesitation in recommending this hotel and its wonderful staff.",5,2023,09,06
212,Stay in Hotel,"Staff very friendly, efficient and obliging. Room very clean but dark, had to keep light on all day, also noisy due to air conditioning particularly in morning, this may be unique to the positioning of this room. For the money paid those issues need to be looked at from the perspective of customer needs as one night stay expensive.    ",4,2023,09,01

212,Great hotel - close to everything,"We stayed at The Green Hotel for four nights over a busy Dublin weekend. Our ""family room"" for three was spotless and spacious even by US hotel standards.  The service was friendly and professional.  The breakfast menu could've used a little variety day-to-day, but was very good.",5,2023,08,28
212,This is a wonderful hotel!,"Greeted very warmly at reception by the reception staff, we instantly felt the warmth of true Irish hospitality. The reception area was inviting with comfortable sofas. We had a lovely– good size- nicely furnished with a nice view. The  friendly staff did everything they could to make our stay comfortable. From Emmy at the front desk, who confirmed our drivers and excursions to Jonathan O, the maître d' who greeted us cheerily each morning and his very accommodating staff. Our room was clean each morning in a matter of minutes by Nikki (not sure of her name). I have no hesitation recommending this lovely hotel.",5,2023,08,27
212,NotreDame-Navy Football Ireland Aug 2023,"The Green was the 2nd of 3 hotels on the 8-day Football package on our first trip to Ireland. The room was roomy and very comfortable, but the restaurant /bar were the best part of our stay. Multiple visits for breakfast, drinks dinner late  nite nite-caps were consistantly enjoyable.

212,Exceptional.,"The hotel was excellent. Sevice superb. Clean. Inviting and easily accessable. Love the location. One of the staff, Franklin, went the extra mile setting up a very early breakfast for us very early travelers. He was wonderful. Highly recommend.",5,2023,08,20
212,Too expensive for the service and quality you get,"The Green Hotel is too expensive for the service and quality it offers. I would come back to this hotel.

Pros:
- Good Location
- King Beds
- Decent sized rooms
- Breakfast is 20€ if you book upon check in and it’s good value for the money if you consider eating elsewhere you would pay more per person

Cons:
- Check-In at 4 pm, which is very late and uncommon for a hotel => Many other guests who checked in after us got into their rooms before us, our room was not ready until 4:15 pm 
- No fridge in the room
- No heating in the bathroom 
- Weak water pressure
- Wooden interior is pretty outdated
- Carpet is outdated and needs an update
- There is a separate wing with rooms; not too easy to get to with carpet everywhere rolling your luggage and non automatic doors 
- No toilet brush
- Nespresso Maschine in the room didn’t work
- Extremely loud alarm in the room in the morning, almost knocked us out",3,2023,08,19
212,Just an all around great experience,"One of the best hotels I’ve stayed in. Easy check in with friendly and funny staff, awesome bar, beautiful atrium with nice mid century modern decor to have a drink in, large room with a huge bed. The whole hotel was spotlessly clean including the rooms, and all the staff were incredible and happy to assist our group with any request we had which was a decent amount for a short weekend stay. Normally I don’t leave reviews on much of anything but I was pretty blown away with how great this hotel was. If I ever plan another trip to Dublin, I’m positive I’ll be staying at The Green again.

It was cozy, well cared for, had stellar breakfast and dessert, and is in the best location, near everything and just off the main thoroughfare.

The service we received from the hotel was top notch, Jessica, Patrick front desk staff and Dylan and Maria in the bar, but most especially Ines from the front desk staff, it was almost like she was assigned to us personally, thats how special the service felt.  Many in our group are frequent travelers, and married to our reward program hotels so it was nice to receive such special service from this boutique hotel group.  The hotel, sleeping rooms and restaurant are much nicer than pictured on the website.  Perfect location, walking distance to so many things without the noise of a Temple Bar district.

They even upgraded us since we were getting married and Ireland the following week they offered to help with steaming out my wedding dress. The whole staff was very friendly and accommodating. We would highly recommend coming here. The hotel is quiet and inviting.",5,2023,07,21
212,Best Hotel Experience in Dublin ,"You will not find a better experience in Dublin! The rooms are perfect...the bar and meals served surpassed my expectations. The best feature is the staff! Everyone we encountered went out of their way to make us feel special .  We were greeted each time we entered and they got to know us in a short time.  I had a few days of not feeling well and Ruth helped get my breakfast to me. I questioned where the prints in my room came from and a letter was delivered to my room telling me the two places I could check.  But they went a step further and told me they were getting ready to replace them and if I gave them my personal information, they would send it to me when they are replaced. Who does that? The Green does!!
A few other names I remember are Emmy, Jessica,  Tanya and of course Ruth.
The location is the best for everything you choose to do.
You cannot go wrong staying at The Green for a memorable time in Dublin.",5,2023,07,20
212,"2 days and nights, clean rooms.","The staff is friendly. helpful and well informed. Breakfast was great and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. We asked many questions and needed referrals for restaurants, recreational sites, etc. I would thoroughly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Ireland.",5,2023,07,20
212,HAPPY GUEST," Really happy with my stay in this hotel I checked in and was greeted my a lovely young man called Patrick.   He was so helpful and very informative too. Couldn't do enough. Room was lovely  bed was really comfotable and breakfast was lovely too.  So much choice.

Would I stay here again? Absolutely just YES!!! Thank you Patrick for making our stay so memorable x",5,2023,07,19
212,Best overnight hotel,"My wife and I recently spent a night in Dublin for birthday celebrations and I have to say staying at the Green hotel enhanced our stay. 
Made to feel very welcome and would highly recommend this hotel in central Dublin. 
Brilliant attentive staff",5,2023,07,19
212,Great overall experience!,"The hotel location is just perfect, right in the heart of the city. It's cozy and comfortable, the bed was fantastic, as it was the breakfast, and the staff (thank you Emmy) was welcoming and helpful, also regarding which places to visit and where to eat. ",5,2023,07,18
212,A Most Memorable Experience--Definitely a Cut Above,"My husband and I were recently on our first-ever trip to Ireland. It was a preplanned small group tour and therefore we only had one night at The Green. However, we do hope to return, and if in Dublin, The Green will likely be our hotel of choice.  First and foremost, are my compliments to the staff.  They made us feel truly welcome and were extremely accommodating.  We arrived prior to check-in, after a long journey, and while we did not request special help getting into our room early, it was obvious they wanted to make this work for us if possible. The restaurant had just closed, but they thought to offer us a coffee. We did have an opportunity to have two meals there, dinner and breakfast. Both were fabulous. The breakfast offered just about anything one could possibly hope to enjoy, and I loved the scones in particular. Every encounter with a staff member brought the same energy. Smiles and kind words. Courtesy and attention to detail. The hotel itself exudes style and personality as well. Exceptionally clean and well kept. Do visit the lavatories downstairs, as they are above par indeed. Unique and worth the exploration.  We also loved the location of The Green and enjoyed a peaceful walk in St. Stephen's Green Park as well as a short walk to  Grafton St. We certainly hope to return one day. ",5,2023,07,18
212,Great experience at The Green!,"We had a great two nights at the green. The beds are super comfortable. The staff are accommodating and always smiling. The location is amazing - right in the heart of Dublin. The parking is a pain, but given the location, it's understandable. Get your parking garage ticket validated at the front desk for a discount off the price. The hotel was always clean and sparkling. Surprised we hardly heard a peep from other guests and from the outside. Must have thicker than usual walls. That was a nice surprise. I recommend you stay here!",5,2023,07,18
212,No Room Service,Hotel is in a good location and rooms are fine. Staff are very friendly but for the price of the stay one would expect some room service. Even at the weekend there is nothing after 12pm. So if you fancy a snack you’re told to download an app! And if you want a drink I’m afraid it’s water only! Irish Resident bars used to be the best of craic - sadly this tradition seems to have disappeared- certainly at the Green.,2,2023,07,15
212,10 day stay,"I stayed at The Green for about 10 days for work. Really solid location, very central. The rooms were clean and quite + comfortable. Very nice staff (special shoutout to Emmy, who was super helpful during my stay). Food could have been a bit better, but overall would recommend. ",4,2023,07,12
212,Amazing stay!!,"Service was amazing, wonderful restaurant downstairs and well curated hotel. Really grateful to Izabela and Emmy for all their help and making our stay so comfortable. I will definitely recommend this hotel and come back in the near future. 👍🏾👍🏾",4,2023,07,12

The front desk staff all were very friendly and helpful with our quetions and the reason why I will always stay at the Green when visiting Dublin .

212,Great location and friendly staff. Good value.,"Great location, super friendly and helpful staff, very clean and large rooms. Special shout out to Emily for exceptional service. Two couples took a golf trip. Staff gave great suggestions. Rooms were quiet. Hotel was walking distance to lots of restaurants, Grafton Street and Temple Bar.",5,2023,07,10
212,July 2023,"This is great location with walking distance to St. Stephen’s Green, Grafton Street, and even Temple Bar. The staff at the front desk and at the breakfast were attentive, friendly and helpful. We would stay here again. ",4,2023,07,10
212,Wonderful Experience,"Booked for a weekend in June to celebrate my partner’s birthday. We didn’t manage to get a luxury room but Patrick was incredibly helpful, as were all the staff, but a special call out to him as he was always so helpful and even got us a larger room. Service was excellent, and great location near the park and easy walking to centre.",5,2023,07,10
212,Honeymoon Pit Stop :),"The Green is a BEAUTIFUL hotel with thoughtful, accommodating staff.  My husband and I stayed for a night on our honeymoon and wish we could have had more time there!
The staff decorated our room for our honeymoon, which was so kind!  The hotel is updated, clean, spacious, and in a great location for touring Dublin!
There is a parking garage nearby, with a discounted rate through the hotel - this was very helpful for us!
When we return to Dublin, we will definitely be staying here again!",5,2023,07,10
212,"Perfect location, great service","The hotel is perfectly located next to St Stephen’s Green, walkable to everything. Staff are excellent, friendly, professional. From the moment we arrived they were eager to assist, from local recommendations to helping with reserving at museums. We felt comfortable and well taken care of, but it was never pushy. I only wish we could have had more time to spend in Dublin and enjoy the cool lobby!",5,2023,07,10
212,Great stay at The Green,"We stayed 2 nights at The Green and it was wonderful. Patrick and Ines at the front desk were awesome.  We arrived early after a red eye flight from the US and they got our luggage stored, gave us directions on where to go to get food, and to catch the hop on hop off bus.  Our room was lovely, clean, and well appointed with a great view of Dublin.  Patrick and Ines also helped us with checkout, including looking up a store where my husband could find a shilalis.  Overall a great stay and a hotel we highly recommend.  Thank you for a lovely experience. ",5,2023,07,10
212,Highly recommend,"Staff was very helpful and friendly.  Rooms were clean and spacious. Food delicious.  Great location by the park and within walking distance of museums, The Temple Bar, etc.  I highly recommend The Green Hotel in Dublin.",5,2023,07,10
212,Excellent staff,"The staff at this hotel were so courteous and helpful. One in particular- Patrick- answered every question we had and helped us with anything we needed (i.e. arranging a taxi for us and recommending a good place to eat.) The room was comfortable and the hotel is in a great location, very close to St. Stephen's Green and nearby shopping. ",5,2023,07,08
212,Great hotel in even better location,We finished our trip at the Green Hotel. From check in to check out the service was top notch and we loved everything about it! Great location walked everywhere! The staff was very helpful and they even gave us a special July 4th treat which was really appreciated ,5,2023,07,07
212,Great location for a hotel,"This was the first place we stayed when we arrived in Ireland.  It was very clean, people were very friendly and the breakfast had such a great variety of different foods to pick from.  The location was walking distance to so many places.  The next time I am in Dublin I will be staying at this hotel.",5,2023,07,07
212,Wonderful staff with amazing breakfast service ,"The friendliest staff, including Tanya, who went above and beyond, to ensure we had some crumbs with us when we were waking up at 5 am to meet our tour bus. And the most brilliant breakfast service. Still daydreaming about the scones and coffee - the kind you could chew. Beautiful rooms and bathrooms. Couldn’t ask for anything more. ",5,2023,07,07
212,"Great Stay at ""The Green""",We enjoyed our stay at The Green.  Staff at the front desk were friendly and very helpful.  The location of The Green is very convenient as it is a relatively easy walk to many different sites.  I would definitely recommend The Green to friends and family.  This is one of the best hotels that we stayed in during our holiday in Ireland/,4,2023,07,05
212,Excellent staff,"I choose to stay here every month whilst visiting Dublin for work. 
The environment is opulent warm and inviting.. But what makes me return to this hotel is hands down the staff, their professionalism and friendly manner make me want to return everytime. 
For example…. My last visit whilst checking into reception there was a candle displayed on the desk, I picked it up made a comment on the scent whilst talking to Franklin behind the reception desk. 
That evening I had a note pushed under my door asking to pop down to the reception when it was convenient for myself. 
Clayton,who was behind reception greeted me with the biggest smile and handed me a boxed candle as a gift. 
. I was delighted and actually touched actually blown away by the above and beyond service that they always effortlessly  provide and nothing is too much trouble I always get greeted with a welcome back and big smiles.
 I have already booked to stay next month and not because of the candle,because when I stay here, I feel like it’s home. ",5,2023,07,03
212,Great location,This hotel was right by Stephen’s green park. We were able to either walk or take the tram to most attractions. It’s also a great location for shopping. The seagulls were the only downside. Noisy on roof top during the daylight hours. I highly recommend this hotel!,4,2023,07,01
212,Comfy at the Green,Very friendly and accommodating. Izabela is a peach! Beds are very comfortable and the decor is very nice.  Breakfast is great too.  We would definitely recommend this hotel for your next trip to Ireland.  We stayed for four nights and it was spot on.,5,2023,07,01
212,The best choice for a great hotel in Dublin,"
There is a saying...you only get to make a first-impression once.

And from the first greeting at The Green...to staff actually taking us to our room (1528)...to the final day...when there was a RESERVED sign on our favorite table...FOR US! The Green staff have set a high standard...

I don't think I can count the times we said..."" I love this place"" and ""this was a really good choice"".

When we left (after 3 days)...we anticipated a similar experience... unfortunately, for us... that has not been the case.

We travelled to Athlone and checked in at the Radisson Blu...which started ""weird""... 15-18 people standing in line to check-in...(they did have 3 front end staff and a supervisor to move things along nicely), way too noisy..more like a pub at midnight, crowded, it seemed very disorganized...

It was not The Green...

There was a level of true welcome and sincerity at The Green that is exceptional...and is missing here.

At our new hotel..we walk around saying ""we don't like them""... With each disappointment and difficulty... they get it again... ""we don't like them"".

When we arrived in the restaurant for breakfast...and I said..  maybe I can get a capuccino... my cousin pointed to the machine and said... ""you make your own"".

Ohhh, my coffee from an automated dispenser? Really? Are we at McDonald's??

I don't like them!

I'm so glad we had our time at The Green! Every experience was wonderful... when they did not have iced tea in the afternoon...Rui made us a surprise... Earl Grey, lime & ginger! It was delightful! That was just one example of so many things their staff does right...and then some.

I will spread the word and go back to visit The Green!

212,A stellar experience!,"Lovely accommodations. The service was wonderful.  One of us was under the weather when we arrived. All the staff was magnificent; they went out of the way to do whatever they could to help. 
We especially wish to thank Innis, Emmy, Jessica, Carla, Peter, and Tanya.",5,2023,06,29
212,Great location - very nice clean and comfortable rooms,"Be sure if you have allergies to ask for a feather free room!!  Also, if you like to cover with a sheet, take your own, as well as a washrag.  I believe these are American conveniences as we didn't have them in any hotel we stayed in Ireland.    Staff was wonderful, very helpful!  Rooms were very nice, clean and comfortable.  We were right across from a large park and within walking distance of shopping, eating and many pubs.  Although if you are here check out Dylan in the onsite pub.  He makes an amazing Margarita and is a great young man to boot!!",5,2023,06,27
212,Ireland 🇮🇪,First Tim  we to Ireland and loved it. Would recommend anyone to travel to Ireland. Location of The Green was great. Close to walk to many sites. Including Saint Stevens Green. Temple Bar area and graft on Street shopping. ,5,2023,06,25
212,"Some good, some not so good","Small rooms, not a great/useful bathroom design, and only two bath towels.  Had to ask for extra toilet paper at desk and another bar of soap.  Maybe that's ""green"", but maybe it had to do with economizing as well.  Nice bar, and they do offer some things to eat though it doesn't seem to advertised particularly well.  Staff pleasant and professional.  Location is pretty central as well.
",3,2023,06,22
212,Wonderful hotel with exceptional staff,"Wonderful hotel and staff. Rooms are spacious and the bathroom is very modern. We enjoyed the breakfasts with fresh fruit, croissants and yogurt parfaits. Staff would also make special coffees upon request (latte). The dining room was bright, airy and modern. The location near St. Stephen's park was superb. What made The Greens memorable was the attentiveness of the staff. Carla & Ines went above and beyond. Upon arrival, the room was a king bed rather than 2 twins. We thought we'd have to wait to have the room re-made, but they were able to move us to a room next door. Later that evening we found a note of apology under our door and a complimentary breakfast for all 3 days. We were hardly inconvenienced by changing rooms and this gesture went a long way with us. 
After reading reviews, I see some of the rooms have Nespresso coffee makers. Ours had a simple coffee maker ... a nudge to the hotel to put Nespresso coffee makers in every room.  :)",5,2023,06,19
212,Good hotel with great location in the center of the city,"Great location and is just opposite to St Stephen Green Park and is in the city center. Overall, the experience with this hotel is great. Giving 4 stars as the hotel breakfast selection is less and repeat the same for every day. ",4,2023,06,18
212,Incredible location,Incredible hotel in every way. The location is fabulous and we will stay here again. Rooms are well equipped with everything we needed. Breakfast was simple and I liked that there was less food waste in comparison to other hotels. ,5,2023,06,18
212,Very disappointing ,"My wife and I stayed here for 5 nights in a king sized room, breakfast included. The room was a good size, nice and comfortable bed and lovely bathroom and shower. Overall, the hotel is pleasant. The bar/dining and seated areas are all close and open to a very busy reception area that is always full of bags and people coming and going. So it's not a particularly relaxing space. The hotel is in a great location for exploring the city although it was a lot noisier on a night than expected. It's a busy city so not much the hotel can do about that but there was also a lot of noise from inside the hotel. We could hear guests talking in a nearby room till the early hours and lots of doors banging. We didn't sleep particularly well. All in all it's a fairly standard hotel although feels more like a 3 star rather than a 4.

The main problem we had was with service and lack of organisation. The first morning we went down to breakfast, there was nobody there to greet us or tell us what to do or where to go, take an order etc. After an awkward wait we decided to just go and find a table. I later saw someone standing and greeting guests at the entrance so went over to give our room number. He'd wandered off again by the time I got there so I had another awkward wait till he came back. I ordered coffee for 2. We only had one cup on the table so I kept trying to ask for another. There was the occasional waiter(ess) flying by but most of the time the place was deserted and so I gave up. The breakfast itself isn't great. The choice for a cooked breakfast is fairly poor with no choice of eggs (and very poor if you're vegetarian or vegan). It also wasn't very warm. I think nearly every guest I saw struggled with the toaster but there was never anybody around to help them.

We just put it down to them having a bad day and ended up going to a café so I could get a coffee. Next morning my wife's tea didn't turn up. This time we managed to find someone to ask (who was very dismissive). We waited 10 minutes, still no tea, so once again went to a local café. We only went to breakfast 2 times out of a possible 5 as it just wasn't very good and the service was so bad. Another day my wife asked for a tea during the day and they actually managed to bring it. This time no milk though! One day they didn't clean the room. We'd run out of toilet rolls so I rang down to ask for more. 45 minutes later, no sign of anyone so I went to the local Tesco and bought some (to be fair they did bring them in the end). On the final day as we checked out (check out is at 11 by the way, despite the card holder that your room key comes in clearly stating it is 12 noon) and were waiting for a taxi to the airport we ordered a tea and a coffee. This time nothing at all came. So we went to the local café again. It seemed a fitting end to our stay.

My wife and I aren't high maintenance guests and don't tend to make a fuss or complain. We know that mistakes happen, especially in busy hotels. 1 star may seem harsh but this was the most disappointing stay we've ever had at a hotel and it wasn't cheap. We may as well have saved a fortune and just gone self-catering.",1,2023,06,18
212,"Spacious Hotel, lovely staff!","I would definitely recommend staying at the Green. The hotel was lovely and spacious. The staff, especially Peter and Ines were friendly and helpful and went above and beyond to make sure we had everything we needed during our stay. The location was perfect, walking distance to get to all of the Dublin attractions. It was our first trip to Ireland and we were not disappointed!",5,2023,06,17
212,Book It!  You Won't Regret It.,"I wish I could give this hotel 10 stars, as our experience surpassed our expectations.  The Green Hotel is modern, elegant, and located in the St Stephen’s Green area, which is my favorite spot in Ireland and was conveniently located within walking distance to local restaurants, cafes, grocery stores, Dublin attractions, parks, and more.  This hotel served as the perfect base camp for my husband and I’s 8 night stay.  We decided to get the Executive King room, which gave us access to the business lounge, which was fully stocked with sodas, waters, alcohol, snacks and more daily.  The daily complimentary waters were a huge bonus and much appreciated during and after a long day of sight seeing.  Our room was extremely comfortable---we selected this hotel because many European accommodations did not have air conditioning and king size beds-but these beds were comfortable; rooms were spacious; and equipped with a nice, big, beautiful bathroom.  The most defining feature of this hotel is the amazing staff, and a huge thank you to Franklin, Jessica, and Ines.  Upon our arrival to the hotel at 6am, both Franklin and Jessica took care of us until our room was ready at a later time.  They went above and beyond to ensure we were comfortable, well taken care of (and caffeinated) and sent us a welcome plate that evening.  Ines was also a daily, smiling face that provided restaurant recommendations, sight seeing advice, and more.  She even sent us an evening surprises of pastries that we couldn’t get enough of during the breakfast buffet.  She was the highlight of our stay!  Overall, I would recommend this hotel time and time again, and I cannot wait to stay here again upon a return trip to Ireland.  Thank you for the amazing memories!!",5,2023,06,15
212,Unsurpassed Ireland Experience,"The Green is a sophisticated, elegant hotel with unsurpassed service.  The rooms were beautiful but the bathroom was extraordinarily gorgeous.  All of the staff were genuinely caring and professional.  Peter and Ines provided the most wonderful recommendations for hotels and towns to visit that I had never knew existed.  We went to a beach town, Howth via a train.  Wonderful place.  Rui excelled at crafting unusual cocktails in the understated, tranquil hotel bar.  This is truly a 5 star hotel.",5,2023,06,13
212,Home Away from Home,"We were so comfortable we hated to leave! Staff was personable, knowledgeable and helpful.  Our room was very comfortable with lots of outlets, even US outlets!  Bed was also super comfortable and Nespresso coffee maker made getting up easy.  Breakfast in the hotel cafe was the best hotel breakfast I’ve had in a LONG time.  Location was central to most of the sights and areas of Dublin we wanted to see.  Over all it was a very lovely start to our Irish vacation.",5,2023,06,12
212,The Green Experience *****,"My wife and I recently visited Ireland. Prior to our trip we reviewed different hotels, however my wife was determined to stay at The Green. I am used to staying at Marriott properties, so I was a little hesitant to drift away from my norm. Despite my hesitation I went along with it, and am happy to say that i do not regret it one bit. The Green is an amazing hotel. Prior to our arrival we emailed the hotel to ask about shuttle services. Bianca Woyames responded promptly to the email providing two local options. She put clear instructions into the email along with two recommendations that were both amazing and helpful. The instructions assisted us with getting to the hotel with ease.

On arrival we were greeted by Ines. She was extremely friendly and welcoming! She asked if we were celebrating anything to which I had replied that we were celebrating my wife’s birthday.  My wife and I were both jet lagged, so we asked Ines for food recommendations. She offered to write up a personalized list to meet our food expectations while we go to our room to put our bags away. When we returned she had a list written for us! She also explained what the restaurants served and told us where we could go for live music after dinner. This went a long way, as she provided a personalized restaurant list that met what we wanted. She did not provide some pre-printed list like other chain hotels. 

After returning from our first dinner, my wife had a knock at the door. She opened the door to see Ines standing there with a small dessert. The small cake came with a happy birthday greeting written on the plate. What hotel does this?! This is what I call top notch customer service. She didn’t just check us in and forget us. She actually remembered that it was my wife’s birthday.

On our second day we had a tour to the Cliffs of Moher. My wife and I went to the front counter where we were greeted by Franklin and Gareth. We had told them that we had stored some snacks in the hotel fridge for our tour. Due to it being early in the morning the executive lounge wasn’t open yet, nor were there nay nearby restaurants or stores open. Unfortunately, our items in the fridge could not be found. Franklin and Gareth apologized for this. Rather than leave it at that, both sprung into action telling us that they would prepare us snack bags and get us coffee. Within minutes we had two bags filled with fruits and snacks. We were also given water and two coffees to go. I’ve stayed at many Marriott properties and never have I ever experienced this type of customer service. Franklin and Gareth could have easily brushed us off and that would’ve been the end of the conversation. Instead they went above and beyond to ensure that we were well prepared for our all day tour. They went above and beyond to ensure that our tour would be great. 

The property was very clean and very appealing. The customer service was top notch. The gym is also well equipped in comparison to many other hotels. My wife and I are truly thankful and appreciative of Ines, Franklin,  Gareth. I felt like the assistance was personal and not just assisting us as if we were another customer. We will definitely be returning to The Green.

212,"Great location, but busy and loud streets!","Picked the hotel for its location, which is excellent.  It was possible to walk to all the sights we wanted to see. It was very noisy at night, though, because of human and people traffic on the street.  Bring ear plugs, or better, noise cancelling headphones!",4,2023,05,22
212,Excellent hotel in the heart of Dublin,"This was a really great experience with nice rooms, great people, good food and an excellent location right down in the heart of Dublin.  Jessica, Ines and Marta, plus the rest of the young people they have working for them are polite and very service oriented.",5,2023,05,22
212,Great Stay,"The hotel was beautiful. It was located conveniently to walk to everything, but wasn't loud. We had an issue with our shower draining initially and they rectified immediately. The rooms were large and the beds were comfortable. ",5,2023,05,21
212,Very nice hotel,"We spent a lovely stay at the Green Hotel. The room was clean , as the bathroom. 
The hotel is great located, near a very nice park, and you can go to mainy places by foot (Trinity college, Saint Patrick Cathedral or Temple Bar). 
Employees are very professionnal and welcoming.",5,2023,05,20
212,"Great staff, lovely rooms - great start to a trip!","The Green was our first stop on a two-week journey across Ireland, and we could not have started in better fashion. The staff treated us so well, and were so accommodating when issues arose and we had to move rooms. Inis and Jessica in particular helped us out so much!

At the bar, Rui Pinheiro served us some of the best drinks we had all trip, and more importantly, took the time to share awesome local recommendations and wonderful stories from Dublin. ",5,2023,05,18
212,Great stay in convenient location.,"This was a lovely hotel. Large, clean rooms. Terrific staff. And very conveniently located. We walked to all the key sites.  We will happily recommend this to others. 

The restaurant and bar had a limited menu. But there are plenty of restaurants within a short walking distance. ",5,2023,05,18
212,Couldn't be better!,"Loved this hotel.  Room was spacious and comfortable.  Everything was recently renovated, too.  Restaurant was great - loved the breakfast.  Staff was professional and patient.  The hotel is just across from St Stephens Green and  is walking distance to just about everything.  Makes us want to visit Dublin just to stay here.",5,2023,05,17
212,A lot of little misses in design and execution for the price.,"Recently updated, but poorly designed property for the money.  A lot of little things (like a place to open your luggage, or hang towels/clothes in the bathroom) were missing.  Not a good value/experience for the money.",2,2023,05,17
212,"Great Location, Great Staff","Very happy we stayed at this modern, clean location with great food and attentive staff. Thank you Simon for the dining experience! We would stay here on our next visit, it's so convenient to so many Dublin attractions. ",5,2023,05,16
212,Great location and nice stay. Avoid breakfast. Get a McDonald's instead,"2 mins walk from Stephens green. Staff at reception great and room was available so let us check in early which was great. Breakfast was expensive for what was provided. Poor service. Lots of food items, plates, cups etc not available. Had to ask staff multiple times for items and received no apologies. ",3,2023,05,16
212,Green Hotel,"Fantastic hotel with incredible staff.  Great location across from St Stephens Green within walking distance of Temple Bar, Dublin Castle, St Patrick’s Cathedral and much more.   Very good breakfast included.   Can’t recommend this hotel highly enough.  ",5,2023,05,15
212,The perfect place to stay in Dublin,"Very nice, classy boutique hotel in Dublin 2, at the corner of St. Stephen’s Green, an esquisite park. The hotel is also a mere block from Grafton Street, the place to eat and socialize in Dublin. Back to the hotel: great rooms, staff, bar, and restaurant. You will enjoy it here. (safe and quiet, too)",5,2023,05,15
212,A Great Find in Dublin,"I stayed at The Green hotel for a week in May, 2023. The whole experience was excellent.  

The hotel is in a great location, across the street from Saint Stephen’s Green park and a short walk from many restaurants and bars. It is also a 2 minute walk from a Luas Tram stop. 

The highlight of my stay was the outstanding, friendly service. This was true at check-in, housekeeping, in the restaurant and at the bar. I highly recommend a stay at this hotel.",5,2023,05,12
212,"Clean, easy and great location","This was a great place to stay.  Close to center of town.  The room was very nice and clean.  Shower was great, ac worked well and you could open a window to let fresh air in.  It was, in our opinion a bit expensive but then again every hotel in Dublin are.",5,2023,05,11
212,Beautiful Perfect Amazing Hotel Experience,The Green is perfectly located beside St Stephen’s Green- The most gorgeous park. The staff are super polite and helpful. The room was incredibly comfortable and spacious. The location was perfect for our Dublin experience. We’ll definitely be back someday. ,5,2023,05,11
212,"Great space and location, let down by some awful service","Not a pleasant stay, despite the promise of the decor and location. Poor room upkeep/ set up, terrible bar and breakfast service, lack of a customer service / high end place ethos in many staff. Some gems within the staff but unfortunately not the average standard.",2,2023,05,09
212,Fantastic Hotel,"The Green is situated in a perfect location in St Stephens Green walking distance to shops bar’s restaurants… The hotel is really stylish, décor beautiful…Staff really friendly & helpful especially Jessica & Amy on reception… all though any staff member has excellent customer service skills… 
Breakfast at hotel was excellent wide selection of food … 
I would highly recommend booking this hotel & I will be a returning customer. My Hotel of choice when staying in Dublin 🤩",5,2023,05,09
212,A stay here is a MUST,"This hotel is so centrally located and the pictures online don’t do it justice. There are plenty of bars, restaurants, clubs, shopping, and scenery within walking distance of the hotel. It’s much more quiet than staying near the temple bar area. Grafton street is about a 10 minute walk and it’s located next the St. Stephen Greens",5,2023,05,08
212,1st trip to Ireland,"We stayed a total of 3 nights at The Green while in Ireland. One night after flying into Dublin and then again for our last two nights in Ireland. For the 1st night, the hotel gave us a complementary upgrade to a junior king suite for our anniversary while also leaving a small plate of brownies and a welcome note in our room. The hotel front staff as well as the bartenders were very friendly and extremely helpful with any questions or requests. The beds were very comfortable and the rooms were clean and well serviced. The location puts most of the tourist Dublin experiences within easy walking distance while being relatively quite at night. Only complaint would be 25 euro per person cost for breakfast. Dublin has a large amount of wonderful places to eat, especially breakfast that come at a better value. Jay Kays just North of the River and Temple Bar area was a favorite of ours. Overall highly recommend The Green!",5,2023,05,07
212,Spring trip,"First time in Dublin.We were near street and upgraded to junior suite( well worth the extra$ if paying)
Staff fabulous. Inez(s) was especially helpful. Well place near all the sites but away from crowds. Great value. Would definitely stay again.",5,2023,05,06
212,Helpful staff,"Stayed in The Green 5th May, lovely location, very comfortable bed, really helpful staff. Contacted by the hotel after check out to advise they had found a purse left behind in the room. Quickly returned to collect the purse! So thankful to Luis, Jessica and Carla for their quick response in looking out for their guests and saving us from a great deal of bother, so honest and reliable, thank you again! ",5,2023,05,06
212,Great Place!,"We were supposed to go to The Hayden Hotel but we’re snowed in so we had to pick a different hotel due to not being able to show up.  Our son booked The Green for us.  We were thrilled to have accommodations that made up for the loss of our first hotel.  Everything was exceptional.  The room, bed, linens, bathrooms, space, decor, and lighting.  It was within walking distance to everything.  Check in was easy.  The bar and food was excellent.  The Green has excellent staff.  Everyone was friendly and accommodating.  I would recommend this place to couples and business folks.  The brunch was wonderful.  ",5,2023,05,05
212,Another amazing night,Absolutely fantastic nightjar away again at the green recently. Always quick at check in and breakfast is efficient and much improved. Everything is on the door step to explore the city and high recommend it for a good night away. Definitely will be back in the summer.,5,2023,05,05
212,Good and very central location,"Good location, nice hotel with a new gym. Room service was moderate, the rest was quite good! Walking distance to public transportation, Airport Express, and Sightseeing spots. Stephen‘s Green is just ahead. Would stay there again.",4,2023,05,03
212,"Great location, great staff.","Great location just at the edge of Stephens Green, a ten-minute walk down Grafton to Trinity and a Temple Bar.  Clean room with helpful staff.  The bartender was an absolute delight (from Portugal, but I cannot remember his name so apologies to him).  We stayed in the executive rooms, which were clean but carpeted, which I personally dont love in a hotel.  The bathroom was gorgeous but it would be REALLY lovely if the hotel added some hooks in the bathroom for towels!  Fresh boxed waters were provided and the staff was great in helping us grab a taxi for the airport the next morning.  As a heads-up, you can take the Dublin Express bus from the airport to the Harcourt Luas stop for 8 euros or so, and then it's just a short five to six minute walk to the hotel down easily-walkable sidewalks!  ",4,2023,05,02
212,Service was fantastic.,"I always call ahead to confirm my booking, this instance was no different. However there was an issue with our room when we arrived and the room we booked was not ready even though we paid for the previous night. Coming from a red-eye this was very disappointing. The Guest Services day manager Jessica, was able to help sort us an option that was very acceptable. Jessica and the rest of staff were so helpful and made sure that we had everything we needed and even sent us a brownie as an aplogy for the mix up.",5,2023,05,01
212,"Fantastic location, nice updates, comfy beds","Can’t beat the location, great staff and service, interior updates are nice, especially bathrooms. Stayed in ExecKing with view. View is limited to Dublin rooftops, but was nice and quiet at night. Comfy bed and bedding. Exec lounge could use some upgrades. Lovely room but lacked breakfast takeaway items and no wine offered in the evening. Would stay again!",4,2023,04,30
212,Fabulous food,"We dropped in for some food and it didn't disappoint , the staff were really friendly and sweet, and the chef Paul mcgovern made an extra special desert for me and my friend as we explained we were two mothers having a little day out and break. What a lovely touch. I would 100% be back and maybe next time I will even stay over as the hotel is spotless. ",5,2023,04,30
212,"One of a kind hotel, modern and luxurious and most important, outstanding staff!","One of a kind hotel!  We had a marvelous experience starting from the minute we checked in.  The hotel is modern and delightful.  Our room was spotless, and the bathroom was bright and contemporary.  I loved the shower head and the water pressure… this may not be important to some but a preference for me!  Their breakfast had everything, including a full frame of honeycomb! But the best about the hotel is its staff.  The staff is exceptional.  They went above and beyond to make our stay incredible! I will definitely come back! Thank you",5,2023,04,28
212,Perfect,The first time in Dublin and first time in The Green Hotel and it was perfect! The reception and lobby area are very spacious and I was even able to have an online conference in quiet. Good place to stay.,5,2023,04,26

212,Only a place to sleep ,Rooms.were great and staff friendly but bar shuts early and of the drinks we asked for (3) they were out of them all (pink prosecco and certain larger) no room service.whatsoever. so if you want somewhere to sleep great but anything else it's rubbish. ,1,2023,04,23
212,Ok-ish experience,Ok-ish experience. Check-in person was quite unprofessional but it could have been their first day (at least it looked like so). Restaurant experience ok too although I found fishbones in my fish and chips. Otherwise rooms look really nice.,3,2023,04,23
212,Four days in Dublin!,"The hotel has many good points - location, style, comfort. Reception staff are pleasant and helpful but the place is let down by some inefficiency by some staff at breakfast where the food was good but the system is disorganised. 
We had King rooms which are very nice and have been part-refurbished since our last stay 6-7 years ago, but we were at the front of the hotel on the first floor so expect to get noise much of the time (day and night) from a busy, main crossroad with the LUAS running alongside too.
A pleasant stay but like most places in Dublin, it comes up rather expensive.",4,2023,04,22
212,Relaxing stay at the Green,"Excellent location with good car parking facilities. Stayed recently with my husband for a city break in an executive bedroom. Our room was very modern, well appointed and perfectly clean. We had use of the executive lounge which was a nice relaxing area to grab an free drinks and a snack after a hard days shopping. 
The cocktails in the bar were lovely, the service was friendly and prompt. 
Breakfast the 10/10. We will be back",5,2023,04,22
212,Exceptional,Stayed here on a trip with some friends and the place was amazing.  Front desk was awesome.  Upkeep was top notch.  Rooms were extremely clean with wonderful beds.  Staff was very helpful when trying to figure things out.  Would definitely stay here again in the future.,5,2023,04,18
212,The great location we expected,The attention to detail in the overall design of the hotel is well matched to the thoughtfulness in play by all of the hospitality staff. The bar and dinning area was a great space to catch up with friends who live nearby.,5,2023,04,13
212,Perfect weekend break,"Really loved everything about this hotel ! The staff were exceptional, the rooms were a little dark but clean and comfortable . The breakfast was really good and the stay couldn’t have been made any better. Highly recommended!",5,2023,04,11
212,The Green April Stay,"Overall great stay- we were able to check in early after arriving early in the morning the day of our booking. Great facility, would return if ever back in Dublin.
The decor of the hotel was amazing, something I’ve never seen before. Gorgeous!",5,2023,04,10
212,Dublin the Green,"Great location right across from St. Stevens Green. Very clean, king size beds were great.when we arrived , we we early & they let us get into 1 of the 3 rooms we had rented, I wish they had parking available, that is my only complaint.",5,2023,04,09
212,"Nice Hotel, Nice design. Nice bathrooms. Ok room, very spare breakfast","I would stay again, but not sure I’ll pay for breakfast. Very nice interior in breakfast restaurant, friendly staff and good coffee/tea. The food was spare and trays were often empty, but this is the only negative experience. Super friendly and helpful staff at the desk.",4,2023,04,07
212,Cleanliness on a high standard,"We spent 4 nights in The Green and it was an absolute pleisure. Daily housekeeping is Standard in The Green, you don't have to beg for it like it is almost normal in other hotels since Covid. The staff is sooo friendly. We booked one extra bed for one night, no problem at all. We recommend The Green. Also for the grand location next to Stephen's Green and Grafton Street.",5,2023,04,06
212,10/10 Experience,"The entire staff was super professional and friendly-- with Emmy helping me check in a few hours early. The design of the hotel was stunning and the rooms were a good size and very clean. My boyfriend and I had an amazing stay together and a couple of fun late-night drinks at the bar downstairs. The hotel is also very close to lots of great attractions like St. Stephen's Green Park, Grafton Street, St. Patrick's Cathedral, Temple area, etc. 10/10 experience and would highly recommend it to anyone staying in Dublin.",5,2023,04,05
212,One of the Best Hotels!,"I highly recommend The Green Hotel.  It was clean, comfortable and the staff very professional.  I had an issue with my shower and as soon as I let the front desk staff know about it they sent someone to check it out and had a resolution immediately.  The staff could not be friendlier or more helpful.  The rooms were clean and the bed was very comfortable. I will be staying there again on my next trip to Dublin. ",5,2023,04,03
212,"Friendly, Inviting and Spacious","The hotel was inviting, clean and has character.  There is a good menu in the bar but what really stands out is the staff.  From Martha's welcoming smile and helpful advise at the front desk to the late night bartender, sorry we did not get her name but she too was warm  and engaging as was everyone we interacted with from the hotel. When we find ourselves in Dublin again, The Green will be on our list of places to stay.  The room was spacious, comfortable and nicely decorated with a very nice shower.   ",5,2023,04,01
212,Fabulous stay made better due to location adn exceptional staff :),"This was a visit to Dublin to visit my daughter.
It was a lovely stay in the hotel and proved to be better than I could have hoped.
The hotel was very well located and central to where I wanted and needed to be.
The room was wonderful as was the bathroom.
I wanted to comment that room service was irregular. Sometimes early sometimes late and perhaps that could be improved thru discussion with the guest?
Also, wanted to extend a special compliment for the lovely breakfasts I enjoyed. The setting was nice and relaxing and a great way to start my day. In specific, a special compliment to Emily who was my server many mornings and provided me wonderful cappuccinos and omelettes. She always went the xtra mile to help get my day started off.",5,2023,04,01
212,"Great location, some wonderful staff","There were a number of problems that we struggled to have resolved in the first few days. Overall the staff were genuine and intent on trying to help.  There are some excellent members on the team.

Great location. Gorgeous bathrooms. Rooms are a good size. Ate in the restaurant and the meal was very good.
-
No fridge or mini bar. 
Minimal lighting in rooms. 
No hotel service guide available.
If we had only stayed two or three nights, I would not have recommended but once the problems were resolved, it is a good option.",4,2023,03,31
212,Wonderful hotel,I very much enjoyed my stay at the Green hotel. It was in the perfect location. The hotel is beautiful inside and had one of the most comfortable hotel beds I’ve ever slept on. The bar was wonderful for food and drinks. Would highly recommend.,5,2023,03,31
212,Great Hotel in an Excellent location.,Great Hotel in a nice central location. Staff were very friendly and welcoming. Very nice breakfast and the bed was extremely comfortable ! Our room was at the rear of the hotel and was very quiet. I would highly recommend staying at the Green…,5,2023,03,31
212,Great place for a weekend break,"We had a great weekend. The front of house staff were knowledgeable and really friendly and accommodating. They are a great asset to the hotel.
The rooms are really comfortable, and included all the extras that I would normally expect to be chargeable. Beds are really comfortable and bathrooms add a touch of luxury.
The bar prices were very reasonable and thanks to the bar staff there is a good vibe with plenty of interaction with the customers.
Will definitely return. Soon, we hope.",5,2023,03,29
212,Dublin in a whirlwind,We had a wonderful time during our stay at The Green. Centrally and conveniently located in Dublin with easy walking access to the sights and seems of Dublin.

212,Incredibly helpful and friendly staff,"The staff on the front desk and also in the bar were remarkably friendly and helpful. Also the room was so comfortable. The bed gave me one of the best nights sleep I’ve had in a while. And the soundproofing in the room eliminated almost all of the noise of the city, which is fantastic when in the city centre. I would highly recommend. ",5,2023,03,26
212,Dont cut corners,"Sort out your hairdryers. Was given a second one which exploded so obviously not checked - the third worked but overall a bit of a shocking experience.
For light sleepers dont forget to request a quieter room - mine was first floor, street side and very noisy traffic and people shouting on the street most of the night.  ",3,2023,03,24
212,"Feel right at home, great location and wonderful staff","
If you're looking for a value and relaxing stay, look no further than the Green Hotel. From the moment you step inside, you'll feel at home. The lobby is grand and opulent, with beautiful decorations and plush seating. The staff is friendly and welcoming, eager to assist with any request.
The rooms are spacious and well-appointed, with comfortable beds, plush bedding, and a beautiful shower. Each room comes with all the amenities you could need, including a large flat-screen TV, and high-speed Wi-Fi. The rooms are spotless and the housekeeping does an outstanding job every day! 
The breakfast buffet is not to be missed, with a wide variety of fresh pastries, hot dishes, hot tea for tea addicts like us, and great coffee too! Do not forget to try Adrian’s Cappuccino, it was the best for us!
The attention to detail, the quality of the amenities, and the level of service are all outstanding. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a truly memorable stay. It is our choice to stay for our future return to Dublin!",5,2023,03,24

212,Long weekend,Nicely located hotel - rooms spotless and lovely king size bed . Bar and dining area very good - although would have liked to see some more luxurious lounge style seating/ table arrangements.

Overall really enjoyed hotel - few easy things to fix.,4,2023,03,21
212,Lovely weekend in Dublin,"We were greeted with a warm welcome, something that remained consistent throughout our 3 night stay.

212,5 stars but skip the hotel breakfast,"5 stars *** (asterisks are ONLY for breakfast buffet)

Wonderful hotel in a great location. Friendly staff. Use the map the hotel provides...it's a helpful way to walk the city without being on your phone the whole time. Plenty to see within a 20-minute walk. Lots of great food and pubs on Camden Street, a block away. 

Hotel king room is spacious, bed is comfortable. 

Great gym with an impressive range of equipment for a hotel! 

Skip the hotel breakfast...it is waaaay overpriced at 25E per person. There are far better options for breakfast a short walk away.",5,2023,03,18
212,A very nice hotel close to the centre of Dublin,"I stayed at The Green for a 2½ week business trip. The facilities of the hotel was very good and the room was really nice, and clean. The personnel provided very professional service and was very helpful. The location was in walking distance to almost every tourist attraction.  
I recommend this hotel to others and hope to visit again myself. ",5,2023,03,18

The room was spacious and clean, the terrace had a great view of the city center. The Green team decorated our room and we got a lovely dessert plate waiting on arrival! Special thanks to Marta for the handwritten greetings card, it was a lovely touch! Also Jessica was really friendly and helpful in the morning! We had a pastry and coffee for breakfast and the waiting staff was excellent! We recommend this hotel to everyone and we will definitely be back soon!",5,2023,03,16
212,"Great stay, great location!!!","Great hotel, centrally located. Staff was EXTREMELY friendly and made the stay enjoyable.  Shout out to Jessica at the front desk for all her help and assist with getting around town. My wife and me were so impressed. ",5,2023,03,15
212,Good night out,The Green has a lovely bar with gorgeous decor and Wesley the bartender made it all the better with fantastic customer service and a friendly and chatty face behind the bar. This was a great way to end our long day out.,5,2023,03,13
212,Not what it seems,"I have thought long and hard about writing this review. I have posted over 200 reviews on Tripadvisor and this is a tough one. 

I booked in for 2 nights and had to cut the stay short due to an emergency at home. I had booked through Expedia to try and get my second night refunded. After five days they had no response from the hotel despite my informing them when I left after one night that Expedia were trying to reach them. The response Expedia initially got was there is no manager to respond . There still was no manager after five days. 

I had flown into Dublin from NY via London.. arriving late after a long trip. it was pouring with rain as I checked in and I asked for room service ..”sorry we don’t do food” but you advertise breakfast ? “Yes but we don’t do good”.. the restaurant is not up and running yet! “We don’t advertise food” they said .. so what is the breakfast I see on the www? A mirage ? 

for a hotel where the room rate is over £200 a night I expect to be able to get a sandwich. I think it is greedy from the owners to charge those rates and not have F&B up and running. The hotel is supposedly recently reopened but as someone who works in the sector there are tell tale signs it’s been patched up. 

The PCs at check in are old and slow, the furniture in the rooms has been heavily varnished but you can still see the scratches underneath. The large TV in my room did not work and was poorly attached to the wall with wiring exposed. The bathrooms and beds however were nice. The interior common parts are dated and faded. 

The one good thing was the young staff who were polite and courteous, and dealt all with my enquiries. But if I were coming to Dublin, and I do once a month, I would not stay here. I just don’t see the value",3,2023,03,11
212,Great location to explore Dublin from,"I chose this hotel for a mini-break to Dublin and stayed a total of three nights - arriving on Friday and leaving on Monday. It was the ideal location, with a short walk to tram stops. The airport bus also stopped relatively near by.

There is also an abundance of things within a short walk 10-12 minute walk including three museum, Trinity College, and of course St Stephen's Green Park. There are also plenty of excellent bars and restaurants in the area and a shopping centre if you need any supplies.

On one of the evenings I stopped by the bar in the hotel for a few hours and enjoyed some pints and cocktails. We were very happy with the service received and our main bartender Alexander.

The room itself was clean and spacious, looked very recently kitted because there weren't many signs of wear and tear. A great shower and complimentary water bottles, along with a kettle plus tea, coffee and hot chocolate to choose from, nicely rounded out the overwhelmingly positive experience staying at the hotel.",5,2023,03,07
212,Well worth a visit.,"Great value 4 star hotel in a fantastic location on St. Stephens Green walking distance to Grafton Street, Temple Bar and central Dublin locations.  Breakfast is ok, we found the full Irish breakfast  fairly cold quickly but substantial for the day.

Service throughout the Hotel is excellent, well trained staff, big shout out to Maria the Spanish lady in the bar and also Alexander, both very welcoming.

The room was very good, all the amenities that you would expect from a 4 Star Hotel.  Wifi and  TV choices both excellent, It would have been useful to have an operations card in the room for the heating control, it was cold during our stay and couldn't work the heating out but if we were that bothered about it we could have called reception and I know that they would have assisted quickly.

Well worth a stay, we will be back.

212,Amazing experience!,"The hotel was amazing! With a modern appearance, great spot and beautiful rooms! Personally l emphasize a lot at the hotel's staff! Especially Jessica and Marta were very polite and helpful! Jessica helped me to book a tour for a whole group, while she was not obliged to do so. I really respected it! I will definitely return to this hotel. It has wonderful services!",5,2023,02,28
212,Very nice experience,"Very nice hotel, clean and cozy with very friendly employees. Jessica and Martha were very friendly and helpful. The rooms are very comfortable, clean and spacious bathrooms and very comfortable beds. I would certainly visit again!",5,2023,02,28
212,Night out at the Gaiety,"A really lovely new hotel very stylish, the rooms were a perfect size, it was the perfect location for the Gaiety, close to everything Luas / buses etc, staff were very nice & reasonable prices for a city centre hotel.",5,2023,02,27
212,Excellent expericence,"Excellent hotel close to the main attractions of the city, like Temple Bar, Grafton Street, Liffey, etc.
Hearty brakfast with excellent choice, wr and cold dishes, extras were considered immediataly withour any charge. Comfortble beds!",5,2023,02,27
212,"Excellent Service and Cozy Ambiance at The Green Hotel Bar, Thanks to Alexander.","My recent visit to The Green Hotel Bar was a memorable one, thanks to the cozy ambiance and exceptional service provided by Alexander, our server.

Upon arrival, Alexander warmly welcomed us and attentively tended to our every need. He was well-versed in the bar's offerings and offered great suggestions for drinks. Throughout our visit, he frequently checked on us, ensuring our satisfaction and making sure we had everything we needed.

The drinks at The Green Hotel Bar were expertly crafted and absolutely delightful. Additionally, the ambiance of the bar was inviting and comfortable, with dim lighting and plush seating.

Overall, I highly recommend The Green Hotel Bar for a great night out. The cozy ambiance and delectable drinks are sure to impress, but the exceptional service provided by Alexander truly sets this establishment apart. I look forward to returning soon!",5,2023,02,26
212,Terrible management and reservation system,"I stayed at this hotel for two nights while in Dublin for business. I arrived in the room early in the morning and was working in the room when another person entered the room with another card  (I had also set the red light outside to not disturb). I was astonished and went to reception to complain; they stated they would look into it but never returned to explain. At the end of my stay, I went to check out at 3:30 a.m., when the manager and receptionist were having trouble finding my booking, but I had to ask several times to figure out what was going on. In addition, I had to phone twice to receive an invoice, and the receptionist kept mistyping my email address and requesting me to write them an email to request it. I am unimpressed with the front house team and how the issues were dealt with, and I will avoid staying here again when I come to Dublin.",2,2023,02,26
212,"Great 1 night solo stay at the classy Green Hotel at St. Stephen's Green, Dublin","Firstly, I would like to say a big thank you to the receptionist 'Jessica'. She was very warm and welcoming on my arrival and helped to make my stay memorable by upgrading my room.

My room itself was very nice, and I have to say it was probably the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in.  The only minor draw back of the room was the water pressure in the shower- I would have preferred a higher pressure. Other than that the room was superb.

The location is excellent- right on the corner of St. Stephen's Green and close to lots of beautiful restaurants, pubs, cafes and shopping.

In terms of the breakfast it was tasty and wholesome and the dining area is nice. Something I would like is  some 'order on request' breakfast items such as 'eggs benedict' (my favourite)
 
You are given a discounted rate at the nearby q park, but it is a bit of an inconvenience if I'm being honest as I would prefer to have parking en site  but not enough to stop me from staying again. This is my new go to hotel in Dublin :)

So thanks again to Jessica,

Cheers,

Paul Mc Carroll ( Stayed Friday 17th Feb 2023)

212,A Great Time at The Green,"My husband surprised me with a birthday trip to Dublin and chose The Green for our one night stay.  He chose well!  It was really really lovely, modern but also cosy.  We had a suite which was great (this also gave us access to the Executive Suite -  an added bonus!).  The staff were absolutely great and couldn't have been more attentive & helpful, and our breakfast was top notch, with a fantastic choice.  The Green is really well situated in the St Stephens Green area, close enough to all the bustle, but also a little bit set back for some down time.  We will definitely stay there the next time we visit Dublin and can't recommend it enough.",5,2023,02,22
212,"Smart, clean and modern with friendly staff","We stayed at The Green for our friend’s 50th birthday on 17th and 18th February 2023. It’s about a €30 taxi ride from the airport. 

Upon arrival, the staff were friendly and helpful, explaining everything clearly. 

The rooms were clean, tidy and modern with huge beds. 

The staff in the bar were also as courtesy and attentive as the front of house staff. Prices in the bar were average for Dublin and less expensive than some of the more famous tourist areas, which was a pleasant surprise. 

A special mention to Jessica, Carla and Juan who were polite and helped with any requests we had such as booking taxis and giving directions. 

Would definitely recommend and will no doubt return to this hotel if I go back to Dublin.",5,2023,02,21

Highly recommend.",4,2023,02,11
212,Good location and great staff,"We had a 50th birthday weekend.  The check in was great the team very friendly and offered us an upgrade.  There was a quirk for anyone who was in the executive rooms, taking 2 lifts ! But not an issue.  ",5,2023,02,06
212,Friendly service and very comfortable room,The room was perfectly clean and the bed really comfortable. Service was attentive and friendly. Location just perfect!

212,Cozy and relaxing environment ,"My husband and I visited Dublin for a few days for the first time and the comfort of the hotel was one of the highlights of our trip. Very relaxing and cozy environment which the staff surprised me with their willingness to help us. I missed lunch and dinner options when we went to visit the hotel bar on our last night, but we stayed for a drink anyway and we were very well served by the bartender Isabella from Brazil who again surprised me by her willingness to help us as I ordered a strawberry daiquiri and in the absence of the fruit she created a daiquiri with fresh raspberries instead, never tried one before but it was so good that I order two. My compliments to the reception team as well, very nice and helpful. We will definitely return to the hotel in the summer ready to try the restaurant and see more in Dublin.",4,2023,02,03
212,Fantastic Central Spot,Great hotel right in the centre. Really smooth process arriving and even go our rooms early on in the day. Breakfast was nice.

212,Best drink ever,"So I arrived in Dublin and travelled around the city and visited many bars. I staggered home to my hotel… the green and was greeted by the fantastic Mr Alex. Mr Alex is a wonderful, enthusiastic, talented bar man who served us the best beverage I had encountered all evening. It started with a perfect Long Island (best I’d ever tasted). Followed by his signature drink that encouraged me to write this review.

Hats off to Alex. If you stay here and don’t have a cocktail with him then you’re missing out!!!

Big up, man like Alex.

Ps room was great but the bar was better",5,2023,01,21
212,Great service,Lovely Hotel. Rooms are clean and service is has been top level from start to finish. Alexander working in the bar is a fantastic custodian who pours a great pint of Guiness. Would stay here every time I return to Dublin.,5,2023,01,21
212,Bar,"The bar in the hotel is absolutely incredible. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful during our stop in. I was visiting friends and we were looking for a new place to have a few drinks. We were not at all disappointed in our choice of the green. The drinks were excellent and the atmosphere was great. The bar staff were excellent, in particular Alexander. He was very knowledgeable about Dublin, and the drinks he was serving us. 
I will absolutely be returning and can’t wait to stay a few nights with my wife.",5,2023,01,21
212,Very nice find,I was pleasantly surprised at how nice The Green Hotel was. I was in Dublin for a conference and needed to find a reasonably priced hotel. Not oy was tThe Green well priced but it was a very nice hotel with a great location. ,5,2023,01,19
212,Great stay,"Take a look book you will not be disappointed . Easy to get out and about , 
Welcome from the staff 
Decorating lovely come on what better can people need , 
Great service and super fun place to enjoy all ",5,2023,01,16
212,The best location and service in Dublin.,"We spent a Saturday night in the Green Hotel. It’s in a fantastic location - perfect,  as the song goes, ‘for coffee at eleven and a stroll round Stephen’s Green’! Reception staff - Nykolas and Peter - were terrific and made an extra effort on hearing we were celebrating a special birthday. Our bedroom was very well appointed, overlooking St. Stephen’s Green with windows that opened together with air conditioning . The bedroom furnishings and fittings were high end; the bed was huge and extremely comfortable. The Executive Lounge is a nice indulgence; the public areas on the ground floor are bright and welcoming for guests and ‘drop  ins’ alike and certainly make an excellent meeting point for anyone in Dublin. The parking arrangement worked very well for us as it was ideal for dropping of the purchases made during the day. The hotel is situated just a 2 minute walk from the LUAS.

We have no hesitation in recommending The Green Hotel for anyone looking for a city centre location.",5,2023,01,16
212,Lovely peaceful stay,This was my second time in the green hotel as I travel to Dublin a lot for work and I will continue to stay here. Beds are comfortable and the breakfast and gym are great. All the staff are so helpful and friendly. Check in has been wonderful both times and last week Daniel on Front of House gave excellent service!,5,2023,01,15
212,Wonderful Staff and Breakfast,"This is a very cute and well decorated hotel in a great location. Grafton area is super walkable and pubs and shopping.

Two standouts from our stay were Jessica at the front desk, who was so wonderful and went above and beyond to help us and order a taxi, early check in etc. and the other was the breakfast served in the morning. My husband and I were so impressed by the breakfast, we stayed at super nice places after traveling elsewhere on the trip and were comparing all the breakfasts to the Green. The Green's breakfast always won!",4,2023,01,15
212,Amazing stay,"Gorgeous hotel in a lovely, walkable location. We were on our honeymoon and chose this hotel because of the convenience of amenities (restaurant and indoor hang out spaces) in case the weather was cold since it was December. The staff were so kind and helpful. Would definitely stay again and would recommend to anyone!! ",5,2023,01,06
212,Beautifully decorated and great location.,"The Green Hotel is a beautiful hotel in a great location of Dublin. 

The grand entrance to the hotel wow’d us and the quality continued in the rooms. The hotels decor is modern and colourful with some quirky touches. The hotel was always immaculate too.

The service in the hotel was very good. 

The only improvement I would suggest is that the rooms are too hot. Although the beds were so comfortable, it was difficult to sleep with the rooms being so warm. 

Overall we had a fantastic stay at the Green Hotel and would recommend to others.",4,2023,01,02
212,Amazing,"Couldn’t fault our stay. Everything was amazing, the decor, the service, the location and comfort. The rooms were great and the bed was so comfy. The staff were helpful and so polite. If I ever visit Ireland again I will be staying here. ",5,2023,01,02
212,"So many hotels in Dublin, which to choose! Give The Green Hotel a try!","I spent a week in Dublin on business and I was looking for a hotel near the center (e.g. Grafton Street) that wasn't too expensive.  In the end we chose The Green and we were not disappointed.  My wife joined me for the trip and spent the week with friends (who came over from the UK).  Things to know about the hotel; staff were very attentive and super helpful - we arrived early on Saturday morning after night flight from US, Juan on front desk did his best to get us into our Executive King room as early as possible - he succeed telling us the room he'd put us in was on the 2nd floor, facing the main road which could be noisy.  He offered to move us the day after if we found the room noisy. On Sunday we took him up on that offer and they moved us to 5th floor (in the new wing) which didn't overlook the main road.  Hotel doesn't have a restaurant but serves a great breakfast and offers drinks and snacks (e.g., chips, nuts,) but no evening food.  That wasn't a problem as there were lots of restaurants nearby.  Air conditioning in the rooms was set for ~22 Celsius (reception staff confirmed), that was a little cold for us in early December so we spent some time keeping the temperature up in our room - not a big deal but just something to be aware of. All in all I would definitely stay here again and would recommend to others, the staff were great, rooms were clean and looked new and it was good value for money.",5,2022,12,26
212,Really Nice,"Hotel was lovely, staff are brilliant especially juan. Highly recommend this hotel! :) It was brilliant. Nice clean spacious rooms and good amenities. Nice central location. check in and out was easy!’",5,2022,12,23
212,City Center escape,"Great location, no fuss hotel with nice rooms and staff.
Very close to city center and all the shops.
Good quality rooms and all up to date facilities that meet all expectations .
Staff very pleasant and all facilities were clean and tidy.
Furnishings were fresh and vibrant .
Hotel probably lacked in athmosphere in terms of bar and dining .
I found the biggest dissapointment was the quality of the food at breakfast, service was good but food was very bad.
",4,2022,12,22
212,Nice hotel in a great location.,"This is a nice hotel in a fantastic location.

Tried to order room service but found out there was no food available outside of breakfast hours, not even something as light as a sandwich available - this was strange as it was around 5pm. Minimal snacks should always be available in a 4 star hotel during the day.
When ironing the trip switch went in the room so we called reception. One member of staff came to the room and was looking around confused as to what happened then left, this took about half an hour to resolve as it seemed staff did not know the whereabouts for the trip switch for this room. The delay was an issue as it caused us to run late for an event we were attending.

My girlfriend had left behind an expensive bottle of cream and when emailing reception she was initially told that housekeeping usually just throw out any beauty products but that they could check anyways. (Obviously check first before responding, it would be useful to contact guests with a quick phone call before binning it regardless as they might just drive back to collect it, and in general there should be some form of lost and found procedure) The cream was found but there is definitely a need for some training being put into place here.

Gave four stars as it is a lovely hotel with comfortable rooms right off St Stephens Green, but staff need the right training and the kitchen should have light bites at least available to in house guests throughout the day. ",4,2022,12,20
212,Manager Franklin was so friendly and kind!,"Amazing stay at this hotel. I would really recommend staying here. The hotel is beautiful, front of house staff were very friendly on arrival but we had the absolute pleasure of meeting the manager Franklin. He could not have been more welcoming and friendly. 
Thank you for such an amazing stay! ",5,2022,12,20
212,Dublin at Christmas,"We absolutely love this hotel for its location, rate, and cleanliness. The staff was top-notch and very helpful. We would recommend this hotel and stay at it in the future. It’s a proximity to shopping and public transportation were perfect!",5,2022,12,17
212,Stunning Hotel - once u don’t want to sleep,"Beautiful Hotel - Really Stunning Fitout - however you can hear EVERY conversation, Car, lorry and footstep that walks by outside on the street. I actually checked the windows at 3am to see if we had opened them by mistake.
There is also a lot of noise transfer from room to room.",3,2022,12,17
212,Great Drinks,"Had a great time good drinks, great rooms, and perfect location for exploring dublin, seen so much! had the server Alexander, He was super accommodating and friendly, would definitely return soon :)!!",5,2022,12,16

Great overall experience in a great hotel would definitely recommend. Location is great - short walk to the town and on St Stephens green",5,2022,12,14
212,Excellent location,"The rooms should benefit from a little more soundproofing but otherwise excellent location.
The service is ok but shame that there wasn’t any food served in the evening. Apparently planned soon. 
I will probably book in this hotel again.",4,2022,12,12

the rooms are good,modern and well equipped.the hotel could not be better placed for the best of central dublin.
best of all,the team running the place,a bunch of bright,very pleasant people who can’t do enough to make your stay confortable.
i recommend the green without hesitation.",5,2022,12,09
212,Bit expensive with no restaurant! ,"Really nice hotel with great staff 
Big downside was the lack of an open restaurant! Only told this at checkin.  Very disappointed with this! Bar staff however were really nice and helpful especially Alexander, Breakfast in the morning was very good also. Overall for the the price of the stay and no restaurant we felt let down by the Hotel really. ",3,2022,11,27
212,Dublin 22,"Beautiful rooms, biggest and comfiest beds, great service, friendly staff and it’s all in the heart of Dublin, Ireland. Had a great time! Will definitely be staying there again on my next trip to Ireland ",5,2022,11,27
212,A trip to remember,"Excellent stay, team were very friendly, had an issue with our safe and Peter from reception was very quick in fixing this. Location is as good as you could get in Dublin, everything on your doorstep from museums to attractions. Nice executive lounge to watch some of the football in while my partner rested. 

Breakfast was great, everything you could ask for, all that was missing was some black and white pudding? Strange in an Irish breakfast, spoke with the manager who assured me he would have this added to their offering. He also recommended a few “local” things to do as he lived around the corner. Some great insider knowledge for cafe’s and bars.

Overall a fantastic stay, no lunch or dinner currently on offer but given the location there’s certainly no shortage of options nearby. Keep up the good work",5,2022,11,26
212,Perfect location and hotel,"Amazing, friendly and professional staff. We arrived at 6:30 AM expecting to leave bags, they found a room right away! Great location next to St. Stephen's Green and much or Dublin city center. Daily breakfast included made it easy to get our days started!",5,2022,11,26
212,I thoroughly enjoyed my time at the bar,I was greeted by a smily blonde haired man named Alexander who was courteous and delivered a delicious pint of Guinness before explaining Irish drinking culture and ireland in general. I will definitely be returning before the end of my visit.,5,2022,11,25
212,A Highly Pleasant Stay At The Green,"I spent 10 nights at The Green with my family and we all had a very pleasant stay. The location is the best right on the corner to St Stephens Green Park and the shopping district. The foyer is modern and stylish with a lovely atrium to relax, do some work or have a coffee. Our check in and out went smoothly. The rooms were nicely appointed with extremely comfortable beds and high quality linens. The rain showers in the bathrooms were very enjoyable. It is noticeable that the hotel is trying to keep its carbon footprint as low as possible with no extra paper of waste which is pleasing. The breakfast is really great, everything is fresh and the presentation is very good. The breakfast service team were very friendly and happy to go the extra mile to exceed expectations. The team is quite international  and speak exceptional English. During the evening the breakfast space is turned into a very relaxing area where drinks are served. We enjoyed to have a drink here and watch the world go by from the glass windows. Most attractions can be reached  by foot from the hotel. Although the hotel is very centrally located it was very quite in the hotel and rooms. I can recommend a stay here.",5,2022,11,21
212,THe Wheelchair Guest,"Excellent staff.  Courteous and helpful at all times.
Car parking onerous.
Hurry up with lunch and evening restaurant facilities - inadequate presently for prices paid.  This is akin to B&B for £350 per night.
Excellent and spacious room.",3,2022,11,21

212,"Great Location, Great Staff",I just got back from a four night stay at The Green and I would definitely return. The location is fantastic and the staff could not be nicer or more accommodating. I would definitely recommend staying there. You can walk to literally everything!,5,2022,11,14
212,Great stay...,"Stayed at The Green whilst visiting Dublin for a rugby weekend.  Excellent hotel having recently been refurbished.  Great location convenient to Dublin City Centre and all of the attractions you may wish to visit.

212,Exceeded all expectations on amenities and value,The rooms were spacious and very clean. The bar area was bright and the breakfast delicious. The gym was well above average for a boutique hotel. The atmosphere and staff were very welcoming. I was planned to stay at a different hotel in Dublin later in my trip and switched back to this one because of the positive experience.,5,2022,11,11
212,Another great stay,Great hotel.  I have stayed here several times over the years.  Centrally located steps from St. Stephen's Green.  Rooms were spacious and clean.  Staff -- especially the front desk staff -- Jessica and Alma were very helpful. ,5,2022,11,07
212,"I'm a hotel snob, AND I WILL COME BACK HERE! :)","I've stayed in several hotels around Dublin city and honestly have found fault with them all: be it the paper-thin walls, dirty sheets and/or bathrooms, tiny rooms etc, but The Green really exceeded my expectations in so many ways. 

The hotel is recently refurbished and they've done an excellent job. The rooms are wonderfully spacious and spotlessly clean. The beds are luxuriously comfy and who can complain about complementary Butler's chocolates?!  

Parking is also close by and really easy to find and of course, the hotel is located right beside St. Stephen's Green, the shopping centre and Grafton Street for some retail therapy.

The staff were absolutely lovely, super helpful and just really seemed to enjoy their jobs and working with each other which is always good to see. I will definitely come back and recommend you make The Green your hotel of choice in Dublin city too.",5,2022,11,07
212,Good,"Clean and the best situation, personal are so kind                                                                                        
We felt really well there, everything is really close and you can walk to go to visit the city very comfortable, the breakfast is good but isn’t cheap.",4,2022,11,07
212,Breakfast not included for some ,"This hotels is very nice, very clean and comfortable king bedrooms ,myself and my husband also stayed here in September, at both occasions we paid €216 at a room only rate , we booked directly with the hotel, my family that were staying at the same hotel in November booked the same time and got it with breakfast and use of a room that had refreshments free of charge at a lower charge , I questioned this at the time of booking but the staff couldn’t answer just said we don’t do that price and offer. If we had added  breakfast onto out stay it would have cost an extra €40 , how can they justify this price ? 
It will question my stay here again ",2,2022,11,06
212,Beautiful and comfortable!,"Stayed here with friends. Rooms we’re beautiful (especially the bathrooms) and the beds were EXTREMELY comfortable!! Staff was friendly and engaging. Great location as well - easy to walk to main shopping area, park and restaurants. Would love to have had a smart tv in the room though so we could screen share or watch a movie.",5,2022,11,06

Hope to come back soon in this amazing hotel.

212,The Green Hotel,Great location being able to walk to everything we wanted to visit in Dublin. Very comfortable and excellent staff with quiet rooms. Special thanks to Pablo in the breakfast room and Jessica on reception for great service in looking after me at the Green.,4,2022,11,04
212,Very unwelcoming! ,"I have stayed here 3 or 4 times previously so I suppose I was not surprised at poor service but this stay was by far the worst service we have ever received at a hotel and we stayed in the best room! We arrived early and didn't expect the room to be ready - no issue. However being told check in wasn't until 4 and they would phone if room was ready before is not acceptable! Please advise staff of the correct times or change emails that go out as we had the same issue on check out! I could only describe the 2 staff on reception as 'dumb and dumber' as they clearly have no hospitality training or etiquette! The female that checked us out was no better in fact phoning our room at 11.30 to ask if we checking out - Check out is 12 as per email! Not once where we greeted on any occasion leaving or returning to the hotel so I coifk only describe the service as abysmal and not acceptable! The only redeeming features of this hotel are the executive lounge and its central location. Even then the executive lounge was dirty and not serviced regularly meaning tables hadn't been cleaned from the evening before. The coffee machine has never worked on any occasion we have stayed. The hotel served its purpose for us being so central but the unwelcoming, cold and quite frankly bordering on rude at times staff made it an unpleasant experience staying here. It would be very unlikely we would ever return as Dublin has so many other top quality hotels to stay at where 'service' is at the forefront and guests are made to feel welcome. It feels like a budget hotel but staying in a suite you are paying a premium price. ",1,2022,11,02
212,5 star stay.,"on arrival the staff were brilliant from the off. Was greeted with a upgrade and early check in. Very welcoming and warm. 

Room was very spacious and very comfy. Bathroom was lovely. 

The whole place, top to bottom was a fantastic establishment. From breakfast in the morning to drinks of a evening. 

Between the rooms there was great quiet seating areas. Ideal for working or general relaxation. I was just so impressed with the whole layout.

You’ll notice as you walk out/in, people that pass by envy the building you’re staying in. It really is eye catching establishment. 

We felt safe, we felt welcome. And most importantly we’d stay again. If you want central, you’ll want The Green. 

Thanks again!",5,2022,11,01
212,Wonderful Experience in Dublin,"I had my first trip to Dublin and stayed at the Green Hotel which is centrally located in the city. The hotel is lovely; public spaces, rooms and dining.  The rooms are extremely comfortable, clean and spacious. The hotel staff could not be more helpful, especially Jessica at the front desk. I highly recommend this hotel and it will add to your experience in Dublin.",5,2022,11,01
212,Charming hotel in the centre of Dublin,Charming hotel in the middle of Dublin. Lovely staff (Juan and Jessica) made us feel very welcome and the bar staff made a mean Aperol Spritz. Lovely bathrooms and very comfy beds. Would definitely stay again. ,5,2022,10,31
212,World-Class Hotel!,"This hotel is beautiful, super clean, and in a great location! And the staff were so amazing. They gave us excellent restaurant suggestions for the area and breakfast at the hotel restaurant was exceptional…best croissant I’ve ever had!",5,2022,10,30
212,Great city centre hotel,"Perfectly placed for all the attractions including an easy 10 minutes stroll from Temple Bar, this hotel was clean with very friendly and helpful staff.  Really comfortable beds and windows that open. We were able to leave our luggage in storage until late afternoon (due to early evening flight) which meant we were able to enjoy our last day unencumbered.  Definitely recommend this hotel.",5,2022,10,29
212,Convenient location,The hotel is very conveniently located.  It was perfect for our overnight stay.  The lack of a restaurant didn’t matter as there are so many eating places nearby.  The room was clean and comfortable.  The staff were welcoming and helpful.  ,5,2022,10,27
212,Modern chic and updated Hotel,"The Green Hotel boasts great proximity to the St Stephen’s area, a modern chic hotel aesthetic in the lobby and bar, and updated spacious rooms with an amazing bathroom. The service was at tentative and courteous, they upgraded our friends who had two kids to a more spacious room and the front desk was super helpful. Parking is self paid, front desk will give you thorough instructions to the car park and validate the ticket for a discounted rate.  We had a comfortable stay and we’re very happy with our overall experience.",5,2022,10,25
212,Lovely hotel,The staff were very friendly and efficient. They could not have been better. The hotel is stylish and the location very convenient. The road was a bit noisy at night but that’s to be expected from a city-centre location. ,5,2022,10,24
212,Very nice and quiet,The hotel is updated and very nice and quiet.  The breakfast and small bar area are big enough to never be crowded.  Desk staff is ver helpful and professional.  We visited a few other local hotels for dinner/drinks and were very happy we chose The Green,5,2022,10,24
212,Beautiful!,"Beautiful hotel, very elegant style. 
Jessica at the front desk was so welcoming and helpful. She was able to accommodate an early check-in for us as well as a room upgrade! She also arranged for our taxi very early the next morning. Only wish we were able to stay longer. Would highly recommend this hotel!",5,2022,10,20
212,:3nights in Dublin,"Very pleasant stay in a convenient area close to most sites in walking distance, Street noise was audible from the room and late into the night. Breakfast was good and all the staff members were polite and professional ",4,2022,10,20
212,Fab stay at this great hotel!,"Super pleased we chose to stay at The Green Hotel. Starting with our check in with the amazing front desk receptionist Paula Pereira, we instantly felt welcome and at home. 

Our room was tidy, modern, and clean. The bed was huge and so comfy! The walk in shower was lovely. 

The location of the hotel was so perfect for walking just about everywhere - we walked to Grafton Street, Temple Bar, O'Connell Street, the River Liffey, and to both the Molly Malone Statue and Dublin Castle. The area also has great public transportation options.

This was our first trip to Dublin and The Green Hotel has certainly added to the wonderful time we had there. We can't wait to return and we'd gladly stay at The Green Hotel again.",5,2022,10,19
212,Great hotel and staff,The hotel was beautiful and very clean. Jessica and Juan at the front desk were very nice and helpful. I arrived early and was just planning on storing my luggage at the hotel until check in time but Jessica was able to go ahead and get me checked in. Will definitely stay here again and recommend this hotel to others looking to stay in Dublin.,5,2022,10,18
212,An excellent hotel,"The Green was our first exposure to Ireland, and after arriving on an overnight flight, being allowed to check in early and get a few hours of sleep before starting our day was very welcome. We found the room large, the bathroom modern, the hotel quiet, and the staff terrific. They couldn't have been nicer. We would absolutely stay here again.",5,2022,10,16
212,loved our stay there,"Great location, delicious breakfast, helpful staff...and my room was enormous! I quite enjoyed the breakfast buffet every morning, and being centrally located really made it easy to see the city. Would certainly stay there again.",5,2022,10,15
212,Stay at The Green,The Green was a wonderful hotel located in a great area of Dublin. Lots of good food/drink/coffee nearby and the beautiful St. Stephen’s Green park just across the street. Staff was truly incredible and friendly! ,5,2022,10,11
212,Won't stay there again.,"We stayed in an executive room with a view.

The room was clean but was damp and cold. Staff told us they could not turn up the heat and offered us nothing else when we mentioned the humidity in the room. 
We were surprised by the view or the lack of it.
Duvet cover made us sweat a lot during the night which was not pleasant with the cold and damp. All the windows were fogged up in the morning after we slept.
A lot of street noise came through windows and interrupted our sleep a few times (traffic, people drinking, & work being done outside).
Bathroom and shower were excellent.
Breakfast was good and the staff were nice but we were really disappointed with the quality of our stay. 

Would not recommend a stay here to a friend.",1,2022,10,09
212,Great hotel - but soundproofing to improve,"Great hotel, from design and breakfast choices and quality
Staff very professional. However, Noisy. I didn't sleep night 1
Please avoid room on the street, and avoid client snoring (wall soundproofing?)
By chance, staff moved me to another room (horrible view however)",3,2022,10,06
212,Beautiful Hotel,"We were very pleased with The Green Hotel, very clean and comfortable, beautifully decorated and wonderful staff. Bar should work some 'Specialty Cocktails for the Green Hotel', and promote at the front, to draw guests in, as we were not too drawn in to go in, initially, as it was very quiet and not sure if it was open, but loved the bar staff and ambiance when we did. They should do a nice Tapas Menu, when they get the restaurant going. The Hotel is a Beautiful place to stay.",4,2022,10,05
212,"Great location, great hotel!","This hotel was everything we needed!  Hard to find a newer, reasonably priced hotel with a fitness center in Europe, but this one has it!  Everything was clean, our room was spacious, breakfast was a lovely buffet with great selection!  We noticed plenty of large tables tucked away in secluded areas that would be perfect for spreading out for work or meeting with a client/colleague, plus there is an executive lounge.  The hotel does not have a full restaurant, which seems to be something most of the high-end hotels offer, but the bar is open during the day for pre- or post-dinner drinks.  Besides, the area is crawling with restaurants & nightlife:  other hotels with restaurants on St. Stephen’s Green, other restaurants & pubs on the Green & in the immediate area, entirely walkable.  We prefer to get out & explore a city anyway, so we never eat at our own hotel.  The staff has water bottles always at the front desk, and were so helpful lining up taxis when we needed them.  Our room did not have a tub, just a shower; we don’t take baths, but if that is important to you, you might inquire whether any rooms come with a tub.  Overall:  GREAT location, new/clean, fitness center, multiple work areas, great breakfast & spacious rooms!  You’re welcome!!!",5,2022,10,04
212,Best of Dublin,Great hotel. Conveniently located to anywhere you might want to go in Dublin. Beautiful rooms and lovely dining space/bar adjacent to the lobby.Definitely have breakfast at the hotel. Staff courteous and most efficient. ,5,2022,10,03
212,Wonderful Hotel,We really enjoyed our time here. Everything was very comfortable and clean. The staff were all very friendly and helpful. We liked the location and had some lovely walks around the parks and neighborhood nearby. Very convenient to a lot of options. We even had to extend a night due to a cancelled flight and the front desk staff were very nice in helping us sort that out even though it wasn't showing availability online.,5,2022,09,26

212,Pleasurable first time stay,"Fantastic first time stay at this hotel in Dublin.  Updated, clean hotel in a great location close to key sites, shopping and restaurants in Dublin.  Staff was extremely welcoming and helpful throughout our multiple day stay.  They also went above and beyond to help us get items of sentimental value we inadvertently left at the hotel post check out.  They packaged them and helped us coordinate the pickup and delivery of those items to our next place of stay in Ireland.  Reception staff (Alex and all others) as well as cleaning staff who found and secured our items all did a fantastic job.  We highly recommend this hotel and would stay here at a future trip to Dublin. ",5,2022,09,22
212,Weekend Stay,"Newly reopened lovely facilities staff helpful but still adjusting to new set up and, at time of visit, only breakfast dining available, no lunch or evening meal capacity. Location meant this wasn’t too much of an issue as there is multiple dining opportunities.",4,2022,09,21
212,Superb boutique hotel,"Stayed here twice in September. Lovely hotel for location, interior design, superb breakfast, and the wonderful staff: friendly, well informed re Dublin. Jessica especially, who was amazing when we needed late night crisis help, and lovely Melanie, who keeps everything running at the highest professional standards. Can’t imagine staying anywhere else now in Dublin.",5,2022,09,21
212,Amazing location,"A newly reopened beautiful hotel in a fantastic location.  If you want to see all the sights south of the Liffey this is a perfect spot. Peter at the front desk was especially great. I had an amazing room with a balcony. Very pleased with everything, especially since they have only been reopened for 3 weeks. ",5,2022,09,16
212,Great Modern hotel at great locaton,"The Green is in a prime location of city center and it's rooms are modern, very well designed and comfortable. Breakfast was good, plenty of choices, both cold and hot. Servers were very attentive as well.

Front desk personal were very helpful when I asked for direction and restaurants to go.  

Overall great experience and will stay there again when I visit Dublin.  ",5,2022,09,13
212,Best Location In The City Of Dublin,"The location is very strategic which is in the city area of Dublin which is walking distance to attractions. Varieties of food in the nice ambiance of restaurant with friendly staffs. The room is big and clean with nice green color bathroom. Overall, I give 10/10 rating for the hotel.",5,2022,09,11
212,Won’t be going back.,"This hotel opened well before it was ready. Rooms lacked standard amenities - coffee makers, refrigerators, even toilet paper holders. The bar was under supplied, lacking many things on the menu. Staff were not trained. A terrible experience, despite the great location. Won’t be going back. ",1,2022,09,07
212,Gem of a hotel!,What a gem of a hotel! Melanie (GM) and her team made our visit to Dublin extra special. Thank you all for the special touches that made the start to our Irish adventure so wonderful. Special shout out to Juan got the amazing cappuccino each morning!,5,2022,09,04
212,Excellent hotel and courteous staff,"Very nice modern hotel.  Bathrooms, gym and bar were nicely decorated and exceptionally clean.  The beds were very comfortable and the staff was alway courteous and accommodating.  Excellent stay,  and great location.",5,2022,09,02
212,Great location and a comfortable stay,"The green is newly renovated with very comfortable beds and clean rooms. The location was also great  - on a quieter corner near St. Stephen's green, but just a 5 minute walk to bars, restaurants and shops and only a 10-15 minute walk to temple bar. The staff was incredibly friendly and helpful. ",5,2022,08,31
212,Just too Expensive,"Positive: Location and room AC (rare). Negative: No complimentary breakfast, Expensive. Summary: we found hotels around Ireland for 1/2 price, clean, with great free breakfast (even in Dublin). Next time: stay further from town center, utilize abundant public transport more!",3,2022,08,29
212,good spot in Dublin,"all in all a really good spot, great location close to everything.  I would say that the rooms above the street can be very noisy due to a club being so close so it was very difficult to get a good nights sleep.

But a really nice room and lots of things very close",4,2021,09,03
212,Perfect base in Dublin,"The hotel is a very solid 4 star Property. The location is excellent. Just a couple of blocks from Grafton Street. The rooms are spacious, very comfortable and cozy. The television is huge and has a wide selection of channels. Wi-Fi was complimentary and of a very good quality. Bedding was excellent and so was the toilet. It has everything you need. 

Breakfast was also very well served. It was also of good quality.

Staff were helpful and you can walk basically anywhere in central Dublin from the location of the hotel. I stayed for three nights and I would not hesitate in rebooking this property again.  It is not five star luxury, but you will not miss anything at all.

I would highly recommend it.",4,2020,05,30
212,Outstanding Hotel and Room,"A truly wonderful experience! Check in was simple and quick and when we arrived early they were about to give us one of our rooms without a bother. 
Our room was so big... It was brilliant, modern, clean, spacious and the bathroom was stunning. 
The staff were great with lots of advice and maps on hand to explore the city. 
Probably 5-10 minute walk to the centre which was nice to be away from the really busy streets, the park outside is beautiful too. 
I wouldn't hesitate to book again on a return visit!",5,2020,04,09
212,Nice Hotel in a Perfect Location,"We were scheduled to arrive in Dublin in the early morning, but check in wasn't until 3:00 PM. I contacted the hotel to inquire about early check in, or being able to store our luggage. Daniela responded immediately and said they would accommodate us the best they could. Upon arrival, she met us and true to her word, allowed us to store our luggage until the room was ready. We were able to go out and explore St. Stephen's Green, right outside the hotel, until our room was ready. The room was nice, the bed comfortable. Felipe and all the staff were friendly and helpful. The full breakfast buffet was delicious and we were welcomed warmly even during the challenging time of COVID social distancing.",4,2020,04,03
212,Great Hotel,We arrived just as the Covid-19 virus took hold of the world. The staff were only too obliging to assist us where ever possible and made our time in Dublin as enjoyable as possible. Felipe on reception is an asset to the hotel and could not do enough for us during this time of uncertainty. Rooms were clean and modern. Hotel situated within walking distance (10mins) to city centre and attractions. If ever I have a chance to return to Dublin I would not hesitate to return to this hotel.,5,2020,03,30
212,Location to Grafton Street,"Excellent rooms, first rate showers. Staff was friendly and helpful, especially Felipe. Good breakfast. Easy walk to Grafton Street, museums, and even  Temple Bar.

212,Superb hotel,"We had a great stay at the green hotel. The staff were just superb especially the front reception and the young lady in the bar was so polite and friendly. The room was just awesome. Only downside was the breakfast, looked like it had been there for a while. But overall it was just great.",5,2020,03,17
212,Green Hotel Dublin,"From arriving the friendly reception staff and other members of staff were fantastic, Beds are so comfortable and the rooms are a good size. Breakfast was a full cooked breakfast or other choices. As we were leaving early for our flight they even prepared sandwiches water and fruit as we were missing our breakfast. A wonderful hotel close to all the main streets trams and buses. It’s not the cheapest but I would go back to it  when I return to Dublin.",5,2020,03,10
212,Dublin 's fair city,Great location close to shopping food night clubs.Cosy bed.Lovely staff who couldn't do enough for us both. Clean and neat.  Modern interior design.Bar was welcoming and lively atmosphere.  I will definitely be back,5,2020,03,08
212,Amazing food & even better service!,"We booked for a small wedding party (9) for an early dinner. The wonderful staff could not have been more accommodating, going the extra several miles to dress our table and make everything perfect. The food was absolutely delicious right across the board and the service was spectacular. I can not recommend this venue enough. Thank you so much!",5,2020,03,06
212,"Beautiful, clean, great location, fantastic service","My colleague found this hotel randomly in an online search and we are so happy she did.  The hotel is located just a couple blocks away from Grafton street, so it's in an extremely walkable area.  The rooms are clean, food is excellent, and the service is amazing.  Tip:  When we booked, a bottle of Prosecco was included as well as breakfast.  Highly recommend!",5,2020,03,05
212,"Beautiful place, beautiful people","I stayed at The Green on a business trip. Greeted at the door by Colm and Felipe who immediately made us feel welcome with their friendly and professional engagement. The rooms are beautiful and I just LOVED the bathroom. We wanted something light to eat that evening and the restaurant and kitchen staff modified the menu to suit our needs, all washed down with a delightful bottle of on the house Prosecco. Breakfast was lovely. Was so nice to be waved off by Felipe after he checked us out and booked a taxi. Really impressed with my stay and now have favourite hotel in Dublin for the next time I visit. Thanks Colm and Felipe!",5,2020,03,01
212,Fabulous!,"Stayed here for three nights over last weekend!

Great staff, good breakfast, a relaxing experience. 
Only issue was with the air con. Difficult to set up. But reception were on hand to help",4,2020,02,20
212,Best experience in Ireland,"Absolutely fabulous hotel room, pictures didn’t do it justice. We were thrilled to have the executive lounge- free drinks and snacks- while the weather was bad. We really enjoyed the breakfast; it was super fresh and all the hot food was cooked perfectly. The staff were beyond helpful and took our bags after we had checked out for the day while we were in the city. 
We have a house in Dublin but decided on staying in the city as a treat for Valentine’s and we weren’t disappointed. Great location.
Would recommend 100% to couples or anyone looking a for a night away.",5,2020,02,19

212,"Nice hotel, pleasant room,","This is a lovely Hotel. It is in a Great location, close to St. Stephens Green, Grafton st, Georges Street where there are quirky restaurants and traditional pubs. It is in walking distance for shopping, Theatre, Night Clubs and it is close to a LUAS (Tram) stop if you want to dart across town or out to the suburbs. 

Staff are friendly, great breakfast, Nice rooms",5,2020,02,16

Very nice person. Good luck to him!!!",5,2020,02,15
212,Wonderful hotel,So luxurious clean and so well placed.  Staff were so helpful and the best breakfast in town.  The room was so clean and the bed was so comfortable and was massive. The bathroom was most unusual and quaint.,5,2020,02,15
212,Disappointed,"Thought location would be good for my meeting next day but was quite disappointed. 
Room was cold and heating only came on when I put card in electricity slot on entry. Air conditioning heated up and then went back to cold air. Room cold in the morning.
Room 1100 not good either if you want to get some sleep.  Trsffic noise all night at very busy street junction for Stephen's Green.
Breakfast hot food a little cold.
Will not book here again",2,2020,02,14
212,Good but could be better,"Firstly, wonderful staff in this hotel, everywhere. Nothing was too much trouble. We asked for a late checkout and this was no problem. We arrived early but in a couple of minutes our room was ready for us. We had booked a junior suite, which had plenty of space... but the main bedroom was very dark with little natural light. Beautiful bathroom and a spare bed had  already been made up in the sitting room. Executive rooms and suites have access to a private lounge on the 4th floor. Its a private space but somewhat soulless. Complimentary coffee and tea, wine and beer, but it's not an inviting place. We much preferred the bar on the ground floor - more bright and airy. We ate out in the evening. The main disappointment was breakfast the following morning. We ate at about 9am and although there was a good choice it was obvious that the food (buffet style breakfast) had been sitting around for some time. The hot food in the chafing dishes was long-steamed and very unappetising, pastries were more than a little stale as they had been sitting out for some time too. At checkout I mentioned to the receptionist about the breakfast - she was most apologetic and said I should make sure to review the hotel on Tripadvisor as they needed to understand what could be improved...so here I am. All in all, I like the place. Location is great, two skips and you're in Grafton Street and the service is very personable. I understand that the hotel will close later in the year for refurbishment. This could be a really lovely hotel  - I hope they make the most of it,",4,2020,02,10
212,Home from home,I stay here most weeks as I travel for work to Dublin. Carla and the team do a great job of making it feel like my home from home. Great service. Great quality food and feel to the place. And always a smile to welcome you back. Thanks guys!,5,2020,02,10
212,Thank you Felipe !,"We had a lovely stay at the Green : clean, modern, quiete, delicious breakfast.
Special Thanks to Felipe who is So Kind, always smiley and ready to help you to find the Best for you during your stay at Dublin ! We had a Great New Year’s Eve.
Bravo and thank you Felipe !!

212,One night stay,"Stayed for one night whilst visiting Dublin to see a band. Lovely hotel in a very convenient location, walking distance to all main attractions.

212,Fabulous stay in the heart of Dublin,"First stay in the Green and we will definitely be back.

Lovely spacious room,  really comfortable bed and a gorgeous waterfall shower.",5,2020,01,19

I plan on staying here again next time.",5,2020,01,13
212,The perfect hotel!,"I first stayed at The Green in June when I was in Dublin to see Elton John. I returned this week as my mom and I are in town to see the panto. I can’t sing enough praises about this hotel. From the location to the accommodations to the wonderful staff (especially Felipe!), our stay was just perfect from start to finish. Already looking forward to my next visit to Dublin, which will of course include a stay at The Green! ",5,2020,01,11
212,My new go-to hotel when in Dublin,"Stayed here for first time, and glad to have discovered the hotel.  Main reason for choice was location and it's in a great spot, with easy access to the offices l needed for work and to head out to explore the town briefly.

Staff were welcoming and kindly arranged a quiet room as requested.  Room was massive, clean and comfortable.  Had dinner (and very nice glass or Merlot) in the bar, which was very tasty.  Didn't get to try breakfast as had early meetings that day.

Will def return",5,2020,01,10
212,New go-to hotel in Dublin!,"I visit Ireland often - and have stayed at many hotels around Dublin. Those days are over! Stayed at The Green for several nights and have found my new 'home away from home.' The property itself is beautiful - modern, spacious, and glamorous. I found myself often pointing out design details and saying ""I'd love that in my home!"" In addition to a beautiful property, the staff were all lovely. Felipe was particularly wonderful and the perfect person to greet us when we arrived at the start of our stay. He was friendly, professional, and took great care of a couple jet-lagged travelers. :) The location of the hotel can't be beat - you're steps away from Grafton street, pubs and shops galore, and much more. Can't recommend this hotel enough!",5,2020,01,08
212,Lovely place for dining,"We arrived just coffee but it turned into easy and delicious dining, we drunk green soup same as the hotel name 😉 and chicken. Normally we can eat just halal type of meat or chicken thanks to Gaye, she asked for us and we tried chicken, it was delicious. ",5,2020,01,08
212,Drinks,"We came the restaurant with our friends for drinks. Gaye and Micheal were working in the bar, they were so kind and friendly. Coctails were amazing
And also i have never seen this kind of nice restroom,  thank you guys",5,2020,01,08
212,Anniversary break ,"We stayed in The Green just before the New Year for our 25th wedding anniversary. We had booked an executive room and were delighted to discover on arrival we had been given a room with an amazing wrap around balcony overlooking Dublin.The room was huge and was great with a lounge area and a gorgeous refurbished bathroom ,we also had access to the executive lounge with complimentary drinks!I can’t praise the hotel enough the staff were so friendly and helpful.The bar/restaurant area that the breakfast is served was contemporary and comfortable with a nice mixture of fruit,yogurts,pastries and cooked breakfast that would suit anyone . We used the Qpark parking facility nearby that was discounted to €20 a night by the hotel.The hotel is so central in a nice area beside St Stephen’s Green and within walking distance to everything.We would definitely stay here again and it just made our anniversary so special!❤️",5,2020,01,05
212,Perfect Dublin location,"The Green hotel was fabulous.  Great rooms and an excellent bathroom.  The location is perfect.  Walking distance to everything, but still quite in the rooms.  Beautiful bar and Michael was the perfect bartender.  Felipe at the front desk was always helpful and courteous.  He gave us suggestions for lunch and dinners that were perfect.  He truly make our holiday special.",5,2020,01,05
212,The green hotel,"I spent a weekend in this fantastic hotel which actually surprised me, especially for such amazing service. Felipe , in the reception, was so resourceful, gave me such nice tips about the city, made me stay so pleasant. Would come back as many times as possible.",5,2020,01,04
212,Excellent Location,"Friendly staff, they greeted us every time my wife and I walked in or out of the hotel. We      did day trips and saw many sites while in Dublin, to come back to a comfortable room daily was a pleasure, great rain fall shower, King size bed was wonderful and fresh water, tea, coffee and a pack of ginger cookies that my wife would eat daily. We never ate breakfast as we were up and out, but the night cap was welcomed once in for the night along with the Red Bull near the front desk as you entered or departed. You will not go wrong with the location as it is right across from the park, a short three minute walk to the main shopping area and restaurants are close any where you decide to walk. Great Tapas restaurant nearby and for anyone who wants a good burger, WOW burger is down the road. Again, great hotel with a friendly staff and location, location, location!!",5,2019,12,27
212,"Fantastic, Friendly, and Felipe!","I frequent this hotel a lot for business and have always received a great experience. However, this week Felipe went above and beyond to make sure that the week before Christmas was extra special. Thank you Felipe. I look forward to staying at the Green in the new year!",5,2019,12,19
212,Weekend trip!,"The hotel meets the standards of photos, great place and a charming atmosphere, rooms were absolutely clean and amazing food served. I cannot forget to thank Felipe at the reception that was always upfront and really helpful whenever I needed, great customer service!!! 
The hotel is situated in the heart of Dublin and really easy access to restaurants and sightseeing! 

Great experience, really recommended!

212,"Really amazing service by Carlo, loved this hotel","My room was amazing and very clean. Location was absolutely perfect, you can walk practically everywhere from it. The hotel was gorgeous and people in it were lovely. Really helpful and always there to help you with anything.",5,2019,12,17
212,Really great service by Denis and Felipe. Melroycoelho,"I regularly stay at the Green

Denis at the front desk does an amazing job at making sure I am well taken care of.

Felipe, António, Daniela and Carlos are awesome 

The Green is centrally located in the heart of Dublin",5,2019,12,15
212,Impressive,"Stayed here when in town for a show. Was here a few years ago and thought it was decent then, but things have changed and it’s now way beyond decent. Our room was spacious and stylish with a large comfortable bed and a lovely bathroom. Public areas were all pleasant and the breakfast was superb. Fantastic location for the city centre with handy parking at Q Park Stephens Green. Highly recommended and will definitely be back. ",5,2019,12,14
212,Perfect location,"We visited The Green for a girls weekend. Some shopping and catching up. We were greeted by Filipe who was just amazing! Super friendly and so so helpful. The room was spotlessly clean and a generous size. The beds were very comfortable and there was little or no noise issues. The bar was pleasant and inviting. 
Apart from Filipe, the best thing about The Green is its location. It is ideal. Perfect for shopping, socialising, doing the tourist thing. Just perfect! Would highly recommend!",5,2019,12,10
212,Orla at the bar is AMAZING ,Stayed here with friends and orla at the bar was nothing but accommodating! She was so kind and helpful and even gave us some great dublin tricks! Will definitely be back to visit orla!!the atmosphere was beautiful as well as the people around ,5,2019,12,08
212,So comfortable ,"The rooms were so comfy and the bed was glorious to sleep in! 
The hotel is clean with good facilities. 
Staff are helpful and friendly. 
Location is perfect and in walking distance of lots of eateries and shops. 
The bar was nice, but had a distinct smell of drains which was a little unpleasant particularly when we were eating breakfast in the same smelly area. 
I think this was down to a faulty pipe which I believe was repaired during our stay. 
The hotel is perfect for a stay in Dublin and was proved reasonably. ",4,2019,12,03
212,Pleasant stay,"I stayed 2 nights and overall I had a lovely stay. Nice clean room, friendly and helpful  staff.  
Only criticism during my stay was the scrambled eggs both mornings at the breakfast buffet were awful.... they were dry, hard and lumpy. My evening meal was great.
I will return.",5,2019,11,28
212,Lovely!,"We had a lovely stay at The Green... wonderful location, charming facility, and most helpful staff.  Everyone cared for us well, especially Felipe, Daniel, and Connor.  Their breakfast is great, and in the evening, their Green Soup is the best.",5,2019,11,27
212,Top Class,"Stayed on Saturday night. Staff were extremely helpful particular on reception. Room was stunning, with an exceptional finish. It was our anniversary and they left us a fruit bowl and chocolates! Decided to have room service for breakfast and the tray charge was generously waved. 

Excellent location on the corner of st Stephens Green, perfect for visiting Dublin City. We’ll definitely stay here the next time we stay in Dublin.",5,2019,11,25
212,Good stay but not helpful staff,I stayed in this hotel with a friend and the room was very small. The staff not so helpful. Not very clean either. We had to ask continuously for things such as glasses or cups. We ate one dinner at the restaurant downstairs and the food was not good. The location is perfect though.,3,2019,11,12
212,Great Service As Always,"I rarely give a review and even more rarely review the same hotel twice. After a second great stay, I found The Green to feel like a home away from home. This I believe comes down to the great staff they have there, especially Felipe who remembered me from my previous visit. He had a smile from ear to ear every time I met him at the front desk, he was extremely helpful and above all genuine. It was a very comfortable stay, great location but it is the staff & Felipe that would bring me back for my third visit. I look forward to it!",5,2019,11,11
212,Great location,"The hotel is located across the street from St. Stephen's Green, and only a 10 min walk away from a big shopping area. Dublin is a walkable city and we didn't need to take public transit at all as the hotel was so convenient. Lots of restaurants around not too far away. The rooms are a bit old, but the bathrooms have been updated and are very clean. Would stay here again.",4,2019,11,11
212,The green hotel dublin,An amazing weekend at the green it is so central to everything. The staff are brilliant nothing is too much trouble. Will definitely be back. Daniel and all on reception make you feel welcome from the minute you arrive until check out they are always smiling and household staff are so nice.,5,2019,11,11
212,Awesome hotel,"Visited Dublin with friends for a few days. The Green is a beautiful hotel with great decor and bathrooms. It is really well located with high standards. The staff are exceptionally friendly, helpful and welcoming especially Carlos.",5,2019,11,10
212,Nice Hotel; Centrally Located,"We stayed 4 nights at The Green.  We were assisted promptly when we arrived and were given a room on the 2nd floor.  The room was fine with a king bed.  The bed was comfortable.  Our room was directly above the intersection outside of the hotel entrance, but we were not bothered by noise at night.  St. Stephen's Green is just across the street and it is a delightful park for a Sunday afternoon stroll.  The green charges $17EU for breakfast, so we found other places to have breakfast.  This was no inconvenience because there are plenty of places to eat around the hotel.  All in all it was a very nice stay.  We liked that there was a bar in the lobby.",5,2019,11,08
212,Awesome Hotel and Hosts!,"My coworker/friend and I visited Dublin for the first time at the end of October. We flew into Dublin and stayed at The Green for a few days before taking the train to Belfast to work with the team for a few days. Carlos was very welcoming, and answered all of our questions and provided us with recommendations when we asked about where to find particular items in shops, local events and of course restaurants. After working in Belfast for a few days, we returned to The Green for one more night before we flew back home the next morning and when we arrived, Carlos greeted us like we were long lost friends and gave us a big hug. He truly made The Green in Dublin feel like a home away from home. The two tending bar were both very friendly also. I've never stayed at a hotel where it feels so comfortable while being 5,000 miles away from home. The rooms were comfortable and I liked the cookie they provided for a night time snack at the end of a long day. The food in the restaurant is very good too. I highly recommend The Green!",5,2019,11,07
212,Awesome hotel!,It was amazing to stay here! The renovations are incredible and the rooms are beautiful! The hotel bar and restaurant is lovely and the front desk staff were great! Felipe was great! Great location and awesome atmosphere!!,5,2019,11,07
212,They are rude and awful!!!,We booked thru our travel agent a few months before our trip. When we got to the location they said they had to call the manager that he had to help with our booking. Reason: they shipped us to a sister motel which was more like a Holiday Inn than a 4 star hotel that we had paid for. However we didn’t know this until we got to the other hotel. Made our travel agent aware of the situation and he gave us a refund and apologized for the hand off and said they had never done that to his clients before and would not in the future either.,1,2019,11,06
212,Perfect location,"This is the perfect location, next to everything. Rooms are quiet, spacious, clean and neatly decorated. The hotel staff are very accommodating and would highly recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Dublin.",5,2019,11,04
212,Great option in Dublin,Nice central hotel with friendly and helpful staff. Breakfast and Room were excellent! Everything is close by and you still fell that you are in a quite neighborhood. I strongly recommend this hotel for family and business ,5,2019,11,04
212,Amazing gem!,Nice quiet rooms. The staff was excellent and made all the difference. The Pakistani gentleman who headed the restaraunt was very nice. The Chilean bar tender to the Brasilian lads. At checkin the Italian gentleman Felipe abad Maiachiapa were always going the extra mile. Loved it and it has now become one of my favorite hotels. Well done.,5,2019,11,03
212,Amazing! ,"Perfect location and very nice hotel. I think my only comment would be that they need to get rid of the carpets in the rooms. Breakfast wa great, stylish decor and evrything walkimg distance. The best though about the hotel was the people. All of them were excellent. Definately made the  extra mile.especially Felip was extremely helpful.",5,2019,10,28
212,A perfect place to stay while in Dublin,"While The Green is in a perfect location in Dublin, that is, right on Stephen's Green and within walking distance of so many places to visit and see, more importantly the staff at the hotel are extraordinary.  I was welcomed so warmly upon checking in and friendly conversations ensued every time I passed the desk while staying there.  They were helpful in all aspects as well with answers to any questions.  In summary, I felt very much at home!",5,2019,10,26
212,"Nice hotel, great location and excellent service","We recently stayed multiple days at The Green and we thoroughly enjoyed our experience.  The accommodations and food were very good, the location was central to all points of interest we wanted to visit and the service was first-rate.  A special shout-out to Carlos who made out experience that much more fun.",5,2019,10,25
212,Just okay,The accommodation is okay although the beds aren’t great. Nasty pillows. Great bathrooms. The big disappointment is breakfast. Rubbery eggs. Rancid-tasting bacon. Processed fruit. Just awful. You can do better nearby. Bar staff are pleasant front desk staff a bit dim. ,2,2019,10,25
212,Fab stay!,"This hotel was great. For the Dublin prices this hotel had everything we needed and more. The room itself was really comfortable and the bathroom was really lovely. We arrived early in the morning and understandably couldn't check in but we were able to leave our bags and we used the bathrooms downstairs to get ready (if girls are looking for good lighting and a nice open space for photos before a night out this is a great place). Once we were ready we headed out to explore. The location of the hotel is perfect to walk to everywhere in the city centre.
The chap welcoming guests into the restaurant wasn't all that friendly but that wasn't a major issue, we just went out for breakfast instead. 
Lastly there was one person on reception that made us feel really welcome ( I believe his name was Phillip). He was really friendly and made sure we felt well looked after so thank you.",5,2019,10,22
212,What an amazing kickoff to our Ireland road trip!,"This hotel is amazing.  After coming off our flight and arriving early in the morning we were treated to the Executive Lounge where coffee, tea, juices, water and snacks were available to us.  We just needed a little breather before we hit the ground running.  We visited Trinity College and the Book of Kells, Grafton Street and the Guinness Storehouse and Jameson Distillery.  The taxi drivers were also amazing and friendly and gave us some great tips on driving in Ireland as well as pointed out sights along the way.  The hotel staff was wonderful at calling taxis for us.  Nothing though, compared to actually getting into our room, which was lovely.  At the end of a very long day we opted to eat in the hotel restaurant.  The staff there were so hospitable and we enjoyed our meal and our last Jameson of the day.  Breakfast was wonderful as well.  We were given a warm farewell by the staff as we ventured out to pick up our rental car and begin our tour of Ireland.",5,2019,10,19
212,Great place and excellent service 👌🏽,"Great place, great location and an excellent service of all team. Very good location, close to all most important places.

I would like to make an special mention for Carlos, Hassan and Michael, you are really good guys!",5,2019,10,19
212,Friendly Service.  Clean Hotel.  Convenient Location,My family and I stayed for three nights and really enjoyed the hotel and its staff.  Staff was very friendly and welcoming.  The hotel is conveniently located for walking and seeing the city.  Would definitely stay here again.,5,2019,10,17
212,Great place,Stayed at the Green during our 3 day Dublin visit. Hotel is greatly located just near Stephens Green and the Grafton street for shopping and many attractions can be reached walking. The rooms are spacious and very comfortable. Staff is great. We shall be back.,4,2019,10,17
212,"Wonderful Staff, Great Location","We only had one night at the Green, but it was a great place to kick off our Ireland road trip. Weary travelers from the US were greeted and given access to the Executive Lounge for coffee and planning out our day, while the receptionist placed a priority on our rooms for the cleaning staff. After a day sightseeing in Dublin, and dinner ( sorted out by the reception/concierge I forget the gentleman's name. Working evening Sept 29th, 2019), some of us retired to the bar which is beautifully decorated and enjoyed Carla's passion for making Cosmopolitans. Very tasty, all three of them. I believe Conor was the young man's name who was also working that eve.  Both really nice and helpful. A nice quiet place for a nightcap after bustling Dublin bars. The breakfast was everything you could want and the room is a great place to wake to. Highly recommend this property. Thanks to all at The Green Hotel for a lovely stay.",5,2019,10,15
212,Perfect Hotel!,"Loved our stay at The Green!  It is situated in the perfect location in Dublin -- a close walk to everywhere we wanted to visit, yet quiet enough that the evening bustle doesn't bother.  The people who work there are amazing -- incredibly friendly and helpful.  Shout out to Felipe, who could not have been any nicer or more helpful with everything from dining to shopping, as well as Daniel, who also helped us find some great spots to eat!",5,2019,10,13
212,"Terrific room, good location","I spent 5 days here in August this year and was really very happy with the hotel.  I needed a small fridge for medication, and Colm, the Front Office manager, went out of his way to obtain one for me after there'd been a glitch with the Expedia booking. 
I found Colm and the staff very friendly and helpful, and the room itself was terrific - very large and light, with ample closet space and a comfortable bed.  A very nice bathroom too, with a large shower. The room was on the Executive floor, and having access to the Executive lounge was another plus.
The hotel has a good breakfast selection, with attentive and helpful staff, and free newspapers available in the dining room.
The location is good, as you're not right in the busy city centre, but easily within walking distance of all major attractions, and having St. Stephen's Green directly opposite makes for a lovely, quiet spot to sit and enjoy the greenery.
",5,2019,10,13
212,Wonderful hotel next to Stephen’s Green,"Taking advantage of a long layover to spend a day in Dublin, we were looking for a nice hotel in the heart of the city. It was simple and relatively cheap (7€ one-way or 12€ round-trip) to take the 757 Air Link bus from the airport to a block from the hotel - just a short walk to the other side of Steven’s Green.  When we arrived, Daniel was assisting other guests and we heard that the hotel was completely booked for the night.  Fortunately, we had reservations through Hotels.com, so we weren’t worried.  When we got in our room, the view was to a wall across the way. We immediately called the front desk explaining that the room was not acceptable.  Even though the hotel was “full”, they immediately found us another room with an open view.  The room was beautiful - recently remodeled - and quite spacious.  This type of service was repeated throughout our visit - quick resolution of any issues (which were few), great suggestions for local dining options and friendly conversations.  Daniel and Colm were wonderful hosts and made our stay quite enjoyable - along with the beautiful city of Dublin.",5,2019,10,12
212,Nice centrally located Hotel in Dublin,"Our party of 6 (3 couples) stayed here in October,2019. Location was great as was the room and service. Special thanks to “Felipe” at the front desk. He was very very helpful with directions and reservations. Would definitely recommend this location. Located in a very convenient location -very walkable.",5,2019,10,09
212,Outstanding location and very helpful staff - thoroughly enjoyed our stay,"We stayed at The Green for 3 nights during our tour of Ireland and we were very happy with the room, the hotel and the staff.  Our room was on the first floor and faced the street but the noise was nominal.  The bed was exceptionally comfortable and the room was quite spacious.  We did not do breakfast at the hotel, instead opting to try several of the nearby restaurants/cafes for breakfast.  The location was perfect - right in the heart of Dublin but located right across from a beautiful park.  I do recommend morning Matins at St. Patrick's Cathedral a short walk from the hotel. All in all a very nice hotel.",5,2019,10,07
212,Excellent Hotel with Helpful Hospitality Staff,We recommend this hotel.  Its location is terrific and the hotel staff is accommodating.  We wanted to highlight Daniela and Felipe.  They made us feel so welcome and provided us with helpful information throughout our stay.  My wife and I look forward to returning one day.,5,2019,10,06
212,Old and New,"The Green Hotel is conveniently located right across the street from St. Stephen's Green making it easy to walk to tons of bars and restaurants in the city.  The people who work here are fantastic.  Philippe at the desk is very sweet.  He got a room early then move us there times due to issues with the air con.  The maintenance staff is also really nice as we met them due to the air con problems.  The lobby of the hotel downstairs is really beautiful and modern.  The breakfast is delicious.  The hotel rooms are variable while all the bathrooms are beautifully remodeled with green subway tiles and marble.  Our first room was spacious but smelled like chloral cleaner.  There was no view and only a tiny window.  We opened it to get rid of the small and later determined that is why the air con would not work.  The next room we had was on the front of the hotel with the train running out front with a ringing bell.  The air con in that room had a loud fan and both maintenance guys confirmed that it is not working properly.  So that last room we had was 1234 and it was perfect.  There was no amazing city view but the everything in this room was great.  The pillows in this hotel are flat and hard and should be upgraded,  But overall we found the place good value for money once we got the right room.  ",4,2019,10,03
212,Good Hotel - Centrally Located,"This is a long feedback with focus on all areas and services provided to me during my two weeks of stay at your Hotel. 

Location (5/5): Located centrally and right next to St Stephans Green Park. You can access lot of pubs within 5min walk. For folks who want to travel to the hotel from airport, bus drop and pick up is hardly 3min walk. Direct bus (747 or 757) is the bus you need to take. Google it. 30 min tops and is only 7 Euros. Taxi will cost you 40 Euro. 

Check In (5/5): Since the hotel was booked through a third party vendor, supported by my organization, there was no issues regarding check in. The room was ready, details were already captured, credit card updated and all of this took less than 10min. 

Lift (3/5): It's a damn slow one at times. They will have to upgrade for sure. 

Room (5/5): The room was cozy, clean and spacious. I loved the fact that there was a rack to keep your luggage. Another rack, below the Coffee maker was available for cabin luggage sized suitcases. Beds, Pillows and the 'comfort' were comfortable. The comfort kept you so warm that I had to turn the A/C to lowest temp. 

A/C control was easy to use and the temperature adjustable to my need. The only challenge I found was the time it took for the A/C to adjust to the new control. This is not just an issue just with The Green but with most hotels, so I'm going to ignore. 

Bathroom (4.75/5): My oh my. It was sparkling clean and spacious. I loved the way the shower and the tap was spaced. The tap is placed 5ft away from the shower. This means that you can open the tap, adjust the water temperature and then enter the shower. In most hotels, you have to do this while being right under the shower or extend your hand to reach the tap while your body stays away from harms way. 

There was enough space above the washbasin to keep all your toiletries. One thing I didn't like was the washbasin tap blocker (To prevent a rush a water pouring down, they keep a blocker). The issue is that it takes a lot of time for water to recede especially after you brush or shave. It's ridiculous if you have a partner waiting (I didn't have any). What I did was remove the blocker and brush. Simple. 

Room Cleaning (5/5): The room looked fresh and clean every day. I liked the fact that all you have to do is turn on a button, in front of the door (from the inside), to 'Make up your room' or 'Do not disturb'. Once you chose, there is a light outside the door that turns Green or Red. No need to use those paper clippers. If you turn the button towards 'Do not disturb' by accident and leave, there will be a note kept for you letting you know that your room has not been cleaned due to same reason. 

One thing I noticed was that they kept the windows open after cleaning. This meant that the room got cold fast. It took me two days to spot it and all the while thinking it was the a/c to be blamed. 

Gym (4.5/5): It's a small gym that's enough to workout for an hour. Loved the bench press machine and the barbell. Weights were also kept accordingly. What was little frustrating was that you couldn't adjust the height of your barbell. This means you can't do squat workout. Little bummer but most people don't bother about this. They come is for a couple of days and workout is not a top priority. 

Pool: No pool. 

Restaurant (4.25/5): I had breakfast at the hotel for all the days I was there. The food is good, seating is comfortable and the service is good. The spread is the same every day and that may be an issue for those who stay for more than 3 days. 

Reception (2/5): This feedback is excluding the check in experience. Everything was smooth at the reception except for two specific issue. 

1) While most of the days were sunny during my visit, one particular evening, it was raining. As I walked in the first automatic door, right after the initial carpet was placed, I slipped. Thank the Gods for not falling or hurting myself. Seeing me slip, the reception folks walked towards me, picks up the big carpet from the hall, places it in the area where I slipped and went back to their work. 

No apologies, no regret, nothing. I felt horrible. Such a bad response to what could have been a horrible incident. 

2) One night, around 10:30pm, I was walking back to the hotel. The automatic door didn't open for some weird reason (This happened only once in two weeks). I waved my hand and the person walked in. He looked at me and asked, 'May I know which room you are in Sir'. I mentioned my room number and walked in. Simple? 

The issue was with the manner he asked me the question. He looked suspicious of me. He asked me the question as if I didn't belong there. What the hell? 

I also have to acknowledge that this matter is my perception of the incident. May be he was doing his job and being protective of his hotel. However, he could have done a better job by smiling at me and asking, 'Sir, for security reason, may I get your room number please? Apologies for the inconvenience caused'. 

A simple smile and apology can go a long way in mending your relationship. 

Check out (5/5): I had an early check out 7am. So, I checkout out the previous night and that experience was smooth (ironic compared to the incident) 

Overall (4.5/5): Barring the incidents, I highly recommend this hotel for those who want to stay in a centrally located hotel with all the amenities and facilities. I would stay here again without any hesitation. Mistakes happen and all they need to do is work on it.",5,2019,10,03
212,A Great Time Had By all..........,"Myself and five friends had a wonderful 3 nights at the Green. Rooms good, service excellent, food of a high quality, and even if you don't stay there you have to see the ladies bathroom in the basement (I only saw photos of course!!)",5,2019,09,30
212,Excellent hotel,"My husband and I stayed in this hotel for two nights at the beginning of our visit to Ireland.  Our room was quiet, spacious and comfortable with nice features.  
The breakfasts were excellent with a variety of choices.  The front desk staff was very helpful and were willing to answer all our questions about the area.   
We were disappointed in the upkeep of the executive lounge which we paid extra for therefore the lower overall rating.  They were always out of coffee or coffee cups. I would let the desk know and I assume it was taken care of until the next day when they were out again.  

We also had reservations here for the end of our  visit but they had overbooked and didnt have a room for us. The manager found us a room at a sister hotel and paid for the taxi to transfer us to the new hotel and to the airport the next day.  That was excellent service. and appareciated",4,2019,09,29
212,An excellent hotel with very efficient staff,When I asked for a postage stamp the concierge took me to the door and showed me where to walk to the nearest shop. The food was excellent and very good bedrooms and bathrooms. No complaints here. There is a good bar and restaurant and the staff couldn't be more helpful,5,2019,09,29
212,Spacious room and bathroom,"The hotel is conveniently located close to the high street and Temple Bar districts as well as the tram. 

The rooms are nice and big and bathrooms are lovely and new. It’s a pity that cleaning of rooms whilst staying there was fairly poor and dirty crockery was left in the room for days. 

There is a nice restaurant/bar downstairs.

212,"Nice Hotel, Great Location","We stayed for 2 nights and had a lovely stay. The room was spacious and clean. The bathroom was awesome! We didn't eat at the restaurant, but it looked nice. 

The best thing about this hotel was the location. Central to everything and very walkable, but removed enough to be quiet. The staff was also helpful with our questions and with getting us cabs when we needed them. The hotel is a bit pricey, but it is a quality hotel in the heart of Dublin.",4,2019,09,26

212,Nice hotel in great location,"Had a very nice few nights at the Green in early September.  The staff is very friendly and helpful.  The rooms are quite nice, not huge, but well appointed.  The breakfast is well worth the cost.  Location couldn't be better for touring Dublin.  Everything in walking distance, and relaxing St. Stephens Green right across the street.  Thank you!",5,2019,09,22
212,Great Hotel in a Fantastic Location,We had a Junior Suite with access to the Executive lounge. Extremely comfortable room and the Executive Lounge was a real oasis.The location of the hotel across from St Stephen's Green was perfect. The park itself is really enjoyable and there are great restaurants all around. We really enjoyed our stay at The Green,5,2019,09,22
212,Great Service - Wonderful Hospitality ,"My wife and I experienced exceptional service from checking in, during breakfast, having drinks, and to getting information from the front desk about places to visit to restaurants. The staff was friendly and concerned about our experiences in Dublin. 
The culture of the hotel is clearly hospitality! ",5,2019,09,19

212,"""""Impeccable Customer Service""","First of all, The Green Hotel is a beautiful hotel located in the city center and within walking distance to everything. My husband and I are travelling around Ireland and then headed to the UK, with friends...we stayed at The Green Hotel for 6 wonderful nights and all the employees were very attentive and applied great customer service. i.e. providing take away breakfasts and coffee when leaving early morning for tours, all departments were helpful and kind. 
We left Dublin very early and boarded the Ferry to Wales, we discovered that my husbands c-pap breathing machine was left behind in the cab...the cab driver was kind enough to take it back to The Green Hotel so they could mail the device to their sister property in England for us to pick up! 
Felipe an employee at the hotel was the employee that answered the phone when I called the hotel and he helped me during the whole 3 day process from the time the cab driver dropped it off (he texted me to let me know) to personally taking the device to the DHL mailing place to overnight it, even texting me a copy of the receipt for tracking purposes!  He was so kind and patient and most of all so helpful...even though I have always had a good stay at the Green Hotel (2 times) I would never stay anywhere else because the employees they hire take customer service to the next level...Felipe's customer service skills are impeccable!!!! He has my vote for employee of the year!!!! Thank you again, Felipe!

212,Great location ,Adjacent to a park area and close to some great bars and coffee shops. I preferred this hotels location somewhat away from Temple Bar but  close enough to the city centre and key attractions within 15 min walk. Large room and brilliant bathroom. Friendly and efficient checkin. Quiet area and solid sleep. Comfy bed. ,5,2019,09,15
212,"Great Location, Friendly Staff !","We have been living in this hotel for one week with my family last week. When we arrived, we were greeted by Daniela who was so friendly and  welcoming. The Location is excellent and is near to  Grafton Street. The room was clean and spacious. During our stay, Carlos and Filipa who work at reception was very helpful and offered us a lot of advice. I would highly recommend this hotel in Dublin.",5,2019,09,14
212,No understanding of Customer Service - Avoid the bar,"I visited the hotel bar to have some food this afternoon during my lunch break. Having taken a seat, I was greeted by a server who took my order of a salad and a drink. Having waited 30 minutes for my food and observing several other tables being served their food, I queried the status of my order with the same server. 

The server presumably went to the kitchen to check on my order however upon returning, he simply went to the bar without speaking to me. I waited a few minutes and when he finally returned to my table, he gave a vague message that my food was on the way with no explanation as to what had happened or how long it will likely take. I asked if my order had been missed and there was again no explanation offered. I then asked to speak with a manager and was told by another server (who had joined the table) that their manager was missing and could not be located. I asked the server to try and find her manager as I was very unhappy with the service. I waited another 5 minutes and with no sign of the manager, I left. 

I did stop at the reception to notify them of my issue and did speak with the Manager at the front desk, however his half hearted apology was pointless. 

The meal prices at this hotel are very much on the high side (average 15 euro for a lunch course) and based on the quality of the décor, the hotel is clearly aiming at a 4 star market. 

Based on my experience, their service has a very long way to justify the price or such a rating. The wait staff are completely disorganised and in dire need of more training on how to deal with complaints. The fact the manager was missing and could not be contacted by the staff during the lunch period is ridiculous. 

I will not be returning.",1,2019,09,12
212,"Great Hotel, Amazing Service!","Stayed in The Green for 2 nights last week and I have to say that my wife and I had an absolutely 5 star stay. The Hotel is very well decorated and comfortable, the staff incredibly helpful, in special to Felippe who made it feel even better by going above and beyond In helping us find some great places to eat and visit in Dublin.

Final Notes:
Overall a great hotel to stay at. Perfect for a visit to Dublin city center. 

If I’m missing any categories you look for, let me know. :)",4,2019,09,07
212,Excellent service,"Stayed for two nights on business, room was very nice, food very good , but the best part was the service from the friendly staff. Nothing was too much hassle and I really felt my business was appreciated. A special mention to Felipe who was always in good mood and nothing was a problem.Will definitely be back and for Dublin and the central location the price was very reasonable. Thanks.",5,2019,09,05
212,Ok but not great...,"Asked for quiet room away from elevators, common areas, service closets and was assigned a room one away from busy elevator and swinging door to hallway...hence significant noise.  Asked to be moved and was accommodated but no apology and no assistance.  Not how we wNted to spend our vacation time.
Breakfast was hardly even mediocre...and after day 3 we were ready for any change although they we’re charging E17...make your own toast, pour your own water, and so on.  Restaurant deserted at noon and at night which will tell you the attractiveness of the food.  Need a new chef, new menu, new choices.  Couldn’t even get a scone!!
Would not go back!",2,2019,09,05
212,Exceptional experience,"Carlos is a wonderful soul, knows hospitality and is a great joy to meet after arriving at 0730 in the morning of 4th Aug. Exceptional , if it wasn't for him , I think I would not have enjoyed my one week stay that much . He also upgraded me to a suite and I was truly grateful for that ! Thank you ! 
The breakfast , however can be improved further. Its a little bland and lack of choices.",5,2019,09,03
212,Beautifully disappointing ,"My husband had booked this a birthday surprise and were booked in for two evenings over the weekend. We arrived early from Belfast so our room wasn’t ready but our luggage was stored away and our contact number taken to ring us as soon as it would be ready. By 3pm no phone so we made our way back and to our surprise room was ready for us. 

We checked out the executive lounge (which came with our room) and found it to be the saving grace over the two days stay. Although it was extremely warm, windows don’t open and with no air con it was a little unbearable at times but the beer and wine helped us cool down. It would benefit from being serviced throughout the day as at times it was messy, coffee machine didn’t work and if you wanted to use the kettle there was no way to fill it. 

Breakfast is disappointing in comparison to other similar hotels, service is slow and certainly not with a smile. Limited choice for anyone staying, hot food wasn’t of great quality. There is little atmosphere in the bar/restaurant so we stayed for one drink and headed out for the evening. 

Rooms are nothing special, especially as we were booked into one of the more expensive rooms you would expect a little more space and a balcony that you can use  other than climbing out the window!  Overall not the birthday experience that I imagined I think they need to address areas within the hotel. ",2,2019,09,01
212,Absolutely perfect location,"The Green was perfectly located off Saint Stephens Green for our visit to Dublin.  The staff was so very friendly and helpful and the amenities (including 24 hour access to executive lounge for coffee, tea, beer, wine, water and snacks; free drink on your first night; clean large rooms and bath; bar/restaurant on premises...) added to our satisfaction with the hotel.",5,2019,08,30
212,Fantastic place to stay and enjoy Dublin,"Exceptional hotel..... clean, helpful staff, great location..... everything you need to enjoy Dublin
We got there early and our room wasn’t ready so they stored our luggage and when we got back at checkin time our luggage was already in our room.
The restaurant has a great breakfast buffet",5,2019,08,29
212,Perfect city break,"Just say u stayed there for 2 nights the hotel was nice clean and modern, staff were friendly specially Felipe who went out of his way to help us in everything we needed, will definitely recommend and be back",5,2019,08,27
212,Great Location but not a great hotel!,"I contacted the hotel directly initially before committing to make a booking as I had few enquiries. I specifically asked if the Executive rooms had a bath to which Imelda Cullen replied stating that all the Executive Rooms at The Green had a bath and a shower. So I was naturally shocked when I finally got into our room that it had no bath! 

Check in was poor. We arrived early so I didn't expect room to be ready immediately but contact number was left to contact me when room was ready. This never happened and having returned from shopping all day just before I was somehow shocked to be told by Felipe the room was ready. So why didn't you contact me? 

Anyway after going to room and having no bath I went to speak with Felipe who tried to play it off with oh your room is nicer than the Suites (the only rooms that have a bath and a shower) which is strange as they are in hindsight after checking larger rooms. I also asked could the balcony be used to be told of course that's what they are there for! This involved climbing out a window to dirty unkept balcony. There are no table and chairs outside and rooms further down on both side had doors (presumably suites) so that was the balcony out! 

Whilst I believe this hotel has been refurbed more attention has been put on bathroom which was nice but shower small given large bathroom and water pressure not great. The room itself is very unremarkable with old tatty furniture which is badly marked and walls badly marked with marks and one which almost look liked someone had stuck their ass against wall and left imprint. Room was ok but if this as Felipe had told me was one of your best rooms I'd hate to see rest of hotel. Also it was my wife's birthday celebration and while a note had been left wishing her happy birthday on our table with a spoon either side I'm guessing they forgot to put whatever was meant to go as a surprise and it never arrived either!

The only redeeming feature to this hotel was the access to the Executive Lounge which again was not without fault. It's a beautifully decorated spacious room with nice comfortable seating area and a nice area to sit out of your own room. It was all self service but had a good selection of crisps, flap jacks, popcorn, soft drinks and best of all beer and wine. This was a nice touch and probably the only part that made staying here worthwhile. 
That being said it was unbearably warm, no air con and windows jammed shut and wasn't serviced regularly. Strangely on every occasion we used no one else was there but when we had been away for some time and come back nothing was tidied or cleared. The coffee machine didn't work during our entire stay. There is also no toilet nearby so you have to return to your own room. 

We had drinks on first night before we headed out for dinner. The drinks where ok but zero ambience or atmosphere in bar/restaurant even on a saturday night and we swiftly left. 

Breakfast is all very hap hazard and service slow and non-existent. The first day we had both asked for pot of coffee. This never arrived and half way though our breakfast I had to ask someone else. It's not a very busy breakfast service but still really slow at clearing plates and dishes. Cooked breakfast is ok, nothing special but not poor either. Coffee wasn't great. Toaster is very slow and no one helps or explains how to use. 

If I stayed again I would not include breakfast as it wasn't a treat. 

I'm unsure where all the rave reviews of service have come from on recent reviews as I didn't experience any. It wasn't poor but certainly not excellent. 

The only redeeming feature is the hotel location and the Executive room access and  would be the only reason I would consider staying again",3,2019,08,26
212,Great Staff,"I stayed here for two nights. Overall, the hotel is clean and has a great atmosphere but what really made this trip special was how accommodating Hassan was. He was extremely informative and made us have such a laugh!! ",5,2019,08,24
212,Reception ,I walked into the hotel and immediately felt welcome following my interactions with Carlos and Felipe on reception.... they certainly set this hotel apart with their charming helpful ways.... nothing was too much trouble and they left me with a great lasting impression of this hotel ,5,2019,08,23
212,Feeling KEEN at The Green!,"Dinner was superb and our server Orla was a doll! She was courteous and kind and super attentive. We ordered the Arancini Croquets, Burger, and Fish of The Day and they were all delicious! The ambiance is a DREAM and we can’t wait to come back and experience it all again!",5,2019,08,23
212,Lovely Hotel,"We stayed at The Green Hotel for two nights. The hotel was centrally located and the staff were very friendly and accommodating. Also, the hotel was quiet, which was good for us as we were travelling with a child. The buffer breakfast was also good!",4,2019,08,21
212,"A great location, immaculate rooms and  fabulous helpful staff","This hotel made our recent trip to the Dublin Horse show so very special. The rooms are great and immaculate The front of desk staff  (Carlos, Felipe, Daniela and Colin)  were always there to help and gave us great tips about what to see in Dublin and where to eat and all with a lovely sense of humour. Good breakfast and once again lovely staff in the dining room. Nothing was a problem!! We would stay again. Happy days.",5,2019,08,20
212,Nothing special and noisy from cars and other rooms.,"On a busy road in the centre of Dublin. Newly decorated average size standard rooms and bathroom with a shower. Big shower head but not much water. Not very special. 
Housekeeping is messy.
We have to call for a second towel. (no not in the drawer).
Restaurant without any atmosphere, the same with the breakfast buffet, nothing special and average quality. Hassan is quite unfriendly. 
Reception which you pass by every time you enter or leave the hotel but (mostly) no greeting to guests (even if we say loudly good evening). 
Complimentary Wi-Fi but when you access you agree that they use you for marketing purposes.
In all, nothing special and noisy from cars and other rooms. Next time another hotel in Dublin.",2,2019,08,20
212,"Very nice hotel with pleasant, professional staff.","We were in Dublin for one night to see Riverdance and picked The Green for its location and proximity to the theatre.  
The hotel itself is bright and airy and the room was great with a good sized bathroom.
The staff were very pleasant, they were courteous, professional and a special shout to Felípe on the front desk who was very helpful as well. The breakfast was a help yourself buffet and the food was very good and my only complaint was that the plates were cold, never a good thing with hot food. Other than that, would recommend the hotel no problem ",5,2019,08,17
212,Nice hotel,"After a few niggles which were put right straight away we had a wonderful time at the green. Great location near all buses ,airport  and hop on hop off bus.Very nicely  decorated and clean. Didn't try the food but the other guests seemed to be tucking in and enjoying themselves. Would recommend highly.",5,2019,08,15
212,Runcation in Dublin,"The Green was a wonderful place to stay. Great location and great staff.
We came to run the Dublin Rock N Roll Half Marathon and other races. 

Make sure to find FELIPE at the front desk. Fantastic guy! Gave us great suggestions for things to do, places to eat/drink, and was terrific with directions. If all hotels had a Felipe, travel would be so easy.
Thanks again Felipe.",5,2019,08,14
212,"Wonderful place, very nice staff","Can't beat the location, right next to all the good bars and clubs, but also just walking distance from all the sights to see in the South City. We walked to Aviva and Guinness and everything in between. Bed was great, bathroom was great, and TV and entertainment were nice. Did not experience their food or bars, but their downstairs bar looks wonderful and was always occupied by residents of the hotel.",5,2019,08,14
212,Room Theft,WARNING!!!!!!  Don’t leave anything of value around the room. I don’t like to cast aspersions but I don’t feel the staff hold the values the hotel should demand of them. What a disgraceful thing to do!!,1,2019,08,13
212,Fantastic! ,"Everything about this hotel was great! Looks classy both inside and out, good central location and the staff were lovely.
The room itself was grand - stylish and modern, very comfortable. 
We stayed 3 nights and opted to have the breakfast available, good selection. 
Would absolutely stay here again, definitely worth the money. ",5,2019,08,12
212,Great hotel and staff!,"We stayed here for two nights on our recent trip to Dublin with our two girls, ages 8 and 12. The rooms were wonderful and the staff, Felix and Carlos at the front desk, were so helpful and friendly. Recommend this to anyone staying in the city.",5,2019,08,11
212,Very Elegant Property in a nice area of the city,Very nicely finished property in both the public areas and the bedrooms. Beautiful bathroom! Excellent breakfast and attentive service from the staff. Felipe at the front desk in particular was very accommodating and a hoot to boot!,5,2019,08,08
212,Outstanding service (especially Felipe),"We booked a short stay here as we were meeting some US friends who were honeymooning in Ireland. 

Great location and beautiful decor in the rooms ad throughout. 

There was also a HUGE bed in the room which was awesome - and I loved the bathrooms (also, the washrooms in the basement are awesome)! 

One frustrating thing as the pillows....they didn’t match the luxury of the rest of the room. I did pass this comment on and this is something which is being looked into :)

The day we left, we checked out leaving our bag - and then a few hours later my partner started to feel unwell. We returned to the hotel and I asked if it would be possible to have a room for a few hours (our flight wasn’t until the evening). As the hotel was fully booked, understanding they dilemma we had, Felipe washed no time in providing us with access to the Executive lounge where my partner was able to rest and slowly start to feel a little better. 

Without Felipe’s understanding and willingness to go above and beyond, I am not sure what we would have done. 

Oh and to top it off I dropped my iPhone and the button wasn’t working so he even helped me get the on screen button on my phone! 

",5,2019,08,08
212,Irene123,Great hotel. Location v good. Comfy bed and pillows in spacious room. Very good quality breakfast and good choice. Carlos in particular deserves a mention. Very friendly helpful and welcoming. A bit pricey BUT worth it for a nice treat!!,5,2019,08,05
212,"Location, location","The hotel was lovely and an excellent location. However, beware if you are driving. Much of this area is only open to busses and taxis and very difficulty to get to by car. The hotel staff was great and breakfast was amazing. Bathrooms were modern and awesome.  Loved everything about The Green!",5,2019,08,04
212,Mrs Carol-Anne Hall,"Hotel is gorgeous. Front desk staff are very friendly and helpful. Buffet breakfast is delicious. Rooms are very clean and beds are very comfy. Every member of staff we met were courteous, impeccably dressed and informative. Hotel is 5 minutes walk from Grafton Street, so location is ideal.Will definitely be back to stay here again. 
.",5,2019,08,04
212,Excellent stay at The Green Hotel,"I recently booked the Green hotel for myself and my husband. It was his birthday and our 10th wedding anniversary. As a result of an email sent to reservations prior to our arrival we were complimentary upgraded to an executive room. Room 1500 was beautiful and spacious. Also a complimentary fruit platter and card for both occasions in our room. A lovely touch! The Hotel has been recently refurbished and the decor is fab Both Felipe and Carlos the reception staff were extremely helpful and funny!! Nothing was any problem to them. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone coming to Dublin, it’s location is unreal and central to all amenities in Dublin city and we will most definitely be returning customers!!",5,2019,08,04
212,5 star experience,"Had a lovely weekend stay at the Green - room was amazing, bathroom incredible, staff knowledgeable and friendly (Carlos in particular - thanks for the coffee!), location can't be beat. Highly recommended!",5,2019,08,04
212,Perfect Hotel for Stay in Dublin,Excellent location and staff.  Highly recommend.  Nice sized room.  Will stay there again if we make it back to Dublin.  Clean.  REALLY nice bathroom.  It was the perfect place for me and my daughter.  On site bar and restaurant that we used.,5,2019,08,03
212,"Good location, moderate hotel, lovely staff","The Green is a mid-level hotel that should probably not charge as much for their rooms as they do, but the location demands it. Perhaps if I hadn’t just stayed at The Wilder across town, I wouldn’t be as critical, but as it is, The Green pales in comparison to that hotel and, I’m sure, several others in the area. 

Staff: I need to call out the staff before anything else. They were all lovely. Felipe checked me in with style and timeliness and was even there again when I checked out and remembered me and treated me very well. The bar/restaurant staff is also friendly, sweet and funny. Due to my friends travels from America, we ended up eating in the hotel two nights in a row (more on that in Food) and the servers were hilarious and sweet.  So GREAT STAFF! :) Now...

Location: Inches from St. Stephens Green and Grafton Street. This comes with noise and bustle, as do any hotels in the area. Great for business, I’m sure, as it’s very near all transportation and locations. 

Property: Eh. It was fine. It’s a nicer spot than, say, the Radisson or other chain hotels, and certainly nicer than anything down near Grafton or Temple Bar. But it’s just...fine. I will say that I didn’t stay long enough to experience the gym or other amenities. So by all means, if you have, correct me. The style is actually nice. Clean, simple, with a good rehab of the bar/restaurant that makes it comfortable but stylish. That said, the public spaces could use a looksee. Shabby, most of them. Including an odd smell coming from the hall between the elevator and the Hampton wing. 

Room: I booked an executive king and the best I can say about it is the bed was, indeed, a king and the room was, indeed, an executive suite of some sort. However, it looked out right on Harcourt Terrace, and was on the first level, so street noise was at a premium. Also, the furniture was beat all to hell. The end tables were scratched beyond belief and tatty. Not only was there an absence of face towels (we learned later the hotel doesn’t supply them for some reason) but there was also just a single body towel and hand towel. It seemed to be an oversight throughout the hotel as my friends had the same experience in their room. The pillows were also weird. (Pic attached.) Like they put the covers on inside out on at least one. So I guess you could say housekeeping was “inconsistent.” As the pictures show, the room was well-appointed, and very good for a business traveler with a desk and spot for both suitcase and other bags. It was just...worn. 

Bar/Food: Here’s where this hotel might excel above others in the area. For two nights, my friends and I ended up eating/drinking here, and with one of them being a vegetarian, that’s no shake. The green soup was killer for her. The pasta I had was just fine. But her being able to get a good veggie dish won that night. The next night, our second friend joined us and was so jetlagged she just wanted anything. Again, the food didn’t disappoint. And the staff was fantastic. Our waiter the second night was...salty and funny about the menu and how the prices weren’t right and they had nothing on it. But we still ate well. It’s nothing to write home about, but it is comfortable, easy, and reasonably priced. 

I won’t likely book at this property again, mostly because I wouldn’t need to stay at the location/area, but also because there are better, cooler, less expensive, properties nearby. It’s a tad shabby for what you pay. :(

212,Great Stay,Location was perfect for visiting Grafton St and surrounding areas. A really nice part of the city. Service was really friendly on the front desk Felipe especially was super approachable and very friendly. Can't waitsh to come back!,5,2019,08,02
212,Fantastic stay,We spent 5 nights at The Green and it was great. Staff was helpful and  very pleasant. We highly recommend the hotel. Short walk to the centre of town and the main attractions. S/O to Carlos for helping with our every need! ,5,2019,08,02
212,Very Nice Location,"Generally very nice hotel. Welcoming staff, close to all services and a nice park. The only issue was that the elevator didn’t work for a couple of days which made getting to our rooms quite annoying. This must’ve been even worse for the staff who had to bring room service, towels, and luggage to and from all rooms. I’d generally recommend this hotel for a short stay. 30 minutes to the airport. ",4,2019,08,01
212,Great service,"Hotel located in central Dublin, rooms very cleaned. Must mentioned the reception staff which went above and beyond to make us feel really welcomed during all our stay. Felipe and Carlos, thank you for all your help.",5,2019,08,01
212,Excellent Hotel for Business Travel,"I stayed in this hotel for two nights just last week for a work event I was attending in Dawson Street in Dublin. The location of the hotel was perfect, the service I received from both Felipe and Denis was excellent. They both provided a great and efficient service to me when visiting this hotel for the first time. The room was very  comfortable and services provided where excellent quality. Perfect for a business trip, will definitely return. Well done The Green Hotel!",5,2019,08,01
212,Desk Service is Incredible,"I’ve stayed with the Green a couple of times now, and even early on Chris at the desk new my name.
Always friendly, and always ready to help solve a problem - a really good experience!
The rooms themselves are the best that I’ve stayed in, with incredibly comfy (and wide) beds. I look forward to staying again :)",5,2019,07,31
212,Extraordinary hospitality in a super location.,"Special kudos to Felipe, Carlos, Colm, Nyara and Chris at the front desk!

Located across from St. Stephens Park, the hotel is convenient to stores, Riverdance, restaurants and the hop on bus. 

Excellent value.",5,2019,07,30
212,The Green,"What a lovely hotel! Great location! Close to many restaurants, local and chain. Had traditional Irish breakfast at Gerry’s coffee house and great crepes at Goose on the loose. Spacious, modern rooms. Would definitely return!!",5,2019,07,29
212,Sophisticated calm.,"This hotel is extremely close to everything you could want to see
In Dublin’s city.
Unbelievable that it is so quiet.
There is a calmness as soon as you walk in.
Always greeted with a smile.
Very clean too.
Definitely worth staying here.",5,2019,07,29
212,Nice stay in centre of Dublin,"Had a nice and cosy stay in centre of Dublin city close to most major attractions 
The room was lovely and the breakfast was very good with fresh food and nice variety 
It is a bit on the expensive side however I found it worth the money as Dublin is not a cheap destination anyways",4,2019,07,28
212,Perfect spot for visit to Dublin,"Perfect location near Stephens Green, Trinity College, Grafton Street and much more. Modern and comfortable accommodations with very friendly and helpful staff. Great breakfast spread. Thanks for everything, Felipe!",5,2019,07,28
212,Nice hotel with great access to downtown Dublin,"We stayed at The Green on July 17 - 19 of 2019.  The room is very nice.  The bathroom was very clean and updated.  The service was excellent and the staff was friendly.  Our package included breakfast, which was very good and had choices of fresh fruit, cereals, pastries, eggs, bacon, sausage and traditional Irish breakfast.  The hotel is adjacent to St. Stephen's Green park and just a quick 10 to 15 minute walk to Grafton Street, Trinity College, Temple Bar and other points of interest in Dublin.  We felt safe walking in this area at all times of day and night.  I would highly recommend this hotel.",4,2019,07,27
212,The Best Hotel in Dublin!,"I recently stayed here for work and I cannot recommend this hotel enough! The food amazing,
The rooms amazing and the staff amazing! Special shout out to Felipe! He is honestly the most amazing person i have come across on my travels and I can not recommend him enough. He bent over backwards to make sure I had everything I needed! Thank you Felipe! I will be back soon 100%",5,2019,07,26
212,I really wanted to rate it higher but.....,"Stayed 5 nights. The positives: Hotel is well located. Rooms and common areas are clean and bright. Bathroom are very nice and modern. The negatives: Room key card did not work initially so back to front desk. Safe in my room did not work (electronics) nor was it secured/bolted to anything.  I or anyone else could have picked it up and walked away with it. I asked/inquired five times and was told it would be addressed. But it was not and after no follow up from any of the staff after two day I gave up. The bed is very uncomfortable. I rarely complain about beds. Sure sometimes the bed is too soft or too firm and that is not the end of the world. But in this case, I knew I was sleeping on metal coils. As well, the pillows are very very thin foam and more pads than pillows. I did not sleep well at all. The room radio, which is advertised as a room feature was not in the room. So the hotel is just okay in my opinion as it is safe and clean, but I can not recommend it.",2,2019,07,22
212,Great staff,"The Green was a great base camp for our time in Dublin.  The rooms were good and the included full breakfast was delicious.  But, the best point was the front desk agent Carlos.  He was extremely attentive and spent significant time helping to connect with the airline and the delivery service over a lost bag.  Over and above the expectations for service.",5,2019,07,22
212,Stylish and helpful,"I stayed at the Green Street or booking at another hotel had to be moved. The location was ideal and the staff were incredibly helpful and responsive. A huge thank you to Felipe, who got me out of a bind with my airline! Lovely place from which to explore Dublin",5,2019,07,22
212,Mona A,"My sister and I stayed in the green for four night. The hotel is beautiful, clean, centrally located, very quiet, friendly and helpful staff specially Felipe who went out of his way to help us out with everything we needed !! Thank you Felipe.   I highly recommend this hotel in Dublin. 
Mona from USA",5,2019,07,18
212,"Great location, lovely staff","Felt like this was a lucky find.  Great location, right across the street from St Stephen’s Green entrance.  Carlos, Felipe were incredibly helpful and friendly at the front desk.  Racquel, Lorena, and Michal at breakfast and at evening bar treated us like family.",5,2019,07,18
212,Nice visit - great service,"I recently stayed at The Green hotel for most of a week on a combination business trip and vacation.  The best about this hotel, in my experience, was the service.  The whole staff was very accommodating (I had to merge two back-to-back reservations) and did what they could to make my unusual booking seamless.  Additionally, Carlos was especially helpful in trying to get me on a particular local tour to join some friends who had already booked.  He made several calls and went out of his way to be helpful.

I will stay here again the next time I'm in Dublin.",5,2019,07,17
212,Perfect spot for Family Stay,"After extensively searching for a hotel located in central Dublin for our family of 4, I was lucky to locate The Green. The location of this hotel is ideal - a quiet spot right across from St. Stephen's Green and only a brief walk to major shopping and key sight-seeing, plus Luas and taxi stands just down the street.

Since our 2 children are young adults, we booked 2 rooms which the hotel staff kindly located next to each other at the end of a quiet corridor. The extra expense of choosing Executive rooms is worth it for the stylish, roomy, and secluded accommodation, as well as the added benefit of lounge access. 

That said, the Executive lounge is not what I had expected based on experience in other hotels: this one only provides granola bars, crisps, small cookies, and a varied selection of beverages on a self-serve basis all day long, whereas we are used to receiving substantial breakfast and evening snack offerings, along with service staff, in other Executive lounges. We did, however, enjoy having this space to relax and chat, or just spend a bit of time away from the crowds, and found that it was almost always vacant and so very private. 

The hotel staff were very accommodating and polite, especially front desk staff Carlos and Nayara who made the extra effort to ensure that we had everything we needed. The housekeeping staff were also some of the best I have encountered in terms of thoroughness and politeness, and I appreciated their efficiency and flexibility. 

Although a bit pricey, the buffet breakfast is extensive and worth it if you are big eaters. There isn't a wide range of choice for dinner items, but a nice selection for when you aren't up to heading out for the evening.

Thank you to all the staff at The Green for making our stay enjoyable and we hope to return some day!",4,2019,07,17
212,Great Location,Wonderful location. Loved our stay. All staff were very professional and accommodating. The rooms were spacious with ultramodern bathrooms. Excellent WiFi throughout the place. Lovely buffet breakfast. Omelettes made to order.,5,2019,07,17
212,Highly Recommended!,"I initially booked with The Mont (another hotel from the same collection) but they were unfortunately still undergoing renovations. However, they kindly booked me a room with The Green at no additional cost. The Green is a great hotel with a retro vibe/theme. Their customer service was exceptional and staff were always happy to assist with my questions and queries. The hotel is located at one corner of St Stephen's Green park and about 10-12min away from the main city area of Dublin. As I was checking out The Mont left a note and a bag of sweets to apologise for not being able to attend to my booking, which I appreciated.",5,2019,07,16
212,Worse experience of my life,"My now husband and I stayed here back in Feb and it's taken me this long to write the review as I spent months trying to get an apology from O Callaghan Hotels. We were home from London for a night. When we arrived the hotel was in a state of refurbishment which we believe it shouldn't have been allowed to stay open during. Our room was old and foul and the shower hadn't been cleaned, nor was there any toilet paper, we had to call down for some. 
However this was all stuff we wouldn't have been hung up on had it not been for the completely horrendous experience we encountered later in our evening. We arrived back to our hotel after dinner and drinks with friends, get to our room, our room key didn't work, went to reception, get it reactivated, get into our room and notice it has been disturbed.... and then we noticed our bed had been soiled.  We were in such shock we didn't know what to do and of course go to check our belongings. We called down to reception, no answer, nothing on several attempts, eventually we went down and the man said that someone came in staying they were staying with us and he allowed them into our room. This was without identification or any security checks. We still to this day don't know for sure who this is, it could have been a friend of a friend in the group or a stranger who overheard a conversation in a pub, we'll never know. the man offered not much in the way of an apology and in our state of shock returned to the room. 
We striped the clean part of the bed and has to sleep on the floor on towels. We woke up on a saturday super early to construction noise right above our room.... and swiftly went to leave. When we complained again downstairs she said to contact head office. No attempt of a refund or apology for allowing someone to break into our room. Completely vile.
We tried for several months to contact O Callaghan and get them to just simply say sorry and at the very least refund the payment of our stay and they did nothing. Utterly appalling hotel and service and one which breaches security of their guests with little to no regard for safety. Very concerning that they allow random people keys to guests rooms when there's the horror stories of people beating people in hotel rooms in the recent past. 
I would personally never stay at another one of this groups hotels , they have gone downhill greatly in the last few years, as I remember they used to have a good reputation.",1,2019,07,10
212,"Great Hotel, Exceptional Service","My spouse and I recently had the pleasure of vacationing in Ireland and stayed at The Green in Dublin. The hotel is immaculate in condition and is located in a prime location, very close to shopping, restaurant, pubs and sites of interest. More exceptional than the hotel itself was the service provided by the staff. Special mention needs to be made of front desk staff Dennis Rondini and Massimo Antonioli who provided helpful advice and assistance throughout our stay and made our trip even more enjoyable. I would certainly recommend this Hotel.",5,2019,07,09
212,Perfect location ,"From Carlos’ initial friendly welcome to the amazing ladies loos this is a friendly hotel and  a brilliant location for a weekend in Dublin. 
Rooms are clean, they have everything you need (hairdryers could have a bit more power!) 
I had stayed here many times before so I loved the new renovations which really brightens up the foyer and bar area...but if you’re going to have a bar look like that you need the drink choice to match it - we ended up in the Ivegh for cocktails as the drink selection and experience of the bar staff was my only disappointment they were friendly, but weren’t able to deliver on a simple cosmopolitan!",5,2019,07,07
212,Dublin visit,5 friends stayed here for a 2 night visit to Dublin- 1/2 hr taxi from airport - check in / check out was a breeze - Carlos was so nice and helpful !! Thank you !   This hotel is beautiful with big spacious rooms including nice amenities (Bring conditioner if you use) A safe and a blow dryer and ironing board .   The breakfast was a really nice buffet and you can special order your eggs - I am a real coffee snob and the coffee was excellent!   Hotel right across the street from st Steven square and near the buses - you do not need a car in Dublin the buses get you everywhere and there are taxis everywhere also... We even took a vantage of the horse carriage ride which was very reasonably priced.   This hotel is within walking distance to most major attractions I would definitely come back again and stay at this exact location.    Only suggestion is that Dublin is loud with plenty of things to do and bars everywhere  I would bring earplugs to sleep. ,5,2019,07,06
212,an end to a journey,"Comfortable room; wonderful staff; great restaurant, bar and breakfast options. Could not have been more helpful especially Felipe and Carlos at the front desk. Helpful with directions and suggestions for alternate transportation and shopping areas and walking ways to travel",5,2019,07,05
212,Excellent Location,"Wife and I stayed here for three nights touring Dublin.  The location is great, right off of St. Stephens Green (hence the name).   Easy walks to Temple Bar, Archeology museum, Trinity College (Book of Kells).  We also walked from here to the Kilmainham Gaol and the EPIC emigration museum, but these were a bit of a hike unless you like to walk (about 45 minutes for each).  Restaurant breakfast was good, with the typical Irish/English offerings, plus the typical Continental offerings.  Did not try the restaurant for anything else.  Did not have a car, so don’t know about parking.  Staff responsive to requests.  Upon departure we had them call for a taxi, had to wait about 30 minutes for the one they called to arrive, in the mean time we saw about 20 drive by, we would have been better off just hailing one on our own off the street.  Would I stay here again?  Yes.",4,2019,07,04
212,Updated old beautiful hotel,"An older hotel in a beautiful building, the Green has been updated so it is comfortable and clean, but definitely not a modern hotel. They appear to cater mostly to business travelers due to a great location. OK quick buffet breakfast. Friendly staff make this a nice hotel visit to Dublin,",4,2019,07,02
212,Regular Business Visits,"I've stayed here quite a lot over the past few months so this is overdue. Team at The Green are an awesome multi-cultural bunch of ladies and gents who're always helpful and supportive day and night. I have to call out both Felipe and Antonio on the front desk.

Rooms are great, clean and modern as well as spacious for a city center location. Dining in the bar is also quite good.",5,2019,07,02
212,Golf trip,I stayed here for 6 nights.  The so called king bed is actually 2 singles pushed together that are so uncomfortable.  The pillows are maybe 2 inches thick.  Most of the front desk staff need to go back to customer service school as they are very rude.  Maybe because we are Americans.  Other then that I would stay somewhere else.  Not much good to say,3,2019,07,02
212,Great hotel in Dublin,"We had a great week in Dublin and the Green Hotel is a perfect location.  The rooms are all new. The bathrooms are big.  Breakfast was awesome. 
 And the service was excellent.  Especially, Carlos at the front desk.",5,2019,07,01
212,"Nice, clean, central hotel","Stayed two nights at The Green. 

Pleasant experience from check in to check out. Staff very friendly. 

Clean, modern and has all facilities you’d expect for a city centre hotel whether on business or pleasure. 

Breakfast was good - nice choices and nice restaurant. Didn’t use the bar as didn’t spend a lot of time in the hotel due to work. 

The only downfall for me was the layout of the hotel- it’s very confusing, to a lad from Leeds it is anyway. To get to our room we had to get a lift to one floor then walk to other end of hotel and get in another lift to get to the room. ",4,2019,06,25
212,Unhelpful ,"Stayed here recently, while check in was slow receptionist was polite, friendly and helpful. Reception area and rooms were immaculate and spacious  and a great location to Dublin.  However night the was ruined by a party near our room which was loud and noisy. A phone call to reception at 2am made no difference and at checkout the following morning a different receptionist was dismissal of my complaint saying that doesn't happen here. Will not be returning.",2,2019,06,16
212,"Great Hotel, Great facilities, staff.-Top location-easy walking to many key spots","We really lucked out in selecting The Green for our 5 night stay in Dublin city. 
Great location with St Stephens Green across the corner. 
A short walk to Grafton Street, shopping, National Library, and State Archives. Public transport close access.
A room was available when we were checked in by Colm. -that was much appreciated after our flight from Australia.
Our room was a very good size, neat bathroom. large bed, a round table, chair with 2 bottles of water near the large mid level full width window.
Bed was very comfortable, curtain was excellent for keeping out early morning sun.
Wifi works very very well.
We walked through the adjacent St Stephens Green quite a few times.--very scenic/pleasant. 
Front desk desk staff were always pleasant and helpful..Special thanks to Chris and Colm, 
One day we left the room a bit late and seem to miss the rooms clean/refresh process. Spoke to Noleen, received an apology and all fixed.

After our days out we ate at the Hotel most nights.- very easy relaxing atmosphere. seating arrangements very flexible to suit 2, 4 etc,
Great service, food was very very good and reasonable prices.

Overall, a top stay, openly recommended.",5,2019,06,12
212,Nice refit but poor service ,"Had a business meeting there this week , client asked for coffee and a scone and the waiter responded “we don’t do scones “
We ordered a few americanos and requested some glasses of water 
Water never arrived , the place was empty 
 Not somewhere I would rush back to which is a shame as I suspect the refurb cost a lot ",1,2019,06,11
212,Exquisite Georgian Hotel in a great location ,"The Green is located directly opposite St Stephens Green and within easy walking distance to Grafton streets amazing restaurants and Cafes. The room was large and tidy, I also must comment on the bathroom and the finishing touches to the room which was also very charming. ",5,2019,06,07
212,A gem,This was a wonderful stay for our family during our last 2 nights in Ireland. Rooms are very comfortable. Showers are great. Needs some electrical sockets near the beds especially for folks who have devices like CPAP machines. We moved a night table to accommodate our family member. Just something for the hotel to consider. The location is tremendous. Breakfast was really nice. The bar was very relaxing for a comfortable drink after a long day of walking. Near Grafton Street and Trinity College. Lots of places nearby for dinner or to purchase items you need during your trip. We really enjoyed our stay here. We will definitely stay again. Well done. ,5,2019,06,01
212,Lovely easy stay ,"This hotel was kindly booked for me by my employer and all I can say is it ticked all the boxes .Location wise it was perfect for attending the course  but also after the course it was so close to everything I could ever want or need when staying in Dublin.
The hotel itself was clean modern and the breakfast was superb.The staff were friendly-except for the French duty manager who looked like he wanted to be anywhere but checking me in - that is the only negative about this hotel.",4,2019,05,29
212,Jewel of Dublin ,"We spend 3 nights at this hotel , it was extremely clean , centrally located , updated decor and extraordinary service . The staff made themself available at very opportunity , a early morning latte , recommendations  and directions ,and personalized items cooked to order  at the breakfast buffet . The staff was extremely friendly and always offered a smile to make our stay enjoyable . Thank- you. ",5,2019,05,22
212,Lovely central hotel,The Green is centrally located by Stephens Green in the center of Dublin. All major points of interest are within walking distance. The hotel is clean and spacious and the rooms are of a generous size. The only point of improvement could be made with front of house staff - they seemed to be very distracted and almost bothered by guests. Otherwise I am very pleased with our stay.,4,2019,05,22
212,Convenient Location ,"Stayed for 2 weekend nights. Location was great. We stayed on the first floor and it was a quiet room. The bathroom was very nice. Complementary bottle water was provided in the room. The staff was very helpful as our room ran out of toiletry and bottle water at 3am, but went to the front desk and front desk immediately brought to our room. ",5,2019,05,21
212,"Excellent location, Pleasant stay","I stayed from Thursday May 2nd to Tuesday May 7th. First of all, this is hotel is in a great location and reasonably priced (we got a good deal booking through Expedia). St. Stephen's Green is right there and you can easily walk to many well known places from here: including but not limited to Trinity College, Grafton Street, National Galley, National Library (plus all of Dublin's Hop on/Hop off buses have a stop at St. Stephen's Green so that's very convenient if you are doing the tourist thing). Also there are plenty of bars and restaurants down the road from the hotel on Camden Street. 

We stayed in the Classic King room and it was very comfortable. On their website they boast about having the fastest WiFi at any Dublin hotel and I would say that's pretty darn accurate because I have never stayed at a hotel with such reliable and fast wifi. (I was even able to downloaded some movies before my flight home without interruption.) Huge plus in this day and age of course. 

One tiny compliant about the room, the plug for the hairdryer was a bit awkward because it didn't quite reach far enough that you could see yourself in the mirror. A little bit of a design flaw but that's really the only thing that was of an annoyance. 

During our stay we ate a couple meals there. We had a burger on night, turkey club, caesar salad, all very good! We had breakfast there only one morning. It is a buffet and although everything was good, I can't say it was worth the 17€. I'm not a big buffet person to begin with, so if you are like me and your personal preference is ordering off a menu then I would say find another option. 

Finally I found the front desk staff to be a bit inconsistent through my stay. The majority of them were very nice and helpful, but a few were a little dismissive and pretentious. That's the only reason that they felt short of getting a 5-star review. However this is a pretty minor issue, but was necessary to note. 

Mind you if Trip Advisor had halves, The Green would get a 4.5 from me. Also we were really glad that they had a room for us before the official check-in time. Coming off an overnight flight from the States we were very appreciative of that.",4,2019,05,14
212,Fantastic property,"Great property, tasteful design, central location at a very affordable price. We got a spacious room with great amenities. Nespresso coffee machine in the room. Great breakfast with mouth watering pastries. Highly recommended.",5,2019,05,07
212,What a shocker!,"The hotel stay was good. The checkin was easy, the room was fine but the shocker was to charge for me 10 euro extra for each hour I wanted late check out for. 
I am an annual visitor to this hotel for the last 8 years. This was not acknowledged, noted or taken into account. 
Where does it leave me 10 euro poorer:-(",2,2019,04,15
212,Fabulous!,The hotel is in a great location - right across from St Stephen's Green and a five to ten minute walk to Grafton Street.  My room had a nice coffee machine and was immaculately clean - lovely Paul Costello toiletries in the bathroom.  Probably one of the nicest breakfasts I have had - the orange juice was freshly squeezed and nothing short of perfect.  I also had dinner which was lovely and a real nice vibe to this hotel.  The only gripe I have is not knowing where the executive lounge was as I had complimentary access - phoned down to reception and they said they would have to open it for me despite normal hours...........  No matter as I enjoyed my stay.,5,2019,04,13
212,Great location!,"Located diagonally across the street from St. Stephen's Green and just two short blocks from Grafton Street and the St. Stephen's Green shopping mall, this boutique hotel offers a modern decor with vintage touches like old-fashioned telephones and radios. Yvonne at the front desk is a treasure! The breakfast buffet is a bit pricey if it's not included in your room rate, but the rooms were well furnished and comfortable, with modern bathrooms and excellent showers. But, the location is great if you want to be within walking distance of a lot of top attractions and the new light rail system, LUAS, also has a stop within one block of the hotel.",4,2019,04,12
212,Little gem,"Gorgeous boutique hotel. It is so central, perfect for a night in the city. 

I had a warm welcome from the reception staff. 

We had a glass of wine in the bar, the bar staff were very friendly and attentive.

Our room was clean and comfortable. The bathroom in particular was amazing, with lovely toiletries.

We had breakfast in the morning. It was buffet style with a large selection to suit everyone. Very tasty.

Will definitely return.",5,2019,04,01
212,Great nights sleep,We stayed here for one night. We really wanted a comfortable nights sleep as we had our third child 8 months ago and hadn’t slept a full night since! This hotel really delivered. The bed was so comfortable and the room was a lovely temperature- hotels are often too hot. The bathrooms are really funky and the showers are fab. We didn’t eat breakfast but we had a drink in the bar where breakfast is served and it’s a lovely space. I would definitely stay again. ,4,2019,03,31
212,Comfortable stay,"Stayed there over the weekend, great location in terms of shopping and nightlife, room was comfortable with good size bed and stylish well equipped bathroom, staff pleasant and welcoming, highly recommended!",5,2019,03,25
212,Smashing Hotel,"Have just stayed at this smashing hotel just off Stephens Green and Grafto Street.
Cracking location. Only 20mins walk from Temple Barr district.
Many of the best, top rated bars and restaurants within walking distance.
The hotel was a pleasant surprise. The rooms were faultless with the biggest double bed I’ve ever slept in accompanied by a spotless bath / shower room.
Huge tv and comfy chairs.
The staff were outstanding, helpful and polite.
Although we didn’t eat in the restaurant we did partake in a tipple. Again the staff were very personable.
Will be staying there again.
Absolutely top notch,",5,2019,03,24
212,Fantastic Birthday Stay,We stayed on Saturday the 2nd of March as we were in Dublin celebrating my wife's 30th Birthday. I emailed the hotel the week before asking if they could add any special touches as it was a special occasion. The hotel could not have been more helpful....we were upgraded to a Junior Suite and had a desert plate delivered to our room with a Birthday note from the hotel. The suite was fantastic and the hotel is situated in the perfect location to explore Dublin. Breakfast the next morning was top class and we had an amazing stay. The Green is definitely our 'go to' hotel when staying in Dublin in future! Big thank you to The Green and their staff for making it such a great stay!,5,2019,03,19
212,Massimo,Hi I would just like to say that Massimo could not be more hospitable and because of his kindness patience services and good humour we will absolutely be back to enjoy his company. Massimo you deserve a pay rise considering what you have to deal with late at night thanks again 😉,5,2019,03,14
212,Excellent comfortable accomodation,"Excellent room, fresh, modern.staff very friendly and room was suitably warm and fresh.all modern fixtures of high standards and exceptionally clean. The location is also excellent at the corner of St Stephens Green.",5,2019,03,11
212,Beautiful room & great breakfast,"The stay started off well with an upgrade in the rooms - which were spacious and gorgeously decorated.  Huge and very comfy bed and lovely bathroom. Especially liked the de-misting mirror in the bathroom and waterfall shower.  The staff were always friendly, helpful and professional.  There was a large variety of food options for breakfast.  The cooked breakfast was the best I’ve had at a hotel.  Very impressed and hope to stay there again soon!",5,2019,03,07
212,They made my stay - great hotel and great staff,"I travel a lot for work, around 40-45 weeks a year so I see quite a lot of nice business hotels. However, I have never been in such a nice hotel like that. The staff there, especially Daniela in the restaurant during breakfast, Iowana (the girl from Poland - unfortunately, I cannot remember her exact name and how it is spelled) and Chris at the reception really made my stay!!! I can only highly recommend this hotel, for private and business trips. Thank you so much for everything, Julia",5,2019,03,04
212,Trip to theatre,"Stayed one night in this hotel. Great location, very central and within walking distance of most attractions. Staff nice and room fine, however, was surprised that there was no literature in the room, no information on anything! Booked breakfast next morning - 15 euro - surprisingly small choice on offer. Serving plates were left on a marble-topped table ensuring that they were really cold, combine this with lukewarm food and the result is cold breakfast. Left it on the table and ate elsewhere. By all means stay in this hotel but eat elsewhere!",3,2019,03,02
212,Stayed for a hen night,"Hotel was perfect, great location and staff were welcoming. The rooms were gorgeous especially the bathroom! Didn’t have breakfast as wasn’t part of package but plenty of options around to choose from. Would definitely go back!",4,2019,02,25
212,Super stay,"This hotel is in a great location for a visit to Dublin. It is within walking distance of Grafton Street, Trinity College, National Art Gallery. A short walk will take to the Luas stop to link you with many other city sights. It has a high level of cleanliness and the staff are welcoming and professional.",5,2019,02,24
212,Lovely hotel in a great location,"The Green is recently refurbished hotel on St Stephen's Green, in walking distance of shopping, restaurants and bars. The hotel is well decorated and very clean, and the rooms are comfortable and quiet. There is a good range of food at breakfast in a well-lit restaurant. The staff on reception and in the bar / restaurant were very friendly and helpful. We enjoyed staying there and found it really good value for money.",5,2019,02,20
212,Wonderful new Dublin option!,"Great hotel in an excellent location.  Friendly staff.  Extremely comfortable bed in a spacious, well-appointed room. Fantastic shower in well designed bathroom. Love the green glass subway tiles! I definitely recommend it!",5,2019,02,19
212,Excellent service in a beautiful setting,"I came here for a mixture of business and pleasure. The hotel was booked by my organisation's travel management company.  Unfortunately (not for the first time) the travel company had not processed everything correctly.  For starters they only booked one person and they had not made the payment.
The Front of House team, were very helpful and supportive and despite not having the confirmation of payment allowed me the use of the room whilst I sorted the problem out.  
The hotel is very comfortable, the breakfast was so good!  All the staff were very friendly and made our stay in this beautiful city even better.  I would HIGHLY recommend this hotel as it is close to the city sites.",4,2019,02,18
212,Very nice hotel in good location,"The hotel is at the Stephen's Green end of Harcourt Street, so 5 minutes from the shops on Grafton St and 10 minutes to the quays.  
When we checked in we were upgraded to a slightly better room, which is always good news.  Unusually to get to the room (4th floor) you take the lift to the 1st floor and then a different lift to the 4th.  Strange
The room was large, very clean and looked very well maintained.  There were a couple of bottles of water on the table for us. The bathroom was large with good toiletries and a rainfall shower.  I do like those
Breakfast was mostly very good - fruit, cereal, pastries and some cooked food.  The latter was the weakest point, but only because all the rest of the food was so much better
Parking for the hotel is in the Qpark Stephen's Green carpark (2 or 3 minutes from the hotel) and the hotel can give you a discount card to get overnight parking for 17.50 euros
Overall I was impressed - good location, good hotel, good staff.  I'd definitely stay here again",4,2019,02,17
212,Excellent location,"We chose this hotel based on a recommendation for the location and it doesn’t disappoint. 

Right on the corner of St Stephen’s Green and literally a couple of steps to the Luas tram stop. 

You don’t really need the tram though as it is only 15 mins wander into the main city centre. You can either take Grafton Street with all the shops towards the river or take the road a little to the right (the one the trams go along) and it brings you out beside the Trinity college. 

Rooms are a good size and very clean with fun details. Breakfast is tasty. ",5,2019,02,17
212,"Very Nice, Perfect Location","This is the second time I've stayed at this property, the first time was when it was the Stephen Green Hotel.  The location of this property is excellent as one has easy access to everything in the city and right between two Luas train stops if you're doing business elsewhere in Dublin. Reception/check-in/check-out was fast and easy.  The hotel allowed me a very early check-in after my morning arrival from the U.S. - thank you very much!  My room was comfortable, warm and wi-fi fast.  The gorgeous renovated bath was very masculine and the heated fog-free mirror a wonderful surprise. The shower is perfection.  Only recommendation is the king size bed made with two twins, one mattress was comfortable, the other not so much.  I did not use the gym but heard it had the necessary equipment.  Breakfast included everything one would want and the service was lovely.  I did not eat other meals here as central Dublin is just outside.  Highly recommend The Green for reasonably priced stay in Dublin.",5,2019,02,17
212,Not bad overall,"Room ok. Very clean, and recently refurbished bathroom. Shower also nice. Rather oddly though, the sheets were too small for the beds, as someone else has said on here...No plug sockets near the bed either which was annoying.

Restaurant food very average and there was nothing traditional. In a centrally located Irish hotel, why serve club sandwiches, pasta, fish and chips? Just round the corner in a bar I got an excellent Irish stew for half the price of a bad club sandwich here. Here it’s just the usual international hotel stuff. 

The bar had no draft beer at all because all the pumps were broken and had been for about 3 days according to the waitress, who had nothing to do because I was the only customer at 6.30 pm. What they did have was expensive compared to the many local establishments nearby.

My advice would be stay here, but go out to eat and drink. 

Finally the Check-in process was the slowest I have ever experienced anywhere. I’ve stayed twice and both times were far too long. 
",3,2019,02,15
212,Great find,"Only stopped one night here but WOW it was a great find in a great location very close to the heart of the city. Staff were very friendly, rooms very specious and the shower was to die for. Would certainly stay here again if we return to the city.",5,2019,02,13
212,Loved this hotel.,"Small, but clean and nice.  Good food in the restaurant.Great truffle mushroom soup. Love the two flushing system in the bathroom. Good location for walking to other places of interest. Nice bar area with good service.",5,2019,02,12
212,Would have loved another night,"My husband & I stayed on a Saturday to go to a concert. We were very fortunate to get a complimentary upgrade to a new executive room, which had lovely decor, a great bed and a beautiful bathroom. Everything was very clean. We ate in the bar before going out, and it was very nice. Breakfast was very good - lovely selection of hot & cold dishes, fresh juice and healthy choices. The decor in the hotel is very chique and comfortable and the bar area is really nice, so I was surprised that it wasn't busier.
All the staff were so friendly & attentive - reception, bar, breakfast servers.
The hotel location is overlooking St. Stephen's Green so it was a short and pleasant walk to so many places of interest and to the shops.
We will definitely go back to The Green.",5,2019,01,28
212,Comfortable stay,"Travelled up in January for business with colleagues. Room was comfortable with spacious and clean bathroom. Very quiet despite excellent central location. Hotel has lovely decor and also a useful gym in the basement. However, my colleague had a heavily stained towel in her room. The cooked breakfast was also sub par, despite excellent selection. This was a disappointment. I am unsure if the hotel would be suitable for a couples/family holiday - I certainly felt underdressed at times, and it seems to be frequented by stony faced business people at all times. Despite this; I enjoyed my stay thoroughly, and would consider the hotel again for similar trips in the future.",4,2019,01,28
212,Lovely hotel and super location.,"My husband and I stayed here recently, and thoroughly enjoyed it. The location is amazing, so central. The room was really lovely, especially the bathroom (heavenly shower!!). Good big TV, cute retro radio and telephone....Just gorgeous. The staff were all so friendly and helpful.  We didn't eat at the hotel, but the bar looks really nice, and if we'd had time it would have been lovely to have a drink there... perhaps next time!  I can really recommend this hotel, especially if you are going to a show or event in the city. We had a room to the front of the hotel, overlooking Cuffe Street, but were not affected by traffic noise at all. We'll be back on 9th Feb and I cannot wait...!!!",5,2019,01,24
212,Great little place in the heart of Dublin city.,"We stayed as a couple for one night on a saturday in January.  I was concerned about some the negative reviews but I was pleased to find our stay was excellent.  The reception staff were excellent, helpful and accomodating - they even offered to check on tickets for shows etc.  The breakfast staff were also very courteous and helpful with nothing being a problem.  The room was average size but  very clean with a really nice bathroom.  The hotel was a 3 minute walk from the top of Grafton street and all the shops and nightlife that entails.  Overall a great stay.",5,2019,01,14
212,"Ideal Location, right where you want to be by Grafton Street!","This hotel was in the ideal location of Dublin! Literally steps for Grafton Street shopping area with the lovely shops and pubs. 10 min walk to Trinity College. Hotel is new and nice size rooms! My only note to make is that the hotel had a ""New"" renovated building, which is where our room was. It is not the easiest to get to while carrying your luggage and a baby through two elevators, a hallway with doors and no doorman/ bellhop to help with bags. That was a bite of a challenge, but manageable I suppose in the light of things. 

Would recommend this hotel and stay again, maybe just ask for someone from the front to help with our bags ;)",5,2019,01,07
212,"Nice hotel, average service","The Green is in a great location. The layout and decor of the hotel are lovely, and a lot of effort has clearly gone into the presentation.

Service was only average. They had tried to squeeze double sized fitted bedsheets onto a king size bed, which meant they continually came off through the night. Although two towels had been used, we were only left one towel the following day when the room was serviced.

The bar was reasonably priced but the Guinness was not poured properly, and therefore wasn't very enjoyable for my partner.",3,2019,01,03
212,The Green,The Green is in a very central location and was very amenable to all the attractions around Stephen's Green. The room was spotless and the bathroom was immaculate. The best part of our 2 day stay there was how peaceful it was and a lovely getaway from the madding crowd around the park and streets of the Temple Bar. A great night's sleep is guaranteed. All the staff were extremely friendly and helpful especially when I'd forgot my phone charger it was not a problem to charge for me.,5,2018,12,31
212,Lovely hotel,Had a one night stay at this hotel and it was great. From the moment I checked in and was given an executive room to a fantastic buffet breakfast the next morning (which was included in the room rate) everything was spot on. Would definitely recommend a stay at this hotel. ,5,2018,12,09
212,Long weekend in Dublin,"My son and I spent a long weekend here and were delighted with our experience.  We were across the street from Saint Stephen's Green, which is one of my favorite places in Dublin.  The breakfast was good, the people were friendly, and I was very grateful that I had asked for early check in.",4,2018,11,10
212,Lovely Hotel,"Staying in Dublin was connected to my flight plans and I was passing through. However Dublin is a great fun town, full of life, great shopping and pub life. It seemed that hotels were either hostels or in the expensive range. I picked this hotel due to location. Right off Stephens Green park, one block to Grafton Street  for shopping and   a few blocks from Baggot street for pubs. The hotel is beautiful modern, traditional, comfortable clean rooms. The ""Irish"" buffet breakfast incl. in my rate was outstanding. Staff all too helpful in every way. My booking somehow managed a bottle of wine and two bottles of water, a nice welcome surprise.  Highly recommend.",5,2018,11,05
212,Central hotel,Booked 2 twin rooms for myself an9id family through bookings .com .When we arrived we were meet by a miserable looking receptionist told us on his system only 1 twin room booked and and a king room showed him my email booking said not what he had and also each room was booked for 1 person so only 2 breakfasts were allowed and the other 2 people would have to pay for it . I said why would i book a these rooms if only 1 person was staying in each ..my daughter and i put r luggage in twin room had some lunch went back to room couldnt get in card key didnt work went to reception informed them a man broke the lock we then had to be moved to another twin room along the corrider i then said thats very strange as i was told couldnt get another twin room at reception earlier which i had orginally booked for ..by the all this was over me and my family were weary of it all .Will not be back awful checkin service please employ staff who r friendly and approachable,3,2018,11,05
212,"Fantastic hotel, fantastic loacation!","Myself and my wife chose to stay here as were in Dublin for our wedding anniversary. Hotels in the area were expensive that weekend due to the Dublin City Marathon although this hotel was the most affordable four star available. Upon check in we were pleasantly surprised at how modern the decor was both in the hotel and more importantly the bedroom. Very spacious with all the amenities you would expect, the bedroom and beautiful en suite bathroom did not disappoint. The hotel is located a straight walk, less than five minutes from Grafton St. through St. Stephens Green. The beautiful autumn weather probably made this even more enjoyable. The breakfast buffet was as good if not better than any other four star hotel we have stayed in and the staff were both pleasant and willing to help in any way possible. If I was to give any advice to the hotel it would be to update their location on Google Maps. At present the hotel is located half way down Harcourt St. when it’s actually even more central than this. We will look forward to returning again.",5,2018,10,29
212,Excellent Stay,"Stayed at The Green in Oct 2018.  Excellent Location as we were going to a show in the Gaiety.  Very reasonably priced.  Staff were super, from reception to restaurant.  Executive rooms were superb.  Breakfast was excellent.   Only negative comment is that we found the bar lacked atmosphere.  It was very bright and sterile looking.  No cosy corner or comfy couch !!  However, I am nit-picking now as I would highly recommend the hotel for a night out in the center of Dublin.  Well done to all staff, who were extremely helpful and kind.  I will be back.",5,2018,10,23
212,A Nice Hotel in a Great Location,"The rooms are large and well appointed, though getting to them can be confusing, we had to use two separate lifts and reception and rooms aren’t signposted very well. The location is fantastic for getting around Dublin, it’s right in the centre and was particularly helpful for us as we were going to the Taste of Dublin Festival which is in easy walking distance of the hotel. The hotel is labelled as the Green, which again was confusing, but the rooms were comfortable, quiet and spacious. Breakfast was nice, but nothing spectacular. A good hotel, but needs to work harder to be worth the price.",4,2018,10,20
212,Sophisticated with Excellent Service,Great location in the heart of Dublin. My husband and I were pleasantly surprised given some of the reviews we had read. The hotel is immaculate and the decor is modern and inviting. The on-site restaurant was a gem and the overall service was excellent (esp Collin at the front desk & Jesus in the restaurant). Thank you for making our stay in Dublin so special!,5,2018,10,19
212,Relaxing in comfort,"A nice hotel in Dublin with great staff, meals and rooms. The room we had  had plenty of room to move in, a comfortable bed and nice breakfasts. There is room for improvement in the rooms for guests like: hair dryer needs removing from the desk or a longer cord added to it, there is no fridge, insufficient power plugs in bathroom and main room.",5,2018,10,18
212,"Decent, not sure about 4-star accolade though...","Stayed just one night, decent stay, quiet and peaceful sleep, no frills, reception service pretty slow, good location, disappointing and over-priced breakfast presented in a plate, no buffet service (except continental) ...",3,2018,10,14
212,Definitely not anywhere near a 4* Hotel,"Stayed here Sep 26 - October 5th. The hotel was decent but was by no means a 4* hotel.
The wardrobe doors in my room were almost coming off the sliders and made it difficult to open/close the doors without making a lot of noise that would disturb guests in adjacent rooms. 
The Hotel bar was ok. Staff in the bar were very friendly however, the lack of real food was a big let down. Apparently they only serve Tapas in the bar and they have no restaurant, but when a bus tour comes in to the hotel they get full meal service. I feel like this should be extended to the rest of the guests in the hotel and not limited to bus tours only. Tapas in the bar was very average at best and by no means made me want to re-order more of it. 
I was on a business trip so was not spending all night in the bar but I saw many many guests come in to the bar at about 11pm on a Friday night and were refused service at the bar as it was closed at at 11pm. It is the first hotel I have ever stayed in where residents of the hotel cannot get served a drink after the bar stops serving public. When the guests said they were residents they were basically told that that wasn't the staffs problem.
Another observation I saw was that it appears that the hotel does not send housekeeping to your room to make up the room the day before you check out. At least that was my experience. I got back to my room at 6pm after working all day and my room was exactly as I had left it that morning when I left the room. I even had the light lit to advise housekeeping that they could make up my room.
I travel to Dublin on business from time to time and I will definitely be telling my travel office to not book this hotel in future. Was definitely not worth the $2200 for a 10 night stay.",3,2018,10,10
212,Well located hotel for tourists and business men/women,"The Green in Dublin was fine. The staff was a bit pretentious.  Although centrally located (block from Grafton; about a 15-20 min walk from Temple Bar; Trinity College, An Liffey, etc.), parking was 2 blocks away (happy we only had carry-on luggage); bathrooms were without the simplest items (i.e. toilet paper dispensers; a place to hang a towel; no room for toiletries, etc.).  A good room (a/c was fairly useless) - a good location - but over priced for what you got; and I probably wouldn't stay there again; although I wouldn't go as far as not recommending it.  Breakfast was not included and was continental, which was fine, but way overpriced for what was offered.  Probably a perfect hotel for the overnight business commuter using public transportation.  We were on vacation, had a car and not using the hotel for anything but a base to go out and tour from.",4,2018,09,30
212,Disappointingly unreasonable,"Sadly, we were bumped from our flight into Dublin. Since I booked through expedia, non-refundable, I was unable to get any money back.  Expedia tried to petition for me but O'Callaghan's denied the claim.  I then tried to get a partial refund by directly contacting O'Callaghan's.  I pointed out that if I had booked the room as refundable, it would have been and additional $40, so I requested 50% refund and was still denied.",1,2018,09,16
212,"Extremely SAD, Disappointing, Almost discriminating w/o knowing why","While the location is very convenient close to city center and many offices; the hotel rooms where I stayed in the newly renovated executive junior suite were fine BUT I have never been treated so badly in a hotel or anywhere as here. 
Starting from greeting or acknowledgement at reception - not existent, if you dare to ask the reception for anything, they look at you as if you asked to move the moon somewhere else (I asked for a still bottle of water).
If I eventually got that water was a ""lucky"" case frp day to day, depending on who was at the reception. 
Not to mention that I had to ask every single day for that water because it was never refilled in the room by Housekeeping like many other things.
I have travelled a lot in my life and having worked in this industry I hve a high level of understanding but this inhuman unfriendly behavior feeling everyday unwelcome was the most terrible experience I have ever made. 

Unbelievably sad, extremely disappointing and feeling almost discriminated for whatever reason.",1,2018,09,12
212,Nice but not outstanding ,There was really no problem here. It was a nice hotel. I just can’t say it was outstanding. The breakfast was adequate but not great. I have to say the location was really nice for getting around town.,3,2018,09,06
212,Fantastic!,"We have stayed in very many hotels in Dublin both North and South of the Liffey and we were happily blown away by ""The Green"" as it was superb and we will without doubt be booking to stay there again next year.It ticked all the boxes in so many ways-ie location,cost,facilities,curteous attentive staff and great rooms.This is just what a city centre hotel should be.Dublin was as ever great but this made it more so.Full marks to a well run immaculately clean establishment.This is how all hotels should be but alas aren't.Can't wait till next year.",5,2018,08,29
212,Only time I've had to immediately leave a hotel,"I recently had a 3 night stay reserved at the O'Callaghan St. Stephen's Green. Wasn't the best check-in experience as they sent me to the wrong floor and part of the hotel to where my room was, but it got sorted. 

What's weird is what happened later that night :

-Around midnight I was asleep in bed when I heard a commotion at the door of my room. It sounded like someone was trying to break in. I had all of the internal locks set (it didn't have one of those hard slider locks) and the do not disturb light on but despite this a member of the hotel staff entered my room (Without knocking or announcing his presence). I jumped up right away and yelled at him and he quickly ducked out and ran away.

-Right afterward I tried to call down to the front desk from my room, hoping to catch someone else working there who could tell me what the heck was going on, but it rang about 20 times and no one ever answered. I tried to go back to sleep.

-The next morning I went to the front desk to voice my major concerns about the invasion of privacy and security issues. The front desk staff was straight out rude, not listening to or believing my account of the situation. He just kept saying he had no record of it and would need to check in to it and that they would never do that. I never received a real apology or any offer to make it right.

-After 10 minutes or so of this back and forth I returned to my room, packed my stuff up and left without checking out as I wasn't going to deal with the guy there.

If it was a mistake and they profusely apologised I could maybe have gotten over it but the front desk staff was so dismissive that I had no confidence they would respect my privacy, my safety or my belongings. After I left I lodged a complaint with my work travel agency and the hotel representative had the nerve to call me a liar and say this incident never happened. What a bunch of creeps. Oh and the hotel is dirty, under construction and the rooms are mediocre. You have been warned. ",1,2018,08,28
212,Great but need to sort out the night entry,"I absolutely loved this hotel for our weekend stay in Dublin (third time here).
We arrived extremely early and hoped we might be able to sweet-talk the staff into letting us check in a couple of hours early and they checked us in on the spot, no less than 4 hours early!! The guy on reception was lovely - dealt with us brilliantly.

The rooms are also lovely, with great showers and you can't fault the location but unfortunately, as we came back on Saturday night the security guard had wandered off from his station. We pushed the button several times but couldn't get an answer. After a couple of minutes, he came back and let us in but at over 200 euros a night, we shouldn't be spending any time at all on the street outside thinking ""oh my God, how are we going to get back in?!"" They either need to hire a security guard who will stay at his station or install an outside entry system for guests - they charge enough to cover the cost of one!.",3,2018,08,25
212,Weekend stay,"Spacious clean comfortable rooms. Lovely decor throughout hotel. Fantastic location for tourists in Dublin. 
Really disappointed on how we were spoken to by a man at reception around 9PM on Saturday night. Initially we asked if there were any water vending machines and there are not.  We asked if we were able to have drinking water in our room. He said no but we could buy it in the bar. We pointed out it was the first hotel we had stayed in thar did not provide bottled  water. He sharply replied that they did but only in executive rooms _ quite nasty. Someone who really should not be in the service industry. So water was available but he had no intention of providing a basic need. Really disgusted at how we were spoken to and the only nasty person we have come across during our Dublin stay for a much needed break. Staff need to be mindful that people may be on a break for respite and shouldtreat people appropriately.",3,2018,08,18
212,A curate's egg of a hotel,"Stayed as a couple recently and it really is a mixed bag of a hotel! They are half way through a branding change and a revamp and I am not sure the know what they are doing. We arrived after 8 on a Friday and check in was quick and the receptionist was very polite. The hotel appears to be in 2 parts now and we had to take 2 different lifts to our room. A lot of guests were wandering around as they were a bit lost due to the lack of signage and direction. Our room was large with a huge, very comfortable bed and bottles of water provided. The view was terrible and the window small. We appeared to be in a Wheelchair access room based on the bathroom facilities which were brand new and spotless. However, there was nowhere to hang towels apart from on the floor. Also, there was nowhere to put shampoo etc. while in the shower apart from on the floor! I have never seen this in a hotel before. This makes showering etc. difficult for everyone, never mind if you had limited mobility. The bar is VERY quiet, and there was no Guinness on tap as they had an issue with the gas. The options were limited after that. One of our friends that came in for a drink had to change choice a few times as they ran out of everything (only 1 bottle in stock on 2 occasions). They also ran out of change multiple times and this made service quite slow. Breakfast was poor, especially considering the price they charge. I ordered Poached eggs, and they brought out 1, with no toast. Everything appeared to be rationed and the selection was below standard. To make toast they had a normal home kitchen toaster that turned itself off after every use. Guests were standing there waiting for toast that would never come as they didn't realize it was turned off. In summary, a great location, spotless with comfortable beds. The staff were very good. The rest is a bit of an overpriced mess to be fair....",3,2018,08,13
212,Last night in Dublin,Really nice hotel with a great location!!!! Hotel staff was friendly helpful and accommodating. Wonderful rooms with all the amenities needed. Comfortable beds and terrific bathrooms and shower and even a hair dryer,5,2018,08,12
212,Pros and cons ,"This is a nice hotel. No major problems during our stay. There are some real positives and a few things they could improve on.

It’s in a great location in my opinion. Right by the lovely Sr Stephens Green. No outside noise when in our room. It’s near to shops and restaurants and maybe a 15 minute walk from O’Connoly Street. The hotel was clean and quiet inside. I didn’t eat there so I couldn’t comment on the bar or restaurant. Lovely comfy bed with good pillows for once although I notice that another recent reviewer was unimpressed with theirs. Nice big bathroom although it only had a shower which might upset some people. 

We also received a free upgrade on arrival from classic room to executive room. I don’t know what’s the difference between the two but as I say, the room was nice and a good size. 

On the downside, the staff are a bit hit and miss frankly.  One staff member was very polite and helpful with a minor query, another was just a bit useless and didn’t really care. This seems to be most people’s experience having read a few recent reviews. 
The A/C didn’t work reliably. The porter came and pressed a few buttons and walked away saying it would be alright. It was after the recent very hot spell fortunately or I would have needed restraining! Not the end of world but naff customer service. 
They also seem to have a problem with key cards for rooms. During a 4 night stay ours reset itself twice so we couldn’t get into our room. Again, one staff member apologised and reset the card quickly while another did it without saying anything at all. 

Lastly, the hotel has huge signs calling it ‘The Green’ not ‘O’Callighans’ which is confusing on arrival.  Nothing to spoil our trip but worth noting. 

So, all in all, a nice hotel I’d recommend with a few words of warning. I’ve stayed in far worse but this one could be better, especially the staff. The most important things like location, comfort and noise levels were pleasing and we enjoyed our stay. ",3,2018,08,11
212,Excellent,"Dublin is magic and so is Stephens green Hotel. A very nice spacious clean beautifully renovated room with all the amenities you may need!! Right in the middle of everything, 2 minute walk to the center!We had an excellent stay, they looked after us , especially the girls in the breakfast room!! We would like to thank all of them for their  kindness and attention.. you must try their Irish breakfast.. delicious. The reception always polite and there to help you! Thank you all !!",5,2018,08,03
212,Decent location but not worth the money. Better hotels around if you don’t mind a bit of a walk,"Stayed here in 2016 on first visit to Dublin. This property is very close to St Stephens Green which is a very historic and beautiful place. Food was decent and rooms were ok...nothing special. Noisy area when you needed to open the window for fresh air. Next time I stayed at a much nicer hotel on Burlington Road that was a 20 minute walk to Grafton Street. I am in my 60 and in just ok shape and I found it a pleasant walk. 
save some money and get a nicer experience a bit further out.",3,2018,07,26
212,Do Not stay here,"Worst hotel experience of my life.  No air conditioning in the room and it is like an oven. The first woman I told at the front desk snickered and told me to shut the balcony door.  The second person (who I had to see in person since the phone in the room doesn't work) said they would telll the manager tomorrow, and that he thinks none of the rooms have air conditioning.  DO NOT STAY HERE.",1,2018,07,14
212,Bar,"Popped into the Green hotel for a drink last night. I have to say the man with the beard and glasses behind the bar was absolutely on top of his game. Super friendly and the most professional barman I have ever met. He had a foreign accent. 
This guy is a real credit to the green hotel.  
Beautiful bar and also the loos were pristine. Well done to all. ",5,2018,07,14
212,mini break with husband,"Lovely central hotel! Very clean,good breakfast but breakfast waiting staff could be more attentive.Duty Manager very helpful and friendlyt recommend.Ideal location for sight seeing and shopping and great night life! Definitely recommend!",4,2018,07,13
212,Mother and daughter visit,"Great location!   Accommodation were just ok.   The pillows were awful - hard flat and uncomfortable!   The curtains were thin and did not keep out the morning light.  The room was very clean and other than the items noted was perfectly fine but would definitely not rate as a 4 star as advertised!   The hotel was quaint and had a boutique feel.  Our breakfast was included in the room rate and it was fine for what we wanted (yogurt, fruit, coffee).  Atmosphere in dining room was very comfortable and was welcoming.  Would recommend and would probably stay here again.  ",4,2018,07,11
212,"Great location, poor service ","Great location, hotel is clean and has a beautiful lobby and bar. The bar however is a little soulless and could be cheered up by an enthusiastic bar tender of which we didn’t meet any....and this is the issue no friendly welcome, staff avoiding eye contact, no smiles...and unhelpful, they just seemed fed up, you got the impression that you where not welcome. 

Bedding is very poor quality, it’s better in premier inn 

So all in all service and  quality is poor for a hotel of this price and the atmosphere is subdued. 

Not the worst hotel in the world but having been to Dublin many times I think there are much better options so shop around people and avoid this place if you can. ",2,2018,07,09
212,A ONE STAR EXPERIENCE AT A 4 STAR DUBLIN HOTEL,"Recently booked a one night stay at the O'Callaghan's Stephens Green Hotel as a gift to my daughter and her husband. It appears the hotel has been renamed The Green.  We agreed to meet in the hotel bar after the Michael Buble concert at 11.30p.m..  Only approximately 12 to 15 people in the bar - the barman hadn't a clue about bar work, couldn't complete the simplest of orders, and couldn't operate the cash till or credit card device. After waiting 30 mins for even an acknowledgement of our presence - we decided to go elsewhere and asked the night porter at the reception desk if he would order a taxi for us. Told us he couldn't do as he had no numbers for taxis.
This and similar other complaints were conveyed to front desk management the following morning - but other than an expression of regret there was no other feedback.
We had paid a significant €300+ charge for a room for one night to a so-called 4**** hotel and we we had at best a 1* to 2** experience.
An email of complaint has also been sent to directly to the hotel.",2,2018,07,08
212,POOR SERVICE AND FOOD AND NOT WORTH THE MONEY,"Apart from the lady on reception who was excellent the hotel was very disappointing indeed. The room was OK but i would have accepted this standard for half of what we paid .. The bar and restaurant service were poor and although we only had evening drinks and breakfast on both days the quality of the food and service was appalling. I had some Porridge ( eventually ) and had to leave it as it didn't even taste like any porridge i had ever eaten.. Just watery cheap oats. 
All in all  i won't be going back and I visit Dublin on a regular basis",2,2018,06,29
212,Too much expensive ,"We stayed 3 nights in this hotel. The room is confortable, but the windows are not soundproof, so you can enjoy the tramway’s bell, the traffic on the road and people drunk walking by.
The breakfast is disappointing. We thought we could enjoy English or American breakfast . No way, only continental breakfast, Irish breakfast(which is one plate with vegetables, bacon and poached egg) and a Veggie one for 17€. Exprès so is extra charge.
So pas thru and let’s have your breakfast elsewhere.
Service is average but it seems waiters and waitresses haven’t too much experience.
Life is expensive in Dublin but this hotel seems over expensive in my opinion. ",3,2018,06,27
212,"Excellent location, recently renovated, modern hotel","We recently spent the weekend at the Green Hotel across the street from St. Stephen's Green in Dublin.  The hotel has a great location, the rooms are modern and comfortable, and the staff is friendly and helpful.  If you are flying from the USA, I would pay extra for the early check-in. We were in our room at 9:15 ad took a nap after the flight from New York. Also, the Irish breakfast is great.  There are other selections also.  Stephen's Green is a lovely park, the hotel is near Grafton Street for shopping and many locations are easily walkable.",5,2018,06,26
212,Revovated to a higher standard,"Back in May I spent a night in this hotel on Stephens Green; I had given a previous review from when I stayed back on February 22nd but not sure where that is gone too.

I wanted to compliment the on-going renovations the hotel was doing at the time and have to say that the bathrooms in the new look King Rooms are stunning.",4,2018,06,26
212,Ideal location and standard,Stayed here a couple of times on business. Could not fault the hotel at all. Excellent service and quality of rooms are great. There was a lot of refurbishment going on at the time I stayed but did not take away the quality of service. Ideally located across from St Stephens Green and a short walk to Grafton Street and Temple bar area. Price was very reasonable for it being in Dublin centre. Highly recommend for city break or business. ,4,2018,06,25
212,"Service is really off, can't provide basic answers","I've stayed at a few places around Stephen's Green and I have to say O'Callaghan's fell short in a lot of areas.  

Highlights:
The renovated areas look cool, lovely new bathrooms.  The cafe in the lobby seems nice.  I was drawn to the location (which is great) but in hindsight wish I had booked somewhere else in the area.

Negatives:
The staff can't give an accurate, consistent answer to basic questions.  I called ahead to see what my options for early check-in were, I know it usually can't be guaranteed but I wanted to make sure my request was noted since I knew my flight would be getting in at 5am.  The person I spoke to told me they didn't have my reservation and I wasn't in their system for 10-15 minutes while I paid long distance calling rates.  After insisting he look again, he finally found it under the exact name I had given him all along.   He eventually said early check-in wouldn't be an issue but there would be a charge (cool, no problem, put me down!).  I also read there were renovations so understandably I figured some things might be closed.  It was important to me to have a gym for my stay so before I committed to the hotel I asked him if the fitness facilities would be open.  He assured me that the renovation was ""basically done"" so it wouldn't be a problem.  Imagine my surprise when I showed up at 5am and there was no record of my request for an early check in (I was told it would have been no problem had they known I was coming early) and the fitness facilities were in fact closed due to their renovation.  Really unacceptable to not be able to provide those basic details to your guests when they ask.  I would have booked elsewhere had I known but I wasn't given accurate information to make that decision.

There are a lot of nice options in this area and I'd recommend booking elsewhere so you're not misled and frustrated for your stay.",2,2018,06,24
212,Surprisingly Poor,"It's not often I leave a review - though it's not often I am as disappointed/frustrated as this stay has left me. 
I am a London-based Dubliner, and travel frequently for work (globally). This stay has been possibly the worst hotel stay I have experienced in years. 
Reception staff extremely rude and unhelpful. Ignored me until they were ready to speak with me (though I am not sure what was busying them otherwise - two behind the counter, with no other customers in sight).
The room itself, though refurbed recently - extremely basic. They obviously didn't replace beds and pillows (lumpy and uncomfortable). 
The air conditioning unit is the loudest I have come across in any hotel. 
There is no minibar fridge in the room (though reception advised me there was. Had to request for water to be sent to the room (not provided as standard). 
The internet is almost unusable. In fact, writing this review has been challenging (let along getting some actual work done). 
Overall, very disappointing. Though loyal to Irish owned hotels, I will not be staying here again on my Irish work trips.",1,2018,06,13
212,Great location in the heart of Dublin.,"This hotel is at the edge of a beautiful park and near the heart of Dublin.  The Dublin tourist information center is just down the street as is the Irish Whiskey Museum.  Walkable to Temple Bar Square.

They offer a nice breakfast but no lunch.  They even had a U.S. outlet in the room!",4,2018,06,09
212,Rip Off,"I stayed in this hotel in early May and I was absolutely shocked over the lack of basic amenities. It is clear the hotel is undergoing major renovation - perhaps they should have closed down until the revamp was done before taking bookings & people's money.

Upon arrival after a long drive I asked the Receptionist for the ladies room to which I was told there is none available while renovation's were ongoing.  Because we landed a little earlier than check in and the room was not ready, there was no place for me to use the ladies.  I had to walk back down to Grafton St and use the facilities in McDonalds'.

I asked where the bar was - I was told it wasn't available due to renovation.  Breakfast was dreadful.  We were squashed into a small room.  Basic crockery were on the table for us to use - mugs, cutlery.  It was really disappointing.  Food was poor; cold and greasy.

That night after returning from dinner, I found the night receptionist very rude.  He was dealing with another customer and was extremely abrupt over what seemed like a very minor issue. I had to wait for him to finish dealing with the young lady before he could tend to me.  The other receptionist was outside the building chatting to his friends.  I asked to get a glass of water to take back to my room.  My husband waited 25 minutes and eventually left empty handed, not sure did the second receptionist get lost but he didn't return with the water - that's really annoying.

The room was lovely - spacious and clean but for €269 the whole experience was a massive waste of money.  If I was made aware the extent of the renovations I would probably have delayed my stay until the hotel was 100% functioning but the only hint there may be disturbance was a foot note at the end of the reservation confirmation stating our room would not be on the same floor as any disturbance.  There was no mention that there's no female toilets in Reception, no bar, no proper breakfast room. 

So if you are like me and expect a hotel to have a bar, a decent breakfast room and ladies toilets on the ground floor - do not stay here.  Wait until the renovation is complete or stay in somewhere else.",1,2018,06,01
212,Saved our life,"We booked this hotel last minute as we had a problem with our previous accommodation and essentially had nowhere to stay.  I can honestly say i wish from the beginning we had booked this hotel.  The hotel itself is lovely.  We had 2 rooms in the new section of the hotel which were decorated to a high standard throughout, spacious & spotless.  They had a nespresso coffee machine which was a god send in the morning!  The staff are lovely, they could not do enough for you and when we had to ring downstairs for items they responded promptly.  They are actually an asset to the hotel.  The surrounding area to the hotel is lovely.  It’s right next to St Stephens Green and a short walk away from Grafton Street.  I would definitely stay here again.",5,2018,05,30
212,Our last minute saviour ,"Booked this hotel and arrived within the hour as the other accommodation we booked wasn’t up to standard so had to leave. Found this hotel on Booking.com and as it looked so nice and was reasonably priced we was surprised they had rooms spare for that night. Upon arrival we were greeted by the lovely receptionist and given the keys to our room in the newer part of the hotel. The room can only be described as clean, comfy and very spacious with a huge bed, bathroom, seating area and outdoor terrace. This was amazing and we were very grateful after our previous hotel encounter. The hotel was in a lovely area close to Grafton street and was within walking distance to shops, bars and restaurants. One night the hotel rung us a taxi to Temple Bar too. We needed a few extra things whilst in the hotel and rung down to the reception desk for extra toilet roll, milk for the coffee machine and an ice bucket for our drinks. Staff were polite, friendly and very quick to meet our requests. Couldn’t ask for better. Will definitely be returning as it was good value, lovely rooms and staff and in a great location. Thank you so much!!! ",5,2018,05,29
212,"Very Nice Hotel, Great Location","We arrived at the hotel at 0600.  Our room was ready so we got in and downloaded our baggage.  We had a king bed, really nice bathroom, and it was very quiet.  The staff were very friendly and the included breakfast in the newly renovated restaurant was very good.  The location is right across from St Stephen's Green, a large park, and only a few minutes walk to Trinity College.  If we went back to Dublin I wouldn't mind staying here again!",4,2018,05,25
212,"Great location, good amenities","Stayed here for 2 nights on a trip through Ireland, and the location turned out to be fantastic. Right next to Stephens Green, and within a short walk to Trinity College and Temple Bar and Grafton Street. The room itself was nice, especially the bathrooms. The car parking was a little hard to find, but once the car was parked we did not need it due to the hotels location. ",4,2018,05,21
212,Lovely hotel,"We had a very nice one night stay in the new part of this hotel. The staff were very helpful and the room, in particular the bathroom, was beautiful. I am aware they are undergoing reconstruction however this caused no disturbance whatsoever to our stay. The central location makes this a wonderful choice for anyone visiting Dublin.",5,2018,05,20
212,Great Bathroom; Everything Else Mediocre,"Despite the beautifully renovated bathroom, I would not stay here again due to mediocrity and inconsistencies.

Pro: 
Good sized, renovated bathroom with trendy teal/jade-colored subway tiles. Modern elevated sink above the sink counter is complemented with storage with a long tiled counter shelf for toiletries.  Standing alone shower and decent sized toilet.

Cons: 
1) The renovation efforts appear only to be partial.  The oak-colored bed, standing closet, desk areas and maroon patterned rug do not match the new, trendy bathroom décor and modern leisure chair.  
2) Uncomfortable bed mattress with flat pillows.  
3) Finally settled on a 3rd room after problems with previous two: 1st was wrong bed type and 2nd had a noisy air/heating system that sounded like a cross between a percolating coffee maker with a malfunctioning refrigerating unit 
4) Upon switching rooms my 3rd room did not have water bottles as the other previous rooms did. 
5) When checking out I had been double-charged.  I prepaid for two nights hotel stay which was acknowledged by front desk upon check-in.  However, upon check-out my credit card had been charged for one night.  Front desk clerk was unable to remedy right then, but assured me it would be corrected later in day once his manager arrived and I would receive a revised bill via email.  It is now 3 days later and I have not received said email, so I now have to follow-up with them.",3,2018,05,14
212,Well located currently being refurbished ,"This is a well located hotel near to St Steven’s Green and shopping streets and restaurants. However the hotel is currently being refurbished, so the room was newly renovated.
However, had the refurbishment been notified when booking would probably given the hotel a miss.",4,2018,05,12
212,Second visit,"I previously stayed ay this hotel in 2014 and as my review stated at that time, I felt that it was a good 2nd tier hotel.  Since that time many improvements have been made (bar / restaurant renovations on-going). 

The lobby area has been completely renovated and so have the rooms (at least ours has), and I am very pleased with the very stylish room and bathroom renovations.  ",4,2018,05,12
212,Nice location across from St Stevens Green and close to Grafton Street/Temple Bar area,Found our experience at this hotel to be good; did have a problem with hairdryer but that was really the only issue we had. Bathroom was very nice with the large circular rainshower showerhead if that is something you enjoy (as opposed to a hand-held showerhead attached to the wall).  Grafton Street/Temple Bar area is very nice for walking around and finding restaurant/bar establishments and shopping (if that is your thing).  Step on/step off Dublin tour bus stop area just on other side of St Stephens Green making this hotel convenient to almost any major tourist location in Dublin,4,2018,05,11
212,Great location and decent rooms,"Have stayed here before on numerous occasions though they were literally finishing the refurbishment as I checked in. The rooms were modernised though the main difference I noticed was the bathrooms which are much better. There were a few touches though like cheap towels that took the edge off.
The breakfast was alright but underwhelming.
The service was a bit ""passive"".
However, great location.",4,2018,05,02
212,Fantastic experience .. to experience Dublin!,"Great hotel, excellent location, brand new and well furnished rooms, perfect welcome with small pastries offered and brought directly to the room, thanks to all the staff (responsible for breakfast, reception and barman who prepare excellent cocktails). Greetings to Jessica, always available and prepared: see you soon!",5,2024,08,19
212,"EXCELLENT, I RECOMMEND IT TO EVERYONE WHO VISITS DUBLIN","Visit to Dublin for Easter holidays, we chose this hotel based on comments on this page and others of this type.
I hope I don't leave anything out of this great hotel.
Very spacious room like few in European cities, extra large bed, full and spacious bathroom, no noise from other rooms or the street, cleanliness of 10, total rest.
Very complete breakfast, Irish products such as sausages, black pudding, eggs, butter, juices, yogurts, pastries, difficult to choose with so much, location 10 minutes from the city center, St. Patrick's Cathedral, library, that is to say, it couldn't be better and I leave it for the Finally, the attention of the staff I give a 10 to all of them, because of my language and not knowing any English, especially Patrick, a boy who studied in Spain and understood us perfectly and wanted to learn more, Sophie, a very kind girl and With his magnificent Spanish he explained perfectly the doubts we had and his other colleagues at the reception, including the day of our departure at dawn to the boy from Cádiz, sorry for not remembering his name, and the breakfast people, all very attentive to us at all times, live to the client and enjoy their work. The details with us to always remember them.

212,Centrally located beautiful hotel with exceptionally friendly staff,"Nice big rooms, beautiful bathroom, super friendly staff, especially Franklin. Very large selection at breakfast. From a hot Irish breakfast to a continental breakfast. The scones were particularly delicious. My room was on the fourth floor facing the street, but by the second night I was able to ignore the traffic and sleep well. On the day of departure, Franklin packed me a very generous breakfast for the road because I had to check out shortly before 4 a.m. The hotel is definitely highly recommended.",5,2023,08,17
212,"Strategic location, comfortable hotel","Discreet structure and furnishings, excellent logistics as the hotel is located in a quiet area but very close (5/10 minutes walk) to Grafton Street and therefore to the center of Dublin.
The staff at the reception were very kind and helpful, the beds in the KS rooms were very comfortable and large.
We did not try breakfast and therefore cannot express an opinion.",5,2023,08,16
212,3 Tage Dublin am St. Stephens Green,"Wir waren 3 Nächte im Green, hatten ein Executive Zimmer im obersten Stock. Schöne Glasfront mit Blick auf St. Stephens Green (seitlich). Zimmer schön gr0ß, Heizung war gut bei den kalten Temperaturen. Nachteil es gibt keine Heizung im Bad, die Fliesen sind immer kalt und wir haben die ganze Zeit die Tür aufgelassen, damit wenigstens ein bisschen wärme vom Raum ins Bad zieht. Ein weiterer Kritikpunkt ist die Executive Lounge, zwar gibt es immer Kaffee, Getränke und Chips, aber keinen Weißwein und auch keine kleinen Snacks, sieht immer sehr verlassen aus und wir waren mehrmals in dem Raum, haben aber nie jemand gesehen der reinigt oder auffüllt. Besonderes Lob gilt Jessica an der Rezeption, sie war immer sehr freundlich, wir durften auch 1 Std länger im Zimmer bleiben bevor wir auscheckten und Sie hat uns einen guten Tip für ein italienisches Restaurant gegeben. Grazie Jessica!!!!",4,2023,03,13

212,Angenehmes Hotel in bester Lage,"Für einen besonderen persönlichen Anlass suchten wir ein gutes Hotel in der Innenstadt und nach etwas Internetrecherche buchten wir THE GREEN direkt über die Webseite des Hotels zu einem sehr günstigen Sonderpreis.
Unser schönes Zweibettzimmer war ausreichend gross mit guten, vielleicht etwas weichen Betten;  Schreibtisch sowie separatem Tisch mit bequemen Sesseln. Zur Einrichtung gehörten ausserdem Retro-Telefon und - Radio; ein grosser Flachbild TV mit diversen englischsprachigen Kanälen; zahlreiche  - auch kontinentaleuropaeische - Steckdosen; schnelles Internet, (Kabel und WLAN); diverse Leuchten, Haartrockner, Klimaanlage und grosser Safe. Das Badezimmer war hell, modern und bot genügend Ablagemöglichkeiten, sowie eine kräftige Dusche. 
Der einzige Nachteil war, daß das Zimmer im ersten Stock zur Straße hin ging, und dass es  trotz Schallschutzfenster nachts nie ganz ruhig wurde. Wer einen leichten Schlaf hat, sollte bei Buchung  darauf achten, ein Zimmer in einem höheren Stockwerk und zur strassenabgewandten Seite zu bekommen. 
Das hoteleigene Restaurant bot eine uebersichtliche Karte mit diversen Speisen zum sehr vernünftigen Preis - keine Gourmetküche, aber durchaus reichhaltig und schmackhaft. 
Das Frühstücksbüffet war sehr reichhaltig, wenn auch den warmen Speisen die lange Stehzeit am Buffet geschmacklich nicht unbedingt bekam. Eine frische Zubereitung nach Wunsch wäre hier angebrachtl. 
Der Service war durchweg in allen Bereichen zurückhaltend freundlich und zuvorkommend.  
Groesster Pluspunkt des Hauses ist die Lage direkt am Stephen's Green Park und in kurzer Gehweite zur Grafton Street. Parken kann man zum reduzierten Preis (20 Euro für 24 Std) im q-Park am Shopping Center, 5 Min. vom Hotel entfernt. 
Unserer Meinung nach ist dieses Haus rundum empfehlenswert mit einem exzellenten Preis/Leistungsverhältnis - besonders wenn man eines der Sonderangebote direkt auf der Webseite des Hotels nutzt!  Eine grosse Flasche Prosecco gibt es bei Direktbuchung noch dazu (Stand Januar 2020)!",5,2020,01,10
212,Angenehme Atmosphäre ,"Ansprechendes, modernes Hotel in guter Lage. Die Camden Street, mit vielen, von den Einheimischen bevorzugten traditionellen Pubs, ist nur eine Ecke entfernt und einige ausgezeichnete Restaurant befinden sich direkt vor der Haustüre am Stephen‘s Green.
Zurück im Hotel, lässt es sich in den großen Betten hervorragend schlafen.
Das Personal ist sehr freundlich und zuvorkommend und wenn Sie Glück haben, arbeitet Felipe im Morgendienst an der Rezeption. Ein kleiner Plausch mit ihm ist ein guter Start in den neuen Tag.

Wir kommen bestimmt wieder und können dieses Hotel sehr empfehlen.",5,2019,10,30
212,Nice hotel,"La habitación es preciosa y está muy limpia.
La localización está muy bien, justo al lado del parque Saint Stephen's Green y en llegar al Temple Bar andando no te lleva ni 15 minutos y de camino, pasas por una calle peatonal importante y por delante de Molly Malone.
