The staff were mega friendly and helpful, and we loved the spacious room and welcoming bar downstairs.",5,2024,10,14
135,A hidden gem!,"Vintry & Mercer… one of the small luxury hotels of the world and I can see why they are part of this elite family. Attention to detail was impeccable. The staff were friendly and professional, nothing was too much trouble. The DND bar was an experience I won’t forget , the Vintage Sazerac was stunning. 
There is something special about the intimacy of a small hotel which, for me, makes for the ultimate experience.",5,2024,10,12
135,Outstanding staff,The hotel was well maintained and well placed for a stay in the City of London but it is its staff that make it stand head and shoulders about others. Without exception they were first class in every way.,5,2024,10,11
135,Perfect Three Nights,"A perfect few nights in London. Great location away from the hustle and bustle but still centrally located and easily accessible. Very quiet at night. Room was huge - we got a free upgrade which was SO appreciated. Normally rooms in London are quite small so having a lot of space was a treat. Otherwise, room was very comfortable with everything we needed and the complimentary drinks in the mini bar were much appreciated. Room service was fantastic for both dinner and breakfast, and every time we had a request it was tended to immediately. The rooftop restaurant was also lovely on a sunny evening. Would highly recommend to anyone for a stay in London!",5,2024,10,10
135,Lovely property…excellent service,I had a booking mix up and V&M were very helpful in resolving it. The room (604) we had  for 3 nights was divine…a corner room with great views and a comfy sofa and chairs.Loved having a bath too. Breakfast was very good and we had drinks and ate in the rooftop bar which was also excellent. Great place to be as sun is setting. This hotel was a pleasant surprise. Thanks V&M,5,2024,10,07

135,Charming hotel,"This is a charming hotel, with a lovely staff, good food, and great rooftop bar. The bed was very comfortable and the room clean.",5,2024,10,03
135,Luxury is worth it,"This hotel was a little pricier than we would normally spend, and you can find hotels for less but… it was absolutely worth it to spend a little more. This hotel was beautifully decorated inside from the rooms to the restaurant.
The rooms were comfortable, and while they were not huge had small details that added that touch of a little something extra. For example decent sized cups for tea and coffee in the room, real milk in the mini fridge and the newspaper and magazines left in a newspaper bag on the door ready to take downstairs for breakfast.
The staff could not do enough for you, they were attentive and thoughtful but not over the top. The information sent to us prior to our stay was just enough to be informative without being too much and when we checked in the reception staff asked about our plans and whether there was anything they could do to help make our stay easier from booking activities to sorting transport.
Would 100% recommend this hotel.",5,2024,09,30
135,Great location but standard bedroom too small.,Great location but the standard bedroom is too small for two people. There is very little room to move and the toilet feels like it's in the bedroom with a glass sliding door. Hotel was very clean and staff friendly.,3,2024,09,26
135,Nice hotel but very expensive,As per comments despite being regular guests spending over £1000 2 x per year the prices keep going up for rooms and no loyalty for returning customers ,3,2024,09,26
135,Great hotel in ideal City location,"Stylish and individual hotel in a quiet yet convenient location. Room are comfortable and well equipped although our standard room was quite small. The roof terrace is a fantastic additional bonus and we spent most of the (sunny) afternoon enjoying the views, snacks and wine! Highly recommended",5,2024,09,23
135,100% Comfortable and convenient,"Convenient location to many attractions in the south bank. Beautiful and modern interior design. 

However, if you are coming from Heathrow to Mansion House Station (nearest subway station from the hotel), make sure you have the energy to carry your checked-in luggage bags up the stairs in order to reach the street level. There are no elevator.",5,2024,09,22
135,Hidden Gem Boutique Hotel,"[my review is an update, TripAdvisor does not allow edits to reviews to add photos etc]

I stayed in this hotel in early Spring 2022 during my London and Scotland trip. The location is fantastic and quiet, very close to the Tower Bridge. I walked over each day to wander the market and shops. The rooms, while small, are packed with everything you'd need and more. The beds were some of the most comfortable that I've experienced! Their breakfast was tasty and rooftop restaurant/bar was a nice cocktail break away from the city. I would definitely consider booking this hotel again when visiting London. It's a hidden gem.",5,2024,09,21
135,What a gem!,"This is a bang-for-your buck hotel. It’s in a great spot walking distance to tourist spots (Tate Modern, Shakespeare Globe, Borough Market) yet tucked away in a small street so it’s quiet at night. Looks, feels and smells new and modern yet reminds me so much of home. Deluxe room is well-proportioned, comfy queen bed. A la carte breakfast was well-priced and good chai latte but so-so coffees. Well-stocked mini-bar which was included in the room rate and replenished daily  (canned water, soft drinks, apple and orange juice, popcorn). I asked for extra still water and room service gave me three extra cans one day! Minor quibbles—pillows were too soft, mini-fridge could be colder, and one night I asked room service for ice which never came—oh well! The front desk and bell boys are champs! Mansion House tube station is a five minute walk but doesn’t have lifts/ramps for traveller with lugggage or disabilities.",5,2024,09,20
135,Simply Wonderful!,"I’ve been wanting to try Vintry & Mercer for sometime now and finally got the opportunity to do so in September 2024 when I was in London to move my daughter home from university.  
The entire experience from start to finish was simply outstanding.
The staff at check in were wonderful to deal with and went out of their way to welcome me.  The room was excellent, and I love the fact that some of the rooms provide an opportunity to open the windows. The bed was incredibly comfortable. The location is really good  - midway location between the City and West London.
We had dinner at the rooftop restaurant, and that entire experience was excellent as well. 
This place is a hidden gem.  The staff,  the rooms and the location make this one of the best options for accommodation in London in my view. 
We will definitely be back.  Thanks to the Vintry team for making our stay so awesome.",5,2024,09,18

135,Enjoyed my stay,"Great location, clean room, breakfast can be better. The weather in London was humid and I wish the room provides a dehumidifier. We had the double twin bed. The beds are very comfortable but quite small, maybe it's the case for European hotels in general? The breakfast was a disappointment, the pastries tastes supermarket/factory quality and the fried eggs/sausages were too greasy. ",5,2024,09,09

We cannot recommend this charming hotel enough! ",5,2024,09,07

Overall is was a wonderful experience and we will definitely stay here again.

135,Exceptional Quality,"This is one of the finest luxury brands in The Hotel Collection. A very unique design to this property with everything from aesthetic appeal, attenuation of modern lighting and vintage decor provides a relaxing space to enjoy away from home. This area is also a perfect place to enjoy the view of surrounding tourist attractions. In particular it is a great location to walk comfortably to and from St. Paul’s Cathedral. ",5,2024,09,05
135,One of the best hotels we've ever stayed at!,"As a very well traveled couple we usually stay at nicer hotels without going crazy, this was our first 5 star hotel and we were very impressed. I thought the price was extremely fair and since I booked with our AMEX PLATINUM they were able to give us a free room upgrade and $100 to spend at the bar/restaurant. They also gave us 2 complimentary glasses of champagne for our anniversary! ",5,2024,09,04
135,Amazing stay,"Super friendly staff, amazing breakfast (I had the veggie option), central location (close to St Paul's with lots of diner options around), very well equipped room, quiet and dark at night.",5,2024,09,02
135,Weeklong Quiet Niche for Couple Travelers,"Vintry & Mercer was the perfect place for our week in London. It was safe, clean, quiet, and easily accessible to several Underground stops. 

We had a superior room, which was just enough for two adults + luggage/""stuff"" for an 8 night stay without wasting room/space. The bed was super comfortable, and the bathroom spacious enough and always impeccably clean.

The location is more so in a business area, which meant it was livelier foot traffic around 3-7pm on weekdays, but otherwise it was always so easy to get to the District & Circle lines on the Underground, and we never had to fight a crowd for those stops in or out. 

The hotel has a great rooftop restaurant and bar, which was perfect for our week of really, really nice weather in London! 

The staff was friendly and accommodating. I'd highly recommend it for either a short or long stay.",5,2024,09,01
135,Perfect hotel for a night in the city,My husband and I decided to stay in London for our 10 year wedding anniversary. We stayed at Vintry & Mercer and we were so thrilled we did. The hotel was exceptionally priced and the rooms themselves were perfect for our short stay. The rooms were not large but we didn't need more space. The rooms were stunning and clean. I suffer with a bad back and its been the first hotel bed where I woke up NOT in agony. I would happily stay ehre again and would recommend it to others!,5,2024,09,01
135,Amazing value and stay,"The friendliness of the staff really made our stay, but it all came with a great price, amenities, and cleanliness.",5,2024,09,01
135,"Location, Service, Comfort","I choose this place, due to it's location to an underground stop as well as the reviews that mentioned service and if I'm being honest - the free mini bar.

Location:
A 2 minute walk to the District line (stop: Mansion House) or you could walk a little further and get the next stop). It took about 75 minutes to get to Heathrow, changing for the Piccadilly line.

15 - 20 minute walk to Tower Bridge, Borough Market, Leadenhall Market.

There are coffee shops, quick serve restaurants and a Sainsbury express right next to the Mansion House stop - you have everything you could need.

Service:
I called and they were very kind and welcoming. They received my Uber Eats delivery for me the day of my departure (even when I was not there) and held it for me as well as my luggage until 4pm when I left. They allowed me an early check in at no extra charge. They also allow you to sit in their breakfast area which is not used after breakfast is over.

Hotel:
We did not have time to eat in either restaurant nor use the gym downstairs, but we did have a peek and the gym was small but perfectly equipped for a person who does a mix of cardio and weights (free weights, pulley machine). There were lots of bathrooms downstairs too to use. The restaurant on the 7th floor was on a terrace and quite beautiful.

Room:
We got upgraded to a deluxe room from a superior. There was a closet with hangers, drawers and an in room safe. The mini bar had no alcohol and was more of a chiller, but it did fine with keeping our yogurts and drinks cool.

We had: coke, diet coke, orange juice, apple juice, and milk and still and sparking water cans which were all free to consume (and free refills).

They also had a hot water electric kettle, a nespresso machine. one US outlet and many USB outlets. They had a powerful hairdryer.

Our room had one wall which was entirely a window with black out shades and curtains with a view of the shard. The bed was so comfortable. Everything was so lush, clean and looked brand new. Soap, shampoo, lotion and conditioner and body wash were provided. The towels were thick. Room service every day. Shall I go on?

I was traveling for 4 nights with only my under 12 year old son, and I could not be more pleased with my choice. I was so comfortable I don't think I could stay anywhere else when I returned. I paid about $250/night.",5,2024,08,30
135,Brilliant,"I had a fantastic stay. The rooms were impeccably clean, incredibly comfortable, and stylishly decorated. The hotel's location was perfect – quiet and peaceful, yet just a short walk from the city center. The breakfast was delicious, with a wide variety of options. The staff were incredibly friendly, helpful, and professional, especially Jairo
- thank you & best of luck!",5,2024,08,28
135,Perfect hotel for a short business trip,"Brilliant rooms, food, staff, guests, design. Loved all. I came for an important meeting and staying in this hotel helped me to prepare well without distractions and recuperate after ",5,2024,08,28
135,"Great Stay, With Two Big Exceptions","The hotel was located in a great area and the room was nice. Two problems. The morning we had to leave there was absolutely no running water and no solution or timing on a repair provided, meaning we were unable to shower or get ready before leaving for the airport. 

Second issue was that upon packing up before leaving I realized that two pairs of Bluetooth earbuds were both missing from my backpack. They had been in a zipped shut pocket and in the room the whole time so unfortunately the only conclusion possible is that they were taken from the room somehow. An unfortunately unpleasant way to end what was otherwise a nice stay. ",2,2024,08,27
135,Short but Wonderful Stay,"My recent stay at Vintry & Mercer was exceptional from start to finish. Upon arrival, we were pleasantly surprised with an upgrade to a beautiful deluxe room, which made our stay even more special. The room was stylishly designed, offering both comfort and elegance. The staff was incredibly friendly and welcoming, making us feel right at home. They were always available to assist with anything we needed, adding to the overall positive experience.

The only minor issue we encountered was the absence of a top sheet on the bed, which we found a bit unusual. However, this was a small detail in an otherwise perfect stay. We thoroughly enjoyed our time at Vintry & Mercer and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a luxurious and memorable stay in London.",5,2024,08,27
135,A must stay!,"This was the nicest stay I’ve had in London. When we arrived we were offered a room upgrade and the room we were upgraded too was absolutely beautiful. Whenever we needed anything (toothbrush/iron) we rang reception and it was there within minutes. We were offered water anytime we were in reception. We didn’t eat at the hotel so I can’t comment on the food. The location was perfect, walking distance from Bank and Mansion House tube stations. We will definitely be back! ",5,2024,08,27
135,Superb hotel,"I really enjoyed this hotel, especially the lack of noise at night. Room was very comfortable, shower was great. Very close to tube station. Staff were very helpful.",5,2024,08,26
135,Service & Comfort,"Lovely small hotel. Very comfortable, and great service. Food quality great, with roof top terrace a lovely spot to enjoy dinner & drinks. Would happily stay again.",5,2024,08,26
135,Pampered in the City of London,"A real treat in The City of London. This hotel makes you feel pampered and is something special. From the beautiful, plant filled reception area, to the perfectly appointed room (with robes and slippers), to the stunning views from the roof terrace, we enjoyed all the upscale touches of a boutique hotel. All the front desk staff were extremely polite and helpful, and the location is perfect for visiting St. Paul's and crossing the Southwark or Millennium Bridge to The Globe and The Tate Modern. Easy access to groceries and the Mansion House Tube Station, or a little walk to Cannon Street. Truly a stand-out hotel.",5,2024,08,22
135,"Small, clean, great customer service!","Small, clean and service hat went far and above.  The front desk crew did everyone possible to make our holiday great.  Thank you for the great time. ",5,2024,08,22
135,Gorgeous Property,"Our experience at Vintry and Mercer was spectacular from start to finish. Its convenient location near the tube made it easy to get around, but it also felt safe and was quiet as it was removed from the main roads. The rooms are beautifully decorated and the beds are very comfortable. The amenities are plentiful, good quality, and frequently replenished. The staff are also very helpful and friendly. The view and food at the Mercer Rooftop restaurant are not to be missed.",5,2024,08,21
135,The perfect overnight stay in London!,"Tastefully decoraded hotel, attentive, nice service, perfect location! We‘d love to come back! Thank you! ",5,2024,08,20
135,Comfortable stay in London,"The hotel was well appointed, had a lovely rooftop terrace, and was very convenient to all London sights and activities. There were two tube stops for two different lines within 5 minutes of the hotel. It was very clean and the staff was courteous. Although we did not spend much time in the room, the room was not the best in that it was particularly dark facing directly another wall, curtains had to stay closed at all time, and the lighting itself in the room was more for ambience than reading and it could not be increased. We had the right to an upgrade that was not honored because they were full apparently. We booked a deluxe room, and the room was spacious and bathroom well designed and nice. It was on the expensive side, but I assume all hotels of this caliber are. ",4,2024,08,19
135,Genuinely boutique stay in London,"Just a lovely boutique hotel near St Paul’s and Mansion House, the atmosphere was relaxed and friendly, the rooms were well sized and comfortable and felt very private. The roof terrace bar is also worth a visit. ",5,2024,08,17
135,Very beautiful bijou hotel,"We absolutely loved staying here. Much thought has been given to the tasteful and comfortable decor and rooms. Fabulous nights sleep in the queen sized bed. Loved the explosion of houseplants throughout the building. Super friendly and helpful staff, always eager to help. Wide range of breakfast choices. Scenic rooftop bar and restaurant for great views and chilled glass of white or G&T before dinner. ",5,2024,08,17
135,Wonderful gem in the City,"Fantastic gem of a hotel in an ideal location.  Great staff, incredibly comfortable beds, great decor and an amazing roof terrace restaurant with beautiful food.

135,Top in the City!,"Excellent stay, very comfortable hotel in a great location. First class service and very friendly staff. Nice Rooftop terrace bar and restaurant. ",5,2024,08,12
135,Next level service,"I stayed for 4 nights and had a really wonderful experience. Firstly, the rooms are small, BUT perfectly formed with everything you need. So many thoughtful touches e.g., the plug adaptors, free minibar, amenities kit etc. The bed is next level comfortable which helped my jetlag and the room was very quiet. The gym is small, but clean and well equipped. I only ate breakfast at the restaurant but the servings were generous, quality very high and they managed my special requests really well. The knock-out experience here was the service. Dimitri and his team leaped into action when I realised, as I was about to check-in for my flight back to Melbourne, that I had left my valuables in the safe when I checked out. They kindly and efficiently organised to get them to Heathrow for me - really going out of their way to help at a very stressful time. I couldn't have wished for a more trustworthy and efficient group of people! Can't recommend enough. ",5,2024,08,11
135,"Great, quiet, high-end boutique","The hotel, staff, location and service exceeded my expectations.  Highly accessible to all of the tourist locations we wanted to visit but was quiet and a great place to return at the end of the day. Would recommend to anyone visiting London. ",5,2024,08,10

Room service tasted extremely good and catered for my gluten free requirements. We finished the stay off with a visit to the rooftop bar which was stunning. ,5,2024,08,10
135,Nice hotel but bad experience with aircon and reception staff,Room was small but nice but the aircon was not working all 4 nights we were there and no one came to fix it / address the issue even after I raised it. The reception staff who received me and checked me out was unfriendly and unapologetic about the aircon situation. ,2,2024,08,10
135,"Lovely, small hotel","We stayed for a quick overnight after touring the English countryside as a family. The staff were very helpful and the decor is stylish and inviting. Excellent rooftop bar and dining. Rooms were very small and they didn’t have parking, which typically wouldn’t matter but we still had a rental for the night. Would stay there again as a couple or single. ",4,2024,08,09

135,V&M,Location of the room will make it break your stay. We had a truck with a generator pumping out the drains first thing on a Saturday morning so which was very noisy and odours came into the room. We had no voice but to get up and leave the room much earlier than planned.,3,2024,07,15

V&M is a hidden gem in a great locations.

We left after two days feeling completely recharged and refreshed. 
Already looking forward to our next visit. 
Thank you to everyone from front of staff and behind the scenes.  ",5,2024,07,15
135,Not Quite 5 Stars,"The property is undeniably beautiful. Everything is well kept and decorated immaculately, from the reception to the rooms. My room was incredibly spacious. That’s the good.

The reason I give this property a 4 instead of a 5 is for several reasons. First and most importantly, something is off with their service. While everyone I encountered was respectful, there was only 1 person (a man who worked at the rooftop restaurant) who was truly…friendly. I kept thinking it was just an anomaly each time I had an interaction with hotel staff but over my 3 day/2 night stay, that’s the only conclusion I was able to come to after multiple encounters with different staff members. This is so odd for a so-called 5 star property to not have this figured out. I stayed at 4 star property in London for the 4 days prior and it was such a contrast in the demeanor of the staff there who were overtly friendly, that I couldn’t help but notice what was lacking at Vintry & Mercer.

Other oddities that warrant the 4 star include: (1) participating the Amex Hotel Collection program* but not allowing me to take advantage of the early check-in or check-out (nor room upgrade for that matter), I’ve never been denied all 3 at one property before, (2) bath towels that were new but had never been washed before, meaning my whole body was covered in white lint to the point that people were pointing it out to me in public that I had “white stuff” on my head/face, (3) the half glass shower in the bathtub setup is always a recipe for water spillage all over the floor and I’m surprised they made that design choice, and (4) toilet paper so rough/dense that you could practically write a letter on it without fear of tearing the paper. 

Again, this property has the bones of a 5 star hotel but for some reasons misses the mark in the oddest ways. It’s not bad and you’ll probably enjoy your stay but personally I’d try another 5 star hotel in the city before returning here again. 

*I’m aware that the Amex Hotel Collection terms say that early check-in, late checkout, and room upgrades are all based on availability, but I’ve never encountered any property in the Hotel Collection or Fine Resorts & Hotel Collection that denied me all 3 of these benefits in one stay.",4,2024,07,13

Great location, tucked away with a fantastic rooftop bar.",5,2024,07,12
135,Such a disappointing experience for what is advertised as a five star hotel.,"From the offset this hotel disappointed us, it’s more akin to a chain than a five star, the room we were assigned also wasn’t what we paid for and when we queried this we were rather rudely told we could see the other rooms. The entire atmosphere was incredibly lack luster and the service pretty non existent. ",2,2024,07,09
135,Weekend break,"A superb hotel, lovely staff, great service, rooms are pristine, food is of a high quality, room service excellent, and free soft drinks ..... although my survey gives a poor score for one category ""sleep"" this was only due to the changeover of bins in the rear courtyard, my window was slightly agar so the noise woke me up.",5,2024,07,08

The hotel was very clean, in a central location, and offers some great food and beverage options - including happy hour! 

Our room was incredible. My husband and I were in awe with how spacious it was and we loved the lighting you get from the floor-to-ceiling windows. The décor was charming, and I loved the amenities, including: nespresso machines, multiple televisions (including in the bathroom!), divine skincare and other toiletries, bath robes, slippers, comfortable beds and great air conditioning.

The friendly staff also sent us a super sweet handwritten card with some sweets and champagne which was such a nice touch. We also enjoyed the room service and would've loved to try the restaurant if we had more time there!

An excellent walk-in shower with a rainforest shower head as big as a dinner plate!! No complaints whatsoever.

separate dinning area for breakfast which looked as if it was cooked to order.  Thoroughly recommend.",5,2024,05,08
135,A beautifully appointed hotel in central London,We had a spacious and immaculate room that was quiet even though it is in the centre of London. There has been great attention to detail in the design of this hotel. The staff were very friendly and helpful. There are so many sights within walking distance and a tube stop a 2 minute walk up the lane from the hotel.,5,2024,05,06
135,Five star boutique at its’ best,"I have stayed in many wonderful places over the years and my last visit to London was the Shangri-La.  I cannot help but comment on some of the things that we experienced in our stay here at Vintry and Mercer.
This hotel has the most wonderful welcome. From the second we stepped inside the staff could not have been more polite and helpful. A genuine interest in our visit and nothing was too much trouble. You actually felt welcomed and not just ‘ another tourist.’ Shangri-La take note. The room- we opted for the executive studio suite. Absolutely spotless. Immaculate. Hats off to the housekeeping staff. Spacious and beautifully decorated. The bed was incredibly comfortable and apart from a couple of doors above only once or twice ,very briefly it was so quiet. 
Dinner on the terrace was my only slight negative. We would have loved the waiter to check on us , how the food was etc and maybe pour the wine. We were topping ourselves up which was a little disappointing. The halibut was insane! Steak not so great, but over all nice. My only other criticism would be the second night. We went for a drink around 10 pm and one of the ladies didn’t look impressed as I think she may have wanted to go home. We noticed how quickly our wine was being topped up as they close at 11. Just had that rushed vibe which is a shame. Pleasant staff overall in there etc but just felt a little rushed. But the terrace was busy and fantastic views. Well worth a visit. The breakfast here is absolutely wonderful. Great choices and all so quickly presented and tastes so good. All hot when arrived. Nothing like the buffet style at the other hotel. I would rate this way above their offerings. 
The speakeasy downstairs- what a find. Lovely cocktails and just a perfect way to end the evenings. The location of this hotel is fab. 10 mins in a cab to Covent Garden and Soho. So all on your doorstep without the noise. 
With that one exception briefly in the restaurant ( maybe she was having a bad moment,) all the staff here have been clearly trained to give service with warmth and feeling which is so lacking today in many top hotels. I would highly recommend this stay, you will not regret it. Special final mention to Karen our lovely breakfast waitress. Her kindness an care shines through. She made us feel looked after and just thought she was lovely. She needs a promotion! Thank you. We WILL be back. Five star boutique feel for sure.",5,2024,05,05
135,Unhelpful staff!!!!,"Staff were so unhelpful. A couple of us were stuck in the lift for over an hour and they did nothing to help. They refused to call the fire department even though there were people panicking and hyperventilating! 

Avoid staying here!!!!",1,2024,04,30
135,Best guest experience in London so far!,"My husband and I were visiting London for weekend of exploring. Booked this hotel based on location.

135,Friday night city stay,"Lovely place good location, spotless, great cocktail bar, lovely friendly staff. My only issue is you have to do 200 min characters on the feedback , which is a pain in the backside. Hotel was great though",5,2024,03,25
135,Weekend stay,"We had such a wonderful time at the Vintry & Mercer.

The front of house staff upgraded our room when they found out it was my partners birthday.

135,Weekend Stay,"Our third stay at the hotel and great service from check in. We were given a room upgrade which was a really nice touch. The hotel location, amenities and cleanliness are superb. All of the staff team are so welcoming. The only downside was being woken in the early hours by noisy guests in the corridor. Appreciate that there probably isn’t much the hotel can do about that but it does make for a disturbed nights sleep and taints would should have been a great experience.",4,2024,03,17
135,Great stopover,"Good location very close to Mansion House Tube. I don’t think I’ve stayed anywhere in London with better staff. They were very professional, efficient and friendly all at the same time. Very pleasant, slightly bougie style decor. Up to date technology throughout. Spotlessly clean. Good breakfast but slightly over priced and coffee was OK. DND prohibition style bar was another level. We had great fun.

135,Good people but bad pricing,"Except the price they charge, everything else is great. The only hotel which I stayed in, that offers the limited minibar stocked everyday free of cost but does not provide complimentary breakfast and that's where the price glares you in your face. Location is very close to Mansion House underground station and many attractions are at walkable distance. Stay here if your company pays, otherwise I would skip it.",4,2024,03,10
135,Fantastic Beautiful Hotel,"Visited for our honeymoon. We were upgraded to one of the suites which was exceptional. So clean and comfortable. The toiletries provided were wonderful and fresh scented. We didn’t eat breakfast at the hotel so can’t comment on that. We did eat in the rooftop terrace and the food was beautiful, really enjoyed it. Equally the Do Not Disturb cocktail lounge was stunning and we enjoyed chatting to the staff behind the bar, and trying many of their amazing cocktails. 
The hotel is in walking distance of St Paul’s cathedral and many other top sites. We will definitely visit again.",5,2024,03,10
135,Luxury in the City,"My wife and I stayed here for our birthday and we couldn't have been happier. The hotel was beautiful, and smelled so clean because of al the plants. The roof top was perfect, and the speakeasy downstairs had some of the strongest drinks I've ever had.  The staff make you feel royal, and the bed will make it hard to get up in the morning its so soft and comfy. They went above and beyond, arranging cars for sightseeing tours and providing around the clock room service. ",5,2024,03,05
135,Great location.,"Really enjoyed our stay here. 1 min walk from Mansion House station. The check in staff were friendly and efficient. The room was clean, well equipped and comfortable.

135,Another Fantastic Stay at Vintry & Mercer,"I’ve stayed at V&M a couple of times and enjoy myself more and more each time. From the moment you arrive you’re greeted by the excellent front desk team, knowing that we stayed previously they upgraded our room which was a lovely surprise. The room was spacious, great amenities and a lovely balcony which makes all the difference in London. They have a great selection of magazines and newspapers, the mini bar offers complimentary soft drinks and a few nibbles (a nice touch). We had breakfast in the morning, granola (my mum really enjoyed this) and I went for the smashed avocado, feta, chilli and eggs which was again very nice. I can’t fault this hotel and it does feel like a hidden gem away from all the hustle a bustle. The staff are amazing, professional, friendly and always ready to assist. We will no doubt stay again some time in the future.",5,2024,02,18
135,"Amazing hotel, amazing staff!","Amazing hotel, staff were very friendly and couldn’t do more to make the stay as enjoyable as possible, the suite was great, exactly as described with a lovely balcony with a view of the shard, I asked for some special requests as it was a Valentine’s Day gift, the staff sent me through some options (Champagne, rose petals, strawberries in chocolate, balloon) and everything was arranged as I had asked.

The perfect night away! We have already booked our next visit. ",5,2024,01,22
135,Probably my favorite hotel in London,"I have stayed at Vintry and Mercer around 4 times now; I love this hotel. It's part of the Small Luxury Hotels of the world group, and certainly derisive to be so. It's a small, charming and unique hotel, close to St Paul's and Tate Modern, such a cool part of London right on the Thames. I especially like the decor, the overall ambiance and feel of the hotel as it is very intimate and stylish. Great bars and restaurant, and above all, the staff are wonderful. Courteous and polite.

A super boutique hotel with great interior and super professional staff!

We stayed for a night for and wondered along the river, visited St Paul’s and crossed the river to The Tate modern, all of which are very close by. The hotel is a stones throw from the river slap bang in the heart of historic London.

The food was great. Delicious breakfast and great rooftop terrace, with a brilliant mixologist. The cocktails were fantastic.

The manager and staff could not have done more. 

We’ll definitely be back, loved it!",5,2024,01,04

135,Quiet Luxury,The hotel is so beautiful and the room was gorgeous. The staff was so wonderful and helpful.

135,Theater trip,"Stayed for one night traveling around London for a quick theater trip. Lovely stay, close to underground station. Staff were very helpful and happy to go the extra mile. We will look forward to staying again in the future.",5,2023,12,29
135,Christmas trip,Dog friendly and well located. Breakfast is lovely. Out superior suite was gorgeous. Not too big a hotel so no long waits for elevators. Attentive staff. Roof terrace good for views and drinks perhaps but we felt food was overpriced. We would love to return in spring or summer to make the best of the balcony. Good quality toiletries. ,5,2023,12,26
135,Dec 2023,"the reason why I give 3/5 to my quality of sleep is only because in the evening before falling asleep I heard the noise of the pipes, but that did not prevent me from sleeping well. It didn't pose any more of a problem than that. Apart from all that, I highly recommend this hotel.",4,2023,12,25
135,Warmest welcome!,"The staff presented us with the warmest of welcomes, which set the scene for the rest of our stay. Dimitri is certainly a credit to this hotel as are all the other staff. Made our stay extra special with little extra gestures and really did go above and beyond. We had a wonderful room with a great skyline view. The complementary mini bar was such a nice touch, the room was so clean and the bed was really comfortable. Shall highly recommend this hotel to anyone. ",5,2023,12,22
135,The best boutique hotel in London,"This is the best place to stay. We can’t stay anywhere else because nothing else compares. The staff are friendly, the rooms are great and the location is convenient to get to anywhere in London. You won’t go wrong staying here. ",5,2023,12,18

135,Smashing little hotel in the City of London,"My partner and I recently stayed at Vintry & Mercer for the first time. I liked the slightly earlier check-in time of 2pm and was greeted warmly on arrival. In fact, the staff were incredibly friendly throughout our stay. 

The reception area, which is full of foliage, is a calming place and made me feel relaxed as soon as I walked in. 

We stayed in a Superior room on the ground floor (room 1 ), which was cosy and spacious (for London standards). There was no real view to speak of but we were only there for one night so that didn’t bother us. The bathroom was luxurious with a great rainfall shower. 

There was a comfy bed, a complimentary mini bar, the room service was prompt (and the food delivered hot!) and I honestly can’t think of anything that would have improved our stay. Sadly we didn’t have time to experience the rooftop bar. We visit London frequently and although we live close enough to go up and back in a day we like to make the most of our time and stay overnight. We’ll certainly consider Vintry & Mercer for future stays.",5,2023,12,17
135,Lovely hotel & service second to none!,"Stayed here Sunday 10th December 2023 for my partners birthday and with our young son. Originally picked this hotel because of trip advisor reviews. 

Before arriving correspondence with the hotel was great & no problem dropping our bags off at 9am on our arrival day. Checked in and was given a free room upgrade & glass of champagne to celebrate her birthday! Our bags were taken to our room and the room itself was lovely which you couldn’t fault including free soft drinks in the minibar which could be refilled as many times as needed.

Great nights sleep and enjoyed a full English breakfast in the morning, with a midday checkout. The reception staff are great and really added to the experience.

The hotel itself is only a two minute walk away for Mansion House tube. 

Definitely recommend staying here and I’m already planning a second stay here!",5,2023,12,12

135,Stylish Stay in The City of London,"When I go on vacation, I want to feel pampered. I searched and searched for a nice hotel in London and really wasn't drawn to any of them except Vintry and Mercer. 

Staying at the hotel exceeded expectations. The location is a block and a half from a underground station and walkable to many sites - Tower Bridge, Monument to the Great Fire of London...  The staff are super friendly. I was able to enter my room as soon as I landed. The room was as gorgeous as advertised, clean, and quiet. I liked the extra accessories they added from the practical adapters to the cute rubber duck and interesting books. 

It was such a treat!",5,2023,12,02

135,A bit different - in a good way,Very good food though the aspect that made this a bit special was sitting on the rooftop in our own glass pod - good fun and great views - and makes the experience a bit unusual.

135,A lovely hotel for a romantic trip to London,"The location of this hotel is ideal for a weekend away as it is right near Mansion House tube station yet hidden away in a small historic alley so away from the hustle and bustle of the City.  It is right next to the church of St James Garlickhythe so if you are on the balcony you will hear the bells which I loved, but if you don't want to hear them the room provides excellent noise reduction so you won't hear the sound of the city at all with the doors shut.  The room was luxurious and clean with lots of added extras like free drinks from the mini bar, free toiletries and a massive bathtub with an inbuilt TV in the bathroom!  The service from the staff was excellent and we also ate on the roof terrace restaurant where the standard of food was excellent although not cheap!  I would highly recommend this lovely hotel.",5,2023,11,07

When we returned in the evening we were left a little birthday card with some little sweet treats. We were made to feel so special and we really weren’t expecting it!

135,Good but we experienced annoying flaws,"A very well presented hotel in the City, well situated for the sights etc.
The room we had was a Standard Double which had everything you'd need, although (as with most London hotels) on the smaller side with a small bathroom (shower only). High quality decor and furnishings.
As I'm increasingly finding in many hotels, sadly, there were some niggles when we arrived - too few hangers, enough milk to make 2 cups of tea, and not enough towels. So I was on the phone within 5 minutes of checking in and housekeeping resolved the problems swiftly.
Sadly we also had a problem with our room not being made up. It transpired that there's a button that tells the staff you are sleeping and don't want to be disturbed (its not clear at all what the button is for as there's no wording and its next to the light switch). Inadvertently this was on. Another call to reception and this problem was solved whilst we were out for the evening. 
The hotel responded well to both issues and we got a free breakfast from them for the inconvenience so some of the sting was taken out of the situation.",4,2023,08,18
135,Excellent stay in a beautiful hotel,"My mum & I stayed here whilst visiting the city for my birthday. The hotel was excellent, the rooms are so clean, quiet and modern we loved it! 

Breakfast was delicious and we ate and drank on the rooftop terrace several times during our stay which again was brilliant. Additionally, the staff on the rooftop were so friendly and attentive as were the 2 men in the reception check in: Alexander & Costin who couldn’t do enough for us during our stay. You have a brilliant team! 

The staff arranged champagne whilst it was my birthday which was a great added touch and Alexander was happy to arrange taxis and transport round the city should we need it. 

We will most definitely return and stay again and I loved the decor of the hotel! 

Thanks again for a great stay!

Location of hotel is prefect for the circle line. Less than 1 minute walk from mansion house station. 

I would highly recommend the hotel.",5,2023,07,17
135,An Exceptional stay,"A fantastic hotel to stay in London, close to the tube, St Pauls, the Shard and Borough market. Special thanks in particular to Stefan who checked us in and made our entire stay exceptional - any little request that we had was dealt with immediately, and we felt that we were treated above and beyond. ",5,2023,07,17
135,Hidden Gem,"Wonderful stay from start to finish. Location perfect and we loved the roof terrace and were fortunate to enjoy lunch in the sunshine. Had the best two nights sleep... mattress was dreamy. 
 
We would highly recommend the hidden gem ",5,2023,07,17
135,Weekend break,"Comfortable bed and friendly staff.  Overall a good base from which to explore London.
A good breakfast, but for the price a fairly limited choice and no free juice or cereals offered.
However, the whole experience was good and we would stop again.",4,2023,07,16
135,Amazing Experience,"Charming, cosy and lovely little hotel that is quiet and off the beaten path by a couple of blocks but situated in the heart of the city, well within walking distance of major landmarks.  There is an underground station at the end of the street that connects to the network’s trains throughout the city.

The hotel is full luxury yet feels like home. The staff was so welcoming, not only to me as a guest, but to my family who live in London and came to pick me up for a day of sightseeing.  The rooftop area is stunning, my family said they had the best apple juice there they have ever had.  My room, though on the small side, was perfect with all the amenities I needed and one of the nicest bathrooms I have seen. Drinks from the mini bar could be consumed at no cost and were replenished each day.   The bedding was plush and the bed extremely comfortable. 

I can’t say enough good things about this hotel and would stay here again in a heartbeat.  The common areas are beautiful and everything oozed opulence.  Many restaurants are in the area if you choose to dine out and, though I did not eat on the rooftop, the food looked and smelled delicious.  

Thank you to the staff who were all so kind, helpful and focused on providing an extraordinary customer service.",5,2023,07,12
135,Boutique Getaway,"Rooms are great, high tech, everything you need, very clean, staff friendly and very helpful. Rooftop restaurant looked amazing - sadly never ate there. The downstairs Do Not Disturb bar, was lively and great atmosphere, cocktails were fabulous. Breakfast was expensive for what you got and a little vague. Please note you will only receive a plate of food chosen - there are no cereals or orange juices etc. laid out. All these items are extras. However that said the breakfast was nice and the restaurant clean and friendly.",5,2023,07,11
135,Great stay!,"Lovely hotel in excellent location. I was there for part business and part holiday and found it very close to transport and lots of options within walking distance as well. Lovely breakfast and the highlight was the rooftop restaurant. I think we were there almost every day we able to go. Excellent food and a truly beautiful spot, a hidden gem. Would definitely stay there again. ",4,2023,07,10
135,Reasonable but not good enough for a 5 star hotel,"Given a disabled persons room until complained. The room was then small but adequate.
No coffee machine which was given on request.
The first day the breakfast was excellent. The second the bacon was cold and hash browns over done. 
The hotel was good but not the 5 star experience I was expecting ",3,2023,07,10
135,Great hotel,"Great hotel, good location as near several tube stations so easy to get around London. Room was small but clean and had everything we needed. Staff were polite, friendly and helpful. Dinner at the roof terrace was excellent. I’d definitely recommend this hotel. ",5,2023,07,08

135,Thurs night stay over,"Great location, fairly priced , however when booking guests should check the roof terrace and restaurants are open as we were unlucky and were closed. Manager discounted our room rate and kindly offered a bottle of champagne to the room which was very considerate ",4,2023,07,01
135,Excellent,"Perfect location , away from the hustle & bustle of London but with close access to transport to see all the sights.
Customer service from every one of the staff was exceptional , making our stay very relaxing and stress free 
Loved the rooftop restaurant

Will definitely stay again

135,City sanctuary,"Sumptuous luxury, friendly staff, amazing roof terrace, perfect location. Our favourite spot to stay when visiting the big city - away from the mayhem but only minutes from all the action. Greeted like old friends, catching up WITH old friends. V&M is spot on. ",5,2023,06,19
135,Great hotel. Roof terrace is lovely. Food is amazing 👏,"We enjoyed a lovely stay here. Great room, beautiful hotel. Amazing food on the terrace & friendly staff. If only our mini bar had been fully stocked (we asked twice), it would have been top scores all around",4,2023,06,17
135,SERVICE WITH A SMILE,Every member of staff made us feel welcome and nothing was too much trouble. The location is nice and quiet yet within easy reach of many tourist attractions.

Since it was my partner’s birthday they upgraded the room for us, they went an extra mile to make his day special. They kept bring us complementary drink and even left us some sweets to say happy birthday. I will come back one day!",5,2023,06,12
135,"Cosy, small with good location","The location is definitely one of the best selling point of this hotel.

It is well appointed and tidy.

Really appreciated the inclusive minibar although the selection was limited.

Regarding the design, the bathroom is just perfect, maybe the small type ideal design and condition bathroom I have ever seen. Co.Bigelow amenities brand are perfect as always - for ecologic reasons it should be considered to change the mini plastic bottles.

AC was rather silent and with easy adjustable temperature, just as every hotel room should be but actually quite rare to find. The AC and light controls and buttons were very well designed, intuitive and responsive, a really nice touch. Overall the room is well designed and comfortable and the whole hotel is very silent.

Now let me adjust some of the not so good aspects of this stay:

the hotel is rather small and the room feels cramped. It has not enough space to open 2 big bags. 

Didn’t like the nearby office so close to my bedroom window. I felt the need to shut the curtains all the time as some people were staring. Not very comfortable.

Carpet in the entire room. It seems old styled and raises hygienic issues. I sensed a “dusty” feel in the room although it seemed clean.

The brick stone entrance. I mean it is just horrible to carry the bags through it and the noise it makes, a totally off design decision.

The lobby plants were not well treated and some were filled with dust. There were also some stains in the lobby chairs. Better attention and care should be immediately engaged to the lobby and reception area.

Service was just ok.

In the end I felt the hotel to be overpriced for what it is. It has several points going for it, mainly the location, design and the perfect bathroom for a small space, but for this category I expected perfect cleaning and condition everywhere and personally I don’t appreciate dark carpets filling the whole room. But at the same time it is much more affordable than other 5 star hotels in London. So probably it is still a great value. Would I return there? Only if I need to stay in an event nearby or if I get a great deal. Overall a nice stay.

",4,2023,06,11
135,Fantastic hotel/hotel staff. Service at the terrace restaurant was disappointing.,"Outstanding hotel experience with wonderful staff. The rooms are stunning, and the location within the city is hard to beat. 

My only gripe is with the service at the roof terrace restaurant. There’s no priority for guests, which I can accept given the prime location for diners - however it would be a nice touch for guests to be offered a reservation on their check-in day. This is something I’ve experienced at other 5* hotels and it goes a long way in making you feel special. 

Another service issue I had with the roof terrace restaurant was the attentiveness of the staff. I was flabbergasted when, half way through taking our order, the waiter asked me to “give him a minute” so he could say goodbye to one of his mates. I found this to be extremely unprofessional and it gave a sour taste for the rest of the dining experience. This is something I’ve never experienced before, and certainly not at a 5* hotel restaurant. This same waiter also didn’t put our reservation through (which we made 2 days prior), so we were lucky there was an available table on the day. 

Dining aside, this hotel is wonderful. A few considerations on how to tie the experience together for guests would take it up a notch.",4,2023,06,10
135,Impressive hotel,"Beautiful hotel, boutique feel, very friendly staff and lovely buzzy atmosphere. Rooms very comfortable and spacious. Breakfast choice great. Easy to get to public transport wise and close to the Thames. Recommended. ",5,2023,06,10
135,Fab-u-lous- we will be back!,"I have had many city breaks around the world but this hotel is definitely on my revisit list!
Our stay was to celebrate 3 of a party of 4 Birthdays.
Prior to arrival I received great communication and was able to request for rooms to be together for our stay.
On our arrival we were warmly greeted by the staff and the aromas and ambiance definitely set the scene on the rest of the stay.
Special shout out to Dimitri Cigliano - your welcome and chats during our short stay was definitely a highlight, next time we will make sure you and the rest of the team get an invite to our night out! 🤣
The rooms have everything you could wish for, dressing gowns, slippers, hairdryer, free soft drink mini bar, umbrellas etc 
We used both the downstairs bar - very atmospheric and great cocktails.
We also spent a couple of hours in the sun on the roof top bar - again great cocktails and although we didn’t eat the food looked amazing.
So V&M thank you to your fantastic hotel and wonderful staff - we will definitely be back",5,2023,06,08
135,Amazing boutique hotel that surpassed our expectations,"Had an absolute pleasure staying in Vintry & Mercer. Amazing minibar selection, cosy room, great service and location. 
From the moment we checked in till the end of our stay, the staff were all extremely helpful and pleasant, I wish I could have gotten their names.
It may be a boutique hotel but it's big on hospitality and value. Highly recommend. ",5,2023,06,08
135,HIdden gem!,"A quiet hotel, with excellent comfort and service, in central london. We ate in the restaurant and the service and food were excellent. Reception staff were welcoming and helpful.

135,One of the best in The City,Really such a pleasure to go to this hotel every time. The rooms are soooooooo comfortable and clean and with a great view. The bed is great for a business traveller. The staff is also very very nice. I get almost the same room every time and that is really helpful for me. Recommend with my eyes closed!,5,2023,06,05
135,Mother/Daughter Trip,"Welcomed warmly upon arrival and the rooftop deck for dinner the first night was wonderful.  Room is a little small,  but not considering one is in downtown London.  Near a number of tourist sites, but quieter on the weekends than other locations.",4,2023,06,05
135,Fantastic boutique hotel,"I was staying at V&M for a business trip and was not disappointed by my choice. Location for me was superb as I was 5 minutes walking distance to my office.

Service in general was great. The rooftop bar was an amazing place to spend some time when the weather is good. If you stay here, at least try and make one trip down to the Do Not Disturb bar. Ayhan at the bar is a wonderful person and deserves a shoutout for how warm and welcoming he is. I very much appreciated it as a solo visitor

Value wise, this place is on the more expensive end and my room was quite small. It didn't really impact me that greatly but I was staying by myself for business. If you were a couple and got a similar size room, I think you would struggle to find places to put luggage without it being in the way.

Overall it was a lovely place to stay. ",4,2023,06,04
135,My New Favorite Hotel,I’ve been all over the world and this hotel checked all the boxes for what we wanted. I’ll be back the next time I’m in London.  I’ll be recommending this hotel to anyone I know visiting London.  This is my new favorite hotel!,5,2023,06,02
135,A let down!,"We were so excited to stay in this hotel having read other reviews and done our research, however it was more than disappointing. One big issue can really ruin a hotel experience but equally so can minor issues when they are one after the other. Our room wasn't ready on arrival (after check in time), we asked to receptionist to check our roof top bar reservation and were told she couldn't and we had to go up and check ourselves, the time of our booking was then messed up which meant we were rushed for no reason. Our room - the shower gel in the shower was completely empty, there was only 1 water/ 1 popcorn etc in the complimentary mini bar - I understand complimentary but there are 2 guests? Our shower wasn't draining properly meaning we could stay in the shower for 5 minutes before a bath was emerging at our feet. When we asked for this to be looked at and let us know it was fixed for the following morning, we had to call again later that evening as no one confirmed it was fixed. And again our shower gel etc wasn't filled up despite requesting so we had to call again for this.  We ordered iced coffees to the room, no straws sent. We called for straws that never appeared. Both lifts were out of service during our stay so we were ushered in a service lift that had old food trays and bags of rubbish...not quite 5 star but fair enough the lifts were broke, however no apology. Actually no apology for any of these issues whatsoever. Again issues happen and handled the right way we could have still had a positive experience but this didn't happen. When we were checking out we were so disheartened we felt we had to be honest and say that our stay had not been the best, this wasn't remotely acknowledged we were just handed the bill and told to have a nice day. This trip was for pleasure however I am in London a lot for business and unfortunately would be unlikely to stay in this hotel again or recommend it. Maybe just a bad series of events for us but unfortunately that's all I can review. ",2,2023,05,31
135,"Amazing views, food and service.","What a beautiful rooftop setting,  exquisite food and fantastic, attentive service from all of the staff. Thank you for a wonderful Birthday meal with my family to remember. We will be back again soon. ",5,2023,05,30
135,Fantastic Hotel,"I have stayed at this hotel 2 times now, it is a very convenient location for my work, but mostly I love it, because the staff is very friendly and helpful and the place has a boutique and unique feel about it. I have been recommending to everyone, who is traveling.",5,2023,05,29
135,A stylish base in the heart of the city,"Vintry & Mercer, based around the corner from Mansion House underground and very close to St Paul's, is a tasteful and extremely comfortable hotel where you are given five-star treatment; especially by the staff at reception who could not be more helpful if they tried. Nothing is too much trouble for them when it comes to helping customers.
The rooms are thoughtfully and beautifully decorated, the beds comfortable with soft, fluffy pillows while the shower is just the right velocity and offers instant hot water. There is no danger of having to stand for five minutes outside the shower waiting for warm water!
Do be aware though that breakfast is not included in the overnight stay. You are given a menu and everything has to be ordered individually. There is no breakfast buffet where you help yourself. This is not a bad thing as the orange juice is freshly squeezed (as opposed to a concentrate), the coffee is as good as anything from Nero/Stabuck and the cooked breakfast - I chose poached eggs, smoked salmon, avocado on toasted sourdough bread - was delicious.
Wintry & Mercer is not only ideal for business people, it also offers a calm and relaxing environment for families.
Given the opportunity, I would definitely stay there again!",5,2023,05,29
135,Good experience,"It’s a very unique hotel. I like the decoration. Though the standard room is very small, it has everything you need. High quality of service, and all room fabric and furnitures are in good taste and quality as well. The rooftop restaurant is a plus. ",5,2023,05,22

135,Couples weekend getaway,"From our arrival to our departure the staff and our room at Vintry & Mercer delivered  service and a feel of splendor, far beyond our expectations. The location it self  is good. (actually in walking distance to Picadelly.) and we received good information about places to have a meal on arrival. Quite a lot of places around the hotel to have a meal, a snack and something in the glass. The front desk staff was very friendly, and the staff on the roof top terrace even so.",5,2023,05,16
135,Justifiably a member of the small boutique hotels network,"Really nice hotel with that ""different' feel you look for against beige chain hotels .. all without it being overpoweringly ""different"".

135,One night stay,"We had a really nice stay here, the bed was so comfortable and the room was gorgeous. There was a couple of details that spoiled the trip slightly however.

135,New favourite London hotel…,"Loved this gorgeous hotel.  Location is fantastic for exploring the City and south of the river. Common areas are nice and there are free newspapers to read while you wait, great rooftop bar and a small but well-equipped gym.  The room was beautiful, quiet as requested and no scatter cushions – amazing.  Minibar is included in the price and is stocked up, but with some room for your own things.  A highlight is the extremely helpful and friendly staff.  All of them, but in particular those on reception.  One suggestion – as there is a big move for people to reuse towels, a heated towel rail in the bathroom would be great, as the bathroom heating doesn’t dry them.  Other than that, it’s pretty much perfect.  Can’t wait to go back. ",5,2023,03,20

135,Great find,"Decided to try a new hotel for a recent visit to London and plumped for this one. It is well located and tucked down a quiet street right next to Mansion house station. We were greeted nicely by everyone on the team and check-in was very smooth. 

The room is lovely, interesting decor that makes it feel a bit nicer than other boutique or luxury hotels. The bathroom was well appointed and the shower had great heat and water pressure. The bed was very comfy and we both slept well as there was virtually no noise from other rooms or outside, just the occasional peel of bells from a distant church. The rooms are a little compact in comparison to other London hotels we've stayed in, but not uncomfortably so. 

Breakfast was a bit disappointing, we tried it our first morning and whilst everything was cooked well and tasted nice, just didn't think it represented particularly good value. Would definitely consider staying here again in the future though. ",4,2023,03,13
135,Weekend break,Great location and wonderful staff who were so helpful. Breakfast was excellent and roof terrace a lot of fun. We had a brilliant weekend. The room was small but bed very comfortable and clean and very little noise,4,2023,03,13
135,Lovely hotel for a romantic weekend,"Went here to meet up with my husband for a quick weekend. Hotel was very nice and located in a quieter area of London, which suited us quite well. 

The room was the size you’d expect from a hotel of this class and price range. The bed and room was luxuriously furnished and check in was a breeze. 

The toiletries were quite nice and the rubber ducky was cute. The water, tea, and coffee provided in the room are good and replenished on a daily basis. 

The speakeasy downstairs was nice, if a little quiet, but it made it easy for us to find a seat. The rooftop bar and restaurant was also a pleasant place to enjoy drinks and nibbles when we came back to the hotel to rest or change. 

The tube is very close and it was easy to reach via Heathrow for my husband and via Waterloo station for me. 

They allowed me a late checkout so I could sleep in a bit before catching my afternoon flight. 

Walkable to some pretty good restaurants (Brigadiers is just up the street) and if you’re keen for a nice walk along the Thames to Westminster and other parts of the city, it’s not a bad walk.

Staff were nice and helpful. Only off putting thing was wasn’t sure the status of the restaurant on the ground floor. I couldn’t tell if it was open or not, but I think it was due to the hotel getting back on track after shutdowns.",5,2023,03,09
135,Beautiful hotel,"I visited Vintry and Mercer to celebrate my birthday with my mum. The hotel is very fancy, the room was lovely and the staff very helpful. The food in the restaurant on the 7th floor and breakfast on the ground floor were both excellent quality.
The only reason for the 4/5 for sleep quality is that I confused the buttons on the console and ended up switching the lights and thermostat off, instead of just the lights so the room got quite hot. The bed as comfy and the room dark so I’m sure I would’ve slept fine if I’d not done this.",5,2023,03,07
135,Hidden Gem !,"Beautiful hotel - Friendly greeting on arrival . Happy to talk , ask about my time in London and explained all the hotel details very well .

135,"Faultless, 10/10","Absolutely faultless stay. Room was beautiful with so many amenities and extras. Not only did we get upgraded, but we got a lovely happy birthday message with some sweets as well as a complimentary class of champagne each. 
We had the an amazing cocktail on the rooftop bar as well as a bite to eat, service was impracticable and food & drink was really tasty.
Later that night we visited DND speakeasy underneath the hotel, the staff were amazing, giving out recommendations and being very attentive throughout. 
Then next morning we had breakfast at the Vintry kitchen on the ground floor. Just like everything else - it was 10/10. The whole stay was flawless, and we are already planning our next visit!",5,2023,03,06
135,Beautiful hotel in a fantastic location.,"Fantastic location and right next to Mansion House underground. Beautiful hotel, loved the layout and the scent throughout the reception area. Staff were very attentive and helpful. Small but quirky hotel and very luxurious throughout. Although a relatively small room, it had everything you needed and was lovely and clean. Great recommendation on the parking nearby too.
My only criticism would be that the toilets on the lower ground were unisex and very unclean. ",5,2023,02,27
135,The perfect long weekend in London!,"We stayed for two nights to celebrate my husband’s birthday, it was brilliant.

135,Gem of a hotel,"I really can’t say enough about this wonderful hotel & its staff. I visited with my Mum for 1 night as a very belated birthday trip. We arrived Friday mid-morning & were welcomed by Gabriella who was so helpful and wished us a belated happy birthday & advised that we had a complimentary room upgrade + a glass of champagne each. This made for a really special start to our stay.
In addition, our room was ready on arrival which we were thrilled about as we could now freshen up after our long train journey.
The room & amenities were fantastic & the beds were so comfortable too.
Later that evening a staff member brought some birthday sweets to our room which was really a lovely surprise.
As we were getting ready to go out for dinner my hair straightners broke so I rang reception on the offchance that they had a spare pair, not expecting much as I thought this was unlikely. The really helpful woman on reception called me back & she had managed to find me a pair which she had housekeeping deliver to my room a few minutes later. This is going over & above normal service, in my opinion. Really fantastic.
We also had drinks at the rooftop bar on 2 occasions during our stay, this was also really enjoyable and a great service. Lovely views too. Our wait staff was a young woman who was so friendly and attentive (didn’t catch her name unfortunately!!), she welcomed us & served us on both occasions and really made our experience a great one.
Thanks to all the team members at V&M that made our very short stay so memorable, you’re an asset to the hotel. We will definitely be returning to stay again :)",5,2023,02,12
135,"Well located, a lovely aesthetic, wonderful staff, all delivered with care and attention to detail","What is most striking is the attention to detail everywhere you turn. The look of the hotel is obviously carefully designed and well delivered, but at the same time all of the modern facilities are present. The staff are absolutely lovely: unfailingly helpful and very friendly. There is an attention to detail in the servicing of the rooms which is unexpected. All in all, a really lovely place to stay.  It is about 30 seconds walk from the nearest underground station (Mansion House) on the District and Circle lines, so access to central London's attractions is quick and easy. Highly recommended.",5,2023,02,08
135,Beautiful London hotel,"The location is great but the staff are even more so! Friendly and helpful from pre arrival to the moment we left.

135,Wonderful hotel,"My partner and I stayed for one night to celebrate my birthday and our anniversary, and we had the nicest time and will definitely go back. All of the staff who we spoke to were so friendly and couldn't do enough to help. Our room was upgraded on arrival, and as it was a special occasion, they offered us complimentary champagne, which we enjoyed on the roof terrace. We also ordered some bread and olives which were delicious, and the bread was absolutely huge! We weren't expecting an entire loaf! When we came back to our room from dinner, there was a note wishing me a happy birthday and a couple of little sweets, which was such a lovely touch. The bed was incredibly comfy, and we both slept so well. The bathroom was beautiful, and everything was so clean. The hotel itself was very quiet when we stayed, which suited us, and we didn't hear a peep from anyone when we were in our room. I absolutely loved everything about this hotel and couldn't recommend it enough. Thank you for such an enjoyable stay. Our only regret was that we didn't stay longer.",5,2023,01,18

135,A hidden Jewel in the City Center,"We absolutely loved our stay at the V&M hotel. The staff is incredible friendly and helpful. They are happy to help with recommendations for dinning around the area and help with ticket attractions. You can tell the  hotel pays attention to small details that really make a difference. it's conveniently located in a quiet area away from the huzzle and buzzle of the city center but at a walking distance from various tube or bus stations,  where you can get in minutes to the heart of London. My kids absolutely loved the extra amenities offered in the room for them. ",5,2023,01,06
135,Enjoyed!,"Lovely rooms, rooftop bar and the location was nice and quite on a cobble stone path. A couple petty hiccups along the way - the chef didn't show up one of the nights so room service wasn't available. Not to worry, Uber Eats saves the day. The service wasn't the most friendly, but to be honest we had just stayed in a hotel that absolutely spoiled us and it might not be fair to compare.",4,2023,01,04
135,"Excellent, charming hotel.","I found this hotel through reviews, and it didn’t disappoint. Wonderful, friendly staff. Great room service. Cleanliness was impeccable.

135,Amazing Hotel As Always - Restaurant Needs A Look,"My partner and I come here twice a year for anniversary and New Years Eve celebrations. The staff at the front desk are always so kind and caring with us which is why we come back every year. The restaurant experience we had at New Years Eve was not good however. I’ve raised this with the front desk and they were quick to help following the previous night’s problems. The hotel for a stay is perfect and I can’t take that away from this establishment. The staff in the rooftop restaurant though need a reevaluation, especially for such an important evening such as NYE.",5,2023,01,02

135,Fantastic boutique hotel,"We have visited London many times and stayed in some nice hotels but Vintry & Mercer is the best all round hotel by far. Excellent location tucked away on a quiet street but only a minute’s walk from Mansion House tube station. The staff were all very friendly but professional. Nothing was too much trouble. Our room was beautifully furnished and the bed was large, comfortable and the bed linen was absolutely sumptuous.  We enjoyed our pre dinner cocktails in the bar and dinner in the roof terrace was just excuisite with views overlooking St Paul’s. We loved the breakfast service too, all made to order with not a buffet in sight.  We will highly recommend to friends & family and we will of course return.  ",5,2022,12,24
135,If you need a spot of luxury please visit,"Can’t recommend this place enough. Excellent service, room and amenities and location was really good.

135,First Class stay in Central London,"This hotel is one of the best I've stayed at this year. Small, boutique feel but with the amenities and support of a large hotel.

135,"Lovely staff, beautiful hotel","Fantastic service, the staff is wonderful. Clean and elegant hotel. A bit tricky location so you’ll have to travel through subway or uber quite a lot see many things in the city center.

135,Best Hotel...small but perfectly formed,We stayed here earlier this year whilst visiting London.  Perfectly positioned near St Paul's.

135,"Fantastic location, tiny but very expensive room","This isn’t a 5 star hotel, one of the lifts were broken for the duration of our stay and the other very temperamental resulting in our using th stairs for the majority of our 4th floor trip. The room was tiny, not what you expect when it cost £600, the views were horrendous, we had a window about 40cm wide and looked over a car park/office block with very loud cleaning activities outside from 4am, don’t think the windows were double glazed either. The staff were brilliant and very helpful.

135,A Delicious stay,"
London is so big is difficult to decide where to stay, this location was excellent, easy to get everywhere, but quiet. 
Loved every aspect Vintry and Mercer, from the wonderful warm professional welcome and all throughout my stay. The room was gorgeous, and every detail thought out.

135,Absolutely wonderful stay !,"What a wonderful stay I had for 4 nights !I have been in a number of London hotels. My colleague wanted a boutique type hotel and we chose this one. It was perfect. I am very sensitive to noise and it is a very quiet place on a small street close to the The City neighborhood, where we could walk. The staff was very kind, the food was good and reasonably priced for London, the rooms are beautiful and very clean. I could not have asked for better for a small boutique type hotel in London !",5,2022,12,03

135,Great Hotel in heart of London,"Very conveniently located within the City, other than if you are driving ! nearby Car Park helps. Warm welcome set an excellent standard for our stay. Rooms are as mentioned, on the small side, but it's central London, they were however very well appointed, extremely comfortable and spotlessly clean. Had drinks in the cocktail bar in the basement, very nice atmosphere and again good service. Also visited the roof top terrace for late drinks and to take a few photo's of the London skyline, great view of the Shard, and an almost amazing view of St Pauls. Breakfast was a bit more hit and miss but despite a last minute staff shortage was handled well. A great base for visiting London with exceptional service and surprisingly reasonably pricd.",5,2022,12,01

Amazing rooftop restaurant and bar. Bathroom modern and very clean. Very cosy hotel nothing too much trouble for the staff. ",5,2022,11,29
135,Great find in The City,"Stayed here one night. Had an issue with a window in my room that wouldn’t close and was moved to another room. 
On checkout the front desk were aware of the issue from the night before and said by way of apology breakfast was on the house which was unexpected.
This attention to customer service is missing in too many places and ensures I’ll return.
Highly recommended.",5,2022,11,27
135,Stunning hotel,"This was our 2nd stay and it was excellent. Hotel is stunning design, rooms high end and everything spotlessly clean. Staff professional and friendly and very efficient.

135,Great rooms but that's about it,"Beware of dining in restaurant, food good but they have a few outdoor hut things on roof terrace, that literally fell like sitting in a shed with little atmosphere. Hotel bar closes early and cocktail bar was overtaken by a private event so nowhere to go after dinner.",3,2022,11,21

135,"Great location, nice hotel, let down by rude staff.","First impressions were excellent. Very warmly greeted at reception and delighted to find our rooms were ready despite our early arrival.
Rooms are of a good size and decorated to a high standard.

However, our first unpleasant experience occurred when we decided to try out the cocktail bar suggested by the reception staff. We went to the bar waiting to be seated. The bartender didn’t acknowledge us or look our way once. Instead he was too preoccupied remising about his beloved Italy to two guests sat at the bar. All that was needed was a simple acknowledgement from the bartender ‘…will be with you in a moment gents please have a seat’. Nope, completely ignored by Him. Bearing in mind the two gents at the bar were the only other guests in the immediate vicinity it’s not like the bartender was too busy to acknowledge us. 

The second unpleasant experience happened later the same day at around 22:00. We came back from Borough Markets and decided to check out the roof terrace that had again been recommended to us by the staff. Initially very welcoming, we were shown to our table within a minute of arriving. Before we sat down my Father made way for a waitress carrying two cocktails, she stopped and asked us if we ordered the cocktails. I joked in a friendly manner ‘we didn’t order those but we will be shortly!’, the waitress scoffed ‘whatever’ and walked past. We left immediately and went downstairs to complain at reception. We were immediately offered free drinks but we explained that this was not the purpose of highlighting the rudeness. We weren’t even asked for our room numbers so it was clear that the staff had no intention of following this up. 

Just hugely disappointed to be treated so badly by a couple of rude and inconsiderate  staff. It’s simply not good enough for a hotel of this standard. Unfortunately the rest of the staff were absolutely lovely, warm and welcoming. But you’re only as strong as your weakest link! It only takes one rude staff member with a bad attitude to ruin the experience for a guest.",3,2022,11,06
135,5 star gem in Garlic Hill,"Well what to say V&M is the spot to stay in 2022 . The hotel is 5 star as well as the professional staff.

135,Charming and Lovely Hotel,"We stayed at Vintry and Mercer at the end of August 2022. It was a delightful experience. We had excellent communication with staff prior to arrival. They asked if we were celebrating any special events and I mentioned my husband’s birthday. Upon arrival at the hotel, we found out they had upgraded our room. What a wonderful surprise. We liked everything about the hotel. The staff were helpful, friendly and attentive. We talked to several staff members and found they were from all over the world, included several individuals from South America. Our room, and most particularly, the bed, were really comfortable. It was also quiet and easy to get a good night’s sleep. Although breakfast was not included in our room rate, we ate a light breakfast at the hotel each morning. The coffee was delicious as was the food. The location was great, a few minutes walk to the closest underground stop. We walked over to the Tower of London at dusk one evening and it was very atmospheric. We would definitely stay at the Vintry and Mercer should we return to London and have already recommended the hotel to friends. To all the staff: thank you so much for a wonderful stay!",5,2022,10,21
135,Amazing rooms attentive staff 5 stars,"Absolutely incredible staff, Beautiful building 
we went for lunch at the Ritz and stayed in this hotel and it was just gorgeous. It was my son’s birthday and the concierge team went above and beyond to make our day special. Finally a hotel in London that gives incredible service but doesn’t charge the earth. The rooms immaculate and clean and little treats that made a difference. I just can’t thank this hotel enough for such a wonderful stay . Very impressed . It really makes a difference when the staff actually appear  to care about the guest and go that extra mile",5,2022,10,20
135,Exceptional service and high quality hotel,Staff provided exceptional service. First class hotel. Rooms were extremely comfortable and very clean with every detail taken into consideration. Complimentary soft drinks and snacks. Luxury toiletries. Very comfortable bed. Only small personal issue was if you are lying in bed you have to have the curtains closed as the rooms are visible from one another. I like natural light so this was slightly annoying however it would not put me off staying here again. We were very early for check in and were kindly offered a room however it was not suitable for us. This was absolutely fine as we had somewhere to go however the hotel offered to call us when a room was ready which they did. This was first class service and very much appreciated. Our luggage was waiting in our room on our return. Would highly recommend this hotel. ,5,2022,10,17
135,"Great hotel, superbly located, and lovely team","Great hotel to stay at for a business trip or leisure trip into London. Conveniently located near St Pauls, and several tube stations. Food excellent and supported by a friendly and attentive team. Rooms are well equipped, comfortable and clean.",5,2022,10,17
135,Five out of five.,"Our friends, avid travelers, booked this hotel for a couples reunion. We hadn’t seen each other for 3 years. Their choice couldn’t have been better. 
This small boutique hotel was all we expected and more. 
Excellent welcome from the moment we stepped in and wonderful service from the reception to the rooftop restaurant and the speakeasy bar downstairs. 
The rooftop terrace is a must. Excellent views, good and service. 
The rooms are small but very comfortable and tastefully decorated. 
The tube and many attractions like St Paul, the London Eye and others are at walk-in distance. 
I give it a five out if five.",5,2022,10,16
135,"Great small hotel, walking distance to St. Paul’s, Tate modern & excellent tube links!",A great quiet hotel in a safe area away from busy hectic tourist spots. Here you can take a number of tube links quickly to all over London easily within 20 mins maximum. Great landmarks in the area and restaurants. ,5,2022,10,16
135,Enjoyable Stay,"The location was very good and easy to get to, as an underground station 50 yards away. The room was very comfortable, bed had lovely linen, with everything that was needed, including free soft drinks, nicely furnished, although room not overgenerous in size.  Staff were superb, very friendly and helpful. A lovely terrace restaurant on the 7th floor with a part view over the dome of St Pauls and a full view of The Shard. Decent menu choice. Good service. A bar in the basement although did not have time to go and have a drink. We would certainly visit the restaurant and bar again if in the area. We live quite close to London and just stayed one night for a special occasion.
However, there was a limited choice at breakfast. There was just one choice of a continental with muesli and the rest of the menu was a cooked menu. Would have been better to have had a small buffet with a choice of breakfast juices, cereals, toast etc. No refills for coffee, had to purchase each cup, would have been nice to have had different sizes of cafetieres available. although the food was good.  We are regular travellers staying in 4 to 5* hotels and so expected more choice at breakfast, especially as our room rate was £ 472.50 for a Standard, although we got upgraded to a Superior, Thank you, but even so, improve on breakfast please..

135,Manchester Couple,The hotel is conveniently situated.  The service and dinner were excellent.  . The bed is very comfortable.  Have stayed twice before but found the room rate was expensive and almost doubled since our last stay in March.,4,2022,10,14
135,Great location and cute place,"Had an amazing stay at this cute boutique hotel. I was there for business travel and the hotel was perfectly located for the finance firms I visited, but also right on the tube and a close walking distance to many tourist attractions for the weekend. The staff was wonderful, including Tolu at the front desk who arranged our airport transfer. I’ll be staying here next time.",5,2022,10,13
135,Luxury London,"I booked V&M to treat ourselves while staying in London for our anniversary. It is a lovely hotel, beautifully furnished and the staff were superb. No complaints. 
The roof terrace is a great for a good view of London while enjoying a drink, while the basement bar had a fabulous atmosphere for a nightcap after a night at the theatre. 
",5,2022,10,09
135,"Excellent place to stay, always a warm welcome","I’ve stayed here multiple times whilst on business in London. 
The welcome is friendly and efficient, and nothing is too much trouble for the lovely team.
It’s clean and well maintained.
The rooftop restaurant / bar is a great place to eat, or chill, or work. 
The rooms are lovely, even the smaller ones have everything you need. ",5,2022,10,05

food okay and food service okay in the restaurant for breakfast. I would stay here again, its a lovely location and building and the rooms are lovely  ",4,2022,10,03
135,Lovely hotel shame about the breakfast!,"Beautiful hotel.  Lovely, friendly reception staff.   Our room was ready to check in at 10.30 in the morning!   The bars are lovely and the bedroom was fantastically clean and well equipped.   Should have been a 5 star review but lost 1 star because the breakfast was awful!   We expected much more from a £370 per night hotel.   There were only 2 staff on duty.   One made a cappuccino for us and left it on a tray for so long before it was brought over to us that it was cold.  There was a 30 minute plus wait for cooked breakfasts and the waitress was trying to talk people into just having continental!  As for the continental breakfast it was all left out on a table!  Nothing refrigerated.  We were there for over an hour and there were hams, yogurt, cheeses and other dairy products just left out.  I certainly would not want to pay £18 for it!  The cooked breakfast was very good when it did arrived.  A huge shame because the stay was otherwise faultless!",4,2022,10,02
135,Great hotel in London,"We had a fantastic stay at V&M.  The hotel is located close to a train stop but is tucked down a small street so is quiet. The staff was great from check in, through daily interactions, cleaning and the restaurants.  The rooms are very well appointed with a nice comfortable bed, small fridge with complimentary waters, coffee, tea and small snacks.  They even have power adapters for plug in.  The restaurants were convenient and the food was great.  We had no complaints at all and would highly recommend it.",5,2022,10,01
135,Hotel visit,"Had a lovely stay in the V and M hotel. Lovely hotel with a beautiful rooftop restaurant and bar. The staff were amazing especially Catrina in reception. She is approachable, v professional and so efficient and always smiling. We will definitely be back.",5,2022,09,19

135,Tulu Made our stay incredible/ kind and helpful staff members,"Tulu works in the hotel, and as soon as arrived he made as feel so extremely welcome, safe, joyful and vibrant. He was always making sure we had everything we needed, he made himself available to help and assist in any way he possibile could and as a character was simply full of life. This hotel made an excellent choice in who they hire!",5,2022,09,17
135,Good location but pricey,"This hotel is in a great location and the decor is very appealing but it is not worth the price. You can get the same for way cheaper. 

I can’t say much on service as we didn’t experience much but the food was expensive, the rooms are tiny and I just felt a bit ripped off. 

The bed was massive, and very comfortable and the pillows were amazing, I even took them out of the case to have a look at the label so I could buy them for myself but there was no label, so if someone would like to tell me I would appreciate that! 

Outside our window was a back alley with large bins that we kept hearing being wheeled about at really random and unsociable times so that was annoying. My friend was also in the hotel and her room was right next to the bell tower and that would constantly wake her up, not ideal!",3,2022,09,15
135,Amazing hotel!,"This hotel exceeded our expectations. Really good location, 1 minute walk from the underground. 
As soon as we arrived the customer service from reception was really friendly and welcoming. We were served by Jude. We got told we were upgraded free to a suite with complimentary champagne as it was my partner's birthday! The room was amazing! The decor was lovely and luxurious. Really clean! We loved having a bath and watching tele in it! 
Lovely having robes and slippers to use whilst staying. 
We went up to the roof terrace bar/restaurant overlooking london which was amazing. Really relaxed, chilled environment. We went just for drinks and had some lovely cocktails. Staff were really attentive and friendly. Others around us had food which looked really good, we were jealous! 
I would definitely stay again at this hotel as one night was not enough!",5,2022,09,12
135,Fantastic stay !,"The hotel was excellent, brilliantly situated in the City of London and so near tubes and sights such as St Paul’s Cathedral.

135,Really lovely hotel,"A really lovely hotel and very reasonably priced for London. Everything was great - welcoming and helpful staff, beautifully decorated room, comfy bed, extremely clean. Only thing lacking (for a 5* hotel) was no 24 hour room service/overnight dining option, but everything else was so good that it's still a 5/5 rating from me. ",5,2022,09,03

Everything was like new.  The staff at the front desk was very helpful.  The roof top bar and restaurant is very nice - we went there every night for drinks and/or appetizers.

135,Best London Hotel we've stayed at.,"Stayed here for 1 night and received an upgrade to a suite due to a slight misunderstanding. 

The hotel itself it beautifully styled throughout, the staff are exceptionally friendly. 

Our room was amazing, clean, spacious,  well equipped, free mini fridge, coffee maker, 3 TVs including one in the bathroom. 

Rooftop bar provides great views across London. 

Breakfast was tasty and made with good quality ingredients although would've been nice to have toast/jams on the side as standard and refillable coffee. Great location mins walk from Mansion House.

Will definitely return to this hotel.",5,2022,08,26
135,Classy boutique hotel that gets it right,"Stopped her for one night and its lovely. Great rooms, superb bed linen, lovely shower etc., and room service perfect. Great roof top terrace for those wanting supper or drinks.

Well thought out and well executed - as a 5 star boutique should be. Will return",5,2022,08,23
135,Fantastic 5* Hotel - Brilliant Stay,"Great hotel, we had a great time and the hotel is very central (Borough Market is about 10 mins away, with great street food stalls and vibes - Bedales wine bar, with the balcony upstairs overlooking the market is a must if open)

A special shout out to Jude at Vintry & Mercer who made us feel very welcome and gave us 5* treatment. 😀",5,2022,08,23

135,Beautiful hotel with easy access to tube and attractions of London,"A beautifully decorated hotel. Our room was on the 6th floor and very quiet with the most comfy bed I think I’ve ever slept in! Air conditioning was top rate and much needed in the summer months. Complimentary glass of champagne as a birthday treat was lovely. Mini fridge with soft drinks was a lovely touch too, as were the tea and coffee making facilities. Toiletries were gorgeous - so nice in fact we sourced some in Liberty to buy and take home with us. There was also a really good hairdryer in the room so no need to pack yours. Robes and slippers also provided. Special thank you to Catarina on reception who looked after us with such care. A great asset to the hotel. Mansion House tube station is literally a one minute walk away which was very handy. Will definitely be returning on our next trip to London.",5,2022,08,20
135,Comfortable and luxurious hotel in handy central area.,"Stayed for 3 nights at the start of August with family. We had booked a standard and superior room but were upgraded to 2 x superior FOC so we could be next door to each other. the rooms are a decent size, the beds really comfortable and the efficient air con was very welcome in the heat. The wifi is amazingly fast and the tv had Sky Sports and BT sport as a very welcome surprise. Complimentary mini bar and morning newspaper were all nice extra touches. The staff are the best asset, all without fail really friendly and helpful. The rooms are cleaned daily but we rarely saw the cleaners. They are very discrete and don't hovver around waiting for you to vacate the room.

The decor is all modern and very tasteful. We had breakfast on the first day. The smoked salmon and scrambled eggs looked delicious. My full English was OK although the eggs and bacon looked like it had been hanging around for a while waiting for me to appear but this was the only minor blemish on an almost flawless visit. We did get stuck in the lift once as the power went off, I suspect this is a security feature as we hadn't presented the room access card to the lift control.

The central location was re",5,2022,08,19
135,Wow,"As 2 couples we spent 4 nights at Vintry& Mercer in Aug 22.
This hotel is fantastic, every member of staff we came across was so polite and helpful, nothing was too much trouble. Despite the heatwave and the rooms having air conditioning I had requested a fan, which was waiting in our room when we checked in.
Breakfast was plentiful, both the continental and full English.
Nearest tube station is all of 4 minutes down the road, the hotel is in a quiet side street. Coffee shops around the corner to grab a snack on the go.
Quieter part of London to stay in near to St Paul's, away from main tourist areas but we liked the location.
Would definitely recommend this hotel, not the cheapest but to get what you pay for - 5* service all round.
 Recommend cocktails on the roof top bar.",5,2022,08,17
135,Excellent central hotel,"This is a brilliant hotel, very well located but also tucked away so nice and quiet and peaceful. Felt very luxurious without being over the top and the roof top bar and restaurant is fabulous. Staff very helpful and cleanliness was superb.  ",5,2022,08,17
135,Beautifully Modern Hotel in Central London,Fantastic service and beautifully decorated rooms and lobby. The hotel rooftop bar is a nice perk with great views. Rooms are on the smaller side but that is to be expected in London. Hotel is off a quiet street. ,5,2022,08,16
135,Fantastic Hotel,"Fantastic hotel. Friendly & helpful staff. The rooms were lovely and clean. Close to all amenities, Would highly recommend this hotel if you’re looking for a great place to stay whilst visiting London.",5,2022,08,16
135,An incredible experience…,"My wife had booked a trip away for our first wedding anniversary. We have stayed in hotels all over the world and she has a immense judge of what makes a hotel stay a exceptional experience however she outdid herself with her choice this time….

From the moment you walk through the door you are greeted with a warm enticing scent in the air with fantastic interior decor. We arrived early- 11am expecting to only be offered a bag drop service like many other hotels. The gentleman on reception checked us in without a fuss, professionally with a warm nature about him. Upon learning we had a lunch reservation at the rooftop bar for our anniversary he offered a complimentary glass of fizz and mock tail. A very nice gesture. Our bags were carried to the elevators by the star of the show. A lovely tall gentleman whose name evades me (management if you read this I must know) I have never in many multiple visits around the world had customer service like it. Incredibly professional but so heartfelt and personal it felt like a family member. He always took the time to stop and chat to us when moving through the hotel and even chatted to us whilst on a break outside of the hotel when we went exploring. What a gem of a staff member you have on your hands there.

The hotel itself. Design- flawless and beautiful cleanliness- Immaculate. Housekeeping team incredibly efficient- best I’ve come across . Everything about the stay visually was pleasing. Bed that makes you want to sleep for years and a spacious bathroom. 
Amenities- Large TV with multiple channels (Sky Sports Football/Main event and BT Sports included- so rare wow!) 
Nespresso coffee and a generous tea making facility with popcorn and biscuits included.
A stocked minibar with no hidden and overpriced charges, which was replaced daily. 
Vintage radio and phone for services a nice touch. 
2 x Bathrobes- the amount of hotels we have stayed in where only 1 is provided. Safe and all usual hotel amenities (hairdryer, amenity kit, iron) all provided but had that touch of class compared to rivals.

Food and Drink- Brunch and cocktails overlooking the London skyline is a must in the rooftop bar. Scallop and Monkfish as good as anywhere I’ve had before with unique and individual cocktails. Even accommodated us during a busy dinner serving when we just wanted drinks.
As a treat we ordered breakfast as room service. Incredibly priced for London! No hidden charges really did feel like a bargain. Instagram worthy but the belly was more than content an unbelievable combination. 

Whether it’s the amazing feel and look of the hotel- or the sensational customer service- or the stunning food and drink that makes you want to stay here just know one thing staying at another establishment whilst in London would be a travesty. 
We look forward to visiting the Vintry and Mercer again in the near future!",5,2022,08,14
135,Very nice,"We had an excellent stay at Vintry & Mercer. Top hotel and service!

135,A super stay,"A unique experience in a wonderful, fresh and cozy boutique hotel. Friendly and Lovely staff always available for a chat or to give informations. 
Mercer rooftop restaurant was the icing on the cake, great service and incredibly tasty food paired with stunning views over the city. Room was perfectly clean and tidy, loved the huge shower and complementary soft drinks and cookies placed every day. Great attention to details. Will definitely come back ",5,2022,08,08
135,EXCEPTIONAL,"From Check in to Check out the service at this Beautiful Hotel was Exceptional.  We were Celebrating my Husbands Birthday and we were Upgraded to a Deluxe Room on the 6th Floor, the View was Amazing.  We were given a glass of Champagne each on the Roof Top Bar, where we sat and enjoyed the last part of our evening.  Breakfast was also Superb with Brilliant Staff.  We slept so well and the Air Con was just an added Bonus.   Do not hesitate to book, you will not regret it.  The Location is lovely, just near St Paul's, down a quiet little road.",5,2022,08,08
135,Hidden gem of a hotel,"Just fabulous. Quiet, immaculate, brilliant reception team (and housekeeping)….a hidden gem in the city. Stayed with my daughter for a post exam treat and the perfect base for us to explore the city. Would stay again when I come back to London.",5,2022,08,08
135,An enchanting experience!,"I had a room booked here through work, I'll be honest I'm not a huge fan of London so wasn't the most excited person, but upon arriving at Vintry & Mercer my attitude changed completely! The hotel is so beautiful I have trouble putting into words how i felt walking in for the first time. The staff are so welcoming and friendly, everyone has a smile on their face. I was then taken to my room and settled in very quickly. The room is exquisite and the shower is something I won't stop talking about for years to come!! We were treated to a 3 course meal on the roof top restaurant with a wonderful view of the London skyline whilst watching the sun set - this again is something I won't forget for some time. Dinner was amazing, the Buratta starter is quite honestly Michelin star quality! This was followed by steak and thrice cooked chips, again incredibly tasty. We were quite a large group and the staff were so attentive and made me feel so welcome. The house cocktails are wonderfully inventive and even the classics were done to perfection. Once dinner and drinks were over I headed town to my room, enjoyed the shower again (I cannot explain how good this shower is!) and settled into bed. The bed itself is super comfortable and easy to fall asleep in  plenty if pillows and with rhe air con gently cooling the room I had an incredible night's sleep. Breakfast the next morning I personally skippered, but seeing what others around me had ordered was making my mouth water a little and I'm jealous i didn't take one to go! Overall this is genuinely the nicest hotel experience I've ever had and I would happily pay to come back here again. Worth every star they've been given *****",5,2022,08,08
135,Great location and incredible staff,"Vintry and Mercer was located in a very convenient location (close to main tube line) and within walking distance to lots of sights. Every member of the staff from front-of-house to housekeeping were incredibly helpful, kind and friendly each day of our stay. We would definitely stay here again!",5,2022,08,07
135,Fantastic boutique hotel.,"If you are in Central London for work you really can't do better than V&M.  I have stayed here several times and while the hotel is right in the middle of everything it is also down a quiet alley.  Also, the roof deck bar really can't be beat - it's a hidden gem.",4,2022,08,07
135,Really good,"Excellent service from all the staff and very nice rooms with comfy beds and a complimentary small mini bar.
Just 100 m1 from mansion house underground.
Excellent and certainly not overpriced.
We will go there again.",5,2022,08,07
135,Brilliant Hotel in the City of London.,"This hotel is tucked away near Mansion House tube station, off Queen Victoria Street. Only a short walk from Bank and St.Pauls, The highly rated Borough Market, Globe Theater and Tate Modern are just slightly further but a nice walk away. Don't be concerned about the location, everywhere is accessible via Tube or Bus from here.

We only visited for one night and were treated brilliantly from the first minute. I had initially booked a deluxe room, but was kindly upgraded to a suite, despite arriving at midday (check in is at 14:00). 
As for the room, wow. Huge bed with gadgets from dimmable lights to remote control blinds. Even a TV (Sky and BT sports included too) in the beautiful bathroom/shower room. Fridge and Nespresso machine stocked and even some complimentary popcorn and soft drinks.

Guest services brought a small gift of sweets with a handwritten anniversary card, which was a lovely touch. What impressed us most was the attentiveness of the staff and the sheer immaculate decor and cleanliness. This seems to be way ahead of the hotels we've previously visited in London.
After a great evening out we returned and had a quick look at the rooftop bar, which was our only regret. A regret we hadn't booked a table to eat an take in the lovely night time view.

Upon checking out, it was a hot day and was even offered bottled water for our journey. The small touches like that make a big impression.

A really fantastic little hotel, I would not think twice about using it again, not a negative the about it. Really!",5,2022,08,06
135,Great service!,"We stayed at Vintry and Mercer for our 10th anniversary trip to London and it was wonderful! The service was incredible and the room was beautiful. The location is very close to a subway stop, which allowed us to travel the city easily. It was 10-15 minutes from all the main attractions, but the area itself was free from extremely busy tourism. Also, their full English breakfast was delicious! I would stay again in a heartbeat. ",5,2022,08,06
135,"Classy boutique hotel and beautiful roof terrace food, highly recommend","Such a beautiful hotel in a perfect location
Staff were extremely friendly.
Patricia in particular was very helpful and was happy to help arrange to decorate our room for husbands 40th 
Dimitri was also very empathetic at short notice when we had to cancel one of our rooms due to an illness and sorted it out for us. Highly recommend visiting here and the food is spot on  ",5,2022,08,04
135,Business Visit to London,"What a wonderful place to stay in London,  great location, friendly staff, roof top restaurant Wonderfull. 
Rooms lovely and clean! Traveling for business can be pretty tough when you go back to the boring chain hotel but, I looked forward to finishing meetings and heading back to the Vintry & Mercer for a glass of wine on the roof top.",5,2022,08,04
135,An OASIS in london!!,"My flights were long and difficult coming from the Caribbean. Timezone change was +5hrs. Got to the hotel way earlier than checkin time, tired, and was received by a friendly front desk, which gave a room right away regardless of me being early. That was the beginning of a world of service and impecable accommodations. Maybe some large hotels shall learn from this management!!",5,2022,08,03
135,Wedding anniversary stay,We were celebrating our wedding anniversary. Staff were very friendly on arrival and gave us a free room upgrade and complimentary champagne. This was a lovely touch which we very much appreciated. Hotel is in a quiet location but central for visiting the city. Will definitely be staying again.,5,2022,08,01
135,Lovely but dear,I stayed at V&M for 3 nights - just checked out yesterday. The service was brilliant and round the clock. The room was a dream both in terms of design and facilities. The tub was a welcome surprise and I had a long soak and it took the edge off my jetlag. The property is obviously very popular because prices had risen to approximately £500 pn. This is probably not worth £500 a night. I'd come back for £300 anytime though. ,5,2022,07,28
135,Nice Small Hotel,"Very nice staff, very small rooms but well furnished, price in my opinion is too high for the size of the room. The location in the city is prefect. The breakfast is ok but not a lot of choice in the menu",4,2022,07,28
135,Vintry Mercer - A Fab Spot in London,"A wonderful hotel tucked away in the financial district with great rooms, excellent service and a lovely rooftop bar.  The rooms are very clean, spacious and comfortable. Easy access to the tube for transfers to the Airport or around the city.",5,2022,07,26
135,Business Stay at Vintry & Mercer,"We had a great experience during our stay at the Vintry & Mercer hotel. The staff was very attentive and hospitable, the rooms were in excellent condition and clean, and the location was very convenient for the variety of meetings we had throughout London. Excellent option if you're traveling for business or visiting London and will be spending time sightseeing throughout the city.",5,2022,07,18
135,First time stay,"We stayed here for date night, it was our first night away from home since baby and Vintry and Mercer didn’t disappoint. The staff were amazing, very attentive and friendly. To be away from the baby for 24 hours it had to be special, and it was. 
Also the bed was the comfiest bed I have ever slept in! ",5,2022,07,17
135,Faultless Stay,Exceptional hotel - made to feel extremely welcome. Room was spacious and stylish and very comfortable - the shower a particular highlight. Hotel is in a good location close to tube links so can get around easy. Would definitely choose vintry and mercer again.,5,2022,07,16
135,Excellent stay,"Lovely area and good tube access. The hotel is quiet, very clean and very comfortable. We didn’t eat there but the staff we encountered were very friendly and helpful.Very welcoming and would definitely stay again.",5,2022,07,15
135,Not 5 Star,"We just completed our stay with V&M in London and we unfortunately would try our luck elsewhere next time. It’s fairly out of the way of all the main attractions and traffic was worse than expected the whole time. We’d definitely stay more central next time. The standard rooms were extremely small - no space to put even one luggage down anywhere. Views from the room were dismal as well, even though we were traveling for our wedding anniversary. 

Gabriella and the Italian/Russian gentleman were fantastic but nighttime staff was not good. We called for a cab pickup from the theatre on our last night and the person I talked to never called us back, stranding us across London and never checking to make sure we got back to the hotel even though he said he’d call us back when he had a cab for us (still waiting on that call). Cleaning services put my toothpaste and retainer case on the back of our toilet while cleaning and left it there, which was all incredibly unsanitary and pretty mind boggling for a 5 star hotel. When we mentioned it (I think to the same evening staff gentleman who was supposed to call our cab) he just wrote down a note to talk to them and said “I haven’t heard that one before” - no apology.

Gabriella in particular did do several things to celebrate our anniversary (complimentary dessert, offer of 2 champagne glasses & gave us an accessible room that had a little more space) but unfortunately even with extras, the basics weren’t there. We regrettably will look elsewhere when in London in the future.",3,2022,07,14
135,Business trip,Gabriela at front desk was great. She was very helpful. Loved the sound of the church bells. I was working in an office nearby so good location. The terrace is also very pretty for a summer lunch or a cocktail in the afternoon ,5,2022,07,13
135,Brilliant hotel- exceeded expectations,Absolutely perfect stay. Service was great. Excellent bedding and towels. Good shower pressure. Complementary snacks and drinks replenished daily. Location was brilliant and a subway station a few steps away. Different types of plug points in the room.  Walking distance to great restaurants and shops ,5,2022,07,12
135,Very nice hotel,"Vintry and Mercer is a new hotel, with nice rooms. Area is very quite, near to St. Paul Cathedral & the City. Our room was perfect with anything we needed including a free selection of soft drinks. We had dinner at the rooftop restaurant which is really amazing. 
Staff is extremely nice and helpfull in any of our needs",5,2022,07,12
135,Fantastic Small Hotel,"Fantastic location, 30 yards from quiet tube station.  Close to St Paul’s, Tower of London and Bankside.  20 min walk to Covent Garden.  
Helpful and friendly staff, rooms spotless with good amenities and comfortable beds.  Rooftop Terrace was great for drinks and nibbles.  
Ate breakfast one day of our trip - good.  
Would stay again definitely.",5,2022,07,11
135,Amazing hotel,The best hotel team ever! I especially want to thank Patricia who went above and beyond to help with every single thing we needed. The whole staff is amazing and we’re extremely welcoming and helpful and simply very kind ,5,2022,07,10
135,Lovely hotel in great location,Great hotel fantastic location reception staff very helpful and friendly. Room small but well furnished had all we needed. Roof top terrace bar reception a real gem could have had a broader cocktail list very limited. Waitress hardly spoke English but idea but lovely place for drinks/ meal,4,2022,07,09
135,Beautiful Boutique hotel,"Beautiful hotel near St Paul’s cathedral , tucked away in the back streets away from the main road, the hotel is small by London standards but perfectly formed , the decor is tastefully done and the room we had was beautiful - an amazing rainfall shower and all the amenities you could possibly want.
Only a couple of minutes away from Mansion House tube station too",5,2022,07,05
135,Hidden Gem,"Fantastic boutique hotel with an amazing staff. Excellent breakfast, lovely areas to hang out all over the hotel. Really good location close to the circle line. The roof top bar was a very nice additional perk.",5,2022,07,04
135,Flawless,"An absolute gem of a hotel in a part of London we don’t usually stay in. Lots of fabulous quirky touches in the public areas and in the guest rooms. The food and drink was good value and top quality. The hotel was in a quiet location so we had a top class sleep, and yet was only a couple of minutes walk from the nearest tube station. A perfect stay - thank you!",5,2022,07,03
135,Luxury hotel but also very relaxed,"Really lovely stay here. The hotel is beautiful, such lovely design features. The rooms are exceptionally clean and comfortable. Staff are all so welcoming. Close to several stations so easy to get around London. Would highly recommend.",5,2022,07,03
135,Weekend break,"The hotel is in a great position in the City of London - easy access to the river, art galleries museums and alot of London history.
The hotel itself is welcoming, well fitted out and reception staff were excellent.
It was Sunday night so a bit quiet and a shame the cocktail bar was closed. Service in the Terrace Restaurant was a bit haphazard but friendly - short staffed on a Sunday night maybe ?",4,2022,06,29
135,Best nights stay in London,"A fantastic, clean and smart hotel with super helpful staff and great facilities.  The front desk staff were particularly helpful.
The room was spacious, clean and fully equipped and the complimentary drink was a nice touch.  Dinner at the rooftop restaurant was fab too with a great wine list!  We would definitely stay here again!",5,2022,06,28
135,Daddy and Daughter Theatre Stay!,"A really smart, trendy hotel with traditional feel. Great service and very clean and smart all round. Felt a step up from some of the larger hotels. Comfy bed. Room quite small but was the standard room and was not expecting anything different. Great TV with movies, radio, etc easy to use. The rooftop restaurant was great, brilliant service and wonderful food. Good breakfast. Was a little slow but that was due to going down at the busy time and as with all good hotels, they warned us when we ordered, so no issues at all! Would recommend",5,2022,06,27
135,Superb boutique hotel,Very comfortable boutique hotel located perfectly for visiting the City of London and the Bankside area. Helpful and friendly staff who went out of their way to provide top notch service. Room was of modest size but very well equipped.,5,2022,06,27
135,Nice boutique Hotel...,"Breakfast Staff and service needs to improved.
Coffee took around 20 minutes to get and breakfast around 30 min until we had on table. 

Rooms are nice but too small. We except a much better service quality within this price range. 
",3,2022,06,24
135,This is a great place to stay.,This is a beautiful hotel near an underground station and the staff is extremely friendly and helpful. There is a restaurant with great food as well on the roof. I really enjoyed my stay there and highly recommend it.,5,2022,06,24
135,Wonderful accommodations in the heart of London,"Large rooms, comfortable beds, and superior service in a prime location. A great place to stay and experience all London has to offer. You can walk to St. Paul's Cathedral, the Tower of London or Globe Theatre, take in a show in Covent Garden, enjoy a pint at one of the many local pubs and enjoy dinner with a view of St. Paul's. Enjoy!",5,2022,06,23
135,Fabulous hotel,"Such a great stay they really thought of everything ! Loved the details in the room like the lighting controls and oversized TV and free mini bar which are usually not thought about in other hotels, plus the relaxed attitude to check in meant we could access the room early. Staff were fantastic, lunch in the roof terrace superb. ",5,2022,06,20
135,Stunning!,"Beautiful stay at what can only be described as the epitome of a five star boutique hotel. Stunning rooms, gorgeous interiors across the hotel, charming staff. The best sleep in the most comfortable bed. Would highly recommend! ",5,2022,06,19
135,Great way to end our visit in London,"The stay at the V&M was Outstanding! The service and hospitality from the front desk team which went out of their way to assist with the late check out, was what service is all about. 
The roof top bar, food and service was outstanding, not to be missed. 
Well definitely come back again",5,2022,06,19
135,Excellent customer service.,"A lovely small hotel in an excellent, quiet location where you feel fully truly valued as a customer. The rooms, although not large, are extremely comfortable with lots of little touches that make the difference !",5,2022,06,18
135,Fabulous Hotel,"We loved staying here and would definitely stay here again. The rooms are a good size especially for Europe. Bed very comfortable and coming back after a long day to replenished snacks and water, which were included, was amazing. The staff was very helpful with suggestions and offered to book things for us, print tickets and just add it to the room. We didn’t eat there but the bar Do Not Disturb, on the lower level, had a great 20’s vibe and a great mixologist.",5,2022,06,16
135,Amazing stay at V&M!!!,"What a great hotel this is! Great location and literally steps away from the Underground; awesome and super helpful staff; excellent amenities; clean bedroom and comfortable bed. Couldn’t have been better! Next time I’m in London, I’ll be staying here again. Highly recommended!",5,2022,06,09
135,Amazing hotel and staff,I loved staying at this property. The reception team was outstanding and went above and beyond to help guests. I actually looked at rooms inside 8 other 5 Star hotels and none of them even came close to Vintry & Mercer. I want to personally thank Demitri for the amazing service he provided for our group.,5,2022,06,08
135,Great small luxury hotel,"This hotel is a true small luxury hotel . Ideally placed for exploring the area around The Tower , Tower Bridge , Borough Market  and so much more being so close to a underground link that’s just up from the hotel . 
Our room ( which we got upgraded with) had a big comfy bed , lots of amenities and was really quiet . 
Good in the hotel was of good quality and well cooked . 
Great little cocktail bar called do not disturb that produced some great mixed / shaken  cocktails . 
We we visit again we certainly would .",5,2022,06,08
135,Jubilee weekend stay,"Good helpful staff. Rooms very clean, comfortable bed. But for the price of the room it was far too small, barely space to walk round the bed. If you were unfortunate enough to fall out of bed you would land in the bathroom.",3,2022,06,05
135,Perfection,"Outstanding staff, always smiling and want to help in any way they can, they are the epitome of what every hotel should be and we hope they are proud! . Housekeeping is absolutely second to none and they should be hugely congratulated. The one and only thing we would have liked is to be able to have tea or coffee somewhere on the ground floor during the day when the cafe is not open, rather than having it in our room but that is the smallest of wishes.",5,2022,06,05
135,Hidden Gem,"This hotel is wonderful - gorgeous and peaceful. So stylish and can't find fault.  Can not wait to stay again and would recommend to anyone. Beautiful rooms, amazing roof top terrace and cool speak easy bar in basement! ",5,2022,06,04
135,We love Vintry & Mercer,"Jude, Dimitri and Julian made our London vacation truly special! From the moment we stepped in, we knew this was a hidden gem in the heart of the city. Do not miss dinner on the rooftop terrace or cocktails at DND ... pure magic! ",5,2022,06,02
135,Little Oasis of Calm in the Centre of London,Excellent weekend family trip away. The attention to detail down to child friendly toiletries in the bathroom was much appreciated. Extremely comfortable hotel with friendly staff. Would definitely stay again. ,5,2022,05,31
135,Hidden Gem,A fantastic boutique hotel in a great location. The staff and the service they provide is of particular note - outstanding. The Do Not Disturb cocktail bar adds further appeal to this excellent hotel. Rooms and common areas are all first class.,5,2022,05,30
135,Over Night Stay,"I chose this hotel on spec because of its location and it more than matched my expectations.  From the friendly, helpful lady at check in until the moment we left the service was excellent, the room was great, the bed really comfortable and the breakfast hearty and delicious.  We will stay again.",5,2022,05,28
135,Business trip,"Overall the hotel is lovely however if you are looking for a hotel where you are able to get refreshments as and when you want them, this is not the place to stay.
Staff are very helpful and friendly but can be very elusive, you need to go back to reception if you want anything, the cocktail bar is nice, although rather dimly lit, I had to use the torch on my phone to read the drinks menu! And the music is on repeat so if you don't like jazz on a loop I would avoid it, the hotel rooms are great, the beds are very comfortable, we ate in the terrace restaurant on the evening the meal was very nice, the breakfast is menu based rather than a buffet style and again it was nice although not to much choice in my opinion, but overall I would stay again, I'd just take my own coffee and milk with me and bottles of water! ",4,2022,05,26
135,"Warm, friendly welcome at this fabulous hotel","A truly wonderful experience.  Delightful staff, gorgeous decor and fabulous 
Roof terrace.  Our bedroom was well appointed and very quiet with great views.

135,Outstanding Hotel and Service,"My stay at Vintry and Mercer was absolutely outstanding.  I've stayed in quite nice hotels around the world, and this was among the very best experiences I have ever had.  The staff treated me like family and made me feel like I was their most special guest.  Vintry and Mercer felt like a second home to me--albeit quite an elegant one!

I'd like to give a special shout-out to Patricia and Alexander.  They were particularly kind and welcoming to me and really helped make my stay very special.

I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough.  Extraordinary!",5,2022,05,22
135,Lovely hotel in good location,"This hotel is conveniently located, the staff is helpful, and the interior is lovely. The rooftop bar has a great view and you can walk to just about anywhere from here but it is also close to a tube station.",5,2022,05,19
135,Travelagent,"Good new, and nice boutique hotel within the centre of Londen but also very private and quite.
Very well decorated and staying there gives you a feeling of being home. Service of staff is wonderful they help you with everything and with a smile!
",4,2022,05,18
135,Outstanding service!,"Amazing hotel which was completed in 2019 so everything seems brand new. The decor is really cool and although it is a relatively small hotel it has everything you need.
The bit that stood out to us the most however was the staff. Every person we came across was so friendly and went out of their way to be as helpful as possible. A special thanks to Katarina on reception who made a great first impression! We will come back and stay again purely because of the staff.
The roof terrace is great in the sunshine and also at night, they have blankets and heaters so it isn’t too cold. Cocktails are great as well!
The room was small, as in no where to enable you to open a suitcase but we only booked the standard room so it would probably be worth upgrading. We also overlooked the bin area at the back which was noisy during the night with bins being collected and lorry deliveries being made to the hotel. We just wouldn’t open the window next time.
We will be booking our next stay very soon! Really pleased to have found this hotel!",5,2022,05,16
135,Short Break with Family,"This is a must stay type of location, service is excellent, location is excellent and facilities were brilliant.  As a family we travelled to London to celebrate our son’s 18th Birthday and it was made even more special by the staff at this wonderful hotel.",5,2022,05,16
135,Cool urban ,Upscale and well planned urban hotel.  Very nicely designed in a tight city setting of old London City.  No parking requires some effort if you have a car.  Small cobble streets make you question your arrival route.  Friendly staff.  Good food.  Elegant comforts in a boutique style hotel. My kind of place. Near St. Paul's.,5,2022,05,12
135,Gem in the City,"Vintry & Mercer was the perfect hotel for a business trip back to the City.  Well positioned for a number of tube stations and main routes for taxi pick-ups, it made for a very easy base for various meetings.  Aside from location the hotel itself was cosy and comfortable, clean with all the amenities required.  Great wifi, lovely food throughout the day and the staff were a fantastic team. Excellent hospitality which made  me feel so welcome and as though I stayed every week.  ",5,2022,05,12
135,Luxury Boutique Hotel,Love this hotel.  It’s definitely a bit of luxury away from home.  Lots of small touches that make a big difference.   Welcome and level of service is second to none.  Speakeasy is just what you need after a long day and lovely cocktails. ,5,2022,05,12
135,Cozy and luxury,"Great location, great breakfast, very clean and personal.
From the front desk until the terrace restaurant, the service is impeccable, with a personal treatment and happy staff. Would recommend and stay again! 

",4,2022,05,09
135,Great boutique vibes and excellent location,Jude at reception was great. The hotel itself has a great boutique vibe and is of very high quality. The standard of service was personal and professional. The location is perfect for an evening or morning stroll across Southwark and the Millenium bridges with all the best eateries London has to offer. An absolute gem of a hotel you will not be disappointed in booking (and I am fussy).,5,2022,05,09
135,Great Stay,"Had a very enjoyable stay at V&M. Located close to an Underground station but in a quiet area for peaceful stay. 
Rooms were very clean and well appointed.
Reception staff were very nice and helpful particularly Gabriella. We did not get the opportunity to use rooftop restaurant but looked cool. 
It would be nice if breakfast was done as a buffet style rather than having to seperately order every drink / item from a set menu. ",5,2022,05,07
135,"Perfect location, nice staff, room upgrade questionable","Hotel has a nice feel and is not bland or faceless, plenty of design highlights and nice staff. Breakfast very good and the roof top bar lovely. I did a double upgrade on the room to a deluxe one. 

The room was a good size but felt a bit dark and the window was not only small but had no view at all, just of a small area outside. It was also only on the first floor and one expected higher floors as you upgrade room category. 

Also unless you are in the bar/s or restaurants, there isn't anywhere else in the hotel to relax or meet friends. So if you like a big lobby area or areas to sit, probably best to pick another hotel. 

Great location for underground and very close to the River Thames. Very quiet area too, so no street noise. 

Decent base if you are out and about a lot, less so if you intend to spend more time in the hotel.",4,2022,05,07
135,Such a gem in London!,"We stayed here for our anniversary! We were upgraded on arrival, had a complimentary glass of champagne each delivered to the room as well as a card and chocolate fudge (which was amazing). The whole experience was lovely and we were made to feel really special. 

The price of the hotel was very reasonable for London and we were very impressed with everything the hotel had to offer, including quirky books in the room, adaptor plugs and Sky TV!

The only small negative was the shower was quite low and couldn’t be adjusted (this was fine for me but my partners head was above the shower) this was okay for the one night and there was also a bath so not much of an issue at all! 

Would definitely recommend and would love to stay again!",5,2022,05,07
135,Gem of a place. Outstanding service,"Gem of a hotel. Beautifully and cleverly  styled. Greenery and fresh scents everywhere. Staff are outstanding - it was my birthday and they delivered sweet treats to our room and offered additional drinks. Superb customer service - Uber professional, warm and friendly 
Roof terrace and lunch were heavenly - it helped that the sun was out. 
Breakfast was plentiful and generous.
We would definitely return.",5,2022,05,03
135,Wonderful family stay,"Best family hotel we've been to! Approachable, friendly staff who couldn't do enough for us. We loved every minute of our stay with all the lovely details and the complimentary refreshments and plant-based toiletries. ",5,2022,05,02

135,Wonderful experience!,A wonderful experience. The service level we received was second to none from the moment we arrived to the moment we checked out. Jude on reception was particularly amazing in his attentiveness and service. I would highly recommend staying at this beautiful hotel.,5,2022,05,01
135,What a fantastic stay…,"What can I say,  from the moment we arrived the level of service and care we received was exceptional! We were greeted by the wonderful Jude at reception, who kindly accommodated us as we arrived fours hours early, upgraded us to a beautiful suite with a balcony and upon hearing we have three daughters presented gifts for them. What amazing start to our trip. From that point, each person we met within the hotel maintained the same energy and high level of service and nothing was too much. My one regret was not gaining the name of the lovely person who helped with our luggage. He always had a smile on his face and happy to help whenever required. Another great asset to this hotel! Our suite was spotlessly clean, modern and chic. We visited the roof top terrace and basemen cocktail bar, where the food and cocktails where among the best we have tasted. We cannot wait to return and would highly recommend this hotel for your next visit. Five stars!",5,2022,04,30
135,Fantastic hotel with great service,"A lovely boutique hotel within easy walking distance from Liverpool Street station - nice quiet location, great staff, friendly service and overall just a very nice place to stay. Fab bar downstairs, and a nice breakfast the next morning. Highly recommended.",5,2022,04,30
135,Excellent Stay in a Perfect Location,"I had the pleasure of staying at Vintry & Mercer for a week at the end of March. I wanted a small boutique hotel within walking distance of the Globe Theatre, as I planned to attend several performances. As it turned out, the hotel was convenient to just about everything, as there were several  nearby Tube stations. My room was exceptionally quiet and luxurious and I had several lovely meals at the restaurants. The staff was unfailingly kind and helpful.",5,2022,04,27

135,"Great location, great staff, exceptionally clean hotel!",Had a wonderful one night stay in this hotel which was quite central to most of London (around St Paul's area). The hotel was very clean and offered free soft beverages in the minibar. Rooms were quite small however they offered all you needed. Bathroom/shower room was opulent with all guest toiletries available. Definitely would consider booking this hotel again however there are other's which may be slightly cheaper around central London. ,4,2022,04,26
135,Review,An excellent venue for whatever your reason for staying in London is. Excellent location near many sites major sites and near a tube station. Incredibly kind and helpful staff. The in house bar was a highlight of our trip as well as the rooftop restaurant. ,5,2022,04,25

135,Amazing trip,We stayed here for my mums 60th birthday. The hotel couldnt do enough for you and the service is always with a smile. The hotel sits very close to manchents house tube station so really good access to links and nearby restaurants and shops.

135,A highly recommended central London premium hotel,"A faultless 2nd visit to this hotel. On arrival I was offered a free upgrade which was a lovely and unexpected bonus. Rooms was spotless, well appointed and very comfortable. All in-room technology worked well and without issue. As I arrived late in the evening I ordered room service which I can safely say was one of the tastiest meals I have had for quite some time. The food was not only tasty and well presented but also delivered very quickly so top marks for the kitchen staff.",5,2022,04,20

135,Lovely Quirky Hotel,"Staff were amazing, cracking spotless homely hotel with a smashing rooftop bar/ restaurant. Rooms were nice with a comfy large bed. My only slight issue with the room was the lack of daylight but this should not take away from an excellent experience ",5,2022,04,16
135,Lovely place to stay,"We stayed in their top room, suite, and loved it.
The bed was comfy, the room was great and the décor was really very nice

i would definitely come back again to this hotel",5,2022,04,14
135,Great place to stay,"This was my second visit. Highly recommended. You will not be disappointed. It's literally a 2 minute walk from Mansion Station to the hotel. It is near to London attractions such as St Pauls Cathedral, Tower Of London Trafalgar Square etc",5,2022,04,11
135,Lovely hotel - perfect for a nice break,"Fabulous hotel . The staff are helpful and friendly especially Monica who works in both restaurants. 
The rooms are lovely with more than everything you need. The breakfast is lovely and good value for money.
The roof top restaurant and bar is stunning with a lovely choice of food . The vege option is amazing.
The hotel also has a speakeasy bar which is quirky and a lovely place to unwind with a cocktail.
Fabulous hotel well worth a visit - we’ll definitely go back",5,2022,04,11
135,Great overall Experience,"The Service, the Interior, Drinks at DND, the Food & the really friendly staff, who assists with really everything.
The Mix of the Interior with it’s Retro Charme & the latest technical gadgets- to me it’s the perfect Combo! ",5,2022,04,10
135,Lovely hotel in the City,"One of the best hotels we’ve been to in London. Rooms were lovely and excellent friendly service. Had a boutique feel, unlike all the homogenous places. Excellent location from the City, but also an easy walk in to the ‘sights’. Would highly recommend.",5,2022,04,09
135,Unfortunate disappointment,"Relative to other 4 star hotels I've stayed at, Vintry & Mercer was a disappointment.

- Location was good in the financial district.  Also convenient the underground station.
- Hotel had a small lobby and virtually no spaces to work in.  The floor had a library room but I was told that must be booked and not for guests to use.  It's a small hotel of around 60 rooms.
- Rooms were dark and small, there wasn't much natural light and wasn't supplemented with good lighting in the room.
- The restaurants staff were courteous and food was good.
- There was no bellhop and the hotel staff couldn't be bothered to come out behind the counter and help even though there were no one else around.

Would not stay here again - I'm surprised the rating is so high on TripAdvisor.  Nothing terribly wrong with the hotel, but definitely not what I would consider top 3% in London according to TA.",2,2022,04,07
135,City with Style,"A unique stylish hotel in the heart of the City of London, fabulous service and excellent rooms. The food is excellent and do try the Cocktail Bar the basement which provides a cosy contrast to the roof terrace which has views across the City.",5,2022,04,07
135,Small Rooms but Nice Hotel,"hi all
overall we liked this hotel in a quiet part of the City. Rooms were nice but a bit on the small side for me but perfectly fine for a long weekend break. The bar terrace and restaurant were excellent. This is a lovely hotel I wouldn't say it Wow'd me but I would stay here again if I stop in this part of London.",4,2022,04,06
135,Mum & Daughter Special Birthday Weekend!,The most perfect birthday weekend for mum & daughter!  Service exceptional on the whole but a couple of people let that down.  Menu was limited so struggled to find something I wanted to eat so had a starter as a main course.  But apart from that everything was perfect & wonderful & the majority of the staff were exceptional.  Would go back without hesitation!,5,2022,04,05
135,"Brilliant, made the trip all that more enjoyable ","We visited the Vintry and Mercer Hotel for 2 nights while I ran the London 1/2 Marathon. The room had all the things you needed the bed was comfortable, the shower was fantastic. The complimentary soft drinks were great and the staff couldn't be more happy to help. Good location for St Pauls, millennium bridge, tower of London etc. Right next to Mansion House underground. Brilliant stay and wouldn't hesitate to stay again when in London. ",5,2022,04,05
135,A few issues,"As our room was on the ground floor we couldn’t get to sleep on the second night of our stay due to music from the basement bar below. We were told on three occasions that it was just about to finish but it kept going. To be fair to the hotel they gave us a discount for that night. I would recommend a room on a higher floor.

When we went for breakfast the next morning we were told it would be a 30-40 minute wait for our food. As we had plans we couldn’t wait that long so didn’t eat. 

On the third morning we went down for breakfast at 10.20am (it finished at 10.30am). The staff were unfriendly and generally pissed off at our arrival. Whilst I get that they had to stay on a bit longer than anticipated, being rude to the guests surely isn’t the answer.

That said this a nice hotel, in a very central location (right next to Mansion House tube station) and the reception staff were very friendly and helpful.",3,2022,04,04
135,London Landmarks Stay,"Wonderful stay in a great hotel, the perfect base for exploring central London. Friendly staff who went above and beyond to make us feel welcome. We were running the Landmarks half marathon on the final day of our trip and were allowed a late checkout, free of charge, meaning we could enjoy a shower and a quick relax after the run. We hope to be back soon.",5,2022,04,04
135,Outstanding hotel,"Absolutely fabulous - could not fault a thing, from the time we were greeted at reception to the time we checked out, every point of contact was excellent.
The rooms and facilities are outstanding.
Thank you for making a magical couple of days.
Will definitely be back",5,2022,03,31
135,Great stay,"Friendly staff throughout the whole hotel stay, room was clean and had everything you need (including the duck) :-) 
You have a mini-bar which is free including popcorn and breakfast the next day had great options, 
Hassle free business stay which was ideal! ",5,2022,03,31
135,Amazing hotel and excellent service 10*(star),"Elegant and sophisticated hotel. From the moment we arrived we, the staff were so lovely. Rooms were very clean and 5*. 
We were there for one night but I’ve already planned to go back. The rooftop bar is a beauty. Can’t wait to go back.
The hotel must be managed so well, as it’s evident in the conduct of the staff.",5,2022,03,28
135,"The room was amazing, loved the light control, room size as well and beautiful bathroom. The service was amazing, l","Love the staff and hospitality.
Honestly the one of the best hotels I have ever started. Will definitely be coming back 
Room was super modern,amazing architecture, staff were awesome, so attentive and welcoming.",5,2022,03,26
135,Not good,"Reception staff was very rude and not helpful. This ruined my stay. We booked a room for 2 which was tiny (214)  yet our colleague booked a room for 1 paid less money and had a much bigger room (207) 

We also couldn’t get a table to have a drink at the bar as we didn’t pre book at 7pm. Then after our event we wanted to go back for a drink but the bar was closed. Just not good really. ",1,2022,03,23
135,Warrington,"It is an excellent hotel with great personal service. It is located close to London's many tourist locations via tube as it close to Mansion House tube.  Wonderful roof terrace overlooking Shard and St Paul's.
",5,2022,03,21
135,Great Hotel,"Top from the check in to the check out. Great location, very friendly staff. A lot of attention for their customer ( example : welcoming present for our son at the check in , newspaper in the morning in front of the room's door )",5,2022,03,21
135,Quiet 5 star city break,"We had an unquestionably relaxing and comfortable stay in this SLH property located near a subway and rail station. It is off the main road which makes the hotel very appealing for a quiet city break. 
We had four rooms all of which were stylishly appointed and included a complimentary mini bar. The rooms had soft touches which made it extra comfortable with plenty of electric sockets, tea and coffee making facilities, little snacks, safe and aromatic toiletries. Cleaning of the rooms and indeed all publics spaces was immaculate. They had a functional gym and we noticed three conference rooms all of which looked extremely quaint. 
Check in and check out was a breeze. The 2 lovely ladies on the reception where true professionals of their trade and made the entire stay extremely personal. Compliments goes to them both. This makes a huge difference in a city hotel.
We enjoyed breakfast on both mornings. Sadly, the last morning they ran out of smoked salmon; a staple on the breakfast menu. All cooked dishes arrived piping hot and the continental option was substantial. Service from the gentleman was polite and efficient. Dinner on our final night on the roof top terrace restaurant was outstanding.
Highly recommended the Vintry & Mercer for a quiet city escape with personalised 5-star services.",5,2022,03,16
135,Vintry and Mercer,"Amazing hotel and the staff are out of this world from the moment you arrive to leaving, keep it up, amazing.   The rooms are perfectly decorated and super clean, the restaurant food and ambiance is second to none and we so enjoyed the roof top terrance and downstairs bar, not forgetting the great breakfast.",5,2022,03,15
135,Perfect stay.,"We stayed at this hotel for my partners 30th birthday. We actually returned after staying here in December. When we stayed in December myself, partner and baby got really unwell ( not from the hotel may I add ) we come down with a really awful sickness bug and was unable to leave our room. The staff did everything possible to make us feel comfortable. Bringing us lots of water, clean towels and bedding. They even offered to help us clean up, we declined the offer as it was our sick and we didn’t want them to. 

They even kept checking in to make sure we was okay. The customer service was just fantastic and that’s why we returned. 

I booked the hotel very last minute and they did everything they could to make sure we had the most wonderful stay. The staff on the reception are wonderful, the best customer service we have ever received and we have stayed in hotels all around the world. The hotel is very clean and it has lovely decor. 

I would definitely recommend this hotel and will% be returning!!",5,2022,03,14
135,Great hotel,"This is a great hotel with friendly service. 

We stayed as a couple overnight on a quick weekend trip to London. The location is great. I love the City at the weekend as it is relatively quiet at the weekend (and cheap!) compared with the West End. 

The hotel is a couple of minutes from St Paul’s and about 15 Minutes walk into Covent Garden where we spent the evening. 

The reception staff were very helpful and welcoming and our room was ready slightly earlier than the check-in time. We had a suite which was very spacious with a balcony with a view of the top of the Shard. 

The room was well-equipped - free soft drinks in the minibar, teas, nespresso capsules, and a couple of snacks. The bathroom had very nice toiletries and dressing gowns/slippers. The bed was super comfy. 

We went to the rooftop bar for a complimentary glass of champagne. It was a bit cold and windy but a lovely view. We had breakfast the following morning which was very nice and again the service was friendly and efficient. 

Can’t really fault the hotel - price location, service, facilities all very good.",5,2022,03,14
135,Fantastic hotel,"My experience at the hotel was as expected 
The room was as described exceptinattly verry clean and very  modern

I would rate my experience 10/10
And I would definitely return and recommend others
Kind regards 
",5,2022,03,14
135,Surprisingly friendly,Great base for an interesting part of London - rooftop restaurant is very good too as is the cellar bar.  The equipment in the rooms is great and apart from some unusual views from the inside rooms there was nothing to fault the hotel.,5,2022,03,09
135,Excellent location,"Excellent hotel in the city, close to St Paul’s Cheapside and the river.

Modern comfortable bedrooms with all amenities 

Unfortunately I’ve been waiting 40 minutes for scrambled egg on toast - what a shame such visibly excellent standards have been let down by delivery.",4,2022,03,04
135,Perfect luxury stay!,"Gorgeous hotel, lovely ambience, beautifully decorated and personable friendly staff who can’t do enough for you. Roof bar was amazing as was the service as well as breakfast on the ground floor where it was relaxing and calm.
Perfectly situated hotel in the middle of everything with lots of travel links in walking distance.
Katarina who welcomed us in reception was able to offer us champagne and a room upgrade as we were celebrating which was a lovely touch! Thank you V & M for a great anniversary!
We would definitely recommend and return.",5,2022,03,04
135,The most incredible stay!,"The staff were incredibly welcoming, the hotel was immaculate. We were so sad to leave and can’t wait to return!

The location of the hotel is perfect too, me and my boyfriend went to Ivy Asia which was a 5 minute walk across to the Cannon Street mall! Amazing",5,2022,03,02
135,Weekend away London ,"Hidden away this is a fantastic gem of a small hotel. Fantastic staff who are attentive and welcoming. The roof top bar has spectacular views across the city and the Thames. Rooms are comfortable modern, clean and spacious for London. Breakfast really recommended close to St Paul's for a nice day trip. Secret escapes maximises the value of the hotel. Great place would have no hesitation in booking again.",5,2022,02,28
135,Hidden Gem.,"Tucked away hotel, modern and artistic appearance, staff professional and friendly. Room exceptionally clean and comfortable. Food excellent, location excellent. Only regret was i didn't book for longer.",5,2022,02,28
135,Take your own hot drink to breakfast! Make your own cuppa in your bedroom down to breakfast,Hot drinks at breakfast can and will break your bank balance. Four cups of coffee and you will need to increase your mortgage considerably! Quality of hot food at breakfast good. But charging customers for each hot drink is unreasonable ,3,2022,02,27
135,Perfection,"My favorite hotel in London. Best staff, small but beautiful, comfy and pristine rooms. Everything works so well, there is a real attention to detail and care for costumer experience. The hotel is well run and a real gem. ",5,2022,02,26
135,A  perfect night in the City,"Excellent everything! A lovely welcome at the desk, a fabulous room, and good room service at around midnight. A fresh breakfast in the morning and perfect coffee rounded off a really enjoyable stay. Highly recommended and a location that takes you to the River in seconds and to the heart of City.",5,2022,02,26
135,Faultless,"We stayed here to celebrate our wedding anniversary as well as for a work trip the next day.  This hotel has so much character, great location, attentive staff and thoughtful touches such as the complimentary glasses of champagne to celebrate.  Our room was small but perfectly formed, we loved the quirky books and the heated mirror was a great touch in the bathroom!",5,2022,02,24
135,What. A. Place!,I don’t often leave reviews but V&M is a special hotel! Right from arrival the service was first class. Staff were brilliant. The room was beautiful! You guy should be proud running such a great establishment. I would advise anyone to stay here if possible!,5,2022,02,22
135,A beautiful looking hotel,"Lovely hotel tucked away on a narrow cobbled street. The staff were lovely and the location is great but it’s the look and feel of the place that are the real star. Wonderful attention to detail in the rooms. Everything is very plush, with blues, greens and golds. Nice change to a lot of generic looking hotel rooms. 
",5,2022,02,21
135,Lovely little hidden gem!,"This was our second stay in this lovely hotel. It's in a perfect central spot for sightseeing-literally a stone's throwaway from St Paul's, yet it's so quiet
and tucked away. The staff are so freaking and welcoming. They made our 9year old son feel very welcome.
We will definitely be staying here in future. Thank you!",5,2022,02,21

135,Fantastic 1 night stay,Special night in London for my sister’s birthday. Everything was perfect and staff couldn’t do enough. Very comfortable rooms. Roof top very nice with lovely views. Check in and out very organised. Ground floor bar excellent too,5,2022,02,18
135,Brilliant Stay,"This is a lovely hotel with friendly and welcoming service.

There was a mix up with my room and Katerina could not have been more helpful in sorting it.

The room (405) was on the small side but really comfortable and with a view of the Shard.  

Bedding, towels and all furniture are all to a really high standard.

We had cocktails in the cellar bar and they were delicious.  We didn’t eat here but the top floor restaurant looks great and the outdoor terrace would be wonderful in good weather.

Will definitely return to this hotel.",5,2022,02,18
135,Best Hotel in London,Everything was perfect from the moment I walked in to a warm welcome at reception to the beautiful room (which had everything I needed). The furnishings and cleanliness were really exceptional and I am sure I will be back!,5,2022,02,18

135,Quality,"A well presented and comfortable hotel. Excellent service, great food and very comfortable. The best night's sleep as uniquely quiet for a London hotel. Convenient location too, just 1 minute from Mansion House underground station. I will be back.",5,2022,02,14
135,Good Hotel with Smiling Service,"Rooms are very small (as other reviewers have said); we booked a superior as we like a walk in shower but both room and bathroom were very tiny.  That said, the decor is nice, there is enough clothes space for a couple for a few nights, the room was clean and the lighting is good.  We particularly like the night lighting setting which set the bathroom light on low instead of the blinding dazzle or pitch black that are the only options in many hotels.  We also liked that the wifi just worked and stayed working throughout our stay without us having to log in every five minutes.

Service was excellent and always with a smile

Location is particularly good for Borough Market and for St Pauls and is close enough to walk to a show in the evening.  Arriving by car is a little tricky as although it is down a very quiet side street, stopping outside means blocking the road, fine for couples where one can check in whilst the other goes and park the car.  As a side, we parked in the Barbican Car Park (the actual Barbican as opposed to the NCP one); although a bit of a walk back we would recommend this as it is reasonably secure and much cheaper (if booked ahead) over longer stays than elsewhere in the area

What really let the hotel down for us was the restaurant.  Starters were good but steaks were really not at all good.  My breakfast was luke-warm at best.  We would probably stay again but would think twice about eating in the hotel. If they can improve the food offerings this would be a gem inspite of room sizes.

",4,2022,02,13

135,Our new favourite London hotel!,"I think we've found our new favourite London hotel! Everything about our stay was perfect. Our (deluxe) bedroom was great, spacious and so quiet, which, combined with the comfortable big bed and pillows, made for a wonderful night's sleep. Lovely bathroom, toiletries, robes and slippers. Complimentary soft drinks and snacks too. All of the staff were friendly and attentive and the decor and ambiance of the hotel was just perfect. The hotel is very close to Mansion House and Cannon Street tube stations, so getting to and from there, and around London was extremely easy. Also a short walk to St. Paul's cathedral, Borough and Leadenhall Markets, and Southwark Bridge and the river. We had booked to stay there a while ago but, because of the pandemic, were forced to cancel, so we were very happy we made it this time. It certainly won't be our last visit.",5,2022,02,10
135,"Exceptional place to stay, from the moment you walk in the door you’re well looked after",One of the best hotels I’ve stayed at and you can see why it’s a 5 star hotel. It’s tucked away on a quiet street which gives that calm and peaceful experience which I was looking for. And from the moment we walked in the door we were well looked after. I had a couple of special requests and they were catered for by the lovely members of staff without any problems. We were also kindly offered a complimentary upgrade which gave us a view of the city which was lovely to wake up too! We had a browse around the rooftop bar and restaurant which looked lovely and the decor and attention to detail were on point but as we were heading out for the evening we didn’t get to try it out but would love to the next time we visit. The cocktails at the DnD bar were some of the best I’ve had and they have happy hour up until Saturday so it makes it even better! The quality of the breakfast was also lovely as well! Overall a really memorable experience with no detail left unturned! I can’t wait to come back again soon! ,5,2022,02,01

135,OneThird visit and Forth being planned!,"We have stayed here three times in the last 6 months and we are already planning a return. The staff are efficient, very helpful and friendly. A shoutout to Jude who has helped with our last two visits. Breakfast is very good with some great options. The basement bar is good fun. Very good barman who makes great cocktails. We find the location good even for the West End a healthy 30/40 minutes walk away and a quick taxi ride after a show. A favourite!",5,2022,01,27
135,Amazing Birthday weekend stay,"My partner booked us a stay for my birthday weekend in London and Vintry & Mercer made the stay that much more special!! The hotel itself was beautiful, clean and modern and the staff were so exceptionally welcoming and helpful.

The room itself was so spacious and the bed was amazing - I would certainly return back and thank you for making a birthday weekend that extra bit special!",5,2022,01,24
135,"Recommend, 100% would return","Me and my boyfriend stayed here for our anniversary and were both none the less impressed.
Very kind and helpful staff upon arrival and due to it being our anniversary we was offered a free glass of champagne at the roof top bar, which by the way had such an amazing view of the London skyline!
The interior of the hotel matches the staff in gracefulness, very modern and sleek design. The rooms came with buttons for underfloor bathroom heating, lights and much more. 
Our room was spot on for its cleanliness and the whole hotel seemed to be so too and not to mention the comfort of the bed.
Overall extremely happy with my stay here, especially with the staff efforts and would 100% return.",5,2022,01,23

Great location right near Bank and St. Pauls, lovely room, excellent staff and a wonderful rooftop terrace that was even usable in this cold weather thanks to the very good heaters.

Small characteristic hotel, plenty of charme, nicely refurbished, lovely roof terrace with igloo and atmosphere, bar and common spaces. Great food, great service both at reception and restaurant.

The rooftop bar was amazing and we found ourself sat up there for hours just enjoying the sunset over the city.

Location wise is okay, it is not right in the centre of everything but the tube station is literally 2 mins walk away which is ideal for getting anywhere in london.

It has a real luxury feel about it.",5,2022,01,08
135,Just perfect,"Stayed here a few times now and it’s consistently outstanding. Beautifully appointed bedrooms with some really special touches. The staff have a great eye for detail and really care about the guest. The food in both restaurants are delicious. Breakfast choice and location is lovely. The roof top garden is amazing and gives great views of the London outline, more so at night. Great location for St Paul’s, The Tower, The Globe and HMS Belfast, which are all within walking distance. Pop over to Bankside which is a 10 min walk over Southwark Bridge and get a day pass for the Thames Uber boat service and Royal Greenwich and the Cutty Sark are only 20 mins away via a very pleasant Thames cruse. This is definitely my new go to Hotel for London.",5,2022,01,06

135,New Year’s Eve getaway!,Stayed here for three nights from NYE. Had a fantastic time. All the staff are so friendly and can’t do enough for you. We was given two complimentary glasses of champagne with it being our wedding anniversary which was very kind of them. They also gave our daughter a rubber ducky and a little toiletries kit for her for the bath and shower. The little touches like the mini bath robe for our daughter was so cute. They have Apple TV so easy to stream anything to the tv if you have kids or just want to watch a film. The rooms are beautiful. The roof top terrace is brilliant and great views of the city. We didn’t try the food but the items on the menu looked delicious. The cocktails are amazing. It’s in a great part of the city with many tube links and sights near by. With it being over the holidays the area was nice and quiet which we liked. Being tourists it was nice to go to the busy parts of London like Covent Garden etc…. But then see it quiet down around our hotel. Not use to being round so many people. Thanks again to the staff. Will stay again on our next visit.,5,2022,01,03
135,Fantastic hotel,"A fantastic hotel in a lovely area of London, a couple minutes walk from Mansion House station. Bank and Liverpool St station are also within 10-15 min walking distance. Friendly service, plus the room was well thought out and modern, with all amenities in little labelled bags and extras you don’t normally get, even at 5 star hotels. I didn’t need them but you got the sense a lot of thought had been put in to the experience. Bed was 10/10. There was a selection of complimentary soft drinks and snacks in the mini bar - water, coke, Diet Coke, apple and orange juice, popcorn and biscuits. 

Sadly I had to rate down cleanliness as I did find a hair under the soap dish in the bathroom which I spotted when I was brushing my teeth. I can see why it was missed by cleaning staff and had I not moved the soap dish I wouldn’t have seen it either so bad luck on that one really.

Would definitely come back.",5,2022,01,02
135,Great hotel,"This is a lovely hotel, with quality rooms and a great location. There is an NCP car park just across the road, so if you are like guys and don't want to travel on the tube because of covid, then you can drive straight in and park 2 minutes away. If you do want a tube, then there is a station just up the road, along with St Pauls cathedral. It's a lovely oasis of a hotel, modern, clean well designed rooms.",5,2021,12,29
135,Gorgeous gem in the city,"Beautiful hotel in the city of London.  Just across the road from Southwark Bridge giving great access to the Southbank.  

We arrived early and was met by a lovely receptionist who was so warm and personable.  She is definitely a credit to the hotel.  Although we were really early she gave us  access to our room straight away.  We were upgraded which was a first for us and much appreciated.

The room was really well furnished.  It included great toiletries and amenities with soft drinks being included.  The bed was sooooo comfortable.

We did not get chance to experience the bars or restaurants but look forward to doing this next time.

We will definitely be returning and will be making this our hotel of choice when in the city.",5,2021,12,28
135,Excellent service,"Fist class service. Would vist again Christmas meal was excellent 
Rooms very clean. Breakfast was very nice
Bed very comfortable room quite had a better night sleep than at home. I could live there. Look forward to staying again.
",5,2021,12,28
135,Xmas getaway,"Lovely hotel located within 20 minute walk of Borough Market and The Shard, really nice chap on reception who couldn’t do enough for you. Room was really nice, comfortable and exceptionally clean. A must is the rooftop restaurant and bar with pods and covered eating “glass sheds”. We sat outside with localised gas heaters, they also provided blankets and sheepskin throws to keep you warm. Didn’t eat a meal but the food did look great ",5,2021,12,20
135,Homely and comfy,Brilliant hotel. You are made to feel so welcome the minute you walk through the door Greated with a big smile. Great place for all ages.  Room was spotless and the bed was super comfy. We had a brilliant time.,5,2021,12,20
135,Aimed at the instagram generation,"Pros:
- Great decor from the lobby area all the way through to the rooms.  They are well thought out and of a consistent high quality
- Cleanliness - I could not fault the hotel at all on this, the rooms and hallways were to a very high standard throughout
Comfort - the beds were great and there was no noise or anything which meant that we had a great night sleep.
- Breakfast variety was interesting! We got some little items in the room like a popcorn advent calendar which were well received by our daughter. 

Cons
- The only detracting factor is that the hotel lacks a bit of soul.  It is more of an adults hotel rather than one for families.  The reason I say this is because of little things that seem to be missing from the stay from the staff.  For example, at breakfast - if there is a family with a young child it is really appreciated if their order is processed quickly.  The manager who arrived at the reception desk on the day we left was very kind though - so I think this is more of a training exercise and something that can improve over time. 
- Location wise, it is a little further east of the city - so suits those around Bank looking for bars etc rather than the sights which are mainly toward the west of the city. ",4,2021,12,20
135,Impeccable quality,"For a hotel that as been around for only a short time I was so impressed with they’re organization. The staff were super attentive, polite and friendly. The hotel is gorgeous and a unique little gem. Next time I’m in London this is the only hotel I would want to stay. Thank you for a wonderful stay.",5,2021,12,19
135,Unfortunately mixed,"As they say ‘a game of two halves’. The room was excellent and if your budget permits it, stay in a Suite  but I imagine that at full price some may still regard it as quite small. The service to make the booking was also excellent, helpful and courteous as you would expect.  It was a special occasion and so we decided to eat in the roof top restaurant outside which again was very pleasant but the food was very average for the price and very underwhelming. The monkfish was slightly under done and fairly plain. My partner had the chicken, again which was average but she felt sick after eating it. We made a quick exit back to the room as she wasn’t feeling well.  As it was a special occasion the booking offered complimentary champagne again which we thought was a nice touch, but couldn’t take it as we had to rush back to the room!  I told the staff what happened when I went to pay for the bill in the morning and nothing but a polite smile!

My advice to anyone staying here is have a drink on the roof by all means it’s a lovely environment for that but definitely eat elsewhere.

Unfortunately, our special occasion was somewhat ruined by the average food and the affect of it on my partner.  For the price I would have expected much more refinement and customer service that actually listened rather than a polite smile.

Snatching defeat from the jaws of victory!",3,2021,12,19
135,A wonderful stay in London,"Worth spending a little more as you get so much more than the hotels that are just a room... Central location near to a tube stop, £8 black cab to covent garden. Rooftop bar where you can sit outside with heaters. 15min walk to the shard. Basement bar on a 1920's theme. Lovely staff and beautiful, comfortable beds with powerful showers and well dressed rooms. We really did have a wonderful time. I felt for what we paid we got a lot for our money in terms of location, venue and staff. Highly recommend you try next time you are in London. ",5,2021,12,19
135,Great stay,"One night stay whilst on business. Walking distance from Bank underground. Good size room, very clean and free soft drinks. Reasonable size bathroom with usual facilities (shower not overly powerful but fit for purpose). Friendly staff. Didn't eat or drink as private functions had taken over the restaurant and bar.",5,2021,12,17
135,Short stay,"Super fast check in and check out.
Staff brought iron a board to my room in a few minutes of asking. 
Saff happy to give directions. 
Cocktail bar looks cool, but a Christmas function was being held.
Room very clean, comfortable and modern.",5,2021,12,17
135,Great Stay,"The hotel is in a great location for this side of London, close to tubes and cabs to get around. The hotels is excellent in amenities and the views from the balcony suites to the shard are fantastic day or night. We would highly recommend and look forward to our next trip. Its great hotel, well worth a stay!",5,2021,12,13
135,The Staff is phenomenal,"The Hotel itself is really good - quite small but this is what we wanted to have. But what you definitely have to say is the Staff makes the hotel so special. Everyone in this team always have a smile on their face - ready to help no matter what it is. 

We enjoyed our honeymoon here and it was the best decision - we will definitely come back",5,2021,12,13
135,FABULOUS HOTEL,"Stayed here for just one night to attend a dinner.  Great location, minutes from the tube station. Staff extremely friendly and hotel was clean and very comfortable,  Roof top bar was amazing - great views, warm pods to use, blankets etc.",5,2021,12,13
135,Love this place. Feels like home.,We came here for a weekend away to connect while my mom looked after our little people. It was bliss. Food amazing. Bed so comfortable! Decor so welcoming and homely. I love staying here and highligly recommend the rooftop huts!,5,2021,12,13
135,Third visit in a month,"Third visit in a month which says it all. Great staff, good 7th floor roof-top restaurant and late-night basement bar with great music. Really good location for city events, 200 yds from Mansion House tube, 600 yds from Bank tube, 300 yds from excellent parking.",5,2021,12,09
135,Great at everything,This is an amazing hotel with brilliant staff. Stopped multiple times through this year including through the later stages of lockdown and always made to feel that you matter. Now hotel is opened fully up can experience all has to offer. Don’t miss the mercer or dnd for some late night drinks. Enjoy like we have done ,5,2021,12,08
135,Wondeful couple stay,Amazing cocktail bar in the basement! Staff super friendly and bed so comfortable! Would love to stay for another night - food in restaurant also wonderful. Perfect anniversary stay. Thank you so much,5,2021,12,07
135,Perfect in every way,"Stayed in a deluxe room which was exceptional. Cleaned to the highest standard, great facilities and the bed is soooo comfy. (I forgot but actually intended to ask the staff where the pillows were purchased as they were amazing)

Food was a delight and inexpensive, the views from the terrace overlooking the skyline are great.

The main Selling point of the hotel though is the staff. Each and every staff member was amazing. Professional, personable, helpful and always going that extra mile.

We will be returning",5,2021,12,07
135,London Pre Christmas family weekend,"A combination of outstanding service, quiet location and great friendly welcoming service. The hotel is beautifully designed & furnished throughout to the highest standard. Great location what London has on offer, both south & north of the Thames ",5,2021,12,06
135,Beware of fully see through bathroom door,"Overall good hotel though tiny room and a fully see through bathroom door with the toilet right in front of it. Who in their right mind designed this? I wouldn't even have booked this as a couple. That aside, the room was clean (though tiny even by London standards), location is very good (about 100m from Mansion House tube station) and the staff were friendly and welcoming. ",4,2021,12,05
135,Staff who go the extra mile,"Wonderfully designed hotel in a brilliant location, such comfortable beds and staff who absolutely go above and beyond. I ordered deliveroo and they not only brought it to me but brought me cutlery! Super special service. ",5,2021,12,04
135,Great area to explore the old and the new London,"Great find in this new hotel around St Pauls area. Really interesting part of London to explore as old London meets the new. Across the bridge from Tate Modern, Southbank. A new hotel with personality! Interesting, stylish interior with a great lower ground speakeasy style bar and lovely rooftop restaurant. 
Have stayed here a couple times and always impressed with service and hospitality.",5,2021,12,04
135,City stay,"Fabulous interiors, welcoming and helpful staff. The cocktails were amazing as was the food. The roof bar is so pretty with fairy lights and we had a gorgeous city scene sunset. We would all visit again.",4,2021,12,04
135,Wonderful room,"What a welcome when you enter V&M
The staff are wonderful & our suite was beautiful, spotless, lovely decor & the bed is one of the most comfortable I have ever slept it, we didn’t want to get up. 

Lovely rooftop bar.. 
would definitely recommend this hotel",5,2021,12,04
135,"Seriously impressive, immaculate and incredible","I couldn’t fault the Vintry and Mercer at all. I usually stay very near the Covent Garden/Soho area so this was new but I loved it. Not only was the hotel absolutely BEAUTIFUL, and the service was incredible and everyone was so kind and welcoming, I was impressed with the attention to detail. My room itself was standard but it was gorgeous considering that. It had everything I could possibly need and more - even things I wouldn’t really expect but you can tell how much thought was put into the guest experience here! From amenities you’d find in more hotels presented nicer, to more niche things which would be so helpful in an emergency… it ensures a seamless stay. Oh, and it was absolutely beautiful and you can tell nothing was left out. I loved it and will definitely pick this hotel again.",5,2021,12,01
135,"stylish hidden gem tucked behind the Mansion House tube station - perfect for a City break, weekend away","If you struggle to get affordable rooms in other five star properties near Bank/Tower Hill, just walk for 5 minutes and you will have amazing time in this gorgeous boutique hotel.  They had some great offers around Black Friday and Cyber Monday",5,2021,11,29
135,"Beautiful hotel, but disappointing room - standard rooms are too small","The room was literally a box and too small for 2 people to comfortably move around. No space to put anything. Also bathroom was too small and toilet too close to the bed. Door is see through so felt a bit awkward when having to do ‘private business’. Also shower door opened outwards which meant matt got pushed away and water just runs out onto the bathroom floor. Shower cubicle also smelled of tobacco, not nice! We asked for a nice room since it was our 10th anniversary and we were put overlooking an atrium, which we got woken up twice by people chatting late at night. Also pillows, we had 1 too firm and tall and the other too soft. Had an awful night sleep and neck ache as a result. Ordered breakfast in the room, and was overdone. Bacon was literally charred and hash were too dry. Overall we didn’t feel the price reflected what we received. Have stayed in much more comfortable rooms for less. That room would be ok for a single traveller, not a couple. Wished we would have been told about that and offered an upgrade. It would have made such a difference to our experience. The room let us down i’m afraid. Wouldn’t book that room again based on this experience.",3,2021,11,29
135,Top Hotel,"A really beautiful hotel, beautiful styish room, spotlessly clean. Friendly staff andoverall excellent stay. Great location also for the southbank and St Pauls area of london. We will definitely return.",5,2021,11,29
135,Great location,"Great location, staff were very polite and check in was easy and quick. Car park was only a few minutes walk and the bedrooms were extremely clean and a good size the bed was really comfy for the price the breakfast could be included. ",4,2021,11,29
135,Saturday night (1 night) stay,"Pricey but lovely; We would stay here again!

Quiet location, great for walking to the likes of Borough Market, The City and St Pauls.

Lovely opulent rooms, cool roof top bar/restaurant and snazzy basement cocktail bar.

If you are looking to treat yourselves.. then this is a good option.

Thanks guys for a lovely stay  :-)",5,2021,11,28
135,Poor value for money,Tiny room for £240.00. Had to shuffle round each other to navigate the room. One dining chair for two guests. Beautiful decor but overpriced. Better value available elsewhere in London.  Example; I didn't measure but at a guess I'd say there was maybe 50cm around each side of the bed. Looked good but it was cramped very poor for £240.00.,1,2021,11,28
135,The best place for a special day,"We wanted a special place to celebrate our 10th anniversary and we certainly found it. Everyone was so welcoming, caring and professional. The room was stylish and very clean. We had a dinner at the Roof Top Restaurant and the food was so delicious, full of flavours. We went to the DND bar also and the cocktails as well as the staff were just amazing. We're definitely staying here again next time we go to London! Highly recommended!",5,2021,11,26
135,Disappointing and cramped,"THE GOOD: The hotel is beautifully designed and spotlessly clean. The location is great and relatively quiet, while still central. If you’re happy to explore and be out for most of the day, you’ll love the transportation options nearby. Check-in was quick and easy. 

THE BAD: I checked in on a Saturday afternoon, and the receptionist asked me if it was my first time, which I confirmed it was. Generally I find that first stays are better than those subsequent. They get you to love it and leave a positive first impression so you’ll be a return guest. After checking in, I was escorted to my room and given an overview. When we stepped out of the lift and my room was right there, I was nervous it would be too noisy, but didn’t say anything (my own fault). Thankfully I can sleep through almost anything, but being near the lift and housekeeping space meant the noise in the morning was loud. Lots of scraping sounds and the lift dinging frequently. Once I got into the room I was shocked by how small it was. I couldn’t even open my suitcase without it hitting the walls, and despite there being a mini luggage rack, it was still too big for the room and therefore unusable. So I was forced to put my luggage on the bed to unpack. I live in NYC so I’m used to small spaces, but this was insanely small. I travelled solo, but cannot imagine a couple staying in this room. Being more than arm’s distance from each other would be honestly impossible. No exaggeration. I then opened the curtains only to see that it was about 3 meters from the office next door, specifically the break room, so it had blaring fluorescent lights all night, and people able to stare directly into the room all day. I had no choice but to keep the blinds closed my entire 5 night stay. Had I left them open, I would have had the pleasure of staring into the vending machine, or watching somebody work on their laptop. It was claustrophobic, to say the least. I was exhausted from travel and needing to meet up with friends, so I reluctantly unpacked and headed out. There is also almost zero drawer space. Two super shallow drawers that I made work, but again, it was just me. A couple could have never put their things away, and using your suitcase on the luggage rack would have meant blocking the space to the  bathroom and door. I wasn’t interested in moving my suitcase every time I wanted to use the bathroom or leave, so I had to get creative with storing my things. Had I had more time I would have gone back down and seen if a room swap was possible. First impressions are lasting, so I doubt I’ll stay here again or recommend it to friends. 

BOTTOM LINE: I won’t stay again. The trendy design isn’t worth the utter lack of space, and I cannot understand why they’d give a first time guest staying 5 nights the worst possible view, with no option for natural light, and right next to the lifts. It was so bad I actually wondered if I had done something rude to deserve such a slap in the face.",3,2021,11,25
135,A truly unforgettable visit with excellent service.,"The service was excellent from the check in to check out everything was perfect we look forward to seeing you again soon.

I also cannot thank the V&M team enough for the help and continued communication prior to our stay.

An excellent location with great transport links to all parts of the city and a stone throw from St. Paul’s.",5,2021,11,23
135,London Weekend.,"Lovely Hotel. Great location. Just one issue with the room, no privacy due to the glass door to the toilet and shower. Staff very friendly and professional. Amazing roof top terrace Would highly recommend.",5,2021,11,23
135,Great stay with friends,"Lovely hotel in a fabulous location with stunning views of classic London. Staff at reception were very attentive. 
Only negative would be that rooms were very ‘cozy’ on the small side. 
DND bar staff were great and the rooftop terrace has a stunning view. ",5,2021,11,23
135,Perfect,"The hotel is just gorgeous. Beautiful reception, bar and lobby and some of the friendliest, most relaxed staff I've ever had the pleasure to meet. The rooms are impeccably decorated and spotlessly clean with a very comfortable bed resulting in a great night's sleep. Our first stay but definitely not our last. Loved it",5,2021,11,22
135,Lovely hotel,We had an enjoyable stay here pre Covid and were keen to revisit. It's a fairly small boutique hotel in a great location (very quiet) close to Mansion House tube which makes is very accessible to many parts of London. Our room was very comfortable and we enjoyed the roof terrace restaurant and DND bar.,5,2021,11,21
135,Night in London,The hotel and experience from the staff was flawless from start to finish. Jude and the reception team were so welcoming and helpful and nothing was too much trouble. We were celebrating our 10 year anniversary and the little extra touches they offered us made us feel so special and valued. The complimentary drinks and snacks in the room are a lovely touch. We are in the rooftop terrace and not only was the food outstanding but again the staff went above and beyond. The cocktails in the downstairs bar were also delicious.We have never stayed at a Vintry & Mercer hotel before but this certainly won’t be our last visit,5,2021,11,21
135,Wonderful ‘boutique’ hotel,"We had an amazing stay right from when we pulled up outside. All of the staff went out of their way and were super attentive.
Room was clean and the bed was super comfortable. 
Will recommend to all family and friends .",5,2021,11,21
135,Fab hotel,"Vintry and Mercer is a fab hotel! Gorgeous rooms and the most comfortable bed! We stayed in one of the deluxe rooms there is a lovely rooftop bar, friendly and professional staff and a great location. We ate breakfast too and that was delicious, ",5,2021,11,20
135,Very nice Hotel in the center of London City,"I would not consider this hotel as a 5-star Hotel but as a very good 4-star Hotel. The price was fair and the Hotel is well maintained and has a nice ambience. Everything worked fine and the furnitures are nice. The hotel service was good, everything was clean. On this central spot you will find not many other hotels for this price.",5,2021,11,18
135,Brilliant,Service was above and beyond. Dimitri at the front desk was very accommodating and made us feel so welcome. The rooms are stunning as well and have all the features you could want - as well as a large and very nicely designed bathroom. You won’t be disappointed!,5,2021,11,18
135,A hidden gem,What a wonderful hotel and a real gem for anyone seeking that all-too-elusive boutique hotel in a central London location. From the minute we set foot in the hotel we were treated to a fabulous experience characterised by a universally warm welcome and terrific customer service. It is rare to find such a beautifully designed and personal-touch hotel in London. Bravo  to the whole team. We'll be back!,5,2021,11,16
135,Lovely Hotel,"Really enjoyed our night here. Attentive staff and a lovely property.
I think it’s a new hotel so, so far so good. Lovely breakfast with room service too.
Great cocktail bar too.
Would recommend for couples.",5,2021,11,15
135,Family Reunion at Vintry & Mercer,Lovely hotel tucked away in the City of London.  A great location for exploring the city and the Southbank which is in easy walking distance.  The rooms were really clean and comfortable.  All staff were really friendly and helpful - nothing was too much trouble for the team to make our stay pleasant.  The cocktails in the bar were great; breakfast was also very good.  Highly recommended.,5,2021,11,15
135,Good find,"Stayed for Saturday night on trip to London and though it was an excellent Hotel, the decor gave it a really sharp modern look as well as giving it a little touch of class and the feel and vibe when you walk in gives it a really good feeling.
The room we had was very pleasant and gave us all the space we needed for the day / night. The roof top terrace was really well done and the basement bar really was a touch of class with a fantastic atmosphere while we were there
The staff were all very helpful and would definitely stay here again",5,2021,11,15
135,ok,"nice enough 200ncharacters wtf but then reviews are   well reviews wtf again min chars lots of dots................
and more dots.

All staff very polite and friendly deserve a pay rise. Don't like the ""optional"" service charge -dal breaker for future - maybe

135,One night in the city!,"Fantastic boutique hotel nestled within the cobbled streets of the city.  exceptional service; Jude and Patricia were extremely helpful and went above and beyond to ensure we had an enjoyable stay.  
We’ll definitely be staying here again.
Thank you",5,2021,11,12
135,"Great, friendly hotel with good food and service / facilities","I rarely leave a review for hotels. They tend to be all rather the “same” but this little hotel in the heart of London is definitely one I will stay at again. Friendly staff, great facilities and nice rooms. Very clean. Well laid out rooms; the gym was small but only me using it with dumbbells, multi gym, running/ cycling / rowing and x-trainer machines.",5,2021,11,12
135,Great stay within easy range of Ivy Asia,"loved the roof terrace bar with it's cute little domes and sheds and awesome views of St Paul's & the Shard etc (especially at night), classy rooms and friendly staff. Short walk to the amazing Ivy Asia. Shame the pubs were shut on Sunday. Superb full English breakfast (altho' was an extra).",5,2021,11,09
135,Great Hotel,"Clean, tidy, lovely welcoming and friendly staff.  Beautiful room with gorgeous snuggly bed.  The cabin meal for four of us was a delight with great food and a unique atmosphere.  Would recommend to anyone.",5,2021,11,07
135,Beautiful hotel in the city,"Clean rooms, brand new, and close to transport. The hotel had great amenities including a cool bar and decked out gym. The bed was comfortable, the room was quiet, temperature control with heated bathroom floors was a nice perk. Highly recommend!",4,2021,11,07
135,Great central location,"Beautiful hotel, not even a 2 minute walk from the tube station. Beautiful room. Check in was faultless as was checkout. I visited the DND bar which served beautiful cocktails. I also used room service for good and drink which was swift and delicious. Definitely stay again",5,2021,11,04
135,Fantastic hotel and location,"This is an ideal spot to explore the city of London itself. Firstly, the hotel is superb with the roof terrace and the speakeasy bar both worth visiting - the latter for the clear espresso martini alone! The Team working here are all fantastic as well. But the location is brilliant - short walk to the river which opens up a wealth of options. But within a 15 minute walk of the hotel you have St Pauls, The Walkie Talkie, Borough Market and all the amazing food and drink opportunities, plus numerous riverside options like the Tate Modern, South Bank etc. If you're into your beer, the Bermondsey Beer mile is a 20 minute walk and will give you some of the best breweries and tap rooms from the area and the wider UK. ",5,2021,11,02
135,Exceptional,What an exceptional stay me and my partner had at this hotel.From the moment we arrived the staff couldn't have done any more to make us feel more welcome and this remained throughout our stay.The breakfast was exceptional and you must try the cocktails in the Do not disturb bar ,5,2021,11,01
135,Must stay here!,Beautiful clean hotel! So cosy yet spacious! The rooftop terrace is just gorgeous with an exquisite and delicious menu! Customer service was so effortlessly efficient! Must visit! Cant wait to return. ,5,2021,11,01
135,Another fabulous stay!,"Another fabulous stay at the Vintry and Mercer. The staff are so friendly, 5 star sometimes means kids are not welcome, but here my son was made to feel just as important as we were. They even left a child’s dressing gown in the room for him which he was delighted with! Beds are so comfortable, rooms are immaculate and location just perfect. Nice touch to have free soft drinks in the room. Bar downstairs is lovely - cocktails are excellent. We wouldn’t stay anywhere else now. See you next time! ",5,2021,11,01
135,Lovely boutique hotel,"My husband and I stayed here for his birthday for 3 nights. We had booked the studio suite. The hotel is modern with nice décor and situated near the station with good restaurants nearby. The hotel front desk were extremely friendly and helpful. The room was very clean and comfortable. We had the corner studio suit which had a good sized bathroom with a separate bath tub and shower, and our own sinks for the both of us. The bed was large and very comfortable. There was a seating area in our room with a coffee table and tea/coffee making area. The fridge is stocked up with complimentary water and soft drinks. The blinds were controlled electronically which was a useful added perk. We noted that as this was a boutique hotel we weren't expecting the rooms to be very big (that's why we opted for a studio) but we appreciate how well the hotel utilised the space for a smaller hotel room, we never felt cramped or needing more space. Room service was good with varied options and convenient if you just want to be tucked away in your room. The hotel has its own rooftop restaurant, basement bar and gym.

In summary, this hotel was definitely 5/5. Very clean, modern, comfortable and friendly!",5,2021,10,31
135,Medical scan,"Hotel is excellent  in every aspect particularly girl with dark hair serving breakfast so friendly.Cleanliness is superb, every aspect of service is wonderful and wouldn’t stay while in London anywhere else!!",5,2021,10,31
135,4 Nights in the City..... Just not long enough!,"I picked this hotel last minute for a work trip. It had great reviews and was in the right location. From the minute you walk in this is a very high-end hotel, beautiful but understated entrance, led to the reception where I was greeted by Jude. I had a few requests and needed help, and nothing was too much trouble, Jude went seriously over and above to make the logistics of my stay here at this hotel work. I got to the room which was beautiful the web site pictures do not do this place justice as good as they are. I managed a drink at the Do not disturb bar which is well worth a visit with 2 for 1 cocktail offers, and one later in my stay at the roof terrace bar. To wrap this up every member of staff said hello with a smile, the ones I had chance to talk to, were an absolute delight and a credit to this hotel. 100% I will return Thank you so much team for making my stay so pleasant.",5,2021,10,30
135,Superb place to stay!,"Great place to stay. Lovely premises and staff are really friendly and professional and attentive. Would most definitely recommend whether traveling for business or pleasure. Rooms are lovely too and have everything you need, with nice little touches.",5,2021,10,29
135,Great service,"The staff at this hotel cannot do enough for you. We would stay again just for the impeccable service. 
The room was a bit dark and pokey and the bed had a very hard mattress which I found very uncomfortable. The amazing breakfast made up for it!",4,2021,10,29
135,"Fabulous hotel, great location","Really great hotel right in the heart of the city. Some gorgeous design details, well thought out and designed bedrooms and by far one of the most comfortable hotel beds I have ever slept in. Could not fault this place at all. ",5,2021,10,29
135,Fabulous stay at Vintry & Mercer,"Friendly but professional staff who without exception went the extra mile to make our stay/drink/meal special. The rooms are beautifully decorated and furnished, bright rather than dark with good lighting, comfortable and serene. We were given an upgrade to a studio suite as our stay was my present to my husband for his birthday. We had a fabulous wall of windows and a generous balcony (with table and chairs) looking across to the Shard one way and the Sea Containers Building and the Oxo Tower the other way. Great views from the rooftop restaurant where we very much enjoyed lunch before we headed home. DND, the speakeasy style bar in the basement was a treat at the start of the evening (along with the complimentary glass of champagne for my husband’s birthday) and again when we returned at the end of the evening for a nightcap cocktail. We were made to feel welcomed and special everywhere by everyone. We loved it and very much look forward to returning.",5,2021,10,27
135,Perfection at every turn,"What a wonderful hotel. Great staff, competent room service (without crazy tray charges) makes it justifiable to do things like have breakfast in the room, bedrooms beautifully set out making them great for sleep as well as work, characterful cocktail bar in the basement, great staff at reception. Really nothing to fault at all. The bathroom even came complete with a rubber duck!

This place won on every count for me and for the many hoteliers who haven’t got a clue offers a masterclass in how it should be done.",5,2021,10,26
135,Excellent,"The hotel was lovely, clean and modern. The staff were very friendly and nothing was too much trouble. One of the nicest hotels I’ve stayed in and I only had the basic room. Look forward to staying again and hopefully will upgrade to see what the other rooms are like as the basic room was smaller but not a disappointment.",5,2021,10,26
135,What an amazing find!,"Tucked away in a quiet street in the City one of the Greatest Small Hotels of the World.

135,Hidden gem,"What an amazing place! We have never been made to feel so welcome somewhere. The attention too detail, staff, cleanliness, food was all 5star. The roof terrace is fabulous for a nightcap. Will certainly be returning ",5,2021,10,26
135,Stylish comfortable hotel,"Fabulous service from the moment we arrived.  Immaculate room with lovely decor, in the style of the Ampersand but with it’s own character.  Comfortable bed and silent room.  Lovely roof top bar. Would definitely stay again. Thank you.",5,2021,10,26
135,Birthday visit,"Family of 6 stay in two rooms for daughter’s birthday. Hotel, service, food all excellent. 10/10. Hard to find fault. Fantastic dinner on the rooftop with very good service, great breakfast, room quality and layout plus the small details: top quality toiletries and complimentary soft mini bar plus small robes for the children. Interconnecting deluxe rooms worked brilliantly, competitively priced given four figures quotes elsewhere. Most of all the staff couldn’t be more helpful or pleasant. Old school service in a modern well decorated hotel with A1 location. Congrats V&M we will certainly be back.",5,2021,10,25
135,Amaziong hotel and staff,"I cannot reccomend this hotel enough. From the second we walked into reception till the moment we left, the staff were so nice and helpfull. Nothing was too much trouble. Cannot wait to return here on our next visit to London",5,2021,10,25
135,Excellent hotel in a great location,"My husband and I stayed for 3 nights in a superior room - everything was immaculate, beautiful decor, very large comfortable bed.  Nothing was too much trouble from when we arrived to when we left - the reception staff were excellent and very friendly, the breakfast was delicious and Mirella who served us every morning was so kind and helpful and nothing was too much trouble - great service.  We ate at the rooftop restaurant - amazing views of the city including St Paul's and The Shard - we were in a 'greenhouse' for 4 people - absolutely wonderful - heated area with warm rugs to sit on - there were two igloo's accommodating up to 8 or 9 people which looked fantastic too.  The location of the hotel is quiet but very central, with Mansion House tube station literally on the same road within 2 minutes walk.  We will definitely return - very soon hopefully!",5,2021,10,25
135,A stay with bestie,"My friend and I visited as a birthday treat, its very hard for us both to coordinate the time away. We were met and welcomed by Dimitri who is a credit to the hotel, other staff were also very polite, professional and welcoming. The area has some very nice bistros and bars etc and walking to places was easy as everything we needed to see and do was close by. A great stay, great hotel, and great staff. The only comment I would add is that more biscuits in the room would be nice. The hospitality industry has suffered immensely and after such horrible times its great knowing that our stay helped. Fantastic staff, cleanliness and all round experience, the slightly lower score on value and location was due to everything can always be slightly cheaper especially cocktails, the location was confusing with google maps. Good luck to the Vintry and Mercer for the future you deserve to be back.x",5,2021,10,23

135,The staff make this hotel what it is,"The hotel is within easy reach of several tube stations, which made getting around very easy.  We stayed at the hotel with our boys, and from the minute we arrived, they were fussed and looked after. Nothing was too much trouble, and I appreciated the level of care we received.  The hotel itself has everything you need, it’s very comfortable, and has quite possibly the best bed I’ve ever slept in.  Breakfast is worth stopping for, it was good value for money. 
The roof top terrace is worth a visit, great cocktails and views to die for.   I am already counting down to when we can stay again.",5,2021,10,22
135,Amazing hotel - friendly staff,"Amazing Hotel with super friend and flexible staff. I would recommend a stay here when in London.

This will be a regular hotel for me",5,2021,10,16
135,Appalling,Do not stay here under any circumstances. They took my payment twice and refused to refund. They refused to escalate my concerns to senior management and acted with complete incompetence. Staff were unsympathetic and unhelpful,1,2021,10,16

135,Faultess,"Couldn't have asked for a better experience - amazing staff, welcoming and professional. Great location for the city with a relaxing, understated luxury chilled vibe. Perfect room, with quality fixtures and fittings and aircon that works like everything else here - silently and efficiently. Great food, sunset terrace and cocktails, and proper, fresh breakfast.

135,PERFECT!,"We recently stayed at Vintry & Mercer after having to reschedule our stay due to covid this summer. Vincenzo was exceptional and assisted with the changes to our booking as this was a special memory making trip with friends. We are incredibly grateful for the excellent customer service. 

Our room was stunning and we absolutely loved the roof top terrace. Awesome views and great cocktails and food. The free soft drinks and snacks in the minibar were a real treat and the bed was the comfiest we’ve ever slept in. 

Special shout out to reception team Katerina and Jud for all their assistance during our stay! We hope to return very soon!",5,2021,10,12
135,"A short stay in a clean, well-located central London hotel","I stayed with my partner overnight because, although I live in South London, we didn't want a late journey home.
The hotel is small, friendly and has a boutique atmosphere.
Accommodation is clean and comfortable.
Bathing facilities were excellent.
In short, no complaints at this price-point.",4,2021,10,11
135,Well worth a visit !!,This is a lovely boutique hotel located near St Paul's which is well worth a visit.  The rooftop bar is a bonus when the weather is good and the late bar DND had a great atmosphere during the time we spent there.  Stall were generally very attentive.,4,2021,10,11

Ten out of ten",5,2021,10,10

135,Birthday Treat,"Not your run of the mill hotel; it has so many quirky features. It’s opulent without feeling pretentious and the excellent staff were both professional and friendly. They couldn’t do enough for us. 

It was my birthday and the young lady on reception made me feel very special. We had a room upgrade and complimentary champagne, plus she even knocked on our room door a little later with some caramel shortbread. She went above and beyond to ensure our stay was a fabulous experience. Our suite was beautiful and immaculately clean. Both the rooftop and DND staff were very attentive and friendly too. It’s a great city location. Couldn’t fault our stay. Can’t wait to come back again! Highly recommend. ",5,2021,10,09
135,Fantastic hotel,"My partner, i and our 7 month old son checked into this hotel as we are waiting for our house to be completed and my partner is working round the corner. It was a great price compared to others and rated 5* but had our reservations as this was not a hotel I have heard of before being very familiar with the city for work. 
I must say a complete gem! A welcoming reception team and a lovely fresh smell every day when you walk in.
Rooms cleaned to the highest standard. Even with the cot they put up in the room for my son they included a lovely blanket, bumper and a baby wash gift set. A really lovely touch. 
The breakfast is lovely and food is great on the top floor restaurant too. 
Love this hotel. I am usually so picky but couldn’t find fault. Was supposed only here for 2 nights already here 4 and don’t want to leave. It’s really great and recommend it to all! Thanks to the team for being so nice to us and always being so friendly with my baby boy !!!!",5,2021,10,07
135,Weekend break,"Thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the vintry and mercer. The front reception staff were very welcoming, friendly and helpful. The decor is amazing, good size room only negative is my husband is 6ft 4 and struggled to use the shower in the bathroom as he couldn’t fit underneath it. But otherwise a very pleasant stay. For the price it would be nice to have breakfast included ",5,2021,10,06
135,Excellent hotel,Stayed at the Vintry & Mercer for 1 night to celebrate our wedding anniversary and couldn’t have been more impressed with the hotel or the service.

135,Anniversary weekend,"Hotel in the main good, Very clean, but needs to pay more care with small details, Ordered bottle of champagne to be in room on day of arrival, had to chase it up when it had not arrived. Tissues in bathroom only thee in box and of poor quality. Did not expect this in a superior room in a 5 star. 
 Food was very good and looked after very well by staff  in the hotel. We feel our rating is a very good 4 star from our past experience of 5 star. that little sparkle missing.  ",4,2021,10,05
135,100% satisfaction,"Have visited London a lot and this place was far and beyond other places I’ve stayed. I look forward to staying here again!
Best sleep I’ve had in a hotel in a really long time. The hotel is steps from the subway and in a great part of town.",5,2021,10,04
135,Top quality hotel,"Wonderful hotel with polite and friendly reception staff who could not have been more accommodating. Food in the roof top restaurant was delicious…it’s a shame it was raining as the outside area I’m sure on a sunny day would have been a delight! We enjoyed our cocktails in DNB which had an old fashioned feel to it. 
Nice touches in the stylish rooms (we stayed in a superior room) such as robes, slippers & complimentary soft drinks to name but a few. The standard of everything was extremely high and I would definitely stay again.",5,2021,10,04
135,Premium Quality,"One of the better boutique hotels I have stayed  at in London that is friendly to the business traveler as well as stylish. Especially enjoyed the good and efficient breakfast, stellar rooftop as well as reasonably sized room and comfy bed. Good staff too. ",5,2021,10,04

nice touch. Great location for exploring the City right near Mansion House tube.",5,2021,10,03
135,Definitely going back!,"From the beautiful reception and warm welcome, to the rooftop bar, and basement lounge - this is a classy venue. Our room was very stylish and comfortable. Perfectly situated between the river and the buzz of the city ",5,2021,10,03
135,Nice Hotel but not 5 stars,"I was extremely disappointed when I opened the room door, the size of the room was extremely small. We booked a standard room at the hotel and it was the smallest room I have ever stayed in. We probably should have upgraded the room but having stayed in hotels such as The Savoy, Sea Containers etc the standard rooms are all 5*. The view out of the window was an office block only a couple of metres away, so the already small room felt even more confined.
The room had weighing scales in the bathroom, as I stood on them and when they didn't work, it summed up the stay for me. It isn't an issue they don't work, but 5* hotels are about attention to detail. 
The staff were pleasant, the speakeasy style cocktail bar nice, our stay was enjoyable but not nothing to warrant a 5* rating. The Vintry is a nice boutique style hotel with a location a short walk from St Paul's and very close to Mansion House tube station. 
My honest review would be the Vintry is a 4 star hotel, having another London trip booked for the end of the month I am glad I booked a different 5* hotel for this trip. 
",3,2021,10,03
135,Best hotel in London,"My wife and I stayed here for two nights to celebrate her birthday. From the minute we walked in, the staff were incredible.

135,Disappointing,"The service we received was patchy , nice receptionist but they were unable to fulfill a simple request for birthday cake.The 'turn-down' service didn't happen and food quality in general was not good in the rooftop restaurant and room service.The cocktail bar was closed for a private event, which would be fine had we received advance notice - we had to cancel meeting friends there last minute which was annoying.",3,2021,09,28
135,Birthday weekend,"A beautiful to look at old but new hotel with excellent customer service, consistently given by all members of the staff.  Request are dealt with promptly and the roof terrace, lovely settings with good food. Definitely stay again ",5,2021,09,28

135,Wedding Anniversary. Even though we live in West London it’s nice to stay in the City and this Hotel is just superb !,"Just amazing staff, room and the hospitality and staff friendliness was second to none, in a small hotel such as this, your a Guest, a real Guest, not just another person. We only live 17 stations away yet felt we were worlds away.",5,2021,09,26
135,Chic gem with views on St Paul’s and The Shard,Cute stylish boutique hotel with view on St Paul’s. Superb value with lovely comfy beds and chic decor. Rooftop bar with incredible skyline views a convenient option for pre-dinner drinks. Friendly professional staff. Only a stone’s throw (5-10mins walk) from Ivy Asia and Borough Mkt - A hidden gem.,5,2021,09,26
135,Disappointed for the price,"Breakfast was very disappointing, it was cold and not the same as what was on the menu. We didn’t sleep at all due to the noise outside. The standard room for £300 was unbelievably small, very disappointed ",2,2021,09,26

135,A Great Stylish Find,"What a great find, you are sometimes overwhelmed with the number of good hotels to choose from in London. 

We stayed for 4 nights… 
Receptionist really made us welcome on arrive, sorry can’t   remember her name red curly hair. But lovely welcoming site, she took the time to explain the room and layout. Nearest tubes restaurant times, but in away that you didn’t feel like a tourist 

Our room, although a little small (Should of took the opportunity for an upgrade) however, clean, fresh, and great comfortable bed, all in all a great room.

Great location a 6-minute walk to the Bank underground statin (central line)  

The rooftop bar was cosy and comfortable, however, a slight downside I found the staff non engaging in any conversation or even a welcome. Although waiting staff did their job very well. Just no life in them they hardly spoke to each other, as if they really didn’t wish to be there.  I’m not saying for them to pull a chair up and join me. But a smile, a how are you today, explain the setup, no one asked whether we wished to east or not. Shame as they have a wonderful place to work at and should feel proud upon where they are working, as this place has the potential of being one of the go to hotels in London. “Well, that’s in my eyes” 

Breakfast was very good as where the staff, the young lady on our last day was just full of beans and made a great start to the day start. A huge contrast to the staff in the rooftop bar. 

Again, I love engagement when I go to new places, this place is stylish well run and in a great location whether business or pleasure would Highly recommend staying.  And back in November .",5,2021,09,24
135,Stylish and friendly hotel in the City,"Very smart and elegant hotel, well located for the city (5 mins walk from Bank tube station). Good views from 7th floor restaurant. Excellent team - really friendly and welcoming. I was lucky to get an upgrade (suspect vacancy rates still a challenge due to Covid) ",4,2021,09,24
135,"Absolutely wonderful. Friendly with personal touches, incredible decor/styling","We stayed for 1 night in room 205. Arrived at 10:30am expecting to drop off our bags but were really pleased to be told by Patricia that our room was ready so we could check in. She also offered us complementary drinks when she realised it was my husband’s birthday. Gorgeous room, lovely styling and decor. Bed was SO comfortable. 

We had drinks on the roof terrace before heading out for dinner. Great views and fab cocktails. We didn’t eat, but the food coming out looked great. We did go to the Do Not Disturb speakeasy bar late in the evening which was a great experience. Really cool cocktails. Again excellent friendly service. Breakfast was on the ground floor. Absolutely delicious, excellent service. 

Overall wonderful stay. Patricia was a complete delight, so friendly and welcoming. We will be back",5,2021,09,22

135,Wonderful oasis in London,Thank you to all the wonderful staff for making it a lovely visit.  The hotel is beautiful and I hope that we can go back again in the future. Sadly due to Covid some things weren’t possible (tapas restaurant) which could have been clearer on the website but it wouldn’t have stopped us going.,5,2021,09,20
135,Quiet for Central London,"I was in the hotel for 3 nights while on a business trip to the local area. The hotel is off the main road so pretty quiet for central London. The staff at reception were very friendly and attentive. Breakfast was a mixed experience for me. The full English on offer was not very good, in particular the sausage and home baked beans didn’t hit the spot for me but the sour dough toast and eggs were very nice. The room was a standard double, very comfortable with everything I need for my stay (including an umbrella). Would stay again",4,2021,09,19
135,Perfect,"I really can't fault it other than it is a little pricey - but you get what you pay for.  Service is excellent, rooms are beautifully furnished and the whole place feels like a little oasis of calm in the City. ",5,2021,09,17
135,Amazing hotel,"Very clean hotel, amazing and friendly personel. Well designed rooms with everything that you need while traveling. I am looking forward to to back there and experience more of London as well. Highly recommend this hotel!",5,2021,09,16
135,Anniversary stay made extra special,"This hotel is fabulous, the room was exquisite and individual. The staff were amazing especially Dimitri who went above and beyond-to make our stay memorable. We were celebrating our wedding anniversary and I was surprised with balloons and flowers on the bed. The bed was so comfortable. we ordered room service twice and the food was presented beautifully and was delicious. We will definitely stay again.",5,2021,09,14
135,"A good, but not great, stay","The hotel was a bit tricky to find and is on a very narrow lane. There is no onsite parking, but there is an NCP car park a short way away.

There was no doorman and I had to ask for help carrying our bags to our room. I think the hotel, like many other hospitality businesses, was short staffed. This definitely affected the impression given, which was not five star.

Our superior room was very comfortable with a nice shower room, but on the small side.

Upon arrival I had asked whether we needed to book a table in the rooftop bar for us and two guests who were meeting us for drinks. The receptionist said she would let me know, but in the end when we arrived at the bar we were told there was no space for us even as residents of the hotel. We felt this was poor when we had requested a table at check in. We had drinks in the basement bar which was fine but not what we had hoped for.

We did not eat at the hotel, we walked to the Shard where we ate in the Ting restaurant at the Shangri La hotel - a very good experience. 

Breakfast was served in the ground floor bistro area and had a good menu with free coffee/tea refills. 

Overall we had a good stay, but I would not say the experience compared with other central London hotels of the same category.",4,2021,09,14
135,Excellent hotel with great service,"Great location, great smiley staff, great service. Lovely toiletries and linens.
Fresh milk would be nice and if not possible more milk capsules. Newspapers only appeared on our last day. Overall a great experience.",5,2021,09,14
135,Lovely hotel in a great location,"Stayed here whilst attending a wedding at St.Paul’s. Some rooms are small but the decor is stylish and a very comfortable bed.  Love the books in the room for us to browse.  Cocktails happy hour was well-appreciated and lots of nice restaurants around.  Very close to Mansion House tube so superb for getting around.  Only downside was having to listen to another guest shout at the breakfast serving time as her boiled egg was cold - she was obnoxious whilst the team remained polite and professional.  We then went to reception to collect a printout and she was there too repeating how cold her egg was!  Well all we can say is we ate breakfast at the same time and ours was lovely!  Can’t fault any of the team at this hotel they are friendly and helpful, thank you all.",5,2021,09,14
135,"Great hotel, staff are superb","Would come back tomorrow… staff were great, rooms were outstandingly clean and comfy. Roof top terrace was great for a few drinks, and the location of the hotel was a 5/10 minute walk from london bridge and the shard.",5,2021,09,14
135,Angela,"Excellent hotel.
The staff were professional, friendly and offered great service. 
We loved the rooftop bar. From arriving at the hotel we felt the staff couldn’t do enough for you.  
Good location and would definitely recommended . ",5,2021,09,14
135,City break,"The staff where polite , friendly and helpful.

Rooms and premises where clean and stlylish with a relaxing atmosphere. The food was good and the cocktail bar is definitely worth a visit . The bed was very comfortable aswell with blackout curtains .

135,Weekend in London,"Great location for a weekend break in London, very friendly efficient staff, very attentive service. Great bar & restaurant with well made cocktails, fantastic views of St. Pauls from the restaurant. Would definitely recommend staying there when visiting London.
 ",4,2021,09,13
135,"Great location, quiet, luxury, amazing staff",Luxury hotel for a great price. Rooftop restaurant is incredible and the DND bar is really special. The staff go the extra mile to make your experience memorable and are so attentive. Overall a great experience!,5,2021,09,13
135,Great service,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay, the service was outstanding. Very clean, we had a room with balcony which was great addition. Guy on reception was so welcoming and friendly, which makes a change to some of the other hotels we’ve stayed in! ",5,2021,09,13
135,Peace and quiet with excellent roof top terrace for lunch,My husband & I enjoyed a quiet weekend in London.  The hotel is tucked down a side street away from the hustle and bustle.  The staff were extremely helpful and accommodating.  Our room was quiet on the 5th floor and had a balcony which we used.  Very enjoyable trip.  ,5,2021,09,12
135,Celebration weekend,"Such a warm, friendly, professional welcome

The service was exceptional, from booking through to collecting our bags at the end of the day

Helpful in delivering special birthday touches, and the cake was simply perfect

We cannot wait to return ",5,2021,09,11
135,Look forward to returning soon,"A fantastic find down a quiet side street. Fabulous interior design, well appointed rooms which were beautifully clean. Staff were attentive and professional. Great location for Mansion House. Will definitely return. ",5,2021,09,10
135,Really great in every way except the beds!,"Such lovely staff. I have a disability and they were wonderfully kind and helpful. Good communication. Restaurant well managed with great staff and food. Not cheap but fair for London. And it didn't feel at all snobby, just friendly. Great shower. Lovely clean room with welcoming details. Nice and quiet. The only thing I didn't like was the bed; rock hard, even with a mattress topper. I had a very bad sleep. Guys, if you can find a way to make the beds softer, I will definitely stay again, I think it needs more than a topper, maybe a whole piece of soft foam? Or a few with soft mattresses? Thanks for all your help.",4,2021,09,10
135,Great stay,"The hotel is well decorated. The staff were friendly and accommodating at all times. I was super impressed with my room; clean, modern and spacious with a giant bed.
There was no view, just office buildings but for hotels in central London you often can't expect much more, so this was of no bother to me. The rooftop bar was full the night I stayed unfortunately but I had a complementary glass of champagne to enjoy anyway. 
As noted by another review, there is no information in the room as you would usually expect but I didn't really give that a second thought as I'm sure you can find anything you need to from the staff.
I used the gym, which I had to myself and so got use the facilities as I wished, with no waiting around. 
Comparing the price to other hotels I was looking at for the same time, I do feel it was value for money and if I'm ever looking for a hotel in the area again I will certainly be returning.",5,2021,09,09
135,Excellent experience,The hotel is unique and interesting in a fabulous City location. The service was outstanding. Rooftop restaurant was an excellent bonus on a glorious day! The room had so many added features and it was immaculately clean. A wonderful stay thank you! ,5,2021,09,09
135,Perfect base for exploring City of London,"Hotel was perfect location for exploring round the city of London, close to main line stations and underground. Our hotel looked out over the church at end of street which was lovely and even though there is a busy street at the bottom you couldn’t hear this at all. Rooms very clean, nice design and all the amenities you’d need, enjoyed the bathrobes and slippers. All areas of the hotel felt very clean and fresh. The staff were very friendly and helpful, able to store bags etc and offered complimentary champagne as I had noted on booking we were celebrating. The roof terrace restaurant is stunning, view of the shard, St Paul’s and down the river. It was beautiful weather whilst we were there so this helped but I’m sure it would still be lovely in winter if you wrap up warm! All in all a lovely little hotel in a fab location, would definitely stay again!",5,2021,09,09
135,Beautiful Designed Hotel,"A lovely hotel, small and perfectly formed in the heart of the city.  The hotel has lots of character from the cobble street entrance, bar area to the bookshelf in the room with a great selection of books to read.

I was made to feel welcome the second I walked through the door. The room had a big comfy bed and I had a great nights sleep.  Will definitely stay again.",5,2021,09,09
135,Clean and tidy but expensive.,"Smart hotel but expensive for what it is. Light system is unnecessarily complicated and it felt a bit much that all the on-demand films had to be paid for, given how expensive the rooms are to start with. I think there are better value alternatives in the area.",3,2021,09,09
135,Beautiful hotel but disturbed sleep,"We arrived at reception and checked in which was a very easy process. The hotel is beautifully decorated and the staff are very friendly and welcoming. Our superior double room was located on the second floor. It had a Marshall Bluetooth speaker which we made good use of. The robes and slippers were a nice addition also. The bathroom was lovely with a large walk in shower. The only thing was that the wall hung shower head was not adjustable in that you had to hold it the entire time rather than being able to angle it on the wall. This was not ideal for someone who didn’t want to wet their hair. The room had a mini fridge with orange and apple juice, water bottles and coke cans. As much as the room was lovely I would not say that it reflected a five star hotel. It was on the small side and quite bare. There was no hotel information i.e the opening times of the restaurant or bar or a room service menu. Also no extra touches such as a welcome pack/drink etc nor any sort of view from the window. The turndown service was fantastic and the room was always pristine afterward. The location of the hotel is great. Next to various underground stations with different lines. It is also close to the river which is lovely to walk along during the day or at night. It is a short walk from St. Paul’s cathedral and the sky gardens which I would highly recommend for drinks. However the downfall of the hotel is that it is positioned next door to a church which has a large bell. The bell is rung every 15 minutes from 7am onwards. At 7am there are 7 chimes with a short tune afterward then at quarter past and half past the hour a few chimes then at 8am there are 8 chimes and so on. If you are an early riser this is fine however for us we had come to London for a break and a longer lie than 7am. This was especially frustrating as we were out later at night. I also think that no corner of the hotel would be able to escape the noise of the bells as it is loud and so close hence why we did not ask to be moved room. For this reason I would not return to this hotel which is a shame as it is very good in all other aspects. I appreciate it is out with the hotels control however it is still a determining factor of my overall experience. ",3,2021,09,07
135,Amazing find,What a find!   Beautiful and spotlessly clean hotel with possibly the best most attentive nice staff I’ve ever encountered! They could not do enough. We will defiantly be staying here again. Keep up the great work guys. ,5,2021,09,07
135,City break with a friend,Wonderful hotel with friendly staff in the Perfect location. Our beautifully decorated deluxe room was very Clean with a very comfortable bed and a little minibar with free soft drinks.  The rooftop bar is fabulous! We didn’t have breakfast but the food on the rooftop bar looked lovely. ,5,2021,09,07
135,Simply Fabulous,"From the moment we arrived we were made to feel welcome.

We were offered champagne (my husband's birthday) and the welcome was very friendly and professional.

When we returned from a walk, a lovely card and chocolates had been left in our room for my husband.

We had a night-cap on the roof terrace with stunning views, the patio heaters were on and the environment and atmosphere was perfect.

The room was immaculate, well laid out and provided a relaxed and comfortable stay. We both slept extremely well, the bed and pillows were so comfortable it was like being enveloped by a huge marshmallow.

Breakfast was delicious, excellent table service and quality of produce, cooked to perfection.

We look forward to returning soon and have already recommended Vintry & Mercer to family, friends and colleagues.

",5,2021,09,06
135,Loved this hotel...,"Everyone I suppose has some basic criteria on what they look for when picking a hotel when in  London. For me, I like Quiet rooms,  very clean, close to a tube station and nice bar. If a hotel covers all that I’m happy.  So when you come to a hotel like the Vintry & Mercer you get all the above and that’s not even the good stuff! It’s a beautifully designed hotel funky and contemporary but done with elegance. Lovely room, Immaculately clean, excellent in room amenities, super comfortable bed, gorgeous bathroom and even though we were close to the lift, usually a nightmare, it was very quiet. Staff are all excellent, efficient and friendly. I had a slight misunderstanding prior to arrival regarding booking the roof terrace so emailed the hotel to leave feedback. Honestly was such a trivial issue I didn’t expect to hear back therefore was surprised when I got a response explaining the miscommunication and rectifying the situation in such a lovely way. Thank you Mircea Jude. 
Don’t miss the roof terrace for drinks .. absolutely gorgeous. Could have spent the whole day up there!!  Loved our stay. Will be back.",5,2021,09,06
135,Amazing,"Beautiful hotel with great access to all areas of St Paul’s. Beds and pillows are amazing, so had a fantastic sleep throughout my stay. Price was really good for our 2 night stay. Rooftop terrace had amazing views and loved the basement bar. ",5,2021,09,06
135,Fantastic,"Everything was faultless, stunning hotel and staff were amazing. Best hotel I've stayed in for years. Breakfast was amazing, roof terrace to die for. Was a beautiful weekend away. I will most definitely be back.",5,2021,09,06
135,30th Birthday Weekend - Exceptional Stay @ Vintry and Mercer,"I booked a two night stay at Vintry and Mercer to celebrate a belated 30th birthday and it did not disappoint. When searching for a hotel to book, I found myself being drawn back to this hotel the more and more we looked. I can safely say that the ratings and reviews are well and truly justified.

Following a swift tube journey from Kings Cross Station, upon entering the hotel you can’t help but notice the immaculate decor. The reception and breakfast area are clean cut and stylishly presented. We arrived a couple of hours before our check-in time and we were able to offload our cases before returning later on. All the staff working across Vintry and Mercer were nothing short of exceptional. The staff were extremely friendly and professional. 

We booked a standard double room to which again was immaculately clean and well presented. There were a few mod cons in the room to which we forgot to turn off the do not disturb button just as an FYI! So our towels etc didn’t get changed. However, a quick call to reception late at night and a member of the team was straight up to hand us clean towels. 

The rooftop terrace and the basement cocktail bar are seriously great additions to the hotel. The menus are varied and the views in particular from the terrace are stunning of St Paul’s Cathedral. My girlfriend accidentally spilt a drink in the basement cocktail bar and it was no problem for the bar staff. They moved us and replaced the drink for no extra cost. 

Our stay was perfect. We will definitely be back!",5,2021,09,04
135,"Great location, beautiful hotel","As soon as you walk in you feel the quality of the surroundings, it is relaxing and welcoming, the small scale makes it feel more personal.  The staff were very polite and helpful & we had a glass of champagne delivered to the room. The room was well designed and comfortable, great shower & giant bed, we had everything we wanted.  It was easy to walk to all of the spots of interest in the City and on the South Bank.",5,2021,09,04
135,Wonderful Hotel,"Loved our short stay here. Very comfortable and tastefully decorated room. Great facilities and great location. 

Staff were very friendly when we checked in and made us feel welcome. Definitely will be a first choice hotel when looking to stay in London again!",5,2021,09,04

135,Perfect stay,"We had a fantastic stay, the quality of service and decor are outstanding. We even received some unexpected little extras in celebration of our wedding anniversary which was definitely made so much more special by our stay at Vintry and Mercer. We cannot wait to be back asap, thank you ever so much for everything! ",5,2021,09,01
135,So beautiful and staff brilliant.,This was for our anniversary and it surpassed all expectations. Amazing rooms and we were upgraded. Restaurant and bar were beautiful and food was great. Roof terrace is a lovely addition. Fantastic location close to St Paul’s and to some great eateries including a little Vietnamese cafe and Casa de Frango,5,2021,09,01
135,Anniversary stay,"Vintry and mercer is now my favourite hotel to stay in London.
We booked this for our anniversary. Staff couldn't have been more accommodating.
There were lots of communication prior to our stay where we were asked more about our stay and nearby restaurant recommended.
We were upgraded to the studio room and given a glass of champagne to celebrate our anniversary.
Katrina and Michael were so friendly and approachable. 
The room itself was just stunning and comfortable, the bathrobes and free min bar was a nice touch. 
Breakfast was just out this world. 

Really looking forward to another visit!

135,Great place shame about the food,Great place central location nice rooftop sadly the food served is below standard. Would recommend as a nice place to stay with amazing staff who go the extra wile and are friendly. Top service with a smile ,4,2021,08,27
135,Small luxurious hotel,"What a surprising little gem hidden a stone throw away from the Mansion House station. We booked a standard room as we were only in London for 1 night. The room was quaint, chic and spotlessly clean. Love the little details such as complimentary soft drinks. 
The staff was very helpful & couldn’t do enough to assist us. 
We had a couple of delicious cocktails at the Rooftop Terrace and the service was equal to a 5 star establishment. 
We will definitely book this hotel again, albeit a bigger room.",5,2021,08,27
135,"Missed my flight, but stayed at the best","The hotel is located in the center of London, it was great!
Loved the staff, the rooms, the bed, all in all a great stay.
I would recommend to stay 10/10 and for sure will come back!
Thank you again for the late check out due to my work call.
",5,2021,08,25
135,"Outstanding, Amazing, Must stay","I am a student from Hong Kong moving to board in UK so as a vacation my dad and I came a month earlier to meet up with friends around England and visit the country. Before Vintry & Mercer, we stayed in countless hotels around England and I must say, V&M outdid all of them, by thousands of miles. 

One of the most significant qualities are the amazing services. Always with a smile on their face, the staffs would do everything they can to fulfil the needs to the guests. Having seen that my dad and I had lots of luggage, the staffs told us that they would give us an upgrade to a bigger room but as it was only available from the next day on, they helped us store our bags while we stayed at our original room. When we went to change our room the next evening, we found our luggage, from store and previous room, already in our new room. 

Another outstanding aspect of this hotel is the cleaning service. Every time we come back from a long day’s fun, we come back to a seemingly brand new room; clothes folded and everything cleaned. You could tell that the cleaners had put a tremendous effort in making the guests come back feeling welcome and relaxed. 

Last but not least is the room. It has everything to make a guest feel welcome and comfortable. From the bed that makes you sleep in seconds like a log to the bathroom that suits your everyday needs to astonishing city view, the rooms of this hotel are outstanding in every aspect. 

Having had such a great time in Vintry & Mercer, my dad and I booked an extra stay after we visit our friend. And once again, the staffs promised us a large room to be reserved for us and helped us store some of our luggage until we come back. Vintry & Mercer is truly one of a kind.",5,2021,08,24
135,Fantastic hotel,"Fantastic hotel, very clean and had everything you could wish for in the rooms, the bed was so comfortable, staff were all helpful and happy, very quick service, so clean all through the hotel with great room service",5,2021,08,23

Other daughters had a lovely room with a balcony. We all  had a welcome gift sent up to our rooms, some chocolate brownies and free soft drinks in the mini bar. Close to St Pauls Cathedral and the river which was very pleasant and we walked along to the London Eye. We had cocktails in the rooftop bar which was lovely with fantastic views. Breakfast staff were really friendly and efficient and breakfast was delicious. Would definitely return to this hotel.",5,2021,08,23

135,Central hotel,"Stayed here for one night for wedding at St. Paul’s so very convenient. Standard room slightly small but ideal for short stay. Bed very comfortable, shower large! Nice touch of complimentary soft drinks & water. Front desk staff very helpful in a very pleasing lobby. Thought breakfast very reasonable price for central London. Nice light breakfast area. Unfortunately was unable to make use of terrace bar which we would certainly have if we had been there for longer and weather better!

Upon arrival the receptionist was very helpful and offered my mum complimentary champagne at their restaurant  to celebrate. The interior is exactly as shown in the images and our room was clean. I was not able to switch off the air conditioner in our room but was offered an alternative room due to the fault. I didn’t swap rooms I just gave them permission to manually turn it off from reception. The staff are friendly and helpful and I wouldn’t fault anything. the room came with robes and slippers and they even have umbrellas you can use if it is a rainy day. The street is quiet and the beds were comfortable. I love their bathrooms too, well lit up and the shower is big enough for 3 people!  The restaurant was accommodating although I didn’t book prior and the food was tasty. Definitely a luxury hotel and an experience worth returning to.",5,2021,08,13

135,Amazing stay,"My wife and I stayed at V&M for our wedding anniversary and had a fantastic time. The hotel is beautiful, and the service was brilliant from the moment we arrived, starting with a complimentary upgrade to a studio suite room. Cocktails in the rooftop bar were excellent, and the Do Not Disturb bar is great for a late night drink. Will definitely be coming back!",5,2021,08,07
135,Great pleasant stay,"Really nice boutique hotel, lovely staff, decor and service. 

Location is perfect.

The rooftop is the true highlight - great views of the city. The complimentary minibar in the room was the cherry on top.

I would definitely return again.

Extra thanks to the reception staff Karina and Katrina.",5,2021,08,06

Cannot fault this hotel one bit
Rooms were very clean and the bed was really comfortable ",5,2021,08,04

The dnd cocktail lounge was also so classy and warming! Nothing was too much trouble for anyone. Best hotel i have ever stayed in! If i could give this 6 stars i would.",5,2021,08,01
135,Fantastic gem of a London hotel,Absolutely amazing 2 night stay at Vintry & Mercer for our Wedding Anniversary. The hotel and staff couldn't have been more accommodating. The service was exemplary and the extra touches made the stay even more special. Breakfast was also delicious!,5,2021,07,31
135,Very disappointing,"After hearing many great reviews of this hotel I was expecting great things. Unfortunately when we arrived we were extremely disappointed: we were upgraded on arrival which was great until we got to our room. It was small, dingy box room with no natural day light (small window directly opposite a building) the room just about fit an ironing board and we had to have our suitcases on the bed as there was no room. The worst incident was a cleaner walking in while I was getting changed (they didn’t knock) and they said to us they thought the room was empty. We paid £36 for breakfast in our room and it was so disappointing cold and tasteless. The hotel didn’t really have much to offer apart from a basement bar that lacked any atmosphere, the roof top bar was nice but small. We won’t be back again ",1,2021,07,31
135,Excellent place!,"We had a fabulous stay here with a beautiful room, view, the best cooked breakfast ever and the rooftop bar made us feel like we were in Barcelona! The staff here were all so welcoming, polite and friendly too. Recommended to all friends already. Brilliant.
",5,2021,07,31
135,Stunning roof terrace,"We met in the evening for drinks on the roof terrace. The setting is comfortable and the views are stunning with the Shard and St Paul’s cathedral clearly visible. The staff are very attentive. The cocktails are varied but the bill soon mounts up, the G&Ts were good value. They also have some light bites on offer.",4,2021,07,30
135,Review: Vintry & Mercer,The food was amazing and the staff were so helpful and friendly. They were very accommodating and took time out to show me around the different parts of the hotel and their facilities. They've got a good gym to burn off all the indulgences on offer and a comfy bed to drift away for the night. Will be staying again!,5,2021,07,29
135,Hidden Gem,"Do not hesitate to book this amazing hotel! Our second stay here and i cannot fault a thing, by far the best hotel in London. Tucked away but also in a great location. We booked a superior room and got upgraded to a suite (amazing!) From the minute you walk into this hotel they make you feel so welcome, the stuff are so friendly and helpful. The beds are huge and so comfortable, the TV in the bath.. i could go on. The bar also has great drinks and good vibes.
Thank you for another amazing stay and i cannot wait until the next one! :)",5,2021,07,29
135,Review,Stay was disappointing due to no restaurant/bar facilities being available.  Room service food was not vey hot and a pepper sauce was cold like just out of the fridge.  Don't expect to stay at a London hotel and be told no facilities due to a function in the hotel.  No reduction in price of course!!!,2,2021,07,29
135,A Very Happy Annivesary,"We had a lovely stay here, the staff could not have done more. Excellent. A few tiny gripes, for an hotel of this quality and price I would have expected more than 2 tea bags and 2 milk cartons per day... especially as my wife's one sole love is a good cup of tea. The cost increase would be minimal but the benefit large. Also our room was large and beautifully furnished but for in room dining a table that two can sit at is required. Otherwise very nearly perfect. (Thanks for the umbrella)",4,2021,07,26
135,What an absolute gem!,"My husband and I stayed here last weekend and couldn't of wished for a better place to spend our first wedding anniversary. 

The hotel itself is gorgeous, from the decor to all the little touches and just so incredibly clean! The staff from reception to cleaners to bar staff were all so lovely and friendly. Always happy to help with anything you asked. I called down for extra water and an ironing board and they never kept you waiting. Other hotels we've stayed in before, you ask for something and they forget or you're kept waiting for a while before you get what you need, but not here! When we arrived back to our room on our first evening, they had left us a little note and a box of sweet treats which was a lovely touch. 

The room itself, we booked a Superior but were upgraded to a Deluxe free of charge (again, brilliant touch from them as we were celebrating) and we were super grateful. We stayed in room 602 and enjoyed every minute. The bed was large and very comfortable! You could see the shard from the room which was nice in the evening and the floor to ceiling windows just bring in lots of light. The bathroom was gorgeous, I said to my husband the only touch this room is missing is a fancy bath which would of topped it off. The room was quiet, the best sleep we've had a in a hotel for sure! 

We decided to take advantage of the Do Not Disturb bar on the lower ground floor before our dinner out of the hotel. They do 2-4-1 cocktails between 5pm-7pm and they didn't disappoint. Some 2-4-1 deals aren't the best and can be quite weak on the alcohol front but these cocktails were very good. The service by the barman and waiter was really good, so much so that when we arrived back after dinner around 11:30pm we popped back in for a night cap and they greeted us from earlier in the evening. 

Location is great, tucked away but still extremely central. We pre-booked the NCP Vintry car park which was a 3/4 min walk round the corner, very handy.

All in all, just a perfect stay and we're very glad to have found this hidden gem in our favourite city. Looking forward to booking again for our next trip",5,2021,07,26
135,Highly recommended,A beautifully well maintained hotel in an ideal location. Everything from the service at check in to the comfortable and clean rooms and the excellent facilities were second to none. Will definitely be back. ,5,2021,07,26
135,"Incredible customer service, high quality hotel","The staff always go above and beyond, making each stay incredibly special. The rooms are lovely and we particularly love both of the hotel bars. The hotel is in a great location with walking distance to Borough Market, lots of great restaurants, and plenty of transport links.",5,2021,07,25
135,Great stay in the City,"A brand new facility, a Hotel of the right size, not too big, with all the needed services. Very well furnished rooms, with taste and confort, friendly staff in an area that offers restaurant options and attractions.",5,2021,07,24
135,Fabulous stay in this lovely hotel,We had a fabulous stay in this hotel which is a five minute walk from the south bank.  AMAZING value for money.  The roof terrace is a great attribute and cocktails were delicious.  The lovely staff were outstanding- I can’t recommend highly enough.,5,2021,07,24
135,Amazing Stay - Exceptional Service,"We stayed in one of the suites and have had an amazing experience. This is the third time we have been, the service is always exceptional, you will be hard pressed to find better and more accommodating staff. 

The room was great, our room wasn’t quite ready for an early check in, so we were showed to another room that was available and was perfect, so we were able to check in a couple of hours early. 

We were given a complimentary glass of champagne each, had a macaroon and chocolate brownie each in our room, we couldn’t have asked for more. 

The location is good for us, just a 30 second walk from Mansion House station and a 5 min walk to St Paul’s. 

The rooftop bar was good, and had views of The Shard and St Paul’s. 

We love this hotel, and the staff make the experience even better. Definitely highly recommended.",5,2021,07,24
135,Secret gem in the city,"Secret gem of a London boutique hotel with all the high standards. 
Very retro decor and incredibly friendly staff. 
Room service was fast and efficient and the cleaning service in the morning for the room was prompt and to a high standard. 
I would opt for the suite rooms with balcony as it is just lovely in the summer. 
Very comfortable and will definitely return soon.",5,2021,07,23
135,Most comfortable stay,The staff especially Karina at reception were so friendly and helpful. Upon arrival we got a room upgrade as we were celebrating our anniversary. We were also offered champagne but we don’t drink so Karina was nice enough to offer mock tails instead which I really appreciated. They also left some sweet treats in our room for us which was a nice touch. The room was spacious and really nicely decorated. The beds and pillows are the most comfortable I’ve experienced in a hotel. The location is great! Mansion house station is just up the road from the hotel. St Paul’s is around the corner and your close to the underground so are easily able to get around. Highly recommend and will be staying here again.,5,2021,07,23
135,Staycation anniversary,"Any big plans to celebrate our wedding anniversary where not going to happen, so we decided to be tourists in our (virtually) own town, London. We wanted somewhere nice, a bit special, but not dramatically expensive. The Vintry & Mercer certainly fits the bill. Tucked away down Garlick Hill, one of those streets off the main streets in the City of London whose names come from trades or goods sold or made there, or linked to goods landed on the nearby Thames.
But this hotel is bang up-to-date. The staff were great and couldn't be more helpful and friendly. 
The rooms come in different sizes. We were given a superior room which was well appointed, possibly some would find it ""snug"" but we thought it was fine. Good bathroom, the key test for my other half, along with a good size and comfortable bed.
The hotel boasts a roof top bar which, not surprisingly is very popular. We enjoyed a couple of glasses of bubbly, courtesy of the hotel who knew it was our anniversary. 
We didn't dine in the hotel but did have breakfast there.
The full English was certainly filling and my wife had the more restrained scrambled eggs, toast and salmon, which she said was very good.
Overall, a lovely hotel and we will certainly return.",5,2021,07,22
135,Wonderful hotel,"We chose this hotel for its location and individuality for a mini break.  Not having had a holiday we wanted a touch of luxury and were not disappointed. Staff were wonderful and helpful. DND was a great little cocktail bar and the Mercer Terrace served great food with a view, we had the benefit of exceptionally good weather. We chose a suite and were lucky to get the requested balcony. This meant we could come back and relax for a couple of hours in comfort. The mini bar with complimentary soft drinks and water was a nice touch. For something special in a good location we would certainly recoomend.",5,2021,07,22
135,Amazing boutique hotel,"Fantastic stay for our wedding anniversary. The hotel is beautiful and the rooms are stunning. 
We even got an upgrade and two glasses of champagne which was a lovely touch.

Rooftop terrace has stunning views and the drinks are great. 

The staff were super friendly and were extremely helpful and always had smiles on their faces. 

The beds are very comfortable too and the free soft drinks and snacks in mini bar are a nice touch. 

Location is great 

Highly recommend this hotel",5,2021,07,20
135,Very impressive,"I just stayed at the Vintry and Mercer for 3 nights, although that part of The City is quiet it really didn't matter because anywhere is just a walk, cab or tube trip away.

The staff were really friendly and welcoming.  The food was totally excellent, I had room service on the first evening, I ordered a fillet steak, cooked medium rare and a cheese board.  I was told it would be about 15 minutes for delivery of my food.  The food arrived within that time, the steak was perfectly cooked and accompanied by a very simple but totally delicious green salad and chips.  The cheese was also very tasty.  

The room was great, nothing that I could criticise, and a very quiet hotel.

The roof terrace is stunning, not huge but very very nice indeed and always busy or a steady flow of people.",5,2021,07,19
135,My stay,Enjoyed the stay at the hotel. Was a nice bar downstairs and the staff were very helpful. Free soft drinks in the room was a nice touch. Room is quite small compared to others I have stayed in but everything laid out well,4,2021,07,19
135,Fantastic luxury hotel,"The staff from check-in to checkout were amazing. We stayed 3 nights and loved it. Will definitely be back! Love the rooftop bar and DND.
ROOM and furnishings lovely 
SHOWER amazing 
BED & PILLOWS very comfy",5,2021,07,19
135,Great stay,We were here on business but would easily return for pleasure. We enjoyed the roof top bar and the basement cocktail bar! The staff are outstanding and I loved our room! Slept fantastical well. Would highly recommend ,5,2021,07,17
135,By far the BEST hotel in London!,"This is honestly the most beautiful hotel, with the most incredible staff members who went above and beyond to make our stay extra special, amazingly beautiful clean spacious rooms, I've never seen a hotel room like it! The decor was so pretty and well put together! With great amenities and such DREAMY showers! (nearly made us late for a reservation because I didn't want to get out of it) You also CANNOT miss out on experiencing the Do Not Disturb bar! Which has the best unique drinks with a cozy 1920's vibe! We felt as if we were in a film due to the furnishing, it was brilliant. Again, the bar staff members were so lovely. 

I would 100% highly recommend this hotel if you were to stay in London. The location is great, tube station is a 1 minute walk away.. with lovely food places all around and the area itself is very nice to take a walk and see the city. 

We honestly had such an incredible stay-cation all thanks to this lovely gem of a hotel. So thank you very much Vintry & Mercer, we will be back.. very soon and we cannot wait!",5,2021,07,16
135,A perfect night away,"I stayed for one night at the weekend with my husband to celebrate his birthday. From check in to check out everything was perfect! Jude at the reception was very polite and friendly and offered us each a complimentary drink as it was a birthday trip. This was a lovely touch - thank you. 
The hotel itself is quite small but beautifully decorated and so feels very light and airy. All the plants make the place feel lovely and fresh. 
We stayed in a deluxe studio (601)  which had a balcony with a great view of The Shard. There’s a church outside with a bell that rings on the hour but with the balcony doors closed at night we couldn’t hear it at all so our sleep wasn’t disturbed by it. The room was spotless and very luxurious. The bed was exceptionally comfortable. Toiletries were very nice and great coffee provided.
We had one drink at the roof terrace bar but unfortunately it was fully booked outside. Understandable as it’s London and we hadn’t pre booked. The inside of the bar was very nice to sit in anyway so we weren’t disappointed. We didn’t visit the other bar or eat in the restaurant for dinner or breakfast so can’t comment on the food but the food we saw looked very good. 
All in all a perfect stay! We have stayed in most of the top rated hotels in London and I can honestly say this is my new favourite place. We will definitely find an excuse to come back again! Thank you for having us.",5,2021,07,13
135,Simply Classy,"I cannot praise the hotel and staff enough. What a beautiful hotel and well deserving of all of its 5*. Super stylish, incredibly professional staff and above all expectations. We are staying in room 604, a Deluxe Studio and it is simply beautiful. Increduble bathroom, super comfy bed, mood lighting, you get the picture. We have stayed all over the world in some beautiful hotels and the V&A is up there with the best in luxury, style and super professional stall.

A real credit to the owners.",5,2021,07,13
135,Beautiful hotel stay,"We stayed at Vintry and Mercer for three days at the beginning of July.  Tt was our third stay at this hotel and it certainly won't be our last.  
On arrival we were greeted by Karina and were upgraded to a deluxe room and offered a complimentary glass of champagne on the roof terrace, where we ended up staying and having several more drinks and some lunch .. a perfect afternoon on a rainy day in London.  The staff are super professional and obviously very good at their jobs.
Our room was beautiful; the furnishings, bed linen and bathroom amenities are top class, and, unlike some other hotels we have visited during covid times, our room was services daily.
Breakfast was lovely!  The whole ambience of the hotel is calm and elegant.
We will definitely be back!",5,2021,07,13
135,Lovely long weekend away,"We booked the V&M for a long weekend away and were pretty happy with our stay. The hotel is beautiful, the location is great and the room was so comfortable. We had a good night's sleep and it was nice that so many amenities are available in the hotel. We did have a meal on the roof terrace but unfortunately I had a problem with my meal. Despite this, it was a lovely stay. ",4,2021,07,13
135,Amazing hotel,"This hotel is beautiful. The staff were so friendly, the breakfast was delicious and we really appreciated our free upgrade to celebrate our anniversary! We also got champagne on arrival. This is perfect for couples and the location is central so ideal for exploring all parts of London.",5,2021,07,12
135,Marvellous V&M,"My husband and I spent 3 glorious nights at the Vintry and Mercer for our wedding anniversary. We chose the hotel as we had prior booked a local restaurant, which was within walking distance, for our anniversary meal. We weren’t too sure what to expect because of it’s location down a little side street with no attractive view. However, upon arrival we realised it was a small luxury hotel and the standard from there on was wonderful! After a long working day and late check-in, we still received an extremely warm and friendly welcome from “Dimitri” who kindly offered us two complimentary drinks in the ‘Do Not Disturb’ bar for our wedding anniversary and we loved the speakeasy style of the downstairs drinking establishment.

We stayed in a deluxe room with a huge king-size bed. Although we did not have any sort of view the room had all facilities and was exceptionally clean and cosy. 
We made use of the small gym which we had to book specific session times for. We did have a couple of mishaps with this due to some errors on behalf of the reception team but they were very apologetic and professional, particularly “Mircea”.

We made the most of the fabulous location and took lovely walks to various local landmarks and down the River Thames. There are also many local restaurants. We did also have dinner in the rooftop restaurant- Mercer Roof Terrace - which was nice but busy! 

Such a wonderful stay made all the better by the welcoming and professional attitudes of the hotel staff. Well-worth a visit!",5,2021,07,10
135,Excellent Stay,"The service and quality provided at this hotel was consistently excellent. 
Great location too. 
Excellent roof terrace with lovely food. 
It would be nice to have a late residents bar, but that was the only thing lacking. ",5,2021,07,09
135,Trip of a lifetime,I was on a business trip and was very pleased. The suite was magnificent. The staff was awesome and I will come back because of the professional way I was treated. Thanks to the great food that I gained 20 lbs because I had to try them all.,5,2021,07,07
135,Sterling quality visit,"A lovely, modern hotel with character and charm in a great location. With impressive views of the London skyline, a close walk to St Pauls, etc. the hotel stands out amongst others. It's also worth a quick mention of the food which I found to be absolutely great, with friendly staff going out of their way to assist on every occasion!",5,2021,07,07
135,Experience,"Vintry & Mercer is nestled at the heart of the City, among the livery halls, guilds and narrow streets that line the banks of the Thames. This is where past and present intersect, where the long traditions of trade and commerce come to life in the contemporary style of the 92 bespoke rooms and suites. Our inspiration comes from the historic trading guilds of the area. Vintry was the centre for London wine merchants, and Mercer was for noble textile sellers who specialised in fine silks and damasks. In the narrow streets near our hotel, this history perseveres. Yet the locale is now a destination for the modern traveller. It’s a place where architectural wonders share the cityscape with global powerhouses, alive with the bustle of commerce and conversation that reflect our first-class location at the centre of a turning world.",5,2021,07,06
135,Lovely Birthday stay!,"My partner booked us 2 nights at the V&M for my Birthday last month and we had such a lovely time I've booked for us to go back for his Birthday next month!

The staff were wonderful, so accommodating and friendly. We only ate breakfast here as we had booked other restaurants outside of the hotel but the food was amazing. I am coeliac so must eat gluten free and they catered to my needs perfectly. The bar food was also a treat after a few wines! 

I am so looking forward to visiting again and I'm sure my partner will when I let him know about his Birthday stay.

Thank you V&M!",5,2021,07,06
135,Couple weekend away,"Fantastic hotel, great location, full of character and very clean (smells lovely too). Each member of the team there were brilliant and so friendly - nothing too much trouble. The terrace bar was also fantastic and again the service was brilliant. ",5,2021,07,06

135,Brilliant hotel,"Really great staff and the room was so comfortable. We even had a TV at the end of the bath!

Roof top bar was really pleasant and whilst we didn’t eat at the bar the food looked good.

We only had breakfast and that was really nice albeit a little slow.

Would definitely recommend it to family and friends.",5,2021,06,27
135,"Gorgeous gem of a hotel, great location","Loved staying here - beautiful decor, warm & friendly staff, and lots of nice little touches. Great area to stay in to explore the city and the riverbanks. It was my boyfriend’s birthday so they gave us 2 free glasses of champagne which we enjoyed on the buzzy roof terrace! The beds are really comfortable, and the staff also were really helpful arranging surprises like balloons waiting for us in the room. Breakfast was also really delicious. Would definitely stay here again!",5,2021,06,26
135,Excellent for families,We booked last minute when our travel plans changed and so glad that we did. The service was excellent and the rooms comfortable. The best part was all the little special treats for our toddler. From a mini robe to child friendly bath amenities and even a rubber duck. We had a great time and will look forward to visiting again. ,5,2021,06,24

135,Stay here once and you’ll stay here again,"We absolutely loved our stay at the hotel. The staff were very welcoming and helpful from the moment we checked in. 

The size of the hotel was perfect which gave it a high quality boutique-y feel and there was a real personal touch.

The rooms were furnished to a high standard and best of all, the bed was among the most comfortable I’ve ever slept in.

The roof bar/restaurant was the perfect place to have a drink in the sun and the breakfast was really good.",5,2021,06,19
135,Just Book it,"Take a quiet, convenient location and insert a well designed, stylish hotel. 
 Add some well appointed, comfortable rooms, a mediterranean style rooftop restaurant, a basement speakeasy bar and garnish with friendly, efficient staff.  Hopefully a recipe for future success....",5,2021,06,16
135,a brilliant stay!,"We had a wonderful stay, the hotel is beautiful, the breakfasts delicious and everyone that works there are so friendly and helpful. Pamela and Shantel who work in the restaurant were brilliant with making sure we had everything we needed, whenever we went for breakfast the service was quick and easy. Katrina on the desk went above and beyond to ensure our stay was relaxing and special for my birthday. 
I couldn't recommend enough!",5,2021,06,15
135,One Fine Stay,"Booked this as a post-lockdown and birthday treat. We loved the tucked-away location and stylish interiors.  But the real delight is the rooftop restaurant with views to St Paul’s, the Shard and along the river.
This is a fascinating part of London - steeped in history and also super-close to many interesting places to visit.
We were kindly given a room upgrade and I think this was probably my favourite ever hotel bed - just gorgeous.
As with all hotels, it’s the staff who really make it, and they have a lovely team who were extremely helpful and efficient and determined to make our stay special.  Thank you and I hope we get to return soon!",5,2021,06,14

135,Room For Improvement !,"My wife and i were excited about our much anticipated 3 night stay at the Vintry and Mercer hotel in a deluxe studio bedroom but were left feeling quite flat about our experience.
It all began so well when checking in we encountered the excellent Dimitri Cigliano who delivered superb customer service as expected by a 5 star hotel and was the consummate professional.
Our room did have a balcony as requested and apparently there are only 2 available in the hotel. The room was clean and well presented with superb lighting options and a very comfy bed. The bathroom, although stunning was a little impractical with a stand alone bath with a rain shower in the middle with hose attachment if preferred but with a wrap around shower curtain which proved to be a bit awkward when trying to have a proper shower, modern, chic and beautiful to look at but not the best to use in reality, shower curtains are rarely user friendly.
For a 5 star hotel, the mini bar we found to be lacking. It had a supply of soft drinks which were complimentary but there was no alcoholic choices or snacks. There was not even any biscuits/chocolate to go with your tea and coffee.

We used the in house bar called Do Not Disturb which was very nice with excellent drinks and staff and with a great happy hour on Fridays/Saturdays between 5-7.
Breakfast was a total disaster. The first morning there was only one other couple waiting to be served but the wait was well over 50 mins. We put that down as a one off and went back the following morning and this time it was packed with most tables waiting for food and an hour long wait was experienced again, shockingly bad and the staff seemed confused and flustered. We had had enough of this and the next day we ordered room service instead which was fine but with a limited menu.
We also went to the much lauded Mercer Roof Top Terrace for drinks. The terrace was beautiful with a great atmosphere but unfortunately that is where our lovely experience ended. Customer service was appalling and the wait for drinks and the quality of them was even worse. We ordered two Mojitos which at over £17 each were a disgrace, just like lemon squash with a couple of bits of ice. We had to ask several times why are we waiting so long for a our drinks order. You should not have to do this at a 5 star hotel especially with a service charge attached. Other couples sitting around us were also dismayed and shocked by the same thing. In farness the hotel waivered these drinks from our bill when complaining at check out.
The hotel staff were all polite but under staffed on the roof top terrace.
The hotel in all areas was clean and very presentable in a good location and we were initially looking to return and book two rooms here when we take our daughter to London on a short trip in July, but after our experience i am now looking elsewhere to stay and i would say that unless you can get a good deal, it's not worth paying top prices to stay here.

Sadly, in our experience the hotel came up short which is unfortunate.",3,2021,06,08
135,Excellent Hotel!!,"Greet location especially for St Paul’s. The staff are always friendly and helpful. The rooms are spotless with lovely little touches. We stay here as often as we can and 
can’t wait to come back!!!!!!",5,2021,06,07
135,Anniversary Booking,Lovely location and the hotel was absolutely stunning. Staff couldn’t have been more helpful. My only two comments are that they could provide you with more then the two small milks and the shower was lovely but rather weak. ,4,2021,06,07
135,Wonderful hotel,"We stayed here for an anniversary weekend away. The room was lovely which we got upgraded and there was a minibar in the room. We also had breakfast at the hotel, once in the restaurant and once as room service which was on time and both lovely breakfasts. We went to the DND bar during happy hour which was really nice. Dimitri and all staff were really accommodating and friendly during our stay ",5,2021,06,06
135,Wonderful stay,"Treated ourselves to a night away, as Vintry and Mercer was a perfect choice. Lovely rooms, spotlessly clean with great decor and really comfy beds. Staff was welcoming and keen to help. We also visited the cocktail bar, DnD, which was excellent!",5,2021,06,06
135,Absolutely amazing hotel,"I booked this hotel for my partners 30th birthday. I had originally booked the superior room but when we told Dimitri it was for a birthday he upgraded us free of charge to a deluxe room! All the staff were incredible, really made our stay special, the room was lovely and the bed was so comfortable. We had the breakfast in the morning which was also lovely. All in all a amazing hotel with great staff. I will definitely be returning!",5,2021,06,05
135,Beautiful !,"Such a beautiful hotel in a perfect location of walking distance to all attractions!! Had the most amazing stay for my belated 21st, lovely customer service and the roof terrace food is next level !!😍 very happy and would stay again! ",5,2021,06,02
135,Birthday weekend,"A nice hotel conveniently located for the city sites and good for tube connections. If you prefer cabs it can be expensive going backwards and forwards to the West End.  Unfortunately my other half loves her cabs! Fantastic for St Pauls, close to the river and the Millenium bridge so easy to get to the South Bank and the Tate Modern. Excellent staff. All n all very happy with the experience. ",4,2021,06,01
135,Bank Holiday Stay,"We had a really nice stay at Vintry & Mercer and would definitely stay here again and recommend to friends and family. Really good location in st Pauls only a few minutes walk from Bank tube station. We arrived early and were able to check in straight away. The room wasnt quite as expected, if you want the balcony suite this needs to be requested online prior to arrival however we were offered complimentary breakfast as a gesture of goodwill which was really appreciated. We mentioned it was a belated birthday celebration following two lockdown birthdays and were given a glass of champagne each and a dessert which was a nice touch. The room was spotless and facilities in the room were great. The bed was so comfy and spacious, we had a great nights sleep. On check out, we were able to leave our luggage to go out and explore London which was really useful as it meant we didnt have the hassle of dragging baggage around with us. ",5,2021,06,01
135,"If you want to feel like an extremely valued customer, stay here!","From the moment I booked this room over the phone with Dimitri (who sadly I didn’t get to meet and thank!) I was treated with the best customer care. The lady on reception was fabulous and made my son feel special for his birthday, the room was lovely, bed comfortable, rooftop terrace gorgeous, food was great - we couldn’t have wished for a better weekend away. Thank you Vintry and Mercer, we will definitely be back! ",5,2021,06,01
135,5 star!,"Wow. Where do I start. Exceptional service with staff going extra mile, no ask was to big. Was visiting for a special occasion and fresh cakes were delivered as well as complementary champagne. 10/10. Definitely returning. Thank you to all staff who made our stay so pleasurable .",5,2021,05,30
135,"Beautiful hotel, exceptional service.","We popped down to London for our anniversary. With lunch booked elsewhere, we intended to drop our bags and return to check in later. However, by the time we arrived midday our room was ready for check-in and the reception staff could not have been more professional or pleasant. When we were politely asked why we were staying in London, my wife informed them it was our anniversary and they sent some complementary champagne to the room. A very nice touch and certainly helped us settle and relax.

The rooftop bar (which is very pleasant) was closed that evening for a private event, but the reception staff were able to book us a table for a quick drink before we left for our lunch appointment.

We had selected one of the suites, which was very extremely comfortable and spotlessly clean. It's not huge for a suite but having spent many nights in Central London hotels, this is on the generous side of spacious compared to its contemporaries.

Having enjoyed the initial introduction so much, we decided to return to the hotel in the evening (rather than sample some other bars in the area) and have a drink in the basement cocktail bar, which was as good as any of the ""speakeasy style"" bars littering London's nightlife at present. We also ordered some room service (having experienced such jealousy during our lunchtime drink on the rooftop watching others enjoy their meals), which was exceptional.

The only flaw I could find in the entire stay was the bathroom tv dropped signal and turned off intermittently, and if an interruption in your bath-tub viewing of Sky Sports if the only complaint, it's a fair reflection of just how delightful everything else was.

I'll certainly look forward to returning when I'm back in the City for work or leisure.",5,2021,05,30
135,Amazing boutique hotel,"We had such a lovely stay at this hotel, the service was excellent, we were able to check in a little early, offered help with dinner reservations etc, and we had great room service too. The location is very central and easy to walk / uber to key locations. The hotel itself is beautiful, very stylish and well thought out. The roof terrace is great as well. You can tell it’s a relatively new hotel as everywhere feels spotless and the staff are really putting in the effort. The only (minor) points to raise:
- the hotel is next to a bell tower so in the evening/morning you will hear it chiming so might disrupt some sleep, it didn’t really bother us though 
- the hotel was quite empty I think just because of Covid which meant some of the restaurants and basement bar weren’t open during the week 
- there was some confusion over the roof terrace when we were there, we asked downstairs when we checked out at 12 if we could go up to the roof terrace and was told by the member of staff we could but because there was a private event it would be last orders at 12.30. We just wanted a drink so headed up anyway. When we got to the roof terrace, a different member of staff told us there was no tables at all and that they were fully booked. He was quite rude and dismissive towards us and this was our only “bad service” experience. The roof terrace was at this point completely empty and we asked again if we could just have a quick drink and explained we were staying at the hotel. The member of staff eventually shrugged and let us have a seat but said it would only be for 1 hour (which was fine). We were able to stay for 1.5 hours before we left and there were still some free tables. It felt like he just couldn’t be bothered to accommodate us which was odd especially when the rest of the stay was basically perfect. I would still definitely recommend the hotel and would stay again !",5,2021,05,29
135,Wish we could stay for longer!,"This hotel hands down is one of the best ive stayed in.
Cannot fault. Free upgrade on arrival when I mentioned it was my birthday with a complementary glass of Prosecco!
Free soft drinks in the room. Beautiful smelling reception with all the plants. 
Asked for an iron and it came within 2 minutes. 
Location very close to mansion House tube station. 
Gentleman on Reception was lovely. 
Id left my make up remover at home and they even have that as part of toiletries.
Bed was super comfortable, black out curtains too.
Highly recommend!!",5,2021,05,28
135,Best London Hotel,"In terms of London hotels, I don’t think you could do better than the V&M. The location, style, service and overall atmosphere of the hotel was perfect. The staff were extremely attentive with no request being too big. We arrived early and reception kindly sorted our room so we did not have to wait around. The rooftop bar and restaurant is wonderful and gives you a great view of the London skyline. We have already recommended this hotel to friends. ",5,2021,05,28
135,Lovely hotel down a quiet side street,"Thank you for our enjoyable stay! We would definitely come back tk this hotel. A short walk to Mansion House underground station and there is a Sainsburys just round the corner for snacks, drinks or to get money out if needed. Good location, as it’s in the heart of the city. We got a good price £315 for 2 of us for 2 nights. For what we got, we felt this was good value for money. The decor in the hotel is smart and fashionable, very clean and modern. The reception area smelt lovely and the addition of real plants around the lunch area and reception was pleasing! The staff friendly and chatty. ",4,2021,05,27
135,Outstanding again,This is a great hotel. You feel completely cocooned in the centre of the city perfectly located for the West End now things are open. The rooms are well appointed and beds very comfortable. The restaurant has a small menu although the food and service are very good. The staff in the hotel make it nothing is too much trouble and are very welcoming. Once of the managers Dimitri is particularly helpful and always on hand to resolve issues.,5,2021,05,25
135,Quality!,"Excellent staff, friendly and helpful. Super breakfast delicious dinner and a huge thanks for the complimentary fizz for husband's birthday! Loved having the fridge, kettle and Cafetiere. Only one minor complaint: the lighting in the room can only be set at low, medium or high so impossible to switch off individual lights apart from ones above the bed, lights left on all night in adjoining office that the cutrain didn't shut out, room 506.",5,2021,05,23
135,Beautiful hotel with excellent staff in a great location!,This was a beautiful hotel and felt very boutique! It’s in a great location for all the sites and restaurants around Bank and London Bridge. But what did it for me was the excellent staff who really make you feel special and looked after. Highly recommended! ,5,2021,05,23
135,A hidden gem in the city,"What a beautiful hotel, hidden down a cobbled quiet street in the heart of the city. We stayed here for two nights in a suite with a balcony and the room was spotless.
The terrace restaurant food was excellent and a beautiful location on the 7th floor with an outside area.
The barmen were really helpful and created delicious cocktails.
Overall a great stay and excellent staff.",5,2021,05,20
135,Amazing! Highly recommend,"Would highly recommend. Really friendly staff, large super comfortable rooms that feel luxe. Lots of personal touches from the staff that made a birthday stay really special. The room had everything you need from a Bluetooth radio, robes and soft/ hot drinks in the room are complimentary which means you feel at home. Thank you so much! ",5,2021,05,18
135,Perfection,"Above and Beyond just Ticking the Boxes! Would very happily stay again and everything was perfect. Even excellent customer services. We had a free room upgrade, superb 24/7 service, additional items we were not expecting and more.",5,2021,05,17
135,Best hotel experience I had in London,"Everything was amazing at Vintry & Mercer, from the staff who helped me organise a wonderful birthday surprise to the room with a beautiful design and the hotel location, there's nothing I could have asked for more and I recommend this hotel 1000% 👍

Thanks for everything!",5,2021,05,17
135,Lovely 1 night stay!,"The decor is stunning and everywhere was spotless - including our room. The hotel is in a great location and staff on reception were really friendly and helpful. The rooftop bar is also worth a visit, we went for cocktails after dinner and it was a lovely atmosphere.
We hope to return soon!",5,2021,05,16
135,Best boutique hotel in London,"The staff were some of the most caring, professional and wonderful we have ever encountered. Thank you Christian for looking after us, Stefan and Mircea for greeting us and organising the surprise for my wife's birthday, Mireka and Patricia for delivering amazing breakfast, my post run fruit salad and room service and finally Aaron (and another Hungarian  waiter) from the roof terrace for being such great waiters and Aaron a pro photographer. You guys and gals were such a great team. Really, the best. My wife felt truly spoilt.

The hotel... Great location, five star quality (so quiet and with furniture and facilities if the highest quality materials) and top notch innovation (auto Aircon, auto lights, auto curtains, bath TV etc.), 7 star comfort (beds, shower, bath, services...).

You guys have set the London standard and I am glad we chose you above other five start hotels for my wife's birthday surprise. Hope to see you again and till then, keep flying the quality customer service flag high!",5,2021,05,15
135,Brilliant stay,"Quality, class, beauty throughout. We really enjoyed our stay and will not hesitate to be come back. The staff, food, service were of the highest standards. Thanks V&M for making our stay a delightful one. Can't wait to revisit. ",5,2021,05,13
135,Beautiful Room & 5* Customer Service,"Amazing staff, excellent customer service. We were given a free upgrade to accommodate our city side view request. We would definitely return. 5* Customer Service, other hoteliers should take note. Thank you!",5,2021,05,11
135,"Nice place, staff could have been better","The location and hotel are lovely. The whole experience was quite soured by the staff on our final day. After we checked out my partner was waiting in the hotel for me to finish work. I understand they need to be safe now so she wasn't allowed to wait in the lobby. However she asked if she could wait upstairs bar/restauraunt, she was told no, then when she said she would pay for something the staff member called up and said ""I have a girl who would like to sit"". She was very unhelpful and her reference to my partner as a ""girl"" was very rude. ",4,2021,05,11
135,Review,"Lovely place in a good area, not far from the tube stops at all! Shame about not being able to dine downstairs but can’t be helped, would definitely recommend. Food in Mercer roof terrace is amazing and the views are stunning.",5,2021,05,08
135,Lovely hotel,"Great hotel with lovely staff who made us feel very welcome.
Car park near by which was very helpful and is in an overall great location with lots of shops and Restaurants surrounding.

135,Great property and even better staff!,What a fantastic stay at the Vintry & Mercer hotel. Its a beautiful property with wonderful design throughout. Every colleague we met was great but Mircea in particular was absolutely outstanding and made the trip for us! We will be back :),5,2021,05,01
135,Absolutely fabulous place to stay,Staff were amazing following medical surgery. The standard of cleanliness is outstanding.  For certain we would not hesitate to recommend this hotel and we will be coming to stay again - without doubt.,5,2021,04,30
135,3 day stay for our wedding,"Excellent location, lovely room, staff were very friendly. A few niggly annoying things took the gloss off, such as a faulty fridge that didnt keep anything cold (and being told there was nothing they could do) and asking for things and arriving late or having to ask twice. We did get a free upgrade, which made our day more special.",4,2021,04,27
135,Another Wonderful Stay,"We've stayed at the Vintry a few times now, it's become our favourite hotel for business and leisure in the city.  It's got the quality and service of other hotels without the high price that usually comes with it.

The rooms are high end and perfectly clean, the staff are very friendly and attentive, and the location is great - everything you need within a few minutes walk, including Mansion House tube which is about a minute away.  ",5,2021,04,27
135,Lovely spot in city of London,"Excellent room, location and service. Highly recommend!
Very nice rooftop terrace for dinner or drinks. Room very spacious with small terrace. Large bathtub with separate shower. Overall staff very friendly and responsive.",5,2021,04,26

135,Lovely and worth it!,"Had a wonderful two night stay this past weekend. Lovely room, excellent service, reception staff - just the best. Had drinks at the Roof Terrace, staff just so lovely. Was a tad too busy Friday afternoon so had to wait a bit for drinks, but seeing as first week of ‘freedom’ from lockdown, it was busy, thus understandable. 
Thank you for a great experience, truly needed it! ",5,2021,04,19
135,Great hotel & location,"Very accommodating staff. Great hotel and location. Would absolutely recommend to anyone traveling through or for staycation! The roof terrace is amazing too! A smaller, better version of maddisons. Thanks ",5,2021,04,19
135,Amazing experience!,"Great stay  at this central hotel ,  would definitely re commend as so close  to  all sights  and restaurants,  the staff were very helpful and friendly and went out of their way to help , breakfast was served in the room which was a bonus!",5,2021,04,18
135,An Outstanding hotel In Every Way (*but don't tell everyone about this secret gem! ;-)  ),"As a business traveller I have stayed in the majority of 5* hotels in London including some of the most famous names. The service from the guys on reception was just perfect! A quick efficient and very friendly check in by (Hercia or Mercia I think his name was) was fantastic! We were allocated room 605 which is one of the superior King Rooms. Out of all the hotels in London I have stayed in this one sets the benchmark for style, elegance and superior service. I think I have found my 2nd home for when I am on business or Leisure in the capital. I love the decor of the hotel and the rooms, which are quintessentially styled with detailed references to the area's past fused with the present technology. I love the bedroom lighting and this hotel just oozes style and sophistication. I can't wait to return, well done Vintry and Mercer on an outstanding experience. 10/10.",5,2021,04,18
135,Most Memorable stay,"Vintry and Mercer has to be the most modern hotel I've stayed at in London. The room decor was beautiful with a gold, teal and marble colour scheme. The walk in shower was amazing with high pressure and great toiletries. The bed was comfortable and we were able to connect our phone to the TV to play music. The location is tucked away down the road from the tube station, next to a cathedral. If you don't like waking up early - you might need to request a quieter room, the cathedral bells start fairly early and are quite loud but don't go on for long. 

Staff are very helpful and friendly. Dimitri and Roulouka were always smiling and happy to help when needed. We couldn't ask for a more memorable trip. ",5,2021,01,25
135,Hidden gem in central London,"From the moment we booked the hotel, the excellent service began. We were emailed to ask if we had any special requests or services prior to arrival and we asked for extra pillows and towels which were placed in the room on arrival.

We had a warm welcome from reception and were able to check in straight away even though we were slightly early. Normally they would take you to your room but this was not possible due to COVID.

The room is quite stylish if a little small but the room was well appointed with a luxurious, comfortable bed and lovely bathroom with walk-in shower (but no bath). There was cafetiere coffee provided together with a range of teas and a soft drink complimentary minibar.

At breakfast, they lost our order and we ended up not having anything to eat but they more than made up for it and were very apologetic.

We ate in the rooftop restaurant for lunch and the food and service were amazing.  There were even pods outside that you could book. You have a lovely view of St Pauls Cathedral from the restaurant.",4,2021,01,15
135,Excellence,"From the moment I arrived at the hotel, the check in and then the room were all first class. The person checking me in (Dimitri) was warm and welcoming. Nothing was too much trouble and the orientation re the hotel (e.g. where the restaurant was, the precautions they were taking due to COVID etc) was delivered engagingly. The rooms are gorgeous and incredibly well planned out. The free soft drinks were a pleasant added surprise. On checking out the staff at Reception treated me in the same warm way.  In short - a wonderful experience!",5,2020,12,23
135,London Christmas shopping,"Very satisfied client, highly recommended. Clean, modern, top class hotel. 

Close to underground for ease of travel to central London. There is also small shopping mall nearby.

We will definitely come back ",5,2020,12,20
135,A special stay,"Amazing rooms, very spacious with comfortable beds. Great for special occasions with the amazing rooftop bar and being a 2 minute walk away from St Pauls Cathedral. We were also given complimentary gifts, champaign, a card and candle for my partners birthday. Thank you for a wonderful stay!",5,2020,12,17
135,Highly recommend,"The facilities are wonderful, the staff are so friendly, professional and go above and beyond. This hotel is truly a 5 star standard the best hotel stay I have ever had. I’ve booked to go back ASAP! Not to mention the location is perfect. ",5,2020,12,17
135,One night stay,We had such a lovely night the staff are so helpful and friendly and did what they can to make the stay special! Would 100% recommend. Lovely rooms and great location for exploring the city and central London. ,5,2020,12,16
135,Fantastic Hotel! ,"This is an amazing hotel, the customer service is excellent and the friendly staff can’t do enough to help out and make you feel comfortable.

It has a great location right near St Paul’s and with a tube station up the road. We have managed to stay here twice this year and will certainly be back as soon as we can! ",5,2020,12,15
135,Romantic getaway,"Absolutly fantastic stay and first class experience.  At check in I was slightly unhappy with my room, but that was extremely fast and professional sorted out by Mircea, who went beyond and above to make my stay extra special. In fact I have had such a lovely time that I have extended my stay with a second night. The roof top restaurant is quirky and very romantic, with beautiful food and cocktails. I would definitely come back. 

Aniela",5,2020,12,15
135,Great Stay,"Really enjoyed our hotel experience, very stylish and comfy hotel. Staff were incredibly friendly and welcoming, all seemed happy to work there. In spite of COVID still felt safe, good City location. Would recommend and would return.",5,2020,12,15
135,Incredible Amazing Staff,"My fiancee and I stayed here on the first weekend out of lockdown 2. I had decided that this would be the location to propose to my girlfriend, where Dimitri and the staff went helped in every which way possible, from allowing private access to the closed bar, to petals being put on the bed whilst we were out. Room was amazing, 100% clean and full of the mod cons, we loved the TV in the bath!

We would definitely stay here again and are very much looking forward to our return!",5,2020,12,14
135,Pure Luxury,"The perfect getaway! My favourite hotel in the UK! Outstanding! The staff are wonderful, the food is amazing, the hotel is gorgeous and the comfiest bed I have ever slept in! Great Gym, gorgeous rooftop terrace and next time hopefully I will get a chance to see the Speakeasy downstairs.",5,2020,12,14
135,Couples trip,"Lovely room, which was spacious, and a great bathroom and products. However, the superior room consisted of 2 single mattresses pushed together rather than one mattress, which you wouldn't expect for a 5* hotel at this price. Church bells go off every hour from 7am!! However, great service when needed.",4,2020,12,14
135,Needs improvement.....,"Great little boutique hotel with fantastic reception staff but general customer services needs improving. Ordered room service, after 40 minutes and 2 phone calls, it hadn't arrived. A call to reception and this was soon rectified. Good customer service goes a long way. This needs looking at. Room was clean though and fantastic bed.  Free soft drinks from mini bar was also a nice touch.",3,2020,12,13
135,"Fabulous hotel and location, will stay again","We normally stay at a different hotel but when staying there last time, it was a ghost ship so we decided to try Vintry and Mercer instead.  Very glad we did.  The staff were very welcoming and accommodating.  We will definitely stay here when we visit London in future.",5,2020,12,11
135,Average,"A beautiful hotel and room which was spotless but we were dissatisfied with the service and attitude of the staff. Our room had no heating and as you can imagine after being closed for a month, it was freezing, it didn't work so straight away we had to go out while the engineer fixed the heating. Didn't get an apology for it just sarcasm. Then my husbands shirt was ruined with limescale when it poured out of the iron before we were heading out. Again, zero apology and zero reduction in the price when we checked out or acknowledgement when it was brought up, just ignored. A shame as the room and hotel was beautiful but doubtful we would visit again due to the attitude of the staff.",3,2020,12,09
135,Birthday,"Hotel was perfect nicely tucked away but not too hidden, definitely worth its 5 stars ⭐️ staff were helpful pleasant and very welcoming.  The location is perfect walking distance from quite a few landmarks, myself and my husband have never been sight seeing in London before so enjoyed having a walk round and exploring. Then returning to the comfort of the beautiful hotel room everything you need en-suite queen size bed mini bar heated floors absolutely amazing , not the largest of rooms but  what you get is exactly what you need. Restaurants in the hotel are very nice roof top terrace is definitely worth a visit 😊 breakfast was amazing. Cannot fault the hotel only downfall no parking at hotel but found some 5 min walk away .",5,2020,11,27
135,Perfect Stay!,We stayed here in October for my wife’s birthday with our two year old son. We immediately got upgraded. The staff couldn’t be more helpful. We’ve stayed in great hotels before but we will remember always remember this holiday. Receptionist Reluka was amazing especially with our son who adored her. Mircea was extremely helpful and friendly. Massive thank you to Dimitri. Would certainly go back soon and can’t recommend this place enough.  Amazing hotel and amazing staff!,5,2020,11,22
135,Absolutely Perfect! ,"What can we say about this hotel, from the moment we arrived to a warm welcome from all the staff at reception, given a complementary upgrade and taken care of throughout the whole stay. Room was beautifully clean and comfortable. Breakfast was superb and a special mention to Mircea who was particularly helpful. We will be staying here again on our next trip to London. Highly recommend! ",5,2020,11,11
135,Fabulous boutique hotel!,"Had a little getaway here the weekend before lockdown and was not disappointed. The reception area is beautiful, very clean and like new (as is the whole hotel) and the man who served us was very friendly and helpful. Because it was our anniversary we were also given complimentary glasses of champagne which we could have brought to our room later on.

The deluxe double room was incredible for the price; the left wall was all floor to ceiling windows so we had a great view of The Shard. The decor is great and it has all the mods cons you need: Marshall speaker, different buttons to control the light settings/do not disturb sign, AirPlay to connect your phone to the TV, Nespresso machine. The bed was also large and very comfortable. 

We didn’t visit the rooftop bar but had a few cocktails at the speakeasy basement bar during happy hour which was also lovely! All in all, I highly recommend this hotel. ",5,2020,11,10

We will always stay at this hotel now whenever we visit London as it is the best customer service from hotel we’ve had in the city (and we’ve stayed in a lot of places).  We have received complimentary late check out on both occasions which we very much appreciated as it made our Sunday even more relaxing.  We used the gym on both occasions which has good selection of weights etc. Once again thank you all and we will see you again soon ",5,2020,11,02
135,Great stay,Stayed here on a Saturday night as a last hoorah before lockdown round 2 and had an all round lovely time. We had a drink on their rooftop bar too which had some lovely views across London. The hotel is a great location and there is reasonably priced car parking nearby at Baynard Castle,5,2020,11,02
135,Lovely stay,We had a fantastic stay at the Vintry and Mercer. The staff were amazing and nothing was too much to ask of them. They were quick to respond to any enquiries we had. Would highly recommend coming back here!,5,2020,11,02
135,Incredible hotel,"The photo's and reviews just don't do this hotel justice on just how fantastic they are. Myself and partner stayed here the 27th-29th October and were blown away from the moment we walked in. From start to finish the service we received was 5* and a breath of fresh air with the team ensuring out stay was perfect. We stayed in a superior double room and it was fantastic. The interior design and cleanliness of the room was even better than expected with loads of great features that added character to the room. The hotel is a 1 minute walk to the nearest Tube stop and is a perfect place to explore London. This really was a true 5* stay and if you get the opportunity to visit, then please do as you won't regret it.",5,2020,11,02
135,Birthday weekend,"Great hotel. We will definitely be returning. Rooms are so comfortable, very modern but cosy. Good food and atmosphere. Hotel feels luxurious but was very good value for money. Reception staff were delightful and really helpful.",5,2020,11,02
135,Perfection,"From the moment we arrived at the hotel me and my partner received the most incredible customer service.
Every member of staff I had interaction with went above and beyond to make sure that our stay was the best it could be and like we were the most important guests in the hotel.
The fact is that me and my partner bought two bath robes so we could wear them at home to help us deal with our holiday blues and keep us feeling happy until we can get back and have another get away at the best hotel either of us have ever stayed at.
Thank you to you all for the amazing work you did in making sure we had the best holiday we could have!",5,2020,11,01
135,Absolutely fantastic,"I have stayed in a lot of hotels in London but Vintry & Mercer is by far one of the best. Great Covid safety practices in place Excellent location. All staff were wonderful. We were very fortunate to be upgraded. The room had everything we needed and more. Cannot speak highly enough about this property. We will be returning 
",5,2020,11,01
135,Great find,"Really lovely hotel on the backstreets near Bank station - so easy for me to get to Oxford Street the next day for work. Really beautiful and comfortable room with lots of little, thoughtful touches. Staff and food great too. Can't fault it!",5,2020,11,01
135,The most friendliest of them all.,"I booked this last minute trip for myself to have some “me” time. As soon as I walked in the door I was met with a friendly smile and made to feel very comfortable. I was offered an upgrade and the room was spectacular, very clean! The bed was so comfortable I wanted to take it home with me. I would 100% stay here again. The food was spectacular, I highly recommend the steak, cooked to perfection. ",5,2020,11,01
135,Such a gem,"I stayed here two nights ago for my partners birthday. I couldn't have picked a better hotel. It is so lovely inside, with lots of beautiful plants and decorations. I was greeted by the most kind receptionist, I think his name was Mircea (sorry if i spelt it wrong!) - he was also there the next morning when we left our bags. What a nice man, he gave us two glasses of champagne sent to the room and a complimentary room upgrade for my partners birthday, then they sent a note and homemade sweets, really was a lovely touch. Thanks Mircea - your customer service was second to none, they're lucky to have you! 

The rooms are beautifully decorated. The bathrooms are gorgeous. The beds are massive (and so comfortable). They even had makeup wipes in a bag in the toilet, and also had a Nespresso coffee machine which did wonders for the next morning. It was honestly so lovely i think i'll have to go back.

Also shout out to Perry (i think this was his name) the maintenance man who was in reception when we picked up our bags. Started a conversation with us straight away, another really kind member of staff. Honestly, the staff are the best at this hotel, they go above and beyond.",5,2020,10,29
135,Beautiful interior and service,My boyfriend and I stayed here for one night and wish it could have been longer! The place is superbly designed and the room had great finishing touches with the most comfortable bed! Rooftop bar highly recommended - pretty lay out and 2 for 1 cocktails between  5-7pm. Friendly staff and it looks as if every detail has been considered.,5,2020,10,28
135,Wonderful stay,"Had a wonderful stay with my Wife.  The hotel is beautifully styled, perfectly clean and high end.  The location is excellent and the staff are great - couldn't have asked for more.  We stay around this area a lot and have tried many hotels, this ranks with the best, and is excellent value for money compared to the others.",5,2020,10,28
135,Vintry and Mercer is Amazing,"A lovely new and modern hotel, Home away from home, Mircea the Assistant front of house manager and his colleagues were very kind to us and our daughter and made our stay very special,  Rubber ducks for bath time and chocolates in the room.
The breakfast was substantial, lots of choices, great coffee made to order.  Our room the Studio suite was very spacious and the bed was big and comfortable more than enough space for 2 adults and a 3 year old we even got a small view of the Shard from one of our 4 windows, which all had blackout electric blinds and our daughter loved watching the TV in the bath, we also had a separate shower,  surprisingly quiet for being in the city of London, the hotel was in a perfect position to explore all the great sights in the east of London, close to Tower Bridge and well located for walking along the river and Borough Market and St Pauls cathedral. We will be back here no questions asked next time we stay in London. thanks again to the Vintry & Mercer team.",5,2020,10,28

Looking forward to returning very soon!",5,2020,10,27
135,Fantastic hotel!,"Stayed at this hotel for 1 night whilst we had a day planned in London. We arrived at 11:30am and our room was ready which was fantastic. The staff were so lovely and polite and kindly upgraded our room for free and gave us a glass of champagne due to one of our birthdays. 
The hotel and room itself are lovely. Everything is spotlessly clean and the room has everything you may need. 
Location was perfect as well. By far the best London hotel we’ve stayed in and can’t wait to come back!",5,2020,10,27

We stayed in superior rooms which were just lovely - good size, bath and rainhead shower, bathrobes and slippers, huge, comfortable bed, TV, wardrobe, umbrella, Nespresso, kettle etc plus a mini fridge with complimentary soft drinks. 
The staff were extremely helpful and pleasant and breakfast was delicious. Hotel is a short walk from Canon Street Station and St Paul's Cathedral.

Just a note - there is no room service on a Monday (impossible to find room service info on their website) so we ordered dinner in from UberEats instead, without any problem.",5,2020,10,27
135,Wonderful service,The front of house staff made our staff as comfortable as possible. Everyone we met did everything they could to alleviate our experience - and nothing we asked for was too much trouble. I would recommend! ,5,2020,10,27
135,Birthday,Wonderful hotel with great customer service. My daughter celebrated her birthday over the weekend they went over and above to ensure her stay was special. We booked a suite with a superior room with connecting doors. The suite has 3 tv which is unusual 1 in the bathroom which is a luxury touch. Complementary glass of champagne and birthday plate was amazing all rooms clean and top spec. Thank you,5,2020,10,26
135,Vintry and Mercer stay,"Had a wonderful stay. Outstanding quality and luxury. Lovely service. Had a room with a balcony, a bath with a tv.... The breakfast was great, the staff were pleasant and helpful. The location was very central. I ll definitely be back.",5,2020,10,26
135,A leisure London break under Covid conditions.,"Having stayed at this hotel in the past, we were wondering how it would feel under Covid conditions. We needn't have worried. The staff were as pleasant and friendly as ever but mindful of the regulations regarding the pandemic which were applied in an efficient but non obtrusive manner. The cleanliness of the hotel in general was very reassuring. ",4,2020,10,25
135,Anniversary Getaway ❤️,Myself & husband stayed here for 2 nights to celebrate our wedding anniversary. To our surprise our room was upgraded and the staff gave us a lovely card & serving of some sweet treats. The staff are incredibly attentive and friendly. All Covid measures are in place. The hotel is located down a very quiet street in London. Great to have complimentary soft drinks in a fridge. Oh I could go on it was just so lovely :0) Thank you for making our stay so memorable. ,5,2020,10,25
135,Excellent Hotel,This hotel is situated in a quiet location and only a 2min walk from Mansion House Tube Station.

The rooms are furnished beautifully with everything you may require.,5,2020,10,25
135,Luxury and amazing service.,"Fantastic hotel, beautifully appointed with interesting and quality furniture and textiles.  Staff were friendly, attentive and skilled in providing high quality service.  Food was delicious - can not fault anything. ",5,2020,10,25

The hotel is gorgeous, great location and amazing staff. We will 100% come back and stay as we think it was a great find!",5,2020,10,13
135,Impressive ,"My husband and I stayed here for one night and the location is perfect, but what is even more impressive is the customer service. The staff were very attentive, friendly, helpful and what you’d expect from a boutique hotel.
We received a free room upgrade which was wonderful and thank you again for this! 
The room was spotless, the bathtub huge and the view from the balcony was splendid. The complementary drinks went down a treat too. 
There’s nothing negative that I can think of and if you are looking for an amazing hotel with outstanding customer service then look no further. 
To the amazing staff at the Vintry & Mercer thank you and keep doing what you are doing. Again we were really impressed with the exceptional customer service, which makes all of the difference.
Jonathan and Tricia Elliott ",5,2020,10,12
135,5 star luxury,"Stayed in the Vintry and Mercer for 2 nights and we were thoroughly impressed throughout the whole of our stay. Beautiful hotel with lovely interior throughout as well as being incredibly clean. On arrival we got a free room upgrade to which we were extremely pleased (thanks again!). The room was impressive, lovely bed, bathroom and complimentary hot and cold drinks. 
All of the staff were friendly, helpful and polite from start to finish providing excellent service. This hotel is so close to all the amenities in London, not too far from St Paul’s Cathedral and the hotel is only around a 1 minute walk to the nearest tube station which we found very useful to getting around London. 
I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a break to London, we couldn’t have asked for anything more and I will definitely be returning on any future trips!!",5,2020,10,10
135,Lovely boutique hotel,"Great location.  Lovely rooms. Friendly and attentive staff. Definitely book to stay again. 
Close to many sights and restaurants in the City. The hotel is very clean, rooms were nicely designed and very clean. ",5,2020,10,10
135,Faultless stay,"We spent a wonderful night at Vintry and Mercer for my partner's birthday - having got a fantastic rate via Secret Escapes.  The hotel is less than two years old, and it shows - every part of the building is beautifully decorated, from the restaurant/bars to the hallways to the rooms themselves.  We were given a free upgrade to a superior room, and loved all the amenities - the bed was incredibly comfortable, the furnishings were of a very high standard and the overhead rain shower was exceptional.  As part of our deal we had complimentary champagne and macarons on arrival, and a delicious, wide-ranging breakfast the following morning.  Every member of staff we spoke to was also extremely polite and helpful.

Apart from a slightly sticky remote control to the TV, this was a faultless stay - and I can't recommend Vintry and Mercer enough if you want a luxury central London night or two away.",5,2020,10,08
135,Lovely boutique hotel,"The hotel is relatively small with a fantastic feel about it. 

Both the food and rooms are first rate and the staff are both friendly and attentive.

If you’re staying near the city it is a superb option.",5,2020,10,01
135,Excellent,"Every time I stay it is excellent:  value for money, location, service and quality of accommodation all mean that I will return again.  The only slight disappointment was that the roof terrace wasn't open on the nights that I stayed, but given the current circumstances, I have no complaints.",5,2020,09,28
135,Weekend trip,"Stayed at this little gem of a hotel and so pleased we did. Ideally situated a few steps from  Mansion House tube station. Staff were welcoming and friendly. Boutique hotel with gym, bar and restaurants. Dinner on the roof terrace was lovely but breakfast was amazing with the biggest baked beans I have ever seen! Price of drinks and food was good too.",5,2020,09,26
135,Excellent in Every Way,"Often, when we travel, we look for a special hotel, as beautiful as some of them are, they always lack something.  At Vintry & Mercer we found everything we could have wished for.

Each and every member of staff we encountered during our stay, were just lovely.  Polite, professional and welcoming.  Nothing was too much trouble and everything was carried out with a smile. People that care about their guests.
The hotel itself was so clean, as was our room, well done to housekeeping.  It was spotless.  We were lucky enough to receive an upgrade too, thank you so much, we felt really spoilt. It was most definitely the best-appointed room we have ever stayed in.  Every gadget and button in just the right place, the quality of linen and the overall ambience had clearly been well thought out.
The breakfast was great, the presentation and attention to detail as well as the host, who was so attentive.
You deserve every bit of praise.  Well done to you all.  Absolutely Brilliant.",5,2020,09,26
135,Hidden gem,"We have just returned home from a mini break at this hotel, the area around St Pauls Cathedral was new to us and we had a lovely time exploring this part of London. The hotel had reopened only a few days earlier and was quiet and relaxing. We had a superior room that was nicely decorated and had views to the old church next door (St James Garlickhythe). Breakfast was excellent and staff were super friendly. The only reason for not giving 5 stars is that the roof terrace was not open and therefore no room service either (Sundays).",4,2020,09,21
135,perfect city location,The hotel is perfectly positioned for a City stay and being just down a side street offers a calm away from it all vibe too. The roof top bar/restaurant is a definite with lovely views. The room we stayed in was very tastefully decorated with lovely touches and the bed extremely comfortable. The reception staff were so helpful. We had a brilliant 2 night stay.,5,2020,09,21
135,Disappointed,"Booked in for a weekend break with my husband for my Birthdays and can honestly say it’s the most disappointing hotel we have actually stayed in when visiting London. The rooftop closed at 21:00 and the bar was closed - why open it all facilities are not available. The room was tiny and dark with offices as our view. Given this was a 5 star and offered a roof too bad we thought perfect. We visit London a few times a year and in comparison to the Marriott - Hilton - Crowne Plaza and others this was the worse. Location wise too was dire - nothing around the hotel - nothing in the evening and no rooftop or hotel bar. 
I have never put a review on but given the expulsion have had this time I felt it was appropriate due to the lack of facilities lack of room space lack of atmosphere and location.",1,2020,09,20
135,Gorgeous 🖤,Beautiful hotel. Champagne on arrival. Ridiculously clean. Great staff. Great location. The restaurants weren’t open due to COVID so will definitely book back in when they are because breakfast was incredible! Cannot recommend this place more. ,5,2020,09,19
135,Lovely place,Very clean and tidy beautifully decorated. Highly recomend. Great staff very relaxing visit would definitely return again.  Resionable prices aswell. I visited with my partner a great place to unwind..,5,2020,08,27
135,Birthday vacation ,"I cannot believe I forgot to review this excellent hotel. Stayed here for 5 days on my solo birthday trip London. They gave me a free birthday cake for my birthday. The rooms are just excellent, bed is so big. The technology the room has is on another level. Their room service, especially the food from the restaurant is one of the best I had in London. I spent the whole day touring only to come back and order food from their menu. I am returning next year because I received excellent service. Thank you so much. ",5,2020,07,21
135,"Excellent Hotel - Very Friendly Staff - Great Food, Perefect Location","Amazing Hotel. Really comfortable, clean, super breakfast and really welcoming team. 
Wonderful views from the 7th floor roof terrece resturant / bar. Perfect central location near to the river.Good use of technology in the room.",5,2020,03,18
135,A great place to stay,"If you want a quiet room do request.  The baths are lovely so worth an upgrade if you like baths.  Go for a drink on the roof and make sure you ask for a pen to take home. Comfy pillows, big beds and great soundsytem ",5,2020,03,16
135,A fabulous hidden gem close to St Paul's cathedral.,"I have been wanting to stay here and my experience was better than anticipated.  The staff were charming, and so helpful when I arrived very early one morning before check in after a flight from the US, and gave me a room to take a shower and have a quick nap. I was given help to move my bags into my proper room and from there on out my stay at the hotel was wonderful. The rooms were very clean, bed was a very comfortable king and the fridge had all the stocked items one needed for a very comfortable stay. I'd definitely return for another stay! The roof top bar was great and I can imagine perfect for a summer cocktail. Sadly during my stay the basement bar DND wasn't open due to two private parties but this gives me more of a reason to return at a later date. Great hotel and perfect location for the Tate Modern, St Pauls, and easy walking to the Southbank and back over to Covent Garden and beyond.",5,2020,03,15
135,Birthday stay,"Hotel is lovely, very modern and stylish and generally very clean. Comfortable bed but nights sleep was interrupted several times by air conditioning unit blowing air directly onto face as situated over bed. Biggest disappointed was that the cocktail bar was closed for a private function but notice only given 24hrs in advance. Never a great approach to put private function priority over hotel guests, especially when you don’t have an alternative bar.",4,2020,03,15
135,Most convenient & friendly hotel in London,"My partner and I have pretty much stayed in every luxury hotel in the city and abroad. This by far has got to be the best in London. It’s like they’ve stayed in every hotel in london and taken notes on what to improve. For example, the TV has Apple TV connection, there are makeup wipes on the bathroom etc so very convenient. The staff are SUPER friendly and it’s genuine not just because they have to. Very helpful too. The roof garden is cosy. The rooms are quirky and luxurious. I have ZERO bad things to say about the place. Well recommended and the price is fair. Thanks guys, see you soon!!",5,2020,03,14
135,Perfect place to stay in the city!,"The location of this hotel was beautifully tucked away in the city that felt like a lovely escape! The decor was stunning as soon as you walk in and the staff were so welcoming and lovely! The room was absolutely beautiful and just perfect for a little couples weekend! Looks like the photos but better in person! All the amenties you would need in the room! I thoroughly enjoyed my stay here, Cant wait to go back and I would highly reccomend to a friend or family!",5,2020,03,09
135,Birthday Weekend,"Fantastic Hotel, great service, great rooms, great food, could not find fault, gem of a hotel in a great location. Will definitely go back and would recommend for a proper 5 star experience in the capital. Thank you to all the staff. ",5,2020,03,09
135,Special weekend break,An excellent hotel with beautiful furnishings and in an ideal location. The hotel is 50 yards from the Underground. Staff are friendly and I would highly recommend staying here. V and M is close to all major attractions,5,2020,03,09
135,Really nice boutique hotel in the heart of London business center,"Very clean and really nice rooms. complimentary coffee / tea and water/juice/soft drink and a little snack.
Staff extremely friendly and a really nice rooftop terrace bar and restaurant. Easy accessible 1 minute from Mansion House Tube station",5,2020,03,06
135,Nailed it!!!,"So, my partner and I stay in London weekly, so lets just say we have stayed in many hotels, particularly ones we get great deals on who claim to be around the five star range.
We had never seen this hotel before in all the times we had searched for hotels and as it was in price range and part of the SLH group we decided to take a punt and it DID NOT DISAPPOINT! 

I need to start with the decor - stunning, stylish and actually functional. It really is beautiful. Modern yet warm and comfortable - right up my street!

Now to the room - the bed was so comfortable and huge we had a really good sleep in the two nights we were there. I loved that the room even had a cafetiere as part of the tea/coffee selection (although the coffee actually wasn't nice). It was a fantastic feeling laying in robes and slippers with coffee on the go.
The bathroom was full of all the lovely extras you expect in high end hotels and had a great shower/bath.
All staff i encountered throughout the stay were warm and friendly and went above and beyond to help with anything they could! They even upgraded us on check in which we were so grateful for (thanks again) as we had cases us with us the extra room was a blessing.

Roof bar - lovely atmosphere - a great place to look over London and enjoy a drink
Basement 'speak easy' - a little too quiet for us but a cool place to have a cocktail.

Would I return? YESYESYES - I will be booking for my theatre stay in April, see you soon!",5,2020,03,05
135,Excellent stay at Vintry and Mercer,"The Vintry and Mercer represents a high vlaue hotel for a weekend stay in London. The location is good, service and support from staff very professional, rooms very clean, aspect good and nicely decorated. Excellent. I will be staying again.",5,2020,03,05
135,Business Trip,"Vintry and Mercer is a great hotel in a good location close to my office. 
The staff are friendly and very welcoming. The rooms are clean comfortable amd well equipped. The staff provide great service. ",5,2020,03,04
135,"Evocative city location with lots of character, extremely comfortable bed!","This is a beautifully designed hotel in many ways, in a great location. It's v close to Mansion House tube but we walked to the South Bank, West End, everywhere we needed to get to. Our room was extremely well-appointed with great touches, such as TV in the bathroom, fresh milk and one of the hugest, most comfortable beds we'd ever slept in! The only downside was a rather unfriendly welcome. I arrived before my husband, who was travelling in from Gatwick, and had to wait for him to contact the hotel to allow me in the room. I went for a drink in the first floor restaurant at around 5.30pm and they weren't v welcoming either, trying to send me to the bar downstairs which I didn't want to do. As a result, we decided against eating in the hotel and went out for dinner instead.",4,2020,03,03
135,Probably the nicest hotel I've ever been to,"The decor is amazing, the hotel is new so all feels fresh and clean.  It is absolutely beautiful inside, so cosy and great attention to detail.  Food was lovely, service great.  Good for walking into the City, London Bridge, Tower of London.",5,2020,02,26
135,Beautiful Hotel,"With so many hotel options in London it can prove to be very difficult to know which one to pick and to pick with any confidence. Well, at least that is the way I felt about 2 weeks ago as I scrolled for days through all the hotel options in London, looked at the rates, the locations, the accommodations, etc. The Vintry and Mercer was recommended to me by  a friend who had stayed there while travelling on business in 2019. So, on the strength of that recommendation I booked and while I was confident in his recommendation I still crossed my fingers. I should not have worried. This hotel is beautiful. It is in a great location with an underground station (Mansion House) a 3 minute walk away.  The design is stunning, the attention to each and every detail is apparent. The room was small, comfortable, also beautiful and immaculate. We ate at the rooftop  restaurant and liked our meals. If this hotel is within your price range you don't have to worry about what you will be getting as you will be getting close to perfection. So, just book it!",5,2020,02,26
135,Beautiful - great recent opening,"This is a super hotel. Everything about it feels like a lot of money was spent in a tasteful and elegant way, but room prices are surprisingly affordable. It's well located in the City, a few minutes from Bank and close to Mansion House and Blackfriars. Staff were charming and helpful, rushing to help me get my bags while a cab was waiting outside for me. Great addition to the City and would happily return.",5,2020,02,25
135,Hidden Gem,"Really nice hotel which we found on secret escapes.  Had never heard of it before and wouldn’t have known anything about it had it not been for secret escapes, but we will definitely return when we next go to London.

The reception has a lovely sort of cobbled entrance which is really cool, very attentive staff and keen to help and welcome you.  We arrived early and our took was free, complimentary soft drinks in the room is a great touch as often when staying in hotels you just need a drink but don’t want to pay through the nose for room service!  Bed was really comfortable and bathroom was also spacious and modern.  Wasn’t a great view from the room but hey we didn’t come to look out the window.  There is a rooftop lounge which we didn’t visit as didn’t have time but I believe there are nice views from there.

My only gripe would be the breakfast.  Although it was great that a continental breakfast was included i didn’t like how it was laid out in high tables which sort of felt a bit like everyone was breathing over it and nothing was refrigerated, there was smoked fish and yogurt which I would have preferred to have seen in some sort of cooled cabinet rather than in the open.  I also had a bacon and egg sandwich and the egg yolk seemed very pale, pretty sure it couldn’t have been a free range egg.  There was a good selection of tasty breads available also.

Location wise, I really couldn’t tell you where we were as we got Uber’s everywhere, although there is a shake shak up the hill which was amazing and a Sainsbury’s local if you wanted to buy snacks or anything.  It is also located in spitting distance of the underground so you could get anywhere you needed to if you don’t use Uber.",5,2020,02,23
135,Great Stay,"What a friendy efficient hotel,in a great location. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff.The hotel is spotlessly clean,with plenty of plants and quirky ornaments to add to the decor.We will definately be back",5,2020,02,23
135,Nice easy stay!,"A nice quiet hotel near St. Paul.  The rooms are clean and modern but with some character.  Free waters, sodas and some snacks are provided.  Modern bathrooms.  Accommodating staff.  This hotel is going to be my new place to stay while in business in central London!",5,2020,02,19
135,Great hotel,Great hotel In a good location. Rooms small but perfectly adequate. Nice and friendly staff. Great meal in the roof top restaurant staff were brilliant up there too. Breakfast was very nice with plenty of choice ,5,2020,02,17
135,Amazing!,"From booking, to arriving, this hotel is faultless. Staff were attentive and friendly. The bedroom was well designed, the bed comfy, all to a high specification. Roof top terrace bar and the Do Not Disturb basement bar were really good and can recommend the Martina cocktail. Can’t  recommend this hotel enough and can’t think of anything negative to say at all. Amazing hotel!",5,2020,02,16
135,Wonderful place to stay for access to city,"Stayed here for 3 days while working in the city. Convenient location, close to good restaurant choices. Very attentive staff and decent restaurants on site. Rooms are small but very well equipped with no shortage out outlets and USB charges. Highly recommended.",5,2020,02,13
135,Honeymoon,"We stayed at Vintry and Mercer during our honeymoon, upon checking in and going up to our room we realized we'd have no room for our luggage so we upgraded to a larger room which was absolutely what we were looking for. The room had a small balcony and quite a large washroom, and the WC was a significant size as well. The mini fridge was refreshed daily.
During our first night, we went out for dinner and then right back to the hotel's speakeasy for a few beverages. We actually spent a couple of nights at the speakeasy during our stay as we weren't ready to call it a night. The room service was always prompt with hot food and the drinks we always cold. I would recommend the hotel, for not only the cleanliness of the rooms and the excellent service but also the distance it is from the underground. My one downfall with the hotel is that where it's located, most bars aren't open on the weekends so you'll be taking a 15-20 minute commute on the tube. ",5,2020,02,11
135,Nice stay,"Absolutely great hotel with tremendously friendly and welcoming staff, beautiful rooms which come with a lovely bathroom and also an extensive complimentary minibar. The rooftop is amazing and so are the other bars/ restaurants!",5,2020,02,10
135,Lovely hotel,"This hotel is beautiful. Very calm and relaxing from the moment you walk in. The bedrooms are not huge but this is possibly because the beds are massive! The customer service was great, we were upgraded and at checkout there was no pressure at all to leave like in most hotels. ",5,2020,02,09
135,An excellent stay in a super location,I really enjoyed my stay here. The staff were incredibly helpful when my flight was cancelled and I couldn't recommend the place more highly with all staff being incredibly nice throughout my stay. The location was excellent.,5,2020,02,09
135,Highly recommended near Bank,"Described as a luxury small hotel, this really doesn’t let you down. It’s like we have found a little gem and will most certainly be returning. Very comfortable rooms and very stylish. The staff go beyond what’s expected and are so very helpful. Thanks V&M",5,2020,02,09
135,A Fantastic Find,"We visited the City of London for a dinner and some sightseeing. The hotel is perfectly situated for the City. It is modern, very comfortable, with excellent food and extremely friendly and well trained staff. A small but perfectly formed place to stay. One of the best hotels we have stayed in.",5,2020,02,05
135,Quiet oasis at weekends,Elegant hotel in a central location; well appointed and comfortable; friendly staff; very quiet at weekends (and hence good value); lucious and delicious buffet breakfast; highly recommended for a 'treat' weekend.,4,2020,02,03
135,Linda Reynolds,"Just got back from a fantastic 2 day break, the staff were extremely helpful and attentive,  the food was amazing and the view from our room was perfect, had breakfast in bed both mornings which was excellent, a lovely gem of a hotel that made us feel very special xxx",5,2020,02,01
135,Best hotel in the square mile!,"Always friendly and helpful staff. Nice rooms and an OK gym. A nice addition is the downstairs ""Do Not Disturb"" bar which I just recently discovered. Always helpful concierge service that has helped me out on more than one occasion .",5,2020,01,31
135,Amazing hotel and service,"Stayed at the hotel for 2 days for business meetings together with a large group.
I loved the hotel, the design, rooms and restaurants but most of all the amazing service.
They worked over and beyond for our stay to be perfect. Thanks
",5,2020,01,31
135,Nice boutique hotel,"Was in London for work and the hotel was conveniently located for all my meetings. The hotel and room itself was nice and clean and service was great as well. Didn't get a chance to eat at their restaurants but overall if you're traveling alone or for work, a great choice in the city.",5,2020,01,30
135,Lovely hotel and staff,"Would 100% recommend this hotel. Rooms are a tad on the small side - which is to be expected in London anyway. Staff were friendly and professional, we felt very welcome. The rooms were modern and clean, extra touches like the mini bar and radios made it feel premium. Would go back anytime I’m in London. ",5,2020,01,27
135,Vintage and Modern,"This hotel is very new and in great shape. While new, it has a historic charm to it. The rooms are compact but very well done with British style. The bed was very comfortable. The bathroom was small but nice. Loved the rain shower and the heated floor. The hotel had two restaurants and downstairs they had a speak easy themed bar. The food and service was very good. The one restaurant is on the rooftop with great indoor and outdoor seating.  They have plastic ""igloos"" during the winter to continue outside use. Staff were helpful and polite. It was quite quiet in the hotel, but may have been an off week. It is in a great location giving you central access to London and provides a lovely walk through winding back streets. Only issue would be if you like to use a gym when traveling. The gym was beyond small with 3 cardio machines and some weights. The room is the perfect size for one person.",4,2020,01,26
135,Exceeded expectations,"A brilliant find in London which will be my “go to” hotel now whenever I need to be in The City. Excellent location near St Paul’s with tube stations minutes away. Beautiful rooms, if a bit on the small side, and one of the best continental breakfasts I have ever had. What really sets this hotel apart, however, is the outstanding service from every member of staff. When you receive warm, genuine, efficient service like we experienced here it reminds you just how rare it is and what a huge difference it makes. Well done to you all at Vintry and Mercer. ",5,2020,01,25
135,Awesome,"Incredible smallish hotel with friendly staff that cares. Attention to detail. Escorted to room and shown all features, any call to reception answered immediately. Iron brought to room, room service etc...
I can’t recommend strongly enough this hotel. 
Nice toiletries, beautiful rooms with exceptional little touches of nic knacks, huge TV, amazing wood features. 
You can’t do better than this hotel. ",5,2020,01,23
135,Overnight stay for anniversary,"Can not fault this place.
Excellent location, truly considerate staff with fantastic customer service.Room has everything you could possibly need.Cannot fault.a real hidden gem. Continental breakfast lovely.",5,2020,01,19
135,Great hotel in great location near St Pauls....,"V&M is a true 5 star hotel in a wonderful location.  A great oasis, no sense of hustle and bustle.  The service is truly elite - all requests were quickly addressed.  The only area of improvement would be to add a few more cardio machines to avoid waiting in the gym area.",5,2020,01,15
135,Excellent but not perfect!,"Potentially my new favourite hotel in London; Position good - quieter than West End, but everything still in easy reach.
Room - really lovely, hard to fault.
Bed - extremely comfortable
Minibar - free, such a good move
BUT! Breakfast a bit odd; if you choose continental you can have free tea / coffee. If you choose full English you have to pay for each one. Seems a bit odd to me.
Anyway, would love to return.",5,2020,01,15
135,Excellent for a party at the weekend,"Really lovely property situated in the City of London, just beside Mansion House Tube. 
Was there for a party which was just great. Excellent facilities, polite, friendly and professional team. Excellent food. 
Room very well appointed.
The city at the weekend is great...quiet and there are plenty of place that are open, if not everything.",5,2020,01,13
135,Perfect London Getaway,"My wife and I spent a Saturday Night at this hotel, having booked it on a deal. 
Not yet a year old, the hotel is obviously very well run and the attention to detail is exceptional. We stayed in a superior room. 
The room was spotless and had all the amenities you could wish for including free coffee machine, soft drinks and snacks. 
The bed was enormous and very comfortable and the tv top quality. We enjoyed a complementary glass of champagne in the roof terrace, where we were lucky enough to shelter from the winter weather in a cosy pod and enjoy the views of the City. 
Continental breakfast was delicious too. 
We will definitely come back if looking for another short stay in London. ",5,2020,01,12
135,"Great location, quiet room, good features",Friendly staff at check in. Nice features in room like variable air con and light settings for different areas of room. 3 televisions was great too. Good bathroom and shower. Handy location for multiple tube station . ,5,2020,01,11

",5,2020,01,10
135,Great service. Super friendly and helpful staff. Worth every penny,All the staff are so friendly and helpful especially Rumen who helped us and introduced us about London and life special thanks to him and all the staff. The location is also topnotch mins away from the tube station,5,2020,01,07
135,Great value and location.,Great spot if your looking to stay in the financial area of London.  Beautiful interior design of the common areas and modern and efficient rooms complete with all the necessary amenities.  I will definitely consider staying there again.,4,2020,01,07
135,magical atmosphere,"magical atmosphere and impeccable service. Strategic position and well served by public transport. Subway stop within walking distance. With a short walk you arrive at the Tate gallery, at the Blackfriars bridge",5,2020,01,06
135,10 out of 10,"Truly amazing hotel with amazingly attentive staff they will make sure your stay is as comfortable as can be. Great beds, amazing ac, great bar in the basement. Really close to public transit and a lot of markets around London",5,2020,01,06
135,practically perfect,"I booked this as a surprise for my husband, and was my first experience of a boutique hotel in the City,  we were both blow away! The hotel is to a superb standard, the staff made you feel at home.  We had a deluxe suite, the bathtub was massive and has a separate shower.

So many intimate touches, the dressing gowns, slippers and the rubber duckies!  We loved it so much we can't wait to come back.  Its perfectly situated and really is a quiet corner that you wouldn't even know was there!  We visited all of the three bars, which are all unique and delightful. 

thank you so much and see you very soon!",5,2020,01,06
135,Amazing hotel,"We stayed here for one night, we were upgraded to a superior deluxe room and it did not disappoint. Massive bathtub, separate shower, his and hers sinks, balcony and a huge bed. Fresh milk in the mini bar was a great touch. The continental breakfast was impressive and delicious. The roof terrace was lovely, we enjoyed our champagne in one of the little pods, whilst seeing the beautiful view. ",5,2020,01,05
135,It's The Little Things,"This is an excellent boutique style hotel hidden down a narrow cobbled street near to St Paul's Cathedral. Check in was swift, efficient and very friendly with luggage taken to our room within a couple of minutes. Room was contemporary with lighting controlled by wall mounted touch buttons. Bathrobe, slippers and towels all gold embroidered with the V & M logo. A well stocked fridge offered complimentary hot and cold drinks which included soft drinks as well as snacks which were topped up each day. Breakfast offers a wide choice with both continental and a la carte table service. Staff throughout the hotel went out of their way to get to know you and make you feel most welcome throughout your stay. We had one small issue during the stay which was addressed immediately without question. This hotel equally matches those well known 5 stars establishments for service and an eye for detail. This hidden gem is well worth a visit.",5,2020,01,03
135,Lovely place to stay,"We chose the hotel as we hoped to see the New Years fireworks from the Terrace Bar and we were not disappointed!   The hotel was very nice, friendly attentive staff, good food in the restaurant and a wonderful room.  Bed comfy, great bathroom with all amenities including a rubber duck for the tub. The tube station was a block away. We would definitely come back again.  ",5,2020,01,02
135,Love this hotel A Lot! Great decor.,"I like the hotel most because of the rooms and the location. The rooms are well designed, I love the wardrobe, bathroom and the well designed and comfortable bed. In NY If you like the Bowery Hotel, Soho Grand or Roxy - this definitely is an equivalent. I got the best nights sleep at this hotel after traveling in Spain for a week - I slept thru the morning into afternoon without realizing it. I enjoyed my good nights rest so much- I reached out to the hotel 7 weeks later re: their mattress brand (Respa - very high quality custom made in Ireland) bc I want to replace my beds at home with this brand. The bathrooms are very nicely laid out, robes, slippers, extra amenities provided. The towels are plush. Fridge is stocked with real milk (not gross half and half for tea and coffee, water, sparking water and orange juice). Housekeeping folded my clothes and put on my bed (pictured) was very nice. Upstairs the rooftop restaurant offers nice dishes. The computer stations downstairs offers good security so any passed history or passwords you may have logged in automatically gets erased (which is good peace of mind). Walking distance are a variety of restaurants and a lots of coffee shops. I discovered a great indian restaurant (Brigadiers) nearby, Heavy traffic for lunch crowd on other side of Queens Victoria Street & alongside Cannon Street (lots of options) and Ned’s is in walking distance for drinks and people watching and for their food hall. Service is great.  I preferred traveling with via van from here & also bc it’s sometimes hard to hail a cab in this area - Via Van has a stop on Cannon St and it is pretty much the same price as the underground, but the hotel is conveniently located with a couple stations in walking distance). I will def stay here again and recommend it to everyone.",5,2020,01,01
135,Fantastic stay,"We stayed overnight 29th December at this lovely Hotel, staff were amazing, very attentive and always helpful and polite, the hotel was really clean throughout and nothing was too much of a problem. The roof top restaurant had excellent views across the roof tops of the City, with St Paul's on one side and the river the other. Scones, jam and cream that melted in your mouth are a must. Breakfast was continental which was more than needed although the Ala Carte menu provided a real treat. Well done Vintry & Mercer a definite treat well worth visiting - thank you for giving us a perfect two day escape",5,2020,01,01
135,Exceptional hotel,"I visited Vintry and Mercer with my girlfriend on Friday 20th December for our anniversary. We were blown away by the quality of the hotel, and service. Any questions I emailed they were more than happy to answer, and were incredibly accommodating(such as ensuring there was oat milk in our room). We were shown to our rooms and given a brief overview of the amenities. The mini fridge (which is all included in the price) has some soft drinks, juice and a few snacks in, including the aforementioned oat milk. Tea and coffee making facilities in the room were lovely. We went out for the day following check in, and when we got back there was a plate with a few biscuits on and “Happy Anniversary” written in chocolate on the plate. We ordered room service for dinner, which was very reasonably priced and came exceedingly quickly. There was a nice selection of films available to rent on the TV, and AirPlay and Screen Mirroring to sync your smartphone/device to the TV. The D&D lounge was truly lovely, the decor was exceptional and the staff (especially Pablo) were excellent. The cocktails were unique and the drinks list was fairly extensive. Breakfast the next day was also lovely, and checkout was easy. There were a couple of issues we faced but the staff rectified the issues to our satisfaction. Overall, our stay was excellent and we plan on returning in the near future, and I would highly recommend visiting Vintry and Mercer.",5,2019,12,25
135,New pin,"This new hotel located near Bank is fantastic.

Beautiful decor excellent room and friendly staff.

It has several bars including a speakeasy in the basement and a lovely rooftop bar. 

Great location near mansion house tube and near to many landmarks. Most definitely worth staying in.

Currently not on too many radars as its so new and offers great value.

135,Weekend Retreat in the City,"Stayed at the V&M for a romantic weekend and absolutely loved it - small but perfectly formed hotel, lovely location for wandering the city at the weekend and heading into the bright lights of the West End ! The room was great, the price was good and the staff were very friendly - will definitely be back",5,2019,12,23
135,I’m in love!,"After a disappointing stay at another boutique hotel my heart was filled completely when walking into the Vintry and Mercer. I’d called ahead to let them know that I needed to make a last minute reservation and insisted I really was looking for quiet and restful nights. They politely insisted I come directly to the hotel and they would work with me, even match the online prices. So said, so done and even better they threw in an upgrade.

This is how hotels do boutique - incredible service, amazing well equipped, quiet and comfortable rooms, excellent dining, bar and lounge spaces, centrally located and that feeling of being at home. No complaints at all. 

I will absolutely be back Vintry and Mercer! Probably sooner that I expect to. 

Thank you for an incredible experience!",5,2019,12,22
135,Lovely overnight stay,Great overnight stay. Staff were very helpful. Being a Sunday night got a good rate. Beautiful furnishings and quiet room. Great location not far from tube but quiet. Breakfast was good. Roof top bar looked nice as did speak easy but closed on a Sunday and due to weather,5,2019,12,17
135,John P,"Excellent find in the city! Great valve, lovely room on the 6th floor with great view, complimentary soft drinks, extremely friendly and helpful staff. Great base to explore the city, definitely would stay again!",5,2019,12,17
135,Superb hotel with exemplary service,"We stayed with Vintry & Mercer on a discounted deal and were really impressed. Lovely rooms, modern bathrooms, superb (and friendly) service from the staff. Great breakfasts - we opted for the lighter breakfast buffet, which was perfect.",5,2019,12,16
135,Best vacation experience,Thank you so much for making  our honeymoon so special. Dimitri went WAY out of his way to make our stay special. Beautiful hotel in a great location. We will be repeat customers. Thanks again for such great service!,5,2019,12,13
135,Beautiful Boutique Hotel,"Vintry & Mercer saved my vacation. After an AirBnB disaster, I was able to get my parents and I two (very) last minute reservations at Vintry & Mercer. The hotel is a little hard to find, down a bit on an alley in fact, but the location is great, just steps from Mansion House station and a few minutes walk to Cannon Street or Bank. 

The lobby has a fun greenhouse vibe with cool furniture. The staff were helpful at check-in and were even able to get us adjacent rooms on short notice. The rooms are small but very well appointed. They use CO Bigelow bath products and I appreciated the addition of single use makeup wipes and a loofah. There is a free minibar in the room, which is restocked daily morning/evening, which includes soda, juice, milk and water as well as popcorn and cookies. The decorations in each room are slightly different giving them an individual feel. A plug converter was provided in the room as well as a smart TV which you can connect to your device (this did not work for me but I did not ask for assistance so may have been my issue). 

I did not get to enjoy the rooftop or the speakeasy, but my parents said the speakeasy was very nice. They stayed an additional night on a separate booking and the hotel was very accommodating, letting them stay in the same room.

My only recommendation would be requesting a room away from the elevators. My room was the first next tot he elevator bank and it dings every time the door opens. The noise is very similar to the room doorbell so in the mornings I constantly thought someone was at the door. 

My normal preference in the City is the Andaz at Liverypool Street, but V&M will be the top of my list for my next stay in London.",5,2019,12,12
135,Gorgeous hotel with peace and quiet,"As a regular business traveler, I want a nice quiet but well-appointed hotel to stay in after long flights and long hours in the office. This hotel has thought of everything! Perfect fixtures, soft bedding, quiet rooms, a quiet location that is super convenient to the rest of London, and such wonderful accommodating staff. Anything you need they can help with! Will definitely keep staying here - ",5,2019,12,12
135,not quite 5 stars,"Attn to detail needed. Rooftop restaurant not up to standard.
lovely staff and amazing design of hotel.
Nespresso machine in room but no coffee pods provided. Sky tv not working. no drinking glasses in room.",3,2019,12,09
135,Lacked professionalism. ,"A beautiful Hotel with a great location. The rooms are fantastic and honestly the amenities are state of the art. Breakfast was delicious and the Bar downstairs was not bad ( I thought it lacked a little atmosphere but my wife told me it was fine!). Where it loses points is the staff, not that they were not nice they were but the total lack of training was blatant. Reception were very good but it went steadily downhill from there. Breakfast service was a disaster with customers openly complaining ( correctly) that they were not happy being left to wait while arriving guests were served before them. The bar downstairs staff sharing videos on their phones with volume on then having some kind of target practice from the other side of the bar! All in all a nice Hotel but if I was the manager I’d have a word with whomever is looking after the staff. 
 Would I recommend, yes probably. To be fair they were all very nice but lots of room for improvement. ",4,2019,12,07
135,Great Boutique Hotel,"Vintry & Mercer was a very nice boutique hotel at a reasonable price.  I arrived off of a red eye flight from the US and the staff was extremely accommodative, allowing me to check in early and offering a complimentary room upgrade which was very much appreciated!  The hotel offers good dining options and excellent service.  The location was perfect for my business meetings, but probably less so for sight seeing.",5,2019,12,03
135,The best in London you can find...,"It is a small, clean, charming and very luxurious hotel! The hotel is a short walk to Mansions tube station. The area around St Paul, Tower of London, Shard offers sights within short walking distance.",5,2019,12,03
135,Beautiful hotel,"The hotel is immaculate. There wasn’t one thing that was unclean, our of place or in need of repair. 
The staff were lovely. Polite and attentive but not overwhelming. 
The bed was very comfortable. There are free soft drinks and snacks and lovely bathroom consumables.",5,2019,12,02
135,One Night Stay,"My husband and I spent one night here for our annual Christmas shopping trip. The hotel is well situated in a quiet back road.
The hotels decor is beautiful we loved our room it was a deluxe and was a great size, the bathroom was great and the shower had really good pressure, free soft drinks mini bar is a great touch as most other hotels charge but the best part of the room was the quality of the bed linen and the bed it was so comfortable.
The thing that pushed my review into very good instead of excellent was that we felt it lacked security especially in the evening there were no door attendants when reception was closed there was absolutely no staff around in the main entrance, people were free to walk in off the street and just wander to the lifts and let themselves up! We stay in London and have never experienced this normally there are night staff just keeping an eye on things, I think thats something they need to improve on.",4,2019,12,01
135,Cosy and splendid,I could say Vintry and Mercer is the one of the top hotels I’ve ever stayed at. I have followed and chosen this hotel recommended by US magazine and not regretted at all. I would stay again if I visit next time with my family. Very close to Mansion House Station.,5,2019,12,01
135,One Night Stay for a City Dinner,"An excellent small City hotel with clean, comfortable accommodation. We were in a standard room which wasn’t large but was quite adequate. Very comfortable bed and for once, the room temperature was perfect. Breakfast was excellent.  ",5,2019,11,30
135,Perfection ,"Beautiful boutique hotel. Excellent service at check-in. Arrived early and our room was not ready, but they gave us a free upgrade. The complementary mini bar is great (free refills). The room is spacious and meticulously clean. A gem of a hotel. First class all around.",5,2019,11,29
135,Outstanding,"Excellent customer service. Great attention to detail. Requests are not considered an inconvenience and followed through with ease. Staff are extremely helpful , professional and courteous.  Rooms are spotless. Great location to underground. Fantastic stay. Will be my hotel of choice when travelling to London. ",5,2019,11,28
135,Love love love this hotel!,"Vintry & Mercer is an amazing hotel! They put a lot of thought into all the small, but important details, that are meaningful to me as a business traveler. I felt so well taken care of - from the amenities to room service to the friendly, helpful staff. Each night I came back to my room and felt like I had come back to a stress-free oasis. ",5,2019,11,28
135,Lovely Stay,"Overall it was lovely.  Great location for our needs.  Shame we had already decided to dine elsewhere as the complimentary champagne wasn't available unless we ate there.  Don't have a room on 6th floor if you want to sleep in on Sunday morning as the bar/restaurant above has a hard floor - all we could hear is furniture scraped across it from 7am.
Staff were super helpful.",4,2019,11,25
135,Perfect,"Took this hotel for a romantic geaway. Great staff and perfect location.
Loved the design and the quality of the room. Breakfast was the only thing that was a ""little behind"" compared to other services. Dont get me wrong It was fine but lacking a little creativty for such a great hotel.",5,2019,11,25
135,Excellent Hotel in London,"Great hotel, very good location close to the city as well as many restaurants and bars.

135,Fabulous hotel,We were very impressed with this modern boutique hotel. Great location in an area away from the usual tourist throng. The staff were lovely and very attentive - it was a birthday weekend and there were some nice personal touches from the hotel team. We will return!,5,2019,11,18
135,Excellent service in a good location,This hotel is trying hard to stand out among the usual chain hotels in the area. They put service front and centre and listen to customer feedback. The decor is a very nice modern twist on a  Jazz age/great Gatsby-esk vibe which carries throughout the hotel. Worth a stay.,5,2019,11,18
135,very nice chic hotel in zone 1,was for a work trip. I really liked the decor and amenities. Decently sized rooms. Friendly staff.  Also because of the cobbled road in front makes it look very historic(although it looks pretty new).  Location is very nice and so close to St. Paul and other attractions. ,5,2019,11,18
135,Another Perfect Stay,"So well situated, and within walking distance of many attractions. 
The actual hotel is refreshing in design, and not too big. Attention to little things, like fresh milk in the drawer fridge, makes a difference.
Staff are great, and impressive that the same staff on the desk from five months ago are still there. Happy staff mean very happy guests.
We were given a room upgrade, thank you much appreciated.
Breakfast has fresh tasty food, and a selection to satisfy. Impressive that they cater for all diets.
We used the sky bar, and again knowledgeable staff.
Nothing negative and highly recommended!",5,2019,11,18

135,Excellence,"If your are into great food, great service, great interiors and a great location then this is the place for you. Within walking distance to most key locations. Breakfast was fantastic and set us up for the day. Staff were extremely helpful and the interiors were pure luxury. This is one not to be missed.",5,2019,11,17
135,Great hotel for the city,"What a well designed hotel, love the attention to detail, attentive staff and cleanliness. Rooms are well designed and have everything you need, bed was slightly uncomfortable (hard) hence the 5 stars. Food was very good, room service has great options ",4,2019,11,15
135,Beautiful hotel with amazing staff,"I loved everything! Especially all the help we got from Angela at the reception and Roman. Thank you guys :)

135,Lovely hotel,"We chose this quite new hotel for a weekend birthday trip and it was excellent in every way. The room was extremely comfortable, the staff were friendly and helpful, and we loved the opportunity to explore and visit places in a part of London which is not on the main tourist route. And it happened to be the day of the annual Lord Mayor's parade.",5,2019,11,11
135,A welcome addition to the area,"Such an elegant and sophisticated hotel. The staff, friendly and welcoming. Its location is a couple of minutes down a quiet street, just minutes from the tube station. My room was spacious and a classic decor of velvet curtains, grey/green paint and mulberry fabric headboard. Continental breakfast was a variety of fruits, breads, pastries and a hot breakfast was available for an additional charge. At night, it was a warm and tranquil place to relax in but well within reach of all the life and noise London throws at you.",5,2019,11,10
135,"London, The City","Great last minute stay , friendly & professional staff.  Everything you could need was available in the room and also plenty of  complimentary soft drinks/tea/coffee etc.

Great stay, would highly recommend it!
Also worth mentioning that gluten free bread was available at breakfast.

135,Birthday celebration ,"Visited with my husband to celebrate his birthday. Receptionist very pleasant check in efficient and we got an upgrade which was appreciated 
Lovely room quality finish and feel to the hotel. Complimentary soft drinks and a turn down service
We had lunch in the hotel the menu was quite limited the waiter recommended the shrimp sandwich as my first choice was unavailable 
My husband had the bento box sadly no alcohol free beers on offer 
Lunch was very tasty but quite pricy and we were the only ones there
Evening we had a glass of wine upstairs and a coke as again no alcohol free beers available 
Food smelt good and looked nice going to a table behind 
Sadly due to rain we couldn’t go outside to see the view

Unfortunately my stay was rather spoilt by the most miserable employees working in the ground floor restaurant. I ordered steamed bao-bun Florentine; one egg perfectly cooked, the other hard boiled. The food was also cold so I sent it back and settled with a coffee. When the bill came the dish had not been removed. The waitress was unapologetic and seemed confused that I would expect not to pay for a dish I sent back immediately without eating. Thankfully an equally miserable supervisor agreed to remove the dish from the bill, however I was left very disappointed with the service I received. ",5,2019,11,09
135,Top notch hotel in a great location,"This property is finished to a very high standard, but comes with a price tag to prove it. Mixed opinions about the dining options - basement bar was great, rooftop restaurant underwhelming. Rubber duck in the bathroom was a nice touch ",4,2019,11,08
135,Little things mean a lot,"Great location, nice rooms, and truly outstanding service.  Staff couldn't do enough for us, and did it with a smile.  Perfect in every detail, including the complimentary soft drinks, tea and coffee, good choice of TV channels and quick and efficient house keeping and in room dining facilities.",5,2019,11,06
135,Husbands Birthday City Break,"We came here for past of my husband’s birthday city break. It was a seamless experience from arriving to the end. It was an excellent stay where we will definitely be booking another stay. The suite we stayed was one of the best we have been in, with fantastic eye for detail. The restaurant on the top floor was an intimate experience, a special shout out to Andrea for the excellent service, him and his team looked after us with the best steak we have had in London. Thank you for such a wonderful short city break. Location of the hotel, staff, experience and décor throughout the hotel top top bottom could not be faulted!",5,2019,11,05
135,Lovely stay!,The hotel is new and modern. Everything in the hotel is done to a high standard and small touches such as fresh milk and an umbrella in the room show they’ve thought of everything. From booking to leaving we felt appreciated at every step. Thank you.,5,2019,11,04
135,one niight in the City,"Great location and splendid decor in an historic part of the City of London.  Views from roof top are spectacular.  Food in the cafe/bar was simple  but very well cooked and presented.  Very close to the Mansion House tube/underground and close to both St Pauls and The Mansion House, home of the Lord Mayor of London in the other..  St James Garlickhythe is next door for quiet contemplation and prayer but also a lovely Wren church",5,2019,11,03
135,Simply stylish,"Lovely hotel with all the amenities you need and some lovely little touches

Excellent breakfast, great service and super stylish decor.  Great location especially if you’re exploring St. Paul’s and the City.

My only critics would be that the room was on the tiny side but for 1-2 nights this isn’t a problem.",4,2019,11,03
135,Traditional values and service in a contempory and modern environment,We stayed for three nights as we had a family wedding and two business meetings to attned during our visit to London. Every detail was perfect and the staff were extremely polite and attentitive without being intrusive. The location is quite and peceful whilst being superbly located for city meetings. The food is lovely and the breakfasts superb and varied. I would highly recommend this delightful hotel and will definately book agin for our next trip into London.  ,5,2019,10,31
135,Spectacular New Hotel,"My wife and I shared our first visit to London here and we loved every bit of the experience. The hotel staff was phenomenal. The room was better than expected and we expected a lot. Everything is new. The TV Entertainment system coupled with the Marshall Bluetooth speaker was a nice touch. The TV offered a seamless way to cast videos from your mobile phone (both Iphone and Android). The king size bed was the most comfortable thing I've ever slept on. We enjoyed the Nespresso in our room. The bathroom was immaculate - the heated floor was appreciated. Room service was prompt and the staff came by twice a day to offer turndown service. There are electronic features in the room that allow you to signal to staff that you'd prefer privacy. The electronic lighting system allows you to dim the room to exactly your specifications. The rooftop terrace restaurant was very nice. There were a bunch of nice, brand-new restaurants right around the corner. Perhaps best of all, the Mansion House subway station is at the end of the block allowing you to explore all that London has to offer. Overall, this is one of the best hotel stays we've ever experienced and we hope that the next time we come to London, the price will remain reasonable.",5,2019,10,30
135,Overnight Stay,"Brilliant, just as good as sister hotel! Very welcoming and enjoyable, staff seemed dedicated to providing a comfortable and happy experience. Location, décor, comfort and ambience could not be faulted!",5,2019,10,28
135,Vintry and Mercer Hotel Review,"Amazing! if you have the opportunity to stay here- it is an absolute must. The room is great, bed is fantastically comfortable, and the service was second to none. The hotel was clean, and new and it was a fantastic stay. Would highly recommend this hotel if you are travelling to London. Mansion Metro station is a 1 minute walk and connects you to all neighbourhoods in London. Absolutely outstanding! ",5,2019,10,28
135,Victorious Vintry,"Fab hotel, fab location. Rooms impeccable. 2-min walk to Mansion House tube station. Surrounding area v picturesque  & less manic than some other area's. Special hotel. Will definitely return without a doubt",4,2019,10,28
135,"Great service, small room",A very friendly and professional staff that helped serve all our needs.  Location is good and within walking distance to a lot of restaurants as well as London bridge and tower of London and tower bridge.  Enjoyed the location.  Just wish the rooms were a little bigger.,3,2019,10,28
135,Perfect hidden gem,"As soon as you book, you are treated as a guest. The rooftop bar is a dream, the service and quality of the finish in the rooms and public areas is top class. Little touches like the Marshall speaker in the room and the quality of the bath products. Highly recommended.",5,2019,10,28
135,Amazing attention to detail,"A great hotel. Wonderful rooms with lovely decor. The stay starts, though, as soon as you book. The hotel email you with useful guidance and also questions aimed at making your stay ideal for you. This level of personal approach makes a real difference. Great staff, breakfast and quality. My new favourite in London.",5,2019,10,27
135,Classy and Trendy,"You walk in to the building and are immediately greeted and welcomed. Upon check in they ask if you need anything and then the greeter gives you a tour of the building and explains the entire layout of the room, amenities and the overall facilities of the place.",5,2019,10,23
135,Excellent Three-Night Stay,"The hotel is in a very good location. Not busy with tourists and quiet, especially at weekends. The hotel was extremely clean, quiet and well maintained. Staff were very professional, courteous and helpful. Couldn't be faulted.",5,2019,10,23
135,"Lovely hotel, wonderful staff",Super stay at V&M.  Convenient location near to Mansion House underground.  Lovely room which was upgraded on arrival.  Friendly staff (especially in the bar) who couldn't do enough for you.  Didn't sample the food except for the continental breakfast but what we saw leaving the kitchen looked good (as was the breakfast they provided).  Definitely recommend and would definitely stay again.,5,2019,10,22
135,Absolutely perfect!!,"My husband and I stayed here for several weeks on business, and I can honestly say it’s the best hotel we have ever stayed in (and we just finished an 18 month round the world trip prior to going back to work, and have traveled extensively for decades). The rooms are beautiful and very quiet, and not a thing was missing; there was coffee and tea, drinks in the fridge, popcorn and cookies, Nespresso machine, newspaper delivered in the morning, bathrobes (an absolute must for me), even washcloths, which are hard to find in this part of the world. The shower was excellent, the beds very comfortable. All the staff are incredible, the most kind and yet professional I’ve ever come across. We had dinner and drinks on the rooftop terrace a few times; beautiful food and view! 
The only bad thing I can say is that no other hotel measures up to this one, which is very frustrating! ",5,2019,10,21
135,Thames Gem,"What a find. This gem of a boutique Hotel, nestled between the Thames and St. Paul's Cathedral lies down a quiet cobbled street, steps away from the Mansion House station. The rooms were of more than adequate size, though we could have used a bit more drawer space during our weeklong stay. They were stylish and comfortable. The staff were particularly pleasant and helpful. It was a great home base for our daily excursions from Southwark to Kew Gardens. We always felt safe returning to the neighborhood even in the wee hours. We will clearly return when next we are in London.
",5,2019,10,19
135,Perfect,"The hotel is designed beautifully, perfect for its location- the staff were incredible, especially the young porter on reception, so polite and welcoming. The room was in pristine condition with great views and so romantic, they even left a fantastic little plate of goodies to celebrate our anniversary. It’s a stones throw from the river so we went for a romantic walk for lunch the next day- a short taxi from Kings Cross and 2 mins from the tube it was ideal! We will definitely be returning!",5,2019,10,19
135,My Birthday Weekend,"Looked forward to very much....my birthday weekend in London with my daughter.
The hotel was not a disappointment. Amazing and convenient location. Beds were so comfy and pillows/ bedding luxurious.
We had cocktails on the roof terrace which was very relaxing. The staff are superb, brought out sumptuous blankets as it was a bit chilly. Breakfast in bed delivered on time. 
The only downside is the rooms are very cramped. Everything is total quality but just a bit stretched to put anything anywhere. 
I would however highly recommend and would return.",4,2019,10,19
135,Beautiful Boutique Hotel,"The hotel is beautiful. Lots of plants and very unique decor. Everything was of the highest quality - from the iron to the blow dryer to the shampoo and conditioner provided. The bed was extremely comfortable, and I absolutely loved how you could dim the lights in the room to a different brightness. We ate breakfast there both mornings. The coffee was wonderful, the service was great, and the food arrived quickly and was of great quality. The employees were very friendly. The door man greeted us upon arrival, as well as carried our very heavy bags to our room. He took the time to point out the amenities available to us, as well. He even asked us how we were doing when we went out for the evening and offered us an umbrella. High quality hotel with extremely well dressed employees and high quality service. Twenty minute was to Tower of London and Tower Bridge. Less than 10 minute walk to Underground. Awesome location. Definitely recommend!",5,2019,10,18
135,Perfect Business hotel,"Very nice and good located boutique hotel near Bank. A big plus is the complementary mini bar (non alcoholic) and snacks. The hotel also runs 2 very nice restaurants. Very close to public transportation (mansion house, Bank as well as Cannon street)",4,2019,10,18
135,Treasure of a London boutique hotel,"Friendly, polite and helpful staff, chic and elegant yet comfortable environment. Incredible daily breakfast buffet. Beautiful city rooftop views by evening, Best location in London with bustling, fun weekdays and peaceful weekends. ",5,2019,10,17
135,"Perfect location for the Tate modern, very stylish and good service.","Very stylish small hotel hidden away near St Paul's, and convenient for the Tate. Good relaxed service, good food (surprised the restaurants weren't busier), and reasonable value. I really don't like Trip advisor forcing me to write more than 200 words.",5,2019,10,14
135,City of London treasure,Lovely boutique hotel charming location. Super staff. Technology savvy. Small rooms but so comfortable. My room was standard queen and too small with no storage for a couple. I would upgrade to a larger for my next stay!!!,5,2019,10,13
135,GREAT HOTEL....POOR BREAKFAST,"Stayed here 11th & 12th October. The hotel is in a great location for The Globe theatre and many other attractions. It is clean and the reception and booking staff were extremely attentive and came back promptly in response to emails and questions....brilliant. Our standard room was very small with not much space at the sides or end of the bed..... but that doesn’t really bother us but it might for some people. We had our window open during the night as we like our room cool and like the fresh air however we kept getting wafts of cigarette smoke so i suspect there is an area where people smoke below our room. However, my big complaint is the breakfast. On the first day it was fine.....full assortment although we did have to ask for extra crusty bread to be replenished. On the second day it was dreadful. We came into breakfast at 10.15am (closes at 11am) and were told the only chopped fresh fruit available was watermelon and pineapple.....all the melon, grapes and kiwi had gone! Also all the crusty bread had gone. We said we’d pop to Sainsbury’s (5 min walk away) to get some bread which then prompted a member of staff to go and get some although this wasn’t communicated to us until we complained to the reception staff. All the boiled eggs had gone and we asked for some but these never materialised?! One member of staff was asked from another customer for bread and he just dropped his head in his hands as clearly couldn’t cope. My husband asked again for the bread and was told I’m just temporary staff and it closes in 30 minutes and that he didn't know what to suggest??!! All the croissants and pain au chocolate had gone too. The crusty bread did eventually show up but it’s a shame they couldn’t buy some melon, kiwi, grapes, croissants and pain au chocolate too.....they all would have at least a day or two shelf life to use for the next days breakfast? Such a shame as it set us off for a bad start to our day rather than it being relaxed. Shame as all other parts of the hotel were great and had a luxurious feel. I did ask to see the manager just to pass on my feedback but they never turned up despite us hanging around for a while whilst finishing our coffee. Don’t like TripAdvisor reviews to be a total surprise to the manager but unfortunately I could do nothing  about this.",3,2019,10,13
135,Comfort & Charm ,"My partner & I really enjoyed our stay at Vintry & Mercier. We had a standard room which wasn’t too small and felt luxurious. This hotel is very new and in great condition. The decor is lovely and the room was very clean. Loved the nespresso coffee machine in the room. The mini bar is replenished with snacks and beverages every day and was complementary. You’ll find interesting books to read in each room. Excellent shower and bathroom. Great level of service and food quality. Definitely try the rooftop restaurant for a dinner. The hotel has a very good location with lots of interesting sights in walking distance and super easy access to the tube station. 
We stayed with the hotel twice during one trip - and they were happy to store our luggage for us while we visited other parts of the country and then returned for the second leg of our stay. ",5,2019,10,10
135,Michael,"This Hotel is perfect.

This is our second time we have stayed in the last 2 months, the location is great and close to all attractions. 

I don't think there is anything I can fault.

Thanks for a great stay",5,2019,10,09
135,"Nice new hotel, but not 5 star service","The trouble with star ratings is that they tend to be awarded based on a checklist: concierge? Check. 24 hour reception? Check. Restaurant? Check. Elevators/lifts? Check. etc.  And on this basis, Vintry and Mercer gets a 5-star rating. 

But on the actual delivery of 5-star service, the hotel falls a bit short. ""Confused"" would be the best word to describe it. Confused at breakfast (where many items were missing from the buffet and menu), confused when travelers ask questions about the area (sorry, no clef d'or concierge service here, at least that we saw). Confused bell service (a nice young man who managed his memorized welcome-to-your-room spiel in English, but wasn't able to answer questions...at least in that language). Confused doorman (who asked if he could store our bags on departure (but did not offer to help with the bags when our taxi arrived).

The location is great for the City of London, St. Paul's, Tate Modern, etc. And the Mansion House Underground station is literally steps away.",4,2019,10,08
135,Weekend,"A very good hotel located close to London Bridge, Tates and St Pauls Cathedral. Standard rooms very small but sufficient if you don't have a large suitcase. Cosy Environment and very friendly staff. Breakfast limited and needs to be imroved. Nice restaurant on the top with a terrace.   ",4,2019,10,07
135,Excellent from start to finush,An excellent stay. Staff were extremely friendly and attention to detail to an exceptional level. Comfy rooms and excellent breakfast. Congratulations to all the staff on their excellent work. Good location near to Mansion underground and St Pauls around the corner for connection to tourist buses.,5,2019,10,07
135,Very good overnight stay,"We stayed here for one night and we arrived early, but our room was not ready. We were greeted warmly on arrival and  they stored our luggage and as we had things to do, this was not an inconvenience.

We were also dying for a coffee and this was not a problem-The coffee was excellent by the way.

When we returned, our room had been allocated and our luggage had already been put in our room, which was good. The room was luxurious in its fittings and fixtures, the bed was extremely comfy as were the pillows.

When we returned from the theatre,again we wanted a coffee and although the kitchen was shut, the night staff arranged for us to have some coffee,which is going the extra mile.

We had breakfast at the hotel which was very tasty and reasonably priced for London, considering the foot was freshly cooked., but although not busy the service was slow even allowing for the food to be cooked and it is for this reason that I have not awarded 5 stars.

I have to say that nothing was too much trouble for the staff and every comfort was attended to.

We will certainly return to this hotel, possible for a weekend and would encourage others to do the same.",4,2019,10,06
135,Disappointed,"We were disappointed with our stay. No way is this hotel 5 star, its very nice but have stayed in better 4star. We were hoping to eat in the roof top restaurant on Sunday evening only to find that it was closed as is almost everything in the City on a weekend. We even had difficulty getting a taxi, hotel tried without success so thought we would walk up to main roads to get one, 10 mins later we were succesful. A lot of taxi drivers, and we used many, didn't know the hotel existed. Its ideal if you have business in The City, but wouldn't recommend, if on a social visit especially on a weekend.",4,2019,10,04
135,Excellent hotel and location.,"Where do I start. I arrived at Mansion Station from Gatwick after an Italy trip for 3 weeks. Very easy to get to the station. Then it's literally roll your bags down a gentle slope about 80 meters to the hotel.

I was a little concerned it being so close as they tend to be a bit hmm, bit I shouldn't have worried.

Your greeted just inside and the reception just to your right. Staff were very friendly and welcoming. Our check in person was from a little island we'd just been too so was nice to have a quick chat.

Our bags were brought up to our room which looked like it had been renovated as has the whole hotel.

Just a nice room, big enough with a couple of chairs to chill in. Tv is a smart tv and had no issues mirroring our phones for some Netflix series we'd been watching. They do have movies though. Bed and bedding is excellent, so comfy.

Having travelled we were in need of some clothes washing, they do have a service but no laundromats close by you can do yourself. No problem clothing shops are an easy 5 to 10 minute walk away or tube into the city.

Nice view over the roof tops and quite. Blinds let enough light in and had block out curtains which were 95% effective.

Just so easy to get around with the tube being so close.

Rooftop terrace for our last lunch which was nice. Not cheap but the food and wine was excellent.

Checking out was painless and I really was sad to leave. Easy 1 hour trip to Heathrow airport, far quicker than a car and just one change.

Perfect hotel for an end of holiday stay.

Sorry just one photo of my lunch. Should have taken more.",5,2019,10,03
135,Beautiful hotel/service and what a location!,"Literally 5 minutes walk from St Paul cathedral and 10 minutes from Borough market, what a find. At the end of a quiet street it is such a nice property. Great staff, fantastic rooms and to top it all a great restaurant with views.
I highly recommend it !",5,2019,10,03
135,Visit yourself !  We Definately will be returning,"This hotel was a great find !  Hidden away near st pauls and a 1 min walk from mansion House this hotel ticks all of the boxes.  The staff upon arrival were pleasant and we could check in early. Our room was on 1st floor and although we didnt have a view (we could see a wall of building next door)  we didn't need it.  The room was lovely, but small and had everything we needed for a luxury one  night stay.  There is a roof bar which was open until 11pm with friendly chatty staff and low music.  The speak easy in the basement was unfortunately booked out for a private party which i wish we were told of before we arrived but the drinks were good in the other bars. Breakfast was also exceptional and costs were your standard london prices (10-12 for a cocktail  same for breakfast) .  Its a 10 min tube ride to london west end and st pauls, bank, cannon street, london bridge and liverpool street and very close by.   I am glad i paid the extra to stay in a hotel like this. .  ",5,2019,10,02
135,Highly recommend this boutique hotel,This is an excellent boutique hotel. It is in a great location - only a short walk to the millenium bridge over the Thames. The hotel is very clean and fresh and the service is excellent. We were able to check in very early after a long flight at no additional cost. Breakfast was included in our stay and was excellent. We didn't get to go to the rooftop restaurant/terrace but it looked lovely. I would definitely stay here again.,5,2019,10,02
135,A Marvel,"Perfect location, new lovely property, immaculate staff.  Next door to a quirky Christopher Wren church, within 5 minutes of the Tate Modern and quietly tucked away on a funny little street called Garlick Hill.  Nice wine bar on the first floor, and a great view from the rooftop restaurant.  Pricey, but worth it.",5,2019,10,01
135,Lovely Hotel,"I stayed two nights and will definitely stay here again.  It is really conveniently located near the Mansion House tube.  Very easy to walk to the Tate Modern, St. Paul’s and other sites.  Not too much going on during the weekend directly near the hotel but since it was easy to get around, I didn’t mind.  The room was small but well-appointed.  Unlike small rooms in other hotels, V&M rooms did the most to maximize usability and make it feel luxe (e.g. heated bathroom floors).  The staff was really friendly and welcomed you each time you returned to the hotel.  The rooftop bar is a really nice space.  I really didn’t have any complaints.

London hotels are expensive.  By London standards, this hotel was a good price for what you get.",5,2019,09,30
135,A little gem in a great location,"Staff were friendly, helpful and professional. Room was beautiful, very comfy bed, lovely toiletries, magnificent TV. Great choice and quality of breakfast and served till 11. Rooftop and basement bars were both brilliant - great atmosphere.",5,2019,09,30
135,Tiny twin room,"This was the tiniest twin hotel room I've ever stayed in. The beds were pushed together and we only had separate duvets. Though I do have to say the beds and pillows were very comfortable. 

Staff are great and can't do enough to help.

135,Great Stay,"Beautiful, well presented hotel with warm, welcoming staff in a very accessible location (close to Bank and Mansion House Underground stations). Our room was sparkling clean and comfortable, with a great bed and minimal noise from the city. ",5,2019,09,29
135,A beautiful boutique hotel with excellent service,"I really enjoyed my two-night stay at the Vintry and Mercer. Check-in was efficient, service was friendly, and the WiFi works like a bomb. The hotel is beautifully decorated and very conveniently located, close to a number of tube stations. The coffee is excellent and the breakfast was good. Ten out of ten.",5,2019,09,27
135,September London trip,Vintry and Mercer is a beautiful hotel with fantastic service from the moment we arrived. The only criticism I had is that the ground floor rooms are a bit noisy with the restaurant- if I were to stay here again I would request a higher floor. Overall fantastic and very impressive property ,5,2019,09,26
135,Hidden gem,"So glad my Husband booked the V&M for our 2 night stay in London.  
Wow it is just beautiful, love love love the decor, staff brilliant, comfy bed and quiet.  Great location too (short walk to underground and St Paul's Cathedral), we will definitely be back, I wouldn't want to stay anywhere else now!  ",5,2019,09,25
135,Trendy & comfortable nearby Bank Station,I really enjoyed our stay at Vintry & Mercer. The overall ambiance is a little OTT but I think it works. Helpful and friendly staff. The rooms aren’t overly large but what they lack in space to move about they make up for in luxurious/fun decor. Lovely bath products - the black branded rubber ducky was a nice surprise. Great views from the rooftop bar. Would definitely stay again.,4,2019,09,22
135,Great boutique hotel,"The hotel is a great  boutique hotel in the city of London. Standard room is a little small, but good for solo or business traveler. Beds are comfortable and it’s in a quiet area, but close to multiple tube stations and area restaurants. Within walking distance of London bridge and other tourists attractions. 
Near the city finance district for business travelers.",4,2019,09,22
135,First Class Hotel,"What a great new find in London.
Beautiful Hotel, in an easy to get to location.
Wonderfully decorated good sized bedroom (superior), with nice shower room, all very clean.
Loved the roof terrace restaurant, the food was excellent as were the views.
Breakfast was very good, everything you could possibly want to eat!
All the public areas very nicely kept.
Last but not least, all the staff were absolutely brilliant, they went out of their way to help and were very polite and always had a smile on their face - you don’t get that everywhere.
10/10 from me, will definitely stay again next time we are in London.",5,2019,09,16
135,Fabulous in every way!,"I will definitely be back to this gem of a hotel. The location, staff and rooms were fabulous. Especially the staff simply nothing was too much bother.

135,Great New Boutique Hotel in the City of London,"We spent 3 nights at the new V&M in the heart of the City. The hotel is in the commercial heart of London but within easy walking distance of The Bank of England, The Tate, St Paul’s and the Tower of London. The hotel is tucked away down a quiet back street but steps from the Mansion tube stop. Our room was uber modern and efficiently designed with shower and large king bed. All electronics are catered for and there is open wi-fi. In addition to complimentary water and soft drinks, there are coffee and tea making facilities with Nespresso coffee maker. Our room was incredibly quiet. There are several  nice eating and drinking spots in the hotel but the most popular is the rooftop bar/restaurant where we enjoyed drinks each night as well as an excellent meal. Staff are cosmopolitan, friendly and eager to help. While the location is in the City, we were able to go from the hotel to Green Park tube station in 20 mins during rush hour. If you are visiting, this is a very busy area Monday to Friday but on the weekends becomes quiet with a number of businesses closed. This makes it easy to move around. We consider V&M a great option for both business and leisure in the heart of the City. 
",5,2019,09,15
135,Fantastic stay,"This hotel is beautiful!! 

Everything in the room is really purposeful and modern. 
Mini bar is included which is always a great plus for some snacks or water for the day. 

The staff were so lovely, always willing to help and greet you when you are leaving for the day. 
Right next to a tube station and some restaurants which is handy.

Can’t wait to recommend it to all of my clients for their London trips!",5,2019,09,13
135,Fabulous Hotel,"We have just returned from a one night stay here and we were delighted to have chosen this hotel.

They have thought of everything: great mattress and bedding, blackout curtains, free soft drinks and snacks in mini bar, plug sockets everywhere. I could go on!

Staff superb, good food on the Roof Terrace restaurant and friendly staff. 

And we slept like babies - it is just so quiet.

Can’t wait to return! Thank you V and M. ",5,2019,09,09
135,"This hotel was superb, we will be back!","This was a family trip to London to celebrate a big birthday for my wife and all twelve family members loved this place. One minute from Mansion house station made it convenient to reach from Kings cross. The standard of the room, slightly small, was absolutely excellent. The sleep quality was second to none for being quiet and mattress quality. The staff are the best I have had the pleasure to meet. From the South African gent on reception to the French and Sicilian staff in the terrace roof bar ( sorry cant remember names) they were slick, friendly and very efficient. They atmosphere while having a drink on the roof or in the lower ground bar was first rate. The staff could not have been more helpful.
Location wise this hotel is near St Pauls, Pudding Lane, Bow Church, underground and buses to Waterloo and places like Columbia road market on the 26 bus.
If you think I am gushing about this place, I am! I will be returning for sure. Please try this hotel, you will thoroughly enjoy your stay. I fully recommend this hotel.",5,2019,09,09

135,Amazing!,"We stayed at V&M for two nights over the August bank holiday and absolutely loved it. The hotel was spotlessly clean, modern and great value, plus the staff were so friendly and helpful. The location was great - easy to walk south of the river or to the tube station - it was very peaceful. There are lots of lovely restaurants and cafes nearby. The free popcorn, soft drinks and biscuits in the room were a lovely touch. We couldn't fault it... and will definitely return.",5,2019,09,04
135,Best Asian tapas on town,"I visited the restaurant on the ground floor.

Absolutely love the food and all reasonably priced for the quality. Service could be better - the waiters don’t know much about the food nor are they very responsive despite being a quiet restaurant - but overall, loved my experience.",5,2019,09,03
135,Incredible and beautiful,"I took my friend to this hotel for a surprise on her birthday. I have only good things to say about this beautiful boutique hotel.

The rooms were so lovely, cosy and quiet.

The reception staff were so wonderful!",5,2019,09,03
135,Superb service.,"The staff were absolutely fantastic. Their attention to detail was above reproach.
If you are the kind of person who loves complaining don't use this hotel as it will upset you.
Just brilliant........
",5,2019,09,02
135,"Great Staff, Food Was Lacking...",Andrea S and the rest of the staff are excellent and beyond pleasant. If the food was good I would rate this place 5 stars. The food was really disappointing. The food got even worse after the hotel resturants closed when ordering room service after 11:00 pm.,4,2019,09,01
135,English as a first language.,"Enter stage left the V & M. Bravo x 100 for a hotel that delivers on each and every category. We arrived from the US at the crack of dawn, hoping the hotel would stow our bags while we got a taste of London. They did better than that, our room was ready. After check in, we were escorted up to ensure we knew how to work everything. The rooms are cutting edge. No smelly, old musty unseen things in this building. It's new plus, spectacular. The rooms are small but who cares, they are perfect! From decor to functionality, they work. I loved the Nespresso coffee maker including free juice and waters daily. Lets talk lights.....itty bitty led's with dimmers by the bed. Multiple places to charge phones and even a converter so we could use our curling iron. It's all there folks. Anddddd....both my friend and I were celebrating big birthday's this month so they put these cute little cakes with Happy Birthday written in chocolate. Not to mention, 2 glasses of Champagne just for fun. The speak easy in the basement is so cute and Pablo and Fabio were awesome bartenders. The front desk staff killed it by bending over backwards to help. Especially on the last day when I can suddenly cancelled in Oxford for no reason as we were leaving to pick it up. Mircea personally called and settled the entire matter. Carlos and Claudia were also so incredible helpful. I can't say enough things about this hotel. It's the most beautiful boutique hotel I've ever stayed in. I'm a flight attendant so I stay in a ton of places. None have ever compared to this!! Bravo.",5,2019,08,31
135,Wow! Nothing beats this!,"Beautiful, very well located hotel with excellent attention to detail and absolutely amazing service. From the moment we walked in to the moment we left we felt relaxed and very well looked after. The rooms are fabulous, and so quiet too! The best nights sleep I’ve had in any hotel anywhere! Thank you Vintry and Mercer!",5,2019,08,31
135,Satisfied,"Excellent hotel and position! I like to stay in this hotel, it's near business district, livelpool street and spatafield old market. Pleasant dinner at the restaurant the terrace. I will love coming back soon",5,2019,08,28
135,Brilliant find!!,"Quirky hotel with lavish decor. Fantastic staff, really attentive and friendly. All mod cons in rooms including usb charging. Free complimentary mini bar (no alcohol).

135,Clean friendly upper class stylish....,"Sums it up. 

Hidden away near St Paul’s handy for accessing the easy and nearby bus tours elsewhere. 

Very friendly staff very very clean. 

The bar has a host of drinks and the cocktails made to order are perfect. 

The rooms are well equipped and have a high standard of cleanliness. 

",5,2019,08,26
135,Gem Near St. Paul,"A stylish hotel open since spring 2019 — a rare find in this neighbourhood.  Within walking distance to St. Paul’s, Across the bridges, Tate Modern, the Borough Market, etc.  Underground Mansion Station is 3 min walk away.  Great place to stay for business as well as play! Btw the complimentary water, soft drinks and snacks are a warm touch, too. Will stay there again.  ",4,2019,08,25
135,What a find!,This small hotel is one of the nicest we have ever stayed in. The welcome and check in were faultless. The room amazing with lots of lovely small touches that are complimentary here but not in other hotels. The roof top bar and speakeasy were both lovely to visit (although good weather did help the rooftop experience). Breakfast was generous and good quality - I loved the bread - and the staff were all friendly and helpful. Location is so easy being close to Mansion House tube station. Cannot fault the team - we really felt like valued guests.,5,2019,08,22
135,Outstanding Hotel!,"When we decided to visit London, we booked our stay at your wonderful hotel through Expedia.
What an absolutely wonderful find!

We stayed Vintry and Mercer from August 1 with checkout on August 8, 2019.
The hotel, being new, was wonderful.  Clean and new is always good.
But the hotel was not the best part.

The amazing staff was the best part.

I sold my business in 1996 and retired.  
When I sold it, I had 42 employees, so I know what a difficult job it is to get good people to work for you.
I spent most of my working day training and finding good people.  It was hard, to say the least.
They have a marvelous staff.

Angela, was always charming, enthusiastic and helpful.  You can’t help but be happy and smile around her.
She booked our tickets for events and made sure we were happy when we returned.
Dimitri was the same way.  Quick to help, enthusiastic and very knowledgeable about the area.
They were so pleasant and fun to be around, I looked forward to going down to the office when I needed to.
Daniel was very charming and knows so much about food and wine.  I really enjoyed talking to him as he shared wonderful stories of his life.
He is such an interesting and talented man.

It is the people like Angela, Dimitri and Daniel that makes it impossible to want to stay anywhere else.  
I will always stay at Vintry and Mercer when we come to London.

I look forward to my next trip to London.
I hope Angela, Dimitry and Daniel will still be there.

Sincerely,
John Carter

135,Luxury in London,"Just returned from a fabulous stay at Vintry and Mercer. I’ve been to London many times and decided to seek out a smaller, luxury hotel for this visit. We had a wonderful experience at the Vintry and Mercer! Accommodations were beautiful, staff were attentive and lovely, and location was superb. Don’t forget to check out the rooftop bar and restaurant, as well as the ‘speakeasy’ located on the lower level. Thanks to Dimitri and staff for a wonderful stay. I highly recommend this lovely establishment, you will not be disappointed!",5,2019,08,21
135,An excellent choice un London,"A beautiful and comfortable hotel very well connected to main city attractions. Outstanding service, good breakfast and restaurants. Very helpful staff. Spotless clean. I will definitely recommend it. ",5,2019,08,20
135,Vintry and Mercer hotel,"The staff at V&M where very nice, and accommodating. Maya greeted us for breakfast, and was very helpful. All the staff made V&M, our home away from home during our stay. Thank you for a wonderful experience. ",5,2019,08,20
135,Overnight weekend stay,A beautifully presented hotel which is located just a very short walk from the nearest tube station. Both check in and check out were swift. The staff were helpful and we would most definitely stay again.,5,2019,08,19
135,Excellent stay in a lovely boutique hotel tucked away in the heart of London,"The service from the staff was exceptional, they were friendly on arrival. The hotel and the roof bar were just lovely and the location was ideal for us.  The hotel was fully booked but you wouldn't have known either, a real sense of space and tranquillity. ",4,2019,08,19
135,A great boutique hotel,"This was my first time and I must say I was very pleased with it. Classy, elegant, the entire experience was very pleasing. Good room with great amenities, good food, great amenities and details. A hotel to come back to. ",5,2019,08,19
135,Quality Hotel close to Mansion House tube,"This is a new opening so you would expect the rooms to be pristine which they are. Very nice high quality furnishings. However our superior room was small, even by London standards so you should be aware of this when booking. The buffet continental breakfast was plentiful and the staff were friendly. I used the gym which was very small and unfortunately with 3 other people in there made it unusable which was a shame as it was empty most of the time, except mornings. We had a couple of bottles of wine on the roof terrace bar which had nice views and lovely temperature and ambience  outside at this time of year - I was disappointed being charged £4.50 for a small bowl of nuts with our wine, whereas most establishments would provide this complimentary when but 2 bottles of wine. Overall a very nice and pleasant stay in a 'small' hotel.",4,2019,08,18
135,Birthday treat,Hotel upgraded our room as a special birthday which was lovely breakfast was very good would recommend hotel very near tube station and next time would love to eat in the restaurant as  had a really good view and looked really nice .,5,2019,08,18
135,Luxury and charming place in the heart of London,"Calm and well layed out rooms,were you feel as in a cocoon. Their équipement is modern and very well thought.

135,Great boutique hotel,"Great boutique hotel in the heart of the city! Close to the underground station and reasonably easy access from London city airport, I will certainly be going to in my future business trips. Thanks!!!",5,2019,08,17

135,"Great hotel, friendly staff","Booked here last minute with my girlfriend, staff were lovely and very accommodating, nothing seemed to much trouble. Helpful with suggestions. The hotel is very nicely decorated as are the rooms with all amenities you'd hope for. Felt as though we may be underdressed but assured not to worry. Highly recommended! ",5,2019,08,13
135,Asian Tapas & a Gorgeous Hotel,"Love this place - rooms are fantastic, really well appointed.

We ate in the hotel’s restaurant, it’s Asian tapas. Blew us away! Really can’t recommend it highly enough.

We also had breakfast in our room, and it was amazing.

We’ll definitely be back.",5,2019,08,13
135,a gem,"We got extra champaign for my friend who had a birthday, she got even some nicely decorated cakes on the room. It was very much appreciated. The reception was kind to check us in at 11 a.m. and we were offered another room, but at the end we stayed in the one we were offered from the beginning. One remark - the waiter at the roof top bar was not very engaged otherwise we were really very satisfied!",5,2019,08,12
135,Great find,"Always looking for new hotels to stay in London and as a lot of our activities centred around ‘the city’, we decided to give this new hotel a go. 

Was tucked away down a back alley, but don’t let that fool you. First impressions were great, warmly welcomed by reception. Our room was great, one with a balcony with view of the Shard, great bathroom and tech to match. 

The DND bar was a a great find, lovely staff, ambience and perfect for pre/post dinner drinks. 

We went for a la carte breakfast, pretty decent value for what you get, albeit the sides were extortionate price wise if you wanted anything added. 

Overall, great hotel, as close to my work, will be recommending this for rooms and functions",5,2019,08,12
135,A Great Stay in London,"New, modern hotel, central location, close to the underground, and within walking distance to Southwark area and bridge, Borough Market, St. Paul's Cathedral, and London Tower and Bridge.
Rooms are impeccably clean, modern, and well-appointed, with Nespresso maker, bottled water, juices, and toiletries, and - above all - the young staff, particularly at the reception, Mircea and Raluca - stand out through their professionalism and kindness. Our stay would not have been the same without Mircea's discreet and attentive assistance. Thank you, Mircea. We wish you continued success and hope to see you again soon! Aurelia Marcovicci",5,2019,08,12
135,Nice hotel,"Overall, this is a nice hotel. 

Location:
-the location, while not especially charming, is central. More importantly, it’s about a block from an underground stop.
-unfortunately, the hotel is also next to a church (a cool, old church). Bells/chimes (I can’t remember) rang out loudly in the morning. at probably 7 am or so. I was already awake, but this could be a major negative for some travelers, especially if London is your first stop after a long flight and you really need sleep.

Room: 
-Everything in the room was new and worked well. There were nice touches like complimentary soft drinks and small bites. 
-the decor, which leans towards modern and hipster, is mostly nice. The one negative about the decor is that some of it feels a bit form over function. For example, there was a larger decorative phone on one of the nightstands that took up an unnecessary amount of space.

Staff: we barely dealt with the hotel staff, but they were friendly.",4,2019,08,11
135,Small luxury hotel that lives up to its name,We spent a Saturday night here seeing a show at the Barbican. I booked through secret escape and got a really good deal with champagne on arrival and breakfast included. The room was small but comfortable and luxurious. Shower was great. Staff was welcoming and helpful. Our bathroom door didn’t shut and it was fixed straightaway. Breakfast (continental) was sumptuous. Would definitely recommend!,5,2019,08,11
135,Great Stay,Brilliant hotel with wonderful rooms with all the amenities one needs and super comfy beds. Wonderful rooms and the staff are all super friendly and helpful. We had a fabulous 3 night stay and we will be back on our next visit to London.,5,2019,08,11
135,Birthday Surprise!,"I surprised my dear friend to a short stay in London, as a treat to celebrate her 60th birthday. Upon arrival we were greeted by Dimitri and Raluca, who were so welcoming and helpful. We felt that nothing was too much trouble. 
The hotel is tastefully decorated from the Reception area to the rooms themselves. 
We were offered a complimentary glass of champagne, which we took on the Roof Terrace, the staff there were equally as friendly and efficient.
The room was a little on the small side but well furnished and very well equipped.
The hotel also offers complimentary soft drinks and snacks from the mini bar! Tea and  ground coffee is provided together with a mini cafetiere, a wonderful touch! 
The breakfast was of a very good quality and plentiful.
Vintry and Mercer Hotel is very close to an Underground station ( Mansion House), and once my friend and I had got our bearings, everywhere in London was a short distance by tube.
We had a wonderful stay, so thank you to all the staff, especially Dimitri and Raluca. We hope to return soon!!
Debbie and Linda.",5,2019,08,09
135,Would live here if I could!,"The Vintry and Mercer is a smaller, 5 star  boutique hotel, located near Mansion House underground Station and very near St Paul's Cathedral and the Millennium Bridge over to the Tate Gallery.  At the bottom of a quiet street called Garlickhythe, from the moment I entered on a hot sticky day in August, it felt like a haven.  Air conditioned, cool, quiet, tasteful and civilised.  The decor is stylish and modern but welcoming.  Our room had a huge and wonderfully comfortable bed, and all mod cons such as Robert's radio, coffee machine and iPod dock.  Breakfast in the attractively lit dining room included home made Bircher muesli,  French yoghurts and fresh pastries, as well as the usual other choices.  There is also a beautiful roof top restaurant for lunch and dinner.  The hotel has library and gym but no pool.  Staff are friendly and helpful.  The bell from the clock of the old church next door can occasionally be heard, but only added to ambiance.",5,2019,08,08
135,Smart city location,"Spent a night at this new hotel which is in a central city location, a stone's throw from St. Paul's.  It has been attractively renovated and the staff are extremely pleasant. We stayed in a standard room which was on the small side but had all the amenities needed for a pleasant stay.  There are two restaurants, one on the top floor with outdoor terrace and an Asian tapas restaurant on the ground floor.  Would definitely recommend.",5,2019,08,07
135,Great little hotel right near the Mansion House tube stop,"Although my room was small, it was very nicely appointed. I ended up here because the hotel my colleagues were staying at up the road was sold out due to a meeting. The staff was friendly and the rooftop bar was cool.",4,2019,08,06
135,Wonderful Place!!!,"This newer hotel is awesome! Perfect quaint location, immaculate hotel and rooms, pleasant staff, great breakfast, comfy beds and a good size room! I even left something and they sent it to me. We would totally stay here again. ",5,2019,08,03
135,Very Special !!!,"Can’t believe I found this place...can’t imagine staying anywhere else now.  We splashed out on a delux suite for our anniversary with a balcony and whilst still compact the room was perfectly appointed and it felt luxurious.  The roof top terrace is a must...wonderful steak.  Great service from the reception staff to restaurant staff all very friendly and helpful.  Great convenient location to mansion house tube and St Paul’s, 15 minute walk to Liverpool Street.  Can not wait to return.",5,2019,08,03
135,Special hotel,"Nice hotel near San Paul cathedral and Mansion House underground. The room is perfect and clean, where you can find free coffee, juice and water. Price good. 
very knowledgeable and welcoming staff... near the hotel the re are some coffee and restaurants ",5,2019,08,01
135,London July 2019 visit,"Beautiful hotel with helpful, friendly, professional staff. The roof top restaurant and the basement cocktail bar are fantastic. Great location, close to good transport links. Would definitely stay there again.",5,2019,08,01
135,Great find!,"Lovely hotel.  Nice location.  All the amenities and features of chain 5-star, but with a personal feel.  I personally don't like loud/busy reception and main areas when I come to and from my room, and V&M offers this -ease of entry and exit.  The terrance bar and restaurant offered a very nice atmosphere and there are many options to grab something simple right around the corner too for those simple nights. 

Great place, I will back!",5,2019,08,01
135,Great stay at the V & M!,"Great hotel near Saint Pauls, the Tower of London, tower bridge, the shard, and many more. It’s a newer hotel in a very nice area. Staff were wonderful, beds comfortable and room was on the small side but well appointed. ",5,2019,07,31
135,"Lovely stay, wish it could have been longer","We spent just one night at this boutique hotel in the heart of the City of London. It is just 200 metres from the Thames and close to such attractions such as the Monument, St Paul's Cathedral and London Bridge. It is 200 metres from Mansion House underground station so is within easy access of mainline train stations. The staff could not do enough for us, showing us around and explaining the various amenities including a wonderful rooftop restaurant (though the prices were a bit too steep for our budget). Our room was excellent, and though not large as you'd expect in a boutique hotel, it was large enough for a very comfy queen-size bed. The fridge had several complimentary items - Diet and regular Coke, Oringina, popcorn, fresh milk for the coffee/tea making facilities. The continental breakfast included in the price was excellent, varied and very substantial though a cooked breakfast could also be ordered at an additional cost. We were allowed to leave our bags there during our second day and picked them up at 7.30 pm on our way back to the station. It was a great short break and one I'd love to repeat.",5,2019,07,31
135,Great cozy hotel,This hotel is great and definitely 5 stars. Located on a quiet street just 70 meters from the mansion house tube station. It’s close to cannon street tube station as well. St Paul’s cathedral in nearby as is the Thameslink station for trains to Gatwick and other places. The front staff is very friendly. The room was very clean with an amazing shower. There was a kettle to make tea and also a nespresso machine. The hotel kept my luggage for me while I traveled to other places and they also received a package for me. I highly recommend this place and will stay here again.,5,2019,07,30
135,Best hotel in London!,"This is a very stylish, truly boutique hotel. But it is so much more, due to the staff’s attention to detail!  We were unexpectedly upgraded to a larger room and a nice birthday card and delicious little cakes were waiting in the room, as we celebrated my husband’s birthday. The room was the quietest we’ve probably ever experienced at a hotel. The location 2 min to the underground is also perfect. We’ve been to London many times, but always stayed closer to the centre. The V&M location allowed us to explore the City area, including the Ledenhall market, which we thoroughly recommend. Thank you V&M, we will definitely return!!",5,2019,07,30
135,Vintry and Mercer stay,"This hotel is a great find, we stayed here for a weekend, easy access with tube station at the top of the road.
Check in was great and very attentive and we were able to book in early, so accommodated all our needs.
Hotel in general was very good, the staff were incredible, always to hand and incredibly polite( always saying good morning/afternoon/evening)
We haven’t stayed in this area before so was a breath of fresh air when staff pinpointed areas of interest for us.
Rooms were fantastic even though we had a standard double room, kitted out with everything you need.
We wanted to use the roof bar but weather was not particularly good so wasn’t really an option, the views were amazing though
Highly recommend this hotel, boutique at its best 10/10",5,2019,07,30
135,Hidden London Gem,"A wonderful hotel on a quiet street, but walking distance to London Bridge and a stone's throw from the underground. Rooms are small, but gorgeous with all the amenities you need, and well thought out storage to make up for size. Staff was excellent. Would definitely stay here again. A pleasant respite from the busy summer streets.",5,2019,07,29
135,"Tranquil , confrortable surroundings","The staff are most helpful , with a curtious manner .
The decor is most attractive & peaceful ,with confortable beds & most efficient en suite facilities .We ran out of time to use the roof top restaurant which looked inviting - will return .",5,2019,07,27
135,Magical anniversary!,"My husband booked this hotel for our 10th anniversary and I cannot fault it.

Dimitris on reception gave us the warmest welcome - he actually made this hotel for me! So polite, warm and personable. Nothing was too much for him.

Our room was gorgeous and lovely little touches like the mini-bar, robes and slippers.

We had champagne on the roof top bar and, yet again, the staff were lovely.

We were so take with the Speak Easy bar in the hotel that we ended up staying there for the night: cocktails were lovely!

A real find!",5,2019,07,25
135,Beautiful and amazing ,"Amazing hotel, room was pure luxury. Stunning place. 
Friendly and helpful staff. Food is amazing, breakfast and dinner.
Lovely roof terrace for dinner. Highly recommend. 
Great location, will choose the vintry and mercer again ",5,2019,07,22
135,disappointed,"room small, view was of the loading/rubbish area, room wasn't cleaned until late evening after we had left for the theatre, poor service at breakfast both mornings, Location was excellent , lovely hotel  pity it was let down by the service.",3,2019,07,22
135,Lovely Hotel,"I phoned Ampersand to book, unfortunately, it was full, thankfully, the reception suggested Vintry & Mercer.
A super hotel location, near metro and walking distance to the city attractions ( 20 mins )
Although the hotel is new, it should by now, be running smoothly, breakfast is chaotic when crowded, a 15 minute wait for coffee is poor.
On first morning, I was told by staff, three times,  that breakfast wasn’t included, when I knew it was!
It was sorted out, but I found the experience embarrassing.
Having said this, the staff were courteous and welcoming throughout the hotel.
I’ll give it another go!",5,2019,07,22
135,Lovely,"Amazing hotel 
Although our cooked breakfast experience was not great waiting on meals when others were already finished ! Hoping that they work on this as then the experience would have ended as good as it started ",4,2019,07,22
135,Very decent,"Hotel was in a very convenient location. Very clean and superbly quiet.  The hotel has a few teething issues.  It could offer better services like shirt pressing, shoe shining etc for the business traveler, given the business location.  There are also some plumbing and AC issues.",4,2019,07,21
135,Overnight stay,"Lovely hotel, close to tube station. Lots of nice touches in room but unfortunately milk for tea/coffee had gone off. 
We had the continental breakfast included as part of a secret escapes booking, this was quite chaotic. Arrived at 9.20 to not much food out, despite breakfast time being until 10.30! Had to wait quite a while for bread and pastry’s to be refilled and no one came to order drinks, had to request when staff cleaning table nearby. ",4,2019,07,21
135,Best London Hotel Stay,"We have been to London on a number of occasions and can honestly say that the Vintry and Mercer was the best hotel stay so far!!  Ever element from cleanliness to helpful staff, made for a most enjoyable experience!!",5,2019,07,21
135,Delightful hotel,We thought it was one of the best hotels we have stayed in anywhere. Easy walking to two tube stations. Such quiet and comfortable bedrooms with everything provided including a free mini bar with water and soft drinks.  The continental breakfast was plentiful and fresh. We ate on the lovely rooftop terrace which again was exceptional. I really cannot fault this hotel. Congratulations to the Manager for such excellent staff training. You should be proud of them. ,5,2019,07,19
135,A City gem,Exquisite . Great location for a modern and very well designed hotel . Terrific value. Great rooftop. Very friendly team that cares and delivers well . We will return for sure and have no doubt recommending for business or leisure use ,5,2019,07,19
135,Fantastic hotel complemented by fabulous staff,"Super brand new luxury hotel where everything that was described, was delivered. Great check-in (although we were supposed to receive a glass of champagne each upon arrival as this was booked within our package but they overlooked this and we were not too fussed albeit some people might be). The rooms are trendy and the fresh juices and cans of coke / diet coke a nice touch. Had a drink at the rooftop bar which was lovely but disappointed we could not sit outside, more the undercover bit by the bar (I think the outside was reserved for people eating only).
This is in a good location, nice and quiet and a great hotel which I would recommend without hesitation if you want a peaceful night sleep in London. However, if you want true ""hustle and bustle"", late night drinks etc. this might not be the place for you.",5,2019,07,18
135,"Girls ""Escape"" Night","What a great hotel in the heart of the City. Close to several tube stations and to Cannon Street Station. Newly opened I think?  Lovely friendly staff, cool surroundings.  Large room with comfy beds.  Clean and modern and with all the amenities required.  Trendy bathroom too.  It was my friends birthday and the little ""Happy Birthday' dessert delivered to our room was a nice touch (not to mention delicious).
There are 2 bars, one on the rooftop and one in the basement.  Both hit the brief, but the rooftop bar and restaurant was fantastic - a great place to be on a beautiful sunny evening. Great view and really good service.  We ate in the rooftop restaurant (nicely presented delicious meal and cocktails) and we also had breakfast (served in the other restaurant on the ground floor), which was plentiful, with all the options.
Genuinely can't fault this hotel.  I will certainly return.",5,2019,07,17
135,Great London overnight,"This hotel is so much more interesting than a regular chain. Highlights are the staff, and the rooftop restaurant at lunchtime. We might have found more highlights if we had been there for more than just one night.",5,2019,07,17
135,You should go,"Super friendly staff; nothing was too much trouble. 
A wonderfully comfy bed with best pillows; I think I've ever slept on. 
A handy location; just across the river from Borough Market. 
A beautiful sun trap of a roof terrace. What more could you need?",5,2019,07,15
135,Stunning Hotel in an excellent location,"The Vintry & Mercer hotel is beautifully presented, spotlessly clean and in an excellent location. All of the staff at reception and in the restaurants were friendly, helpful and efficient. We ate at the Mercer Roof Terrace, which was amazing with spectacular views over London and had breakfast in the Vintry Izakaya. Both meals were excellent and beautifully presented.  The service was exemplary. Would certainly recommend the hotel and hope to go back very soon.",5,2019,07,15
135,Great hotel,"We stayed here on a Saturday night. We arrived earlier than we should have done and from the off the staff were really friendly and welcoming. The hotel is decorated beautifully throughout, we had a room with a balcony and it was stunning. The rooftop bar is worth a visit even if you’re not staying here, the views are fantastic. It’s well located and London’s very accessible from here. We will definitely visit again!",5,2019,07,15
135,Hipster,"Great hotel, even loved the restaurant on the roof.   The bed was great and it had cool technology for the room.  I wish we had stayed longer. They included a complimentary mini bar of snacks and drinks.  ",5,2019,07,14
135,Fantastic hotel,"We stayed here for my fiancé’s 30th. I had mentioned the occasion to the hotel before we stayed and they went to great lengths to make him feel special. The front desk staff were brilliant. 
The room was stunning, couldn’t fault it
We also really loved the location,  very close to Bank Tube so it was really easy to get anywhere
We will definitely stay again ",5,2019,07,14
135,Excellent,"Food is amazing, definitely recommend cocktails on the roof. As for location St Paul’s is on your door step, across the millennium Bridge is Tate Gallery, from there your pretty much where you need to be. Just enjoy it and follow your feet, London will do the rest. ",5,2019,07,14
135,Brand new boutique stay,"We stayed overnight on a Friday in the summer.  The hotel is not even a five minute walk from Cannon Street station, slightly longer walk but barely from Bank underground and a two minute walk, if that, from Mansion House underground.  

Great location on the edge of the City of London, near but not on the Thames.

Within a 10 minute walk is St Paul's Cathedral and in the other direction, slightly further, the Tower of London.  An array of various pubs, bars, restaurants and other hotels to visit, at a range of prices.

First impressions were excellent and those continued throughout our stay, virtually unblemished.  

The staff were very professional, polite and and friendly.   

We arrived slightly early for check-in  (1pm); they had our room ready  which was great, so we dropped our bags off and went upstairs to the rooftop restaurant.  For a work-day lunchtime, it was busy but not packed.  We had a couple of drinks there - a very well made cocktail each and a glass of wine each, with service included, was around £50.  The rooftop had a garden-like feel, with pots of herbs and lavender and, I believe, olive and bay trees.  Comfortable dining chairs. Though we did not eat there, we looked at the menu which was modern British and erred on the ""grill"" side of dining.  The food we saw others have looked excellent and they were generous portions.  

The interior design throughout was beautiful.  The entry level room which we had booked was very cleverly designed and felt bigger than it was.  The en suite shower room was accessed via a pocket door - so no hinged door taking up vital space.  The sanitaryware was Duravit and the taps and heat settings were a high end brand.  

The walk-in shower was huge and the power of the rain shower was excellent - not the weedy kind of flow you get from other similar rain showers.

One sink, two large mirrors and the lighting in the en suite was excellent for applying makeup.

In the bedroom, the bed was kingsize and though it took up a vast amount of the room, it did not feel disproportionately so.  Comfortable, and great pillows.

We had a courtyard view room and these are overlooked, but with sheer curtains as well as the thicker blackouts this was not a problem.  

Wardrobe spaces was adequate for two to three nights max - any more and you'd be struggling.  We had a  cabin-size bag.  If you had a suitcase it would probably be annoying to have to navigate around it.

There were some really clever storage touches to give maximum space whilst not taking up too much room - such as the bedroom mirror with a shelf for toiletries and the bedside tables which were round with deep drawers.

The only irritation about the room was that the cafetiere was big enough for one small cup of coffee only, and there was only one sachet of caffeinated coffee.  When the room is for two, and the booking is for two, you'd expect to be able to serve coffee for two, comfortably.  

We visited the DND bar late on the Friday - after midnight - they were open until 1am.  There were a few others in there but it was quiet.  The design was lovely (1920s style) and the atmosphere sophisticated.  A well made G&T and a bottle of beer later and it was time for bed.
  
The only other niggle was the next morning at the Asian restaurant on the ground floor where we had breakfast.  I have a couple of food allergies, and the menu was marked up with all allergens - which was great - and they had gluten free bread - which was great too.  However, on the menu I opted for the avocado on GF toast which the waitress said was fine...until I asked her why on the sides part of the menu the avocado side said it would contain gluten.  She said it didn't make sense to her (as it didn't to me!) but that was how it was.  And the other sides all similarly indicated they contained gluten - mushrooms etc.  Weird!  I therefore steered clear of it, believing that for some reason there must be cross-contamination of food and went for poached eggs on GF toast instead with nothing else on the side for fear of eating something I shouldn't.  A minor thing, but an indication of a teething problem perhaps.  

My husband had the bacon (he said was excellent), fried eggs and hash browns - the hash browns were a little greasy, he said, but all very tasty.

The coffee was very strong indeed - so if you like it that way, you'll love it.  They are happy to provide some hot water if you find it too strong.

On the Saturday morning the staff kindly stored our bags and we enjoyed a chilled out walk up to St Paul's, through to Smithfields Market, across to Farringdon and then back via Fleet Street.  Took about an hour.  It was a lot quieter than it would have been on a weekday, that's for sure.  

All in all we really enjoyed our overnight stay, and whilst we would normally automatically look towards West End accommodation at a weekend, we would definitely return to this little gem.  It was great value, well situated and just what we were looking for.",5,2019,07,13
135,Top Notch Hotel,"This hotel was fabulous!  The amenities were very helpful, there is a free handy phone that you can use during your stay for getting around town, placing phone calls, checking social media, etc.  The room was small but well efficient.  There are a few bar/restaurant options in the hotel, basement has a speak-easy called DND, and then there is a restaurant on the main floor that all meal offerings and coffee, and then there is also a rooftop restaurant, but you must have RESERVATIONS.  I wish the rooftop had a walkup bar, but sadly it did not.  Also the hotel has great proximity to underground and some good food options",5,2019,07,13
135,Awesome Service!,"
This is a fantastic hotel with great staff. You feel welcome and care for and you can feel their sincerity in serving you. I was staying at this hotel from 26-29 june in room 410.

The nearest tube is Mansion House and is very convenient. The only thing is that there is no lift at this station. However if you need taxi which we did, we engaged the front office to do the booking for us and I paid the taxi by cash based on meter on arrival at the euro train station. Keep up with the good work and hope to stay at your hotel again.",5,2019,07,13

135,V & M,"Nice Hotel, great location, friendly staff, It would have been 5 star if the room had a separate shower rather than over the bath shower.  Very clean and nice bars.  Would recommend as a great small hotel",4,2019,07,12
135,Stylish Boutique Hotel,"We had a fab stay, it’s a beautifully styled boutique hotel in a great location, just a minute or two walk to Mansion House tube. The lovely lady who greeted us at reception couldn’t have been more welcoming & she set the scene for this trendy but friendly abode. Our room was small but very smartly designed with a pleasant outlook, super comfy bed & chic bathroom. Great shower & products with many thoughtful touches including vanity kit & fresh milk. We appreciated the complimentary (soft drinks) mini bar & nibbly bits. We slept very well, no noise issues from either inside or out. We didn’t take breakfast but enjoyed ourselves on the roof terrace for dinner, a lovely space with great service, though food was good rather then great. The hotel also has a bar/restaurant at ground level, & there is a gym (which we didn’t see or use). Overall, a very pleasurable stay & I would recommend the hotel to friends.",5,2019,07,10
135,Weekend Delight!,"V&M hotel is perfectly placed for a quiet, classy weekend break. We were in London for BST Hyde Park events and nearby St Paul's tube is a quick walk to utilise the Central line. The hotel is also really close to Bloomberg and One New Change for quick eats and plenty of shopping. 
All staff were super friendly and there were lots of lovely touches to help us celebrate. 
The roof top bar is perfect for London views and sunny evening drinks. Room rate included continental breakfast which was great before heading out. Our room was super comfy and so well equipped. Complimentary cold drinks in the mini bar were welcome after hot days in the city. 
We will need to return soon as we really didnt get to spend enough time at the hotel!! 
Well done to all the team, your outstanding hospitality really made our stay extra special. ",5,2019,07,09
135,An excellent hotel,"Fantastic boutique hotel, with brilliant staff. Only a stone's throw away from tube and buses. Perfect location for the city, river and West End shopping.

135,Wonderful Hotel,"Recently stayed at the Vintry, a new hotel in the City and it exceeded all expectations.  From the location to the staff and facilities.

ROOM:  We booked the standard room which, while smallish, was beautifully appointed with push button everything with a great bathroom with a wonderful rain shower.  Very comfortable bed.

LOCATION:  Fantastic if you like history as you are surrounded by all of the history of the City of London.  The church next door to the hotel was rebuilt by Christopher Wren after the great fire in 1666!  The city closes down at the weekend so even though you are in London it felt quite peaceful.  There are not many places open at the weekend but the hotel is close (10 minute walk) to  St Pauls and across the river to the Southbank and Borough Market.

FOOD:  The rooftop restaurant was amazing with fantastic views, dinner with St Pauls in the background anyone?  The food was very good and reasonably priced given the location.  Breakfast was great and also reasonable.

STAFF:  Everyone we met was wonderful.  The breakfast guys were great and Andrea, the rooftop restaurant manager, was one of the most accommodating and welcoming hosts I have experienced at any hotel that I have stayed.

Overall a brilliant hotel for the price in London and we will return.  I just hope I will be able to get a room because I think its popularity will be huge.

",5,2019,07,08
135,The Perfect Hotel for the Perfect Weekend,"Absolutely no complaints about this hotel. Luxury from the entrance to the room. Firstly the staff are very friendly and accommodating, from check in to room service there was no request to high. The room was beautiful, spacious, and full of every amenity that you could ask for, cleaned to a high standard everyday, the biggest and comfiest bed i have had the pleasure of staying in. Location, for us, was perfect far enough away from the hussle and bustle to properly relax in one of the worlds busiest cities, tube station 2mins from the doorstep meaning central and tourist London was always 10mins away. Also convenient to get to the London Stadium for the Baseball on Sunday. Couldn't recommend highly enough.",5,2019,07,08
135,luxurious modern hotel,"room excellent, facilities very good, roof terrace stunning. we were given a complimentary room upgrade as had mentioned we were celebrating a milestone birthday when we were booking. overall service excellent and the quality of the hotel was apparent throughout. convenient yet quiet location right next to Mansion House underground station but no passing traffic.",5,2019,07,08
135,😍,"This hotel is stunning. Didn’t feel at all stuffy. Absolutely impeccable decor. Came here for my boyfriend’s birthday and when we arrived they had upgraded our room free of charge. The bed was insanely comfortable, the room has a smartphone for information and a TV with Apple TV. Means you can airplay to it which is pretty handy if you have an Apple device. Loved the bathroom, there was a tv above the bath and a walk in shower with his and hers sinks opposite. Enough space in the closet to hang some clothes and store bags and shoes, a fridge with some free drinks and some snacks in the cupboard. 
The downstairs area with the library, gym etc is flawless. A beautifully executed hotel with lovely welcoming staff. 
Our room (504) was directly next to a church and opposite an office building. Fortunately we stayed on a Sunday night so no one was in there but on the Monday morning it did feel a little invasive when we opened the curtains. The church bell also goes off every hour from 7am onwards; my boyfriend didn’t notice at all but I’m a light sleeper so it woke me up. I don’t think it would be fair to put the hotel at fault for this and it didn’t at all ruin our stay, just worth noting.",5,2019,07,07
135,Second stay,"New place, good location and room quality, upstairs terrace is superb in the summer, food quality improved since opening, service is still a bit hit and miss, can b3 excellent but depends on the individuals",5,2019,07,07
135,Just amazing book it. ,"Just returned from a 2 night stay with my wife for a weekend away. 

It was awesome. Great location as everyone says and beautiful rooms (we were upgraded on arrival too thank you).

135,A HIDDEN GEM,"When we were looking on line at hotels to stay in London, so many of them looked old and tacky.,  Then, we found Vintry and Mercer.  The hotel is new and modern.  It's more like a boutique hotel.  Because it is a smaller venue, the customer service and hospitality is amazing..  The entire staff go above and beyond to please their guests.  The rooms are spotless and decorated beautifully.  The location is a bit hidden and in the financial district.   We would definitely stay here again!!",5,2019,07,05

135,Excellent hotel ,"This hotel is fairly new and it’s been done to an excellent standard. Rooms were brilliant, bed was very comfortable and there was a great tv.

Overall one of the best hotels we’ve stayed at ",5,2019,07,01
135,Wedding night stay,"We stayed at Vintry and Mercer for our wedding night and the hotel, staff and service did not disappoint! Given the chaos of the wedding we were not as organised as we’d hoped with our packing but fortunately this was not a problem to the staff and were very welcoming with our every request. Thank you for a delightful stay, we hope to return in future to celebrate anniversaries!",5,2019,07,01
135,My London hotel experience was great,Thoroughly enjoyed my stay at the Vintry and Mercer hotel in central London. I recommend it to you if wanting a quality hotel in a central location. It was a great location with ready access to transport ,5,2019,06,30
135,5 star gem ,"This new hotel is in a wonderful location for sightseeing and is on the same block as the Mansion House subway stop. It is a nice link between old and new London, and very close to the north bank river walk. One can easily walk to the Tate, the Globe, South Bank and St Paul’s. Other sights such as Westminster and the Churchill War Rooms are only four short tube stops away. 

The decor is beautifully done. The standard room (172sq’) was on the small side for one couple (not a deal breaker) but we knew this in advance. They do make meticulous use of the space however, and everything was well appointed and well thought out. 

We ate at the rooftop for dinner and really enjoyed our meal and drinks. 
The entire staff was super friendly and helpful. 

So happy I chose this hotel over a tiny, windowless room with no soul in Covent Garden for the same price, and away from the fray in Piccadilly Circus.  
We were very happy to be here and felt surrounded by luxury in a very visually appealing space. Would we return? You bet!",5,2019,06,27
135,Amazing,"The hotel was outstanding, we were upgraded on arrival. Everything in the hotel was beautiful, very clean and stylish.  Perfect location with a tube station just a minutes walk away and a very short walk down to the Thames.  We completely missed the secret bar next door/downstairs until we checked out.",5,2019,06,26
135,A true luxury hotel,"The hotel team was very attentive and with natural kindness. There was attention to detail that makes your stay memorable.  Room was luxury, quiet and was equipped with complimentary handy smartphone, allowing you to stay connected throughout your time there. Service and food were excellent. Location was perfect with 2 tube stations near the hotel (one just 300m from the hotel, another one just 5 minutes walk) allowing easy access to sights, museums, art galleries or business. Vintry and Mercer is the perfect place to relax. A true luxury hotel with luxury details.",5,2019,06,26
135,Awesome ,"Stayed here on Sunday 23rd June for one night for my partners birthday.
The hotel is tucked away in a lovely quiet spot about 25 mins stroll from Waterloo along the Southbank.
The hotel was spotless and the staff very welcoming and happy.
The room was lovely and had lots of lovely features re lighting, umbrellas, dressing gowns etc.
We had a drink on the roof terrace which was fantastic but could not dine as was not open Sunday evening.
I am a light sleeper but had a wonderful nights sleep on the amazing bed.
Breakfast was continental, fresh and tasty but wish the cooked was an option on booking. 
Late check out too of midday which was a nice touch.
This is a new hotel and they have done brilliantly, I would definitely stay again and would recommend without hesitation for business or pleasure if your visiting the big smoke!
Thanks for making our stay perfect- well done! ",5,2019,06,26

135,Super lodgings in historic location.,"We stayed over the weekend, and it was a super quiet location steps from Mansion House tube.
Staff are outstanding, In an unobtrusive way. 
Rooms are beautiful if compact! They do have everything you need though. Bed is very comfortable too.
It is high tech, we mistakenly put on the do not disturb which resulted in the room not being serviced! But that was quickly remedied.
Breakfast is continental and very good, if a tad expensive. Cooked is a la carte if you need. But service is great.
There is a gym, and roof terrace restaurant for sunny days.
Novel is a fridge drawer, containing soft drinks and fresh milk, all are complimentary. There is no mini bar.
Would we stay again? If the price was right then I think we would!",5,2019,06,25

135,Family Wedding in Central London,"This newer hotel is modern, comfortable and in a tremendous locale.  The staff treated us warmly and professionally.  In looking at local prices, the V & M are good value, especially considering what the hotel provides (an example is the free international cell phone). ",5,2019,06,18

135,Masterpiece,"I stayed at Vintry and Mercer for 2 nights as I needed somewhere central to catch up with friends, get some shopping done, and visit the Sky Garden. The location of the hotel was perfect, and only a few minutes walk to everywhere.
I cannot say enough about the staff here. They went above and beyond to make my stay as pleasant as possible.the check in staff were so polite and professional. I was able to check in early and take advantage of the sunshine on the open terrace in my room. I had lunch on the top floor of the hotel where the food was incredible. 
The room was immaculate, with a free mini bar, and the most comfy bed.and the decor at the hotel made this hotel a true masterpiece! You will not be sisappointed...",5,2019,06,18

Can't wait to come stay again! ",5,2019,06,16
135,Beautiful boutique hotel near tower bridge.,"We booked this hotel for my sons 9th birthday. We travelled by train from north Wales and arrived around 12 noon. We were fortunate enough to be able to check into our room at around 12.30pm which gave us the rest of the day to shop at the tech department in Harrods for a certain  little boys birthday present !!!
The reception staff we impeccable. 
Our deluxe studio was the highlight of my sons trip, given his love of technology. Our bed was enormous( just like we have at home, so there wasn't any of the usual feeling like your sleeping in a large single ) and very comfortable. The under floor heating was an added bonus and the general design and decor was lovely.
I'd chose this hotel over the more traditional established hotels like the Langham etc because of its contemporary technology and decor and because of the service we received.
Well done Vintry and Mercer. We will be back. ",5,2019,06,16

135,Great hotel with AMAZING service,"My friend and i stayed at the hotel for 5 nights, at the deluxe room.
The service was just amazing, very accommodating (specifically receptionist Mircea and Raluca).The room was spotless. The mini bar is free and the hotel re-feels it every day. The hotel it self is very Clean and modern.The Hotel is minutes walk to all the main train lines. Also the hotel is relatively close to shoreditch, and is a great option for people who want to visit the neighborhood more then once, but don't want to stay in it. The neighborhood it self is business oriented, but is very lively and fun during the week.

All in all just a great hotel.",5,2019,06,12
135,Great weekend rate,"Well located for central London, just a 2 min walk from Mansion house tube. 
We booked this hotel due to the great wknd rate. With it being in the city, there’s not a great deal open within walking distance although they do have a cool speak easy style bar in the basement with some original cocktails. We didn’t eat in the hotel as there’s always so much choice outside but the b’fast in the room was v reasonably priced at £12! ",4,2019,06,10
135,The most amazing stay,"The location let us explore some great places, especially on the other side of the river.
The Attention and Service was 7 stars
The room was Amazing

A stones throw from St Paul's, London Bridge and the Thames walk we found it very easy to access the major sites from here! Our room was ready early and we couldn't have been happier to freshen up in the amazing rainfall shower. Very cosy and quiet room with lighting options, robes, toiletries and best of all complimentary snacks and soft drinks. Any hotel that puts a little pot of fresh milk in your fridge for that morning cuppa gets my vote! Thanks for a great stay, worth every penny. Polite and efficient staff too.",5,2019,06,09
135,Amazing!!,"We are on the second night of our five night stay (first time in London) and I am already writing a review, because this hotel is so fantastic!  First off, location- tucked on a little quiet street, next to a quaint church, close to everything (everything us first time tourists want to do anyways). Second, it’s gorgeous- our room, 601, although smaller than US standards, is well designed, super comfy, free mini bar, amazing balcony over looking the rooftops of the City of London (and the church bell steeple, which chimes beautifully every quarter hour.  BTW, you can’t hear it with the balcony door closed, so if you hate noise, this is the place- it’s perfectly silent inside our room).  Third, the rooftop restaurant, great views and the most delicious modern British food.  Jet lagged and travel weary, we were thrilled to enter such a beautiful hotel, freshen up, and enjoy the perfect meal.  I am excited to try the downstairs restaurant and enjoy the other hotel amenities- I’ll update at the end of our stay!!  Oh, I can’t say enough about the excellent service as well :) this hotel was what we were looking for- high end luxury without being snobbish, but welcoming and wonderful.",5,2019,06,08
135,Wonderful stay wonderful view will definitely return,This was one of the most wonderful hotels I have visited. Lovley area quiet but yet near a variety of wonderful restaurants. Lovley vintage decor with every modern amenity possible. Our every need was catered to. Will most definitely be returning. ,5,2019,06,06
135,THE place to stay when in London!,"This brand new hotel, very centrally located in the City at walking distance to several subway stations (one of them just one block away) is my new favorite gem in London.
The hotel is brand new, very comfortable, great decoration and attention to every small detail, with extremely friendly and helpful staff. 
Perfect for any kind of visit to the city - work or vacation, alone or with family & friends. ",5,2019,06,06
135,London cities restful hotel,"We booked the hotel having never stayed in this part of London, the city of London. A wonderfully clean, efficiently run and quiet hotel. Located a short walk from Mansion House underground station. Offers a satisfying breakfast.",5,2019,06,06
135,Designed for Style and Comfort ,"Our experience at the V&M was excellent.   It's brand new so every part of the facility and room is immaculate, yet the staff is so uniformly helpful and friendly that it feels like a well-established hotel.  

The room showed evidence that ideas about design were blended well with ideas about convenience.  Plenty of USB ports were always handy, and a complimentary adaptor for those who forgot one was already in the room.  Books in the room added a nice touch, featuring history and architecture.  For those who always want it, TV in the bathroom as well as main room.  Minibar has ""free"" sodas, water, and snacks.  

Speaking of the bathroom, amenities include rainfall shower, heated floors, a scale ( no thanks), separate bathtub, and double sinks.  Minor complaint is the shower door, which was heavy and hard to open, and always left water on the floor after being pushed open.  A rubber ducky adds whimsy, and loofah pad & plenty of Bigelow lotions and gels are appreciated.  

Housekeeping was prompt when called; laundry delivered nicely as promised.  

The main downsides are for the nightlife due to location.  This is a City hotel, and the City doesn't have bustling evening pubs and cute cafes and gelataterias.  However, it's a good location for access to St Paul's, and you can do some nice walking tours of guild halls and old London.  A walk to Southwark's Borough Market is about 15 minutes across the bridge.  And the Mansion House tube stop or Cannon St (tube and National Rail) is very close.  The terrace restaurant featured nice outdoor dining on warm nights with a fine view of the city skyline, including St Paul's.  

I'd stay here again!",5,2019,06,04
135,Great New Find!,"Thoroughly enjoys our stay at V&M.  It's a new hotel in a great location downtown, walking distance to many things, including connecting  Underground.  Service was great.  Room was excellent, and we would definitely suggest it as a place to stay.  Look for online deals to get a good rate. ",5,2019,06,04
135,London City Break,"A very chic new hotel tucked away in the city of London, Staff were attentive and service was excellent.

You couldn’t find a more luxurious, unique and comfortable hotel right in the heart of the city.  We particularly enjoyed they fantastic roof top restaurant and bar.

Wonderful.  ",5,2019,05,31
135,A very good newcomer,"The hotel is very well located and very nicely presented. Loved the books on architecture, 
London and Pubs in the room which I was very tempted to 'borrow' but resisted...the restaurant on the roof terrace was a treat. Great food and service, lovely views and a great place to round off our annual Chelsea Flower Show pilgrimage!",4,2019,05,30

Great 7th Floor Roof Terrace bar is a must
So close to the Shard, a 5 min walk, Borough Market, Covent Garden and Westminster are all with a 20min walk.
Highly recommend - we will be back ",5,2019,05,28
135,Luxury stay at an affordable price,"A stylish small hotel tucked into a quiet corner of busy London. Beds are comfortable but the details are what put it over the top: heated floors in the bathroom, free water and juice in the mini fridge, even an internet-connected phone that you can take with you for day use. Well-located, with every convenience; V&M felt like a luxury stay at an affordable price point.",5,2019,05,27

135,"Fantastic service, beautiful hotel","I stayed here with my husband for the weekend of the London marathon. The room was beautiful and staff couldn’t do enough for us. 

We did have an issue with the shower leaking into the bathroom due to a block drain, but we reported it and it was fixed immediately.

Beware of the bar in the basement as it very expensive, but the staff are so lovely and the cocktails are a bit of a treat!

Thank you for having us - we would LOVE to stay here again!",5,2019,05,26
135,A super stay,"I have just returned from a great one night stay with my husband. The reception staff were so friendly and welcoming.

135,"Vintry & Mercer Hotel, London","The Vintry and Mercer is a lovely quirky boutique hotel. The staff were friendly and welcoming. The rooms and facilities within the hotel are great. Quiet hotel, was able to enjoy a good night's sleep. ",5,2019,05,24
135,Luxury boutique hotel in The City,"I stayed here recently and thoroughly enjoyed every aspect of the hotel from the warm welcome to the rooftop restaurant. It’s like an oasis in the middle of the hustle and bustle of the City. It’s perfect for business travelers and tourists alike, as it’s walking distance from St Paul, The Tate, Borough Market, Shakespeare Globe etc. I would highly recommend this hotel. A particular mention to Mircea at the front desk for his warm welcome and to Giorgio on the rooftop terrace for his humour and entertainment!",5,2019,05,24
135,Business Customers ,Newly opened 5 star hotel which has A roof terrace restaurant able to handle some weather variances. Our group of 12 had a great time and the food was of a quality to match the 5 star venue. I recommend it for couples or groups alike. Service was good too. ,5,2019,05,23
135,Great new option in the City,"Was nice to have a new, reasonably priced option in the City.  The property is fairly new and the room was very well organized and efficiently laid out.  The staff was excellent and attentive. Had dinner with a group of 6 in the roof-top restaurant.  The food was excellent, service good and the ambience while on the casual side was very nice, as was the view. I got excellent sleep but if you find church bells bothersome, be forewarned, they are rung frequently. ",5,2019,05,23
135,Great boutique hotel with really fashionable but small rooms ,"...the rooms are really really really small and the beds a HUGE fitting 3 people would not be a problem...so not too much space to move. Thanks God I got a room for disabled people (the guy at reception told us it would be a superior room with “hangers” 🙄 in the bathroom)...that was much bigger. Bathroom was huge, too, the only minus was that the mirror was a little bit low to fit a wheelchair user. But fine, there were enough mirrors in the room to put on make up or check the outfit. Toiletries from Bigelow (the old apothecary in NYC) were definitely a plus. Technical equipment was awesome - lights were all to be turned off from your bed, WiFi was excellent and free, there was an individual hotspot and cell phone for you to use...so why only 4 points? A) Some colleagues of mine complained about the views (garbage bins) and B) service in the breakfast room was totally overwhelmed and slow...so slow...also, the hotel is not really cheap...around 300 GBP per night including breakfast menu. On the other side, the location is great...",4,2019,05,23
135,"Impeccably stylish, lovely rooftop","This hotel is a gem in London.  Beautiful furnishings and a consistent design scheme, along with a location not in the dead center of the city allow for excellent light in the rooms.  The rooftop restaurant have great views and should not be missed on a clear summer day.  While the room is compact, it never feels claustrophobic.  

Staff was helpful, cheerful and professional.  Will report back once I’ve had a chance to see the gym.",5,2019,05,22
135,Vintry & mercer,"I was in London for a conference. Vintry & Mercer staff were excellent to deal with, the location was convenient and the hotel amenities were great especially the rooftop bar and restaurant. The hotel is reasonably new and pricing compares favorably with the other options available in the city of London.",5,2019,05,21
135,Nice boutique hotel with friendly staff,"This is a nice boutique hotel with friendly staff, nice cozy rooms, wonderful food. It is near the train station and has alot of other food option around the vicinity. It is also a 15 minute walk away from borough market.  ",4,2019,05,20
135,Birthday meal,My husband arranged a meal here for my birthday and wow. The service was excellent. The waiters were very cheerful very attentive and gave excellent advice on the food. Took my gluten free allergy to the next level. The roof terrace where we are our meal had a magical feel to it with the fairy lights. The terrace has overhead heaters so we didn’t feel the chill. The bar on the lower ground was amazing. Sat at the bar and the bar tenders were constantly busy but always had the time to chat during and in-between order to chat to us. Very happy.,5,2019,05,20
135,Lovely hotel,"Stay 2 nights in the hotel. The room is not so big but very clearn and modern and lovely. Very good service in the hotel. The location is perfect for us. we can walk to st. Paul chuch, One new Change, London Tower, London Briged ... ",5,2019,05,20
135,My new favorite hotel in London,"I just stayed at this property. Everything is wonderful - the rooms, the service, the location, the bar and the staff. I have stayed at many hotels in London. V&M really gets it right. I will be back soon. ",5,2019,05,19
135,Absolutely perfect hidden gem!,"From the moment we stumbled into the gorgeous entrance from the little cobbled street we fell in love with this hotel! 
The staff were amazing with nothing too much trouble , birthday cake , complimentary late check out all made such a difference to our experience.
The room totally opulent , think  velvet and marble . Everything has been thought of .
Raining -umberella , adapters , mobile phone to use in or out of the hotel. Fresh milk , juice and snacks .
The roof terrace the absolute crowning glory, as weary travellers we were made to feel like vips with views of st Paul’s dome to entrance you. 
I cannot wait to go back !",5,2019,05,17
135,Great hotel,"Located in a business district, but, very close to St Paul Cathderal, a new Boutique Hotel with class and charm.
Staff are great !
View from rooms are not great, but the standard of the rooms make up for lack of view, a bit expensive though.",4,2019,05,17
135,All cosy convenience in the heart of London,"Minor things that made my life really easy/added to the experience: newspaper in the morning, adaptor plug laid out, speaker (and easy to connect to), excellent guide books in the bedroom, both of which I read in detail over the 24 hrs!! ",5,2019,05,15
135,Clean and modern ,"Stayed here for a weekend. Attentive and friendly staff. Hotel was very clean and modern. Room was spacious and comfortable. 

There is a lovely rooftop bar/restaurant to visit as well as the basement bar which is a hidden feature! 

I work on Cannon St and would use this hotel again for both social and work related stays.
",5,2019,05,14
135,Fabulous new hotel near St. Paul's in the city,"A real gem in the city!  Staff were happy, friendly and professional. The deluxe room was light and airy with a huge window overlooking a beautiful rooftop view.  Very stylish decor in room with large and comfortable bed. Great roof terrace and they serve excellent gin and tonics!",5,2019,05,13
135,Amazing Saturday Sleepover,"This hotel is amazing, friendly staff, and a lovely warm welcome. The place is spotless and the attention to detail in design and decor is truly top class. We spent a sunny Saturday evening on the roof terrace enjoying the views which were so good that we we went back on Sunday for lunch - Dover Sole to share which we both felt was one of the best  meals that we ever had. 100% will go back as it beats the bigger hotel brands hands down.",5,2019,05,12
135,Fantastic hotel!,"We had a wonderful stay at Vintry and Mercer and can’t wait to return.  This was a birthday treat and there were some nice unexpected surprises along the way (opera cake and birthday message in the room and also at the end of our meal).  The location is close to St Paul’s which is perfect for exploring all the sights with three tube stations close by.  This hotel was a lovely sanctuary in the heart of London, the room was beautiful, with fabulous interior design features.  It was well appointed with some lovely little freebies, including all the soft drinks and snacks.  We ate lunch in the terrace restaurant which gave impressive views across to the roof of St Paul’s.  The service was efficient and friendly, the food was delicious and beautifully presented.  We also enjoyed the ambience in the hotel bar although, but did feel the cocktail menu was some what limited.  We had continental breakfast included which was very ample with a good selection of food to choose from.  We found all the staff very helpful and friendly during our stay and hope to return again soon!",5,2019,05,12
135,Perfect Boutique Hotel ,"This is one of the reviews that I am tempted not to post as I would prefer only a handful of people discover this place. That said I thought I’d do the right thing and give credit where due. 
Location - 2 min walk from Mansion St tube station, 10 min walk to St Paul’s Cathedral 
Service - all the staff I engaged with are friendly and seem genuinely interested in their work and the customer experience.
Room - beautifully decorated, comfortable with great main features (bed is amazing, shower is fab, strong WiFi and great air con) but equally great small touches such as an international adapter, convenient lighting panels by the bed side with complimentary mini bar.
Dining - all the food and the drinks I had were fantastic, interesting menu, great quality and the service to go along with it. 
All in all I can highly recommend Vintry & Mercer and I look forward to my next stay. ",5,2019,05,12
135,Sassy City Hotel,"Booked this hotel as a surprise for my husbands 50th birthday over the Easter weekend and couldn’t have chosen better. A beautiful hotel with elegant design in a quiet part of the city but with easy access to the tourist spots on foot or using the underground. The continental breakfast was simple but tasty. The only small disappointment was the bar wasn’t open on the Sunday evening which we found odd given the bank holiday. The staff were enthusiastic, accommodating and helpful. We both absolutely loved it and wouldn’t think twice about a return visit.",5,2019,05,12
135,Oasis in the big city,"A very welcoming hotel with attentive staff,we were upgraded on arrival. The roof terrace has fabulous views across London and pretty fairy lights. Our meals were delicious and we enjoyed a nightcap in the 1920s cocktail bar, in the basement of the hotel.The continental breakfast was excellent, overnight oats, meats and cheese. 

The Art Deco decor is beautiful. Amongst the brushed brass there are velvets and vivid greens, adding a tranquil dimension to the opulence. The room was well equipt, the makeup wipes were very handy. Our mini bar was restocked, even though we only stayed one night! 

 
The location is great to explore the London Bridge area. The hotel is tucked away but walking distance to Borough Market etc.

The only thing we noticed was a few poor finishes, such as some hanging silicone in the bathroom and a loose panel in the lift. It was as though everything had been slightly rushed. However this didn't effect our stay, we had a wonderful time celebrating our engagement.",5,2019,05,11
135,Unique!,Fantastic stay at this beautiful and unique Hotel.  Room was wonderful. Staff professional and friendly and could not do enough for us.  Lovely views from the roof restaurant and fantastic cocktail bar. Highly recommend.  We will certainly be back.,5,2019,05,11
135,Looks beautiful. Doesn’t work.,"This hotel looks beautiful. Many of it basics functions - heating and lifts didn’t work whilst I was there. Lighting and sleep was also a challenge. 

Service in the restaurants was terrible. Lots of staff with good intentions but completely untrained and therefore inattentive and intrusive In equal measures at exactly the wrong times which made a business breakfast embarrassing for my guest and I. ",2,2019,05,11
135,Totally amazing ,This is boutique hotel at its best. Cosy stylish but plenty of space too. Room was sumptuous and tasteful. Staff and service were first class. Location excellent and the upstairs outdoor terrace was superb. Overall great value and I will definitely return,5,2019,05,09
135,Fantastic Hotel - highly recommend,"We booked this hotel before it was even open, so took a risk, and we were REWARDED! The front desk staff were fabulous, really friendly, helpful and enthusiastic. Room was big for a standard room in London, every detail thought of including monogrammed towels and a rubber duck. Modern and stylish finishings. Loved it and will happily return.",5,2019,05,08
135,Wonderful weekend at Vintry & Mercer,"I went to London for an extended weekend trip to enjoy theatre, the sights, and see friends. I was looking for a comfortable stay at a hotel with a good location - and quiet rooms with a bit of luxury.

Vintry & Mercer certainly tix all the boxes. From the moment I arrived, I was greeted by friendly staff who ensured an easy and swift check-in. A staff member escorted me to my room, made sure to explain all the technical features in the room and where to find what. Nice service in a new hotel!

I had a superior room right next to the small bell tower. Very quiet, very comfortable, and nicely decorated with a king size bed and nice amenities. My room was located at the corner of the hotel with a view to a small church tower next to the hotel. I like to hear church bells ringing - so it did not bother me. A nice sound and not at all intrusive - makes for a good day :-)

The Vintry & Mercer is located very close to the Underground station of Mansion House, making it easy to get access to all kinds of sites and travel to/from various parts of London. The Tower and Tower Bridge are close (in walking distance) and so is the Tate. All in all - a very good location.
Plenty of cafes and small restaurants closeby - so you have alternatives to the hotel restaurant if you so desire. 

All in all - a very nice place where I felt extremely comfortable and well looked after. The latter is especially important when traveling solo. Will certainly stay at Vintry & Mercer next time I am going to London. :-)",5,2019,05,08
135,Weekend break for partner's 40th,"Great service, friendly staff, our room was exceptionally quiet and the hotel is in a great part of the city, especially at weekends when the footfall is vastly reduced. We received a room upgrade. Design features of the hotel and rooftop bar were less impressive than I had hoped as I'd read interesting articles about this opening and conversion. This would possibly mean I might look at other options at a similar price point for when we stay next.       ",4,2019,05,07
135,Great Service and a lovely stay,Wonderful experience. We were a group who travelled together and the hotel accomodated our needs (live at same floor + quiet). The staff were amazing. breakfast very good ! Good location in particular if you are on business,5,2019,05,07
135,Very good hotel with excellent rooms!,"Would recommend to stay here. The beds are really nice, fluffy, comfy and big. The rooms have enough space and there is a lot of eye for detail. Love it! Even when I put out an extra request, they delivered amazing! The bathrooms are also nice and clean. Amazing hotel! ",5,2019,05,06
135,"Great hotel, highly recommend","Beautiful hotel in a great location. Will definitely come back. We have a young child with us, and she love it too. The breakfast is nice. Service is amazing. Room is clean. The decoration is nicely done. ",5,2019,05,06
135,Boutique gem,"Had a great 3 night break in this wonderful small hotel. Location is 2 minutes away from Mansion house tube station and very near to St Paul’s Cathedral.
The reception staff were friendly and helpful and we found all the staff to be extremely pleasant. The room we had was a standard one and as other reviews have said it was cozy but the decor was lovely the bed so comfortable and great facilities with a great bathroom including a walk in rain shower. Complimentary mini bar with soft drinks replenished each day with tea and coffee making facilities. Continental breakfast was excellent and staff particularly friendly serving great coffees!
We were very so busy going to concerts ,musicals etc that we didn’t have the opportunity to eat in the restaurants but we did enjoy a late evening cocktail in the DND bar which was great.
Loved this hotel so much we will definitely return on our next trip to London.",5,2019,05,04
135,A Hidden Ge,A charming hotel . The staff was extremely kind and helpful in every way. The food was very good. Dinner on the roof terrace is a must. My first stay in London in a non-chain hotel. A delightful experience all around. Recommended without hesitation.,5,2019,05,03
135,Great place to stay,"We had a great experience at V&M. Nice facilities, friendly service and beautiful art made the stay exceptional. I also liked the fact that the hotel is located near various underground stations which makes it very well accessible with public transport.",5,2019,05,01
135,Stay at V&M,I'm very like design. It's small boutique hotel that not crowded with the people. Very good service. Good choice of food on breakfast. There is no option to reserve a room with breakfast included. Great location ,4,2019,05,01
135,Top Hotel,"It was every thing top. The employees were very friendly, The food was excellent. The room and bathroom were clean and were well furnished. The employees werefriendly and helpful. For my next trip to London I will book this hotel. ",5,2019,04,30
135,A great stay,"The hotel is extremely clean and the staff are excellent.

The rooms are well equipped and touches such as the complimentary mini bar, coffee machine, Marshall speaker and even a rubber duck are great. 

This hotel has great potential but should change its pricing. We stayed through Secret Escapes, so paid less and got complimentary breakfast and champagne. We also received 25% off at the restaurants due to a deal at the hotel. This made the pricing slightly more reasonable, however, I stay at a lot of hotels and would not pay full price for this hotel or the restaurants. 

The terrace restaurant offers great food and the setting is perfect. The cod cheeks and rib-eye were great, but the pork cutlet was dry and flavourless. 

The DND bar was great, and the cocktails were very nice. They also managed to get us a brownie which wasn't on the menu.

Breakfast was nice enough but not worth £18 had it not have been complimentary.

The hotel went to a lot of effort to make our weekend away special, with hand written notes, complimentary treats and fantastic service.

I would stay at the hotel again at the prices I paid. The decor of this hotel and the staff make it worthy of 5 stars.",5,2019,04,29
135,Great new hotel in London,"Booked this hotel back in December 2018 before it was open with excellent rates via Secret Escapes. Easy to find via a 200 yard walk from Mansion House tube station. As it is still very new it was immaculate inside and the receptionist very welcoming without being pretentious. Taken to our room on the 4th floor and shown all room amenities including a mobile phone you can take with you outside of the hotel including free calls to a number of countries. Nice touches include free soft drink mini bar, fresh milk and snacks. Hotel is in a great place to explore this part of London with easy access to the Thames and within 2 minutes of St Pauls Cathedral. The added bonus for our weekend was the hotel was on the path of the London Marathon so we made the most of being able to watch and cheer on the runners. We eat at the rooftop restaurant one evening and had a lovely view of St Pauls and a glimpse of the London Eye. Unfortunately the weather was too cold to sit outside but it is a great venue for a summer meal. The food was very good and the portions bigger than expected. We benefitted from a 25% discount offer which has been running to encourage more dinners so full price would put some people off (about £100 for two courses / two people without drinks). On checking out the hotel were happy to look after our bags (they offered) until it was time for us to catch our train back. Would definitely go back as long as we can pick up a special rate again.",5,2019,04,29
135,Excellent hotel,"Just returned from a Birthday weekend away with friends. What a fabulous gem of a hotel, tucked away down a small side street. In an excellent location for getting about and sightseeing. Beautiful inside and immaculate. Staff were incredibly helpful and accommodating. The rooms were spotless with all the mod cons. Very comfy bed and a nice touch was the fridge with complimentary drinks. The continental breakfast was top notch with plenty of variety. Had a late night tipple in the basement bar which had a really lovely ambience. We had lunch in the rooftop restaurant and the food was superb quality. This hotel ticked all the boxes with everything. Will definitely be back. Just couldn’t fault it. Thanks V and M for an amazing weekend.",5,2019,04,29
135,One night stay,Great hotel. Location spot on. Great value for what you are getting. Immaculate hotel with great food and quality staff. Staff were incredibly welcoming across the hotel and had fantastic knowledge of their products. The food was really good in the restaurant and the chef there is doing a great job. The setting of the restaurant and roof terrace are great too with some nice views over the city. ,5,2019,04,29
135,A lovely experience,A great hotel being run by professional and friendly staff. They made us feel very valued. They go out of their way to make your stay at this new stylish hotel a pleasurable experience. Looking forward to returning hopefully very soon. ,5,2019,04,29
135,Fab little hotel,"Great clean rooms, fantastic staff, lovely views from the rooftop restaurant. Free champagne was a nice touch too. The location is two mins walk from Mansion House tube with plenty of coffee shops nearby. ",5,2019,04,29
135,Wonderful! ,"I was in London to run the marathon and the hotel and staff was excellent! Great breakfast, many cool gadgets in the room, friendly staff and good location. Five stars! 
I would definitely recommend this hotel and I will stay here next time I’m in London ",5,2019,04,28
135,Birthday stay,"Complimentary glass of champagne on arrival  free room upgrade and a really nice touch for my birthday. The guys were so welcoming and accommodating and made us feel so welcome. Would definitely stay here again. 

The only thing to note would be that the church bells were noticable but they can't do anything about it for obvious reasons but it wouldn't put me off by any means in coming back",5,2019,04,28
135,Excellent hotel,"Nice rooms and very good service. The personnel is very friendly , competent, and willing to help. The location is good and busses and metro are near. The roof restaurant is excellent and offers a nice view.",5,2019,04,27
135,Rubbish for Small Luxury Hotel,"Visited Vintry and Mercer for a cocktail 
What a disappointment! Staff are not friendly 
No nibbles with cocktails despite the prices of the cocktails 
This is a lovely area - within walking distance from St Paul’s so people would pop in - the staff are wary of everything- not relaxed at all 
Thoroughly disappointed ☹️",3,2019,04,26
135,Perfect stay!,"Perfect in every way. Location is ideal right within central London. 
Brand new hotel with lots of character so facilities are second to none.
Lots of complimentary services.
Staff are very helpful and kind!",5,2019,04,26
135,"Beautiful, well located hotel","This is my second time staying at this hotel. The staff are amazing, cant do enough for you ,not overly intrusive. Great location close to 3 underground stations and the Thames.
Great food in the rooftop restaurant. Nice comfortable bed.
",5,2019,04,26
135,Just excellent !!!,"Our citytrip to London was great, but the hotel really made it really excellent! They were really nice people and helped us with whatever we needed. The room was very nice and full of luxury. The drinks were complimentary and the beds were amazing. 
Thanks to all the people in the hotel for making our citytrip complete!",5,2019,04,23
135,Perfect Easter break,"What a perfect hidden gem.
Impeccable service and beautifully designed interiors.
Made to feel very welcome. 
Views from the roof top terrace restaurant were great only wish we had stayed longer so that we could have eaten there.",5,2019,04,22
135,Talbot,"Please send some front line staff for English lessons who clearly struggle to comprehend the language
Please consider introducing light meals throughout the day rather than restricted to set meal times",4,2019,04,20
135,Impeccable service in a great location,"The perfect hotel for people with business in the City of London, down a quiet side street but just a few meters from busy Queen Victoria Street. The hotel is beautiful and comfortable. The staff is friendly and attentive. The food at the rooftop restaurant is superb. Would definitely visit again!",5,2019,04,20
135,A little jewel of a hotel,"Great rooms, great service, great continental breakfast. The attention to detail is wonderful. The experience was a real treat, except for on the saturday night when we visited the RoofTop Bar, which itself is beautiful, but there appeared to be some problem between staff members behind the bar. As it is a small space this felt quite obvious and a bit uncomfortable. But I'm sure this will be transient - the hotel in general is wonderful!",5,2019,04,17
135,Great Trip,Stayed her on business and could not have been any more comfortable. Will be coming back for any future stays in London. The rooms were spacious and the staff was more than accommodating throughout the entirety of my stay. ,5,2019,04,15
135,Lovely hotel ,"Beautifully decorated hotel; (superior) room was well thought-out and very comfortable with a fridge of complimentary soft drinks. No need to wonder what time it is - C Wren’s less famous church is next door & the clock chimes every 15 minutes, comforting! Staff are very attentive. Room was very clean and was refreshed frequently.  We ate in the roof top restaurant and the food was delicious. The roof terrace in warmer weather would be special for drinks. The area’s super busy Monday to Friday being a centre of business, but very quiet at the weekend with many pubs, shops etc closed. Great tube link. Loved it. ",5,2019,04,14
135,Impeccable end-to-end experience,"Right from the point of booking, the level of care taken to make sure we had everything we needed before and during our stay was just right. Good customer service is something you always hope to get but this was exceptional. From reception recommending we loan a hotel umbrella to dodge the forecast rain (glad we did), to a birthday message left in the room, it made such a difference. The attention to detail in the room design and decor gave a nod to the history of the area but was contemporary too. There are some great reviews on here about this hotel and if you’re thinking of staying in this area of London, stay here.

Thanks Vintry and Mercer - we look forward to coming back soon.",5,2019,04,14
135,Really nice but wouldn't return,"This is the first I have left an irresolute review of a hotel, but I am really undecided over this place taking into account the fee I was charged.
We spent 2 weekend nights here to celebrate our 20th wedding anniversary, but if you are looking to party, this really isn’t the venue for you.
The hotel has a lot going for it. It is beautifully decorated, the staff are outrageously helpful and polite and there is a tube station at the top of the road. I cannot comment on the restaurants because we didn’t eat there. We had a couple of glasses of home-brew lager (Meantime- never heard of it) that came to £13.50 and we noticed a piece of cheese on toast was £15, so decided to eat elsewhere until the lottery numbers come in.
Our room was beautiful but ridiculously small. I would say, at least half the size of a Premier Inn average room. It may be ok for one person but certainly not 2. There wasn’t room for 2 cases, no seats to sit and watch TV and I fell into the window several times trying to clamber around my side of the bed. I was particularly disappointed with the shoe-box sized room we’d been given, but have no idea if other rooms are bigger.
Our room (612) was in an atrium and faced an office containing 3 male employees. I think the curtains in our room were attached to their heads or maybe an alarm went off in their office because every time we opened the curtains, they all turned and leered into our room. That’s fine if you are an extrovert, voyeuristic type but it wasn’t our cup of tea so we kept the curtains shut.
The atrium caused additional problems in the shape of noise. I appreciate that this is a city hotel but it would be nice to get a bit of a lie-in at the weekend when paying hundreds per night for a room. The noise started around 7.30 am when bins and trolleys are dragged along the floor and bottles thrown into the bin. The noise rose up the atrium walls like smoke bellowing up a chimney. This was the calm before the storm as the construction site next door (sounded like it was on the roof!) started its unbelievable din at 8.00am. You could argue that the construction site isn’t the hotel’s fault, but the grinding howl that echoes through the hotel every time someone turns on a tap certainly is. I thought I was in a 1960’s Best Western, not a brand new 5 start hotel.
The worst part for us was the location, particularly because we wanted to celebrate. The location of the hotel is perfect if you are here for business, but if you want a late drink, the whole of the area is shut at 10.30pm. Absolutely nowhere is serving and we were in bed before midnight on both nights. There is a late night bar in the basement of the hotel. We went on the Friday and ordered 2 drinks (no JD just their own brands). There was only one employee behind the bar making cocktails. We waited 15 minutes for our drinks before giving up and retiring to our rooms.
I appreciate that some of these issues are not the fault of the hotel, but the hotel did not suit what we visited London for. We wouldn’t return, but I guess it would suit most people if you fancy an early night and a nice, clean room.",3,2019,04,14
135,Awesome hotel,"What a great find. Ideally we’d stay in central London but this is right next to the tube stop so very handy
The overall hotel design is beautiful, well laid out and the bedrooms are gorgeous. 
Didn’t get to spend too much time in the hotel but the staff were overall helpful and friendly which really made a difference. The queen bed was super comfy too",5,2019,04,14
135,Great Saturday night stay,"Myself and my partner stayed here with parents and brother and sister in law for a Saturday night. Hotel is a very short walk from mansion house station, via circle ad district lines and as it was a Saturday, the city wasn’t it’s normal busy self, which is was perfect for us. 
Hotel is decorated lovely and the staff are really friendly. 
We all had one of the basic rooms and although small, this is normal for most London basic hotel rooms. We had a peaceful nights sleep and bed was comfy. Bathroom had a lovely big shower and all the necessary toiletries that were required.
We had dinner in the restaurant and took advantage of their 25% opening discount offer. Food really was lovely, gutted we couldn’t go out on roof top, but that is the typical British weather for you. We went to the DND bar after and what a great little bar this was. We went for a few cocktails and got chatting to the bar staff. We had cocktails that were not on the menu, so they are accommodating. Prices are expensive but only what you would expect in a London hotel bar.
We had breakfast and this was great. Likes the set up and plenty to choose from. And for a Sunday in a London hotel didn’t seem too busy. 
We enjoyed our stay so much, we are there again Easter weekend to celebrate my birthday and as a treat, upgraded to a room with a balcony.",5,2019,04,14
135,Great place to stay.,"Great location. Welcoming staff on arrival, very helpful throughout stay. Room was beautifully decorated and furnished. Breakfast very nice. Would definitely return and recommend to friends and family.",5,2019,04,14
135,Highly recommend,"The hotel is a classy establishment. The staff were incredibly helpful and proactive from the outside, allowing for a hugely enjoyable stay. Superbly located with amazing facilities and speak-easy bar on site. Highly recommend",5,2019,04,12
135,A fantastic place.,"The attention to detail and attentiveness of the staff was amazing. 
All fixtures and fittings are high end. We enjoyed cocktails with a twist in both the rooftop bar and speakeasy. 
We had a fantastic stay and were made to feel special.",5,2019,04,08
135,Top class hotel in great location ,"This is already on my hotel top list. And it’s only 2 months old. 

The staff are super - and no matter how snazzy your rooms are - if you don’t have 5 start staff you don’t have 5 star service. 

Check in was great - fast, friendly and efficient. 

The room was small ( they said we got an upgrade so I’m not sure how small the basic room might be!). But honestly whether it’s business or pleasure you don’t go to London to spend too much time in your room and in a location like this space is expensive. 

That being said whoever they brought in to do design did a great job. The rooms feel smart and stylish and so do the public spaces. It’s modern but retains a sense of its London merchant past 

I’m hoping I can review the restaurants separately because we ate some amazing food in our short stay. The 7th floor has a great British focused menu  and great views and they execute very well

The only minor gripe is if you get picked up or dropped off by car it’s not a convenient road to drive down. 

But that really is minor given how excellent it it

Try it

135,We'll be back!,"The hotel was unique and beautiful making a short stay feel like a holiday; the staff are incredibly friendly and the complimentary beverages, as well as the use of facilities, makes this hotel a 5* experience. Our room was even tidied with clean towels and snacks and drinks topped up whilst we were out on the evening that we checked in - something we didn't expect. The breakfast was delicious with a wide range of choice. We really enjoyed both the DND bar and the roof top terrace, although we didn't have time to try a meal there, so we will have to return! ",5,2019,04,08
135,Great Hotel,"Super hotel with glamorous decor, great food and drink and super friendly staff. 3 areas for food and drink within the hotel, which was brilliant. Great location, as quieter at weekend but still loads to see, we visited The Tate, The Ned, The Royal exchange, Sky Gardens and more!  ",5,2019,04,08
135,Such a wonderful night out! ,"We were walking around the centre of London about a week ago with my girlfriend and we thought to try out the Vintry and Mercer, since we heard about it on social media. As we walked in we actually had the luck to be welcomed by the restaurant manager, Daniel! With his big welcoming smile he took us in a little tour around the hotel, and we saw things we wouldn't expect!! They have 3 
Food and beverage departments, one in the ground floor with amazing natural light decorations and wine barrels, one speakeasy bar on the basement floor called DnD (do not disturb) with very interesting cocktail menu and last but not least their Mercer Terrace on the top floor with heartbreaking views of the London skyline! Although we didn't want to leave this spectacular terrace restaurant we decided to dine at the Vintry kitchen and we were not disappointed as their outstanding Asian style cousine (plenty of vegetarian and seafood dishes) met beyond our expectations!! Thank you very much Daniel and your staff for such an amazing experience! ",5,2019,04,07
135,Fantastic,"Really fantasic hotel, not so big, close to subway and a nice quiet location. Very nice deco - newly opened so everything was tip top. Staff was really helpful and there was a good atmosphere. Rooftop bar is very nice and convinient. Highly recommended - all services (wifi, even minibar) was complimentary!",5,2019,04,06
135,"Comfortable, quiet and immaculate, will return","Stayed two nights, and was not disappointed.  My room was at the back and very quiet.  Very comfortable room and bathroom, everything immaculate.  Room service was from a small list of choices but good food and good service. ",4,2019,04,06
135,Vacation,A new hotel but they were not ready to open. Heat didn’t work the last 2 night and room for real cold. Main TV didn’t work first 3 nights. We were offered another room but it was a lot smaller and no rate reduction was offered. Water pipes had loud horn sound when turned on in our room as well as others above and below.  This made the mornings very loud.  Hard to get in and out of dead end street for cabs. ,1,2019,04,05
135,Lovely Hotel,"We loved everything about this hotel.   The location is perfect for getting to many tourist sites as well as getting to some of the trendier parts of London.  We walked everywhere and came back to the rooms with thoughtful touches.  You get a personal internet enabled device that makes calls, you can use for maps, search for nearby restaurants etc. We took it with us and it worked great everywhere.  Never seen anything like it in other hotels but certainly hope to again.  Lots of ways to control the room lightning, a comfortable bed and great rain shower just added to the experience.  Probably the highlight of the hotel for us though was the basement speakeasy bar.  If you appreciate cocktails, make a point to go and see if Fabio is working.  He is a very kind, knowledgeable and talented bartender--one of the best I've ever encountered.  Highly recommend.",5,2019,04,04
135,Fantastic Service,"Definitely one of my top 3 hotels globally. The service was impeccable, to a similar standard as Il Salviatino in Florence. I have recommended this already to several friends and colleagues and returned twice in the last month already!",5,2019,04,03
135,What a find in the heart of the city.  Beautiful place - a special weekend.,"Perfect location, quietly tucked away in a cobbled street but walking distance from tubes and city sights.  Very relaxed welcome with Angela - who was so professional and friendly.  Our room was ready early and check in super smooth.A beautiful room, stunning décor and the most comfortable bed ever.  Free non alcoholic drinks in the mini bar with tea, coffee and snacks.  Spent our evening at the rooftop bar, drinking lovely wine and snuggled under fluffy blankets, looking over the city.  Great atmosphere, just don't want everyone to find it and it get too busy!  Its such a gem of a find and we will definitely be returning.  The most relaxed stay in London ever and there is nothing they wont accommodate for their visitors.  Staff are all so helpful.  Great facilities for meetings, DND bar is a must and the gym is very well equipped.  ",5,2019,04,03
135,Shh - keep it a secret,"Great spot. Hidden down a little lane this new hotel has a great ambience and style. We loved our stay. Room was great. Didn't eat at the hotel but can highly recommend the roof top bar for a drink and the 'hidden' DND bar downstairs was great.

Keep it a secret so it doesn't get too busy - just for those in the know.",5,2019,04,01
135,Little gem in the City,"Stayed in 301 for a night to celebrate our anniversary.  The hotel is hidden at the end of Garlick street - only a 2 min stroll from Mansion House Station. Reception is tucked away on the right and the entrance level has a bar/breakfast area as you head through to the lifts. I arrived at about 7pm and the place was buzzing, yet a really easy and friendly checkin and up to the room.

We had a studio suite which was excellent - super comfy bed, foam pillows as we had requested before arrival were on the bed, a lovely Happy Anniversary welcome cake and the decor and cleanliness of the room was flawless. 

A huge long balcony (although being on the third floor, we only had a view of the church opposite), a great little work area and a lovely bathroom, with good free wifi and a great HD TV.

A little minor gripe was the lack an iron in the room and a strange design on the shower door - which meant there was no handle on the inside to shut the shower door and because the door was flush with the floor - it removed the shower mat when you wanted to step out. I am not sure the fun rubber ducks they provide were impressed!

We had dinner at the roof top restaurant which is very nice. A great outside rooftop area and a nice dining area. The menu is possibly just a little too eclectic - trying a little too hard, but the staff were fantastic and attentive.

Breakfast downstairs was good too - great cooked options and a decent buffet too.

Check out was as painless as check in and we were sad to have to leave so early. A really excellent bolthole in the City.",5,2019,03,31
135,Outstanding new boutique hotel,"This is a new hotel in the financial district of London. The location is lovely - walking distance to many sites. The hotel is truly memorable. Comfortable rooms and bed. Black out curtains and quiet. Exceptionally nice and helpful staff. Great amenities - free non-alcoholic drinks and snacks provided in the room. Outstanding continental breakfast that's included. The roof top dining room is beautiful and the food is excellent. The speak-easy is fun. Both spots are staffed by very knowledgeable bartenders who make creative and delicious cocktails. Honestly, I can't rave enough (and I'm a frequent business traveler who is hard to wow).",5,2019,03,31
135,Super place to stay,"The hotel had only been open a few days when we visited. The staff present as a happy well organised team and happy staff make for excellent service. We had a standard room , it was quite small but had everything you would expect of an excellent hotel. Breakfast is a treat, great choice and beautifully cooked. We had dinner in the restaurant , the food is fabulous, fresh, delicately seasoned , perfect. The Cheff will help if you are spoilt for choice. The hotel is tucked away so quiet but in an excelent cenral location so easy walking distace to many sights and the central or circle line. Great food and wine great hospitality, comfortable, well designed , great customer service and an excellent choice if you are on hoiday or on buisiness in London.",5,2019,03,31
135,Impeccable service and great location,"My wife and I booked through Mr and Mrs Smith and got a great rate for a 2 night stay in a superior room with the continental breakfast included. Upon arrival we were upgraded to a studio room which was a lovely surprise which had a nice view of the Shard, sofa area and big bathroom with a bathtub. The front on house service was excellent on check in and out and very friendly throughout. 

All the rooms have complimentary soft drinks, snacks and water which was a nice touch and the beds were really comfy. The only thing I will say is that the blinds were not blackout so the light woke us up early on the first morning. The second night we requested an eye mask, which they provided for us no problem which helped with the light. 

The location is fantastic for the tube, literally a 1 minute walk from Mansion House tube stop and takes about 15 minutes to Oxford Circus and about 20-25 from Marylebone station. This made it easy to get to the theatre on the Friday and shopping on Saturday.

We had a cocktail in DnD downstairs before dinner in the Terrace. The bar had a really nice vibe to it and the drinks were lovely. Dinner in the Terrace was delicious and the staff really worked hard on the service. You can tell that they want to make it a success and couldn't do enough to make the meal one to remember.

Breakfast was very good but as I included it in the room rate we could only get the continental. However the first morning we asked to switch to a cooked Al a Carte option as it was the same price and they let us do this out of goodwill which was really nice. The second morning we were short on time so we had the continental which was good but I feel that for £18 there could a few more options to make it worth while. The Al a Carte option was excellent though and a cooked breakfast was £12.50.

All in all a great 2 night stay and a lovely new hotel with great staff, service in a fantastic location. We would stay again.",5,2019,03,25
135,Fantastic spot for business and pleasure!,"My family and I were looking for a new spot in the city which not only had a roof garden - but also did great food! A friend suggested we try Vintry and Mercer. 

On arrival the staff were super friendly and attentive - nothing was a chore! We were sat close to the kitchen which was buzzing! 

We ordered steak tartare and cod cheeks to start - WOW! Presentation and quality were second to none. 

Alongside our starters, we also had sourdough and Guinness break. Again, WOW!

For mains, we took things to the next level and ordered two tomahawk steaks, triple cooked chips, Yorkshire puddings and all the butter/sauces they offer. Sorry to repeat ... but WOW! It was fantastic. The head chef, Chris Golding, personally came to our table and calved the steaks up. It was great and really added to the experience. 

We will certainly return!",5,2019,03,25
135,New and not blue,"Vintry and Mercer still smells new in a positive way. Excellent service alreday before getting out of my taxi outside until after checking out, taking care of my luggage until late the day I checked out. The room was extremly nice, I even had a TV in the bathroom. Nespresso machine and even a socket for my Swedish standard charger, not only adaptor UK/EU. Nice breakfast with at least some of the staff alreaduy knew what to do. Very nice top restaurant and bar with outdoor seatings. Water and other stuff free of charge at least in this room category. I give the hotel 4+ as the location is quiet but still very central in the City of London. I wish the hotel and it's staff good luck!",4,2019,03,22
135,One of the best hotels we’ve stayed in while in London,"I stayed last Friday with my boyfriend and we both agreed this was one of the nicest / cleanest hotels we’d ever stayed in. 
The hotel is so pretty, the staff are friendly and always happy to help. 
Checking in went well, they found our booking straight away. 
We were taken up to our room on the 5th floor and were shown how everything works, what the different buttons for the lights do etc..
The hotel rooms are spotless, they even brought up some cake and a card saying happy birthday for my other half which was a lovely touch.
We went out for dinner and when we can back we had fresh towels in the room and our room had been tidied for us, it was a nice thing to come back too. 
We would recommend this hotel to anyone and everyone! We’ll definitely be coming back!",5,2019,03,20
135,Excellent service,This was booked for me as a surprise birthday present. On arrival we received an upgrade - totally unexpected but so grateful for. Room lovely and spacious. Everything there that you need for a comfortable stay. The staff are this hotels main strength. Extremely friendly and polite and nothing was too much trouble. Would definitely recommend this hotel to any of my friends and family. ,5,2019,03,19
135,The best hotel in London - truly 5* luxury!,"I booked this hotel as a surprise for my fiancé’s birthday. When I booked I let the hotel know we were celebrating just incase they could make it that little bit extra special! Well, they were simply amazing! When we arrived the amazing staff allowed us to check in early and upgraded us to an amazing studio! Later that night, when we arrived back from dinner they had left a birthday selection of cakes and chocolates in the room. The decor is simply fantastic all over the hotel. The rooms are perfect. Our bath even had a tv!! The bar downstairs is wonderful. It’s a speak easy style that serves incredible cocktails. My fiancé and I did not want to leave! It was the perfect stay and we are already planning our next visit. Thank you so much Vintry & Mercer!",5,2019,03,17
135,Lovely,"What a lovely hotel! The check in was quick, with the staff being friendly and polite. I was allowed to check in early which was really helpful. The room itself was lovely. A nice amount of space and lots of neat touched such as the heated bathroom floor, adjustable lighting and complementary mini bar with soft drinks and snacks. The bed was super comfortable and the hotel was really quiet. Would have no hesitation in staying here again.",5,2019,03,17
135,Just fabulous!,"Everything about my stay at Vintry and Mercer was utterly stunning (the foyer light fitting is worth visiting in itself!). I stayed in a Deluxe room, and the entire room was beautifully decorated with so many little touches that made it very clear a lot of thought had gone into the room. The staff were so friendly, approachable and helpful. The location was so convenient and easy to get to, and the hotel itself was quiet I could not recommend this hotel more!",5,2019,03,17
135,Excellent experience,"Decided to try this place out as work is just opposite and have seen this place being built for the last few years.
We were not disappointed from the moment we walked in greeted by a team of welcoming faces we were shown to our table and then approached by what I assume is the manager who introduced himself as Carmelo. From the get go he had great suggestions of wine and the food that we must try. The service was impeccable and went without any issues, we had a fillet steak cooked to perfection with the side recommended to us, cauliflower cheese. My friends had two halibut and side of chips and spinach. Everything was delightful and if the food doesn't do it for you then the service definitely will, even just for a drink you'll have amazing recommendations. What a great little find in the centre of the city 100% will be back in the summer to have a after work drink on the terrace.",4,2019,03,16
135,It's the little extras that make it a big positive stay,"If you want to stay a Hotel that has the amenities you need but also has little extras to make your stay feel more special then this is the Hotel for you. 
- friendly, approachable staff
- couple of minutes walk from Mansion House tube station
- Mansion House tube on the circle line direct from Paddington station
- fridge in room with soft drinks, bottled water and fresh milk
- Nespresso machine, tea making facilities and fair trade biscuits in the room
- a personal mobile concierge in the room to check the weather, book trips, plan your days out
- scrumptious new beds and pillows
- daily newspapers
- healthy breakfasts within a relaxing environment
- a gym
- weighing scales in bathroom to help you check you are not piling on the pounds during your stay!
- a rubber duck for bath companionship!
Would have no hesitation booking and staying again. T",5,2019,03,12
135,5 stars for service ⭐️,What a lovely new place in the city! We booked for Friday night and it place was nicely busing but not overcrowded. We started our drinks at the bar downstairs - I love the name Do not disturb! And we continued a dinner upstairs at the roof top. Stunning place with a spectacular view.  We got welcomed by host I believe his name was Carmelo and he give us spot on table. I must say he was look after trough the night and always checking on us if we have all what we need. More places should have service like this. The menu is well balanced and everybody can choose. It is split into 4 section so even vegetarian person like me can choose. My fav dish was the celariac with hazelnut. My friend ordered English snails on the butter and she was more than satisfied with this dish. I would highly recommend this place and I will be defiantly coming back to try their other floor with tapas food.,5,2019,03,12
135,Relaxing stay in a beautiful hotel,"Hotel is stunning, attention & detail from the staff was excellent. We stayed in standard room, one word to describe.. Luxurious. The little details like turning your bed down & drawing the curtains, so nice. The bed is soo comfy. Can't fault this hotel, our stay was so relaxing in such a busy city.",5,2019,03,11
135,Luxury on the doorstep of London town ,"I have had the real pleasure of staying here last night for a quick business trip to the BIG smoke. I came across this little gem when scrolling through booking.com. A typical habit when trying to find somewhere central, comfortable and safe for travelling to the City on my own.

The welcome at reception was prompt, friendly and welcoming. This to a very weary traveller who had been on the go since 5am was very pleasing. 

My luggage and I were escorted to my room on the 5th floor, which was a nook of tranquility and relaxation. A lovely cosy and very comfortable room. With everything you could possibly need to hand. Very quiet indeed, no next door or outdoor noise! A most comfortable nights rest in a most divine bed. Prompt and very tasty room service. Plus a 12pm check out ta boot!

Would highly recommend!!",5,2019,03,07
135,Such a fabulous stay!,"Only open a month, the hotel is understandable in beautiful condition. In addition to the sumptuous decor, they've really thought about every little detail to demonstrate luxury, from the free soft drinks in the minibar to the connected devices for in-room ordering etc. We ate at the roof top restaurant (too cold to sit outside but it looked fab) and the food and drink was brilliant. Gym was nicely fitted out, although small so only a couple of machines and weights. Breakfast in the ground floor restaurant was great. But it's the staff that make this hotel - everyone we met was so friendly, so helpful, couldn't do enough to help us, and all with a bit of personality. All in all, a really lovely luxury escape. Bravo!",5,2019,03,05
135,Nice stay few things could be different ,"Just checked out today. Lovely one night stay. The rooms look great with some posh features. Drier in room, complimentary tea, coffee and soft drinks. All the nice little touches of liquids, vanity kit, shoe shine, soap and even scales. Heated bathroom floor, room service, great tv, nice pillows and huge bed. Good lighting system and little vanity mirror & speaker. Staff very polite and attentive. 

Few issues though we found need improvement which are:

Horrible noise when tap used (414)
Shower seal not quite right and water floods into bathroom.
The safe opens itself and blocks the wardrobe from closing.
No coat hooks.
Light panels by the beds don't dim so there is a little light on all night. 
Breakfast wasn't very clear, partner ended up paying £18 for one bowl of cereal as the toaster was broken and thought he could choose sausages beans etc from a counter but that's only made to order. 
Roof terrace not complete yet so decided to have a couple of drinks up on floor 7, but prices very high and didn't really have drinks we required. 

We had a good nights sleep that's the main thing and enjoyed our stay. ",4,2019,03,04
135,Very good ,"The hotel’s location is excellent, close to Mansion House, walking distance from St Paul. Small rooms, very well equipped. Everything very new. Helpful staff. Small tapas restaurant in the hotel, perfect for evenings when you don’t feel like roaming the city. Wine kept in wine barrels at the entrance of the restaurant. Recommended.
",4,2019,03,03
135,Stunning hotel with amazing staff,"Sadly, only got to spend one night at this gorgeous hotel.
A long awaited child free night away for my friends birthday; this was the perfect location.
Location - so easy to find, a stones throw from Mansion House or Cannon St stations. Very quiet at the weekend and noticed free weekend on street parking nearby. We went into the West End and it didn’t take long by tube.
Hotel - beautiful in a word. Great that it’s a new hotel, still had the smell of freshly laid carpets. Attention to detail and the interior design feels luxurious and sumptuous. We were upgraded to a superior room and I have never felt so spoilt. Robes, slippers, complimentary soft drinks, toiletries, even an umbrella in the room for the British weather!
Staff - outstanding! 5*!! What a credit to the hotel. From the moment of stepping in the door everybody was so friendly and helpful and it felt completely genuine. Got checked in early by the lovely lady on front desk. David on concierge, Daniel and his restaurant and bar team, especially Erica and Ronalto. 
Food - Continental breakfast was included. Plenty of choice, the food was fresh and great quality. Didn’t feel the need for a cooked breakfast, however, it was available I noticed. 
We had complimentary bubbly on the roof top restaurant terrace on arrival, served by the very friendly Ronalto. Views of the Shard and St Paul’s. Daniel then helped us with our travel plans. 
Returned to the hotel at 11:30pm and had a night cap in the elegant Do Not Disturb basement bar. Delicious cocktails and attentive service from Erica.
And finally, the finishing touch was to place a plate in our room with Birthday wishes and chocolates for my friend. 
Will definitely be returning as soon as possible.",5,2019,03,03
135,"Beautiful hotel, well thought out facilities and fantastic staff","Just returned from a 2 night stay at the Vintry and Mercer in central London. Located just 5 minutes away from the stunning St Paul’s Cathedral and only a 10 minute from from Bank Station the hotel is in a great location whether travelling for business or pleasure.
As Iv said in the title the staff here are absolutely fantastic. They are informative and friendly without being overpowering and really do seem happy to go above and beyond to ensure all needs and desires are catered for. 
The facilities at this hotel are great. They really have thought of everything giving the rooms a modern feel which is a nice contrast to some of the traditional touches. 
I will definitely be returning to this hotel and will certainly be reccomending to any friends requiring a London hotel with a great location and fantastic food.",5,2019,03,03
135,Rooftop Restaurant and Terrace,"Interesting and fairly unique views of the City and further out to both the East and West and also South over the River. The food, cocktails, beers and wine all top notch and the service was very friendly. Prices very reasonable too for what and where it is, so all round it's certainly worth a visit. Lunchtime was good but they say that sunset and early evening is a bit special and I could well believe that. Did not stay at the hotel but it looked really nice, very ""boutique"".",4,2019,03,01
135,AMAZING,"Usually I don't do reviews but my gosh, from the small details on the plate to the huge flavours we as a group do not have a single bad word to say about this restaurant. Very clean, very helpful, food is spectacular and the selection of drinks marry with the menu very well.

Many many many thanks to chef Chris and his team of talented chefs. 

Be back very soon!!!",5,2019,02,26
135,Superb,"I have nothing negative to say about this hotel. Extremely helpful and friendly staff. Spotless and clean room. Would definitely recommend this hotel, maybe I should not write this review!....keep it one of London’s best kept secrets 😃",5,2019,02,24
135,Exceptional Service,"This hotel was booked for a business trip for colleagues, the feedback has been that the hotel is stunning and staff went above and beyond for them. Personally I would like to thank Malvika, I was stuck get some documentations to my colleagues and she and her co-workers looked after everything for me, I have had to do transactions like this with lots of hotels over the years and this hotel stood out on top for their willingness to make sure we were looked after. I am not surprised my colleagues feedback  confirmed they received 5 star treartment whilst there! Keep up the good work, I look forward to being able to use this hotel again.",5,2019,02,20
135,Dinner night in London,"This new restaurant is a must if you are in London. It is not only located in a great place and carefully decorated to make you feel super comfy in a stylish quirky environment but it also offers you a memorable experience thanks to the amazing food it has. Everything is so well cooked and prepared that you feel as asking every single dish of the menu. The lemon sole, the rib eye  and the oysters were so tasty, you cant leave the place without trying these! Even more for those who love food and a personal treat, you will appreciate having the chance to meet the Chef that comes into your table to serve some dishes and ask how everything is, making the whole experience difficult to forget.",5,2019,02,20
135,Will be beautiful once its finished ,"I work just around the corner from this hotel and had booked a 1 nights stay for my boyfriends birthday via Secret Escapes. I had booked the room prior to the opening of the hotel, and was regularly walking past to check on its progress, it still looked like a building site 1 week before it was due to open.
However, upon check in I was pleasantly surprised to see that the interior was beautifully decorated and the staff at reception were smiley and friendly, although i would say that externally there was no real sign for the hotel and it could easily be missed.
Once we got to our room i was slightly disappointed to see they had given us a disabled room. Which, is fine If you are staying overnight for business, but for a special occasion, not only were we celebrating a birthday but I had also been offered a new job that day, so it was a double celebration, and for me personally it makes the stay less pleasurable if you dont have a lovely room.
We raised this with reception, who couldn't do more for us, they made a note on the account for future visits that our preference is to not have a disabled room, and they gave us a free upgrade on our room, to a much larger 'suite' (see pictures). Which we cant thank them enough for as it made an already good day  even better !
The room was beautiful and the bed was really comfortable, the only thing I would say is that there was still some finishing off to be done in certain areas of the hotel. For instance the panels in the lift werent quite stuck down properly and one of the TVs in the room wouldn't turn on (we had 3 so it wasn't really an issue). And
In the morning we were woken by the sound of building works going on in the room next door.

In respect of food we had dinner in the roof terrace restaurant, which I will write a review for separately as it deserves it's own review- its worth noting that it was wonderful, the staff were lovely and the food extremely tasty.

We also had breakfast the next morning. I should point out that only continental breakfast is included, which I think is really poor for a luxury hotel in central London, especially if you pay full price for a stay as it isn't cheap.
And to be honest it was a shambles, there was no juice or hot drinks out, and trying to get the notice of the wait staff was a nightmare. 
Compared with the attentiveness from the staff at reception and at dinner the night before, breakfast was a poor show.

Overall I would say its going to be a wonderful hotel, but it opened prematurely and they need to work out the kinks to get it just right.",4,2019,02,18
135,Dinner and stay,"My partner surprised me after work in London with a dinner and stay at this wonderful new place just down the road from my office (Friday 15 Feb). From the second I walked in I was in awe of the warm ambiance of the hotel, and the staff were all incredibly helpful. 

The room was wonderfully appointed, bed sumptuously comfortable and show head big and waterfall like - a point particularly appreciated. 

We started with some wonderful cocktails in DND  in the basement, then went for dinner on the top floor looking over London. Menu was not over sized, but beautiful food all night. Oysters fresh, steaks cooked to perfection and wine was lovely. 

Out host in the restaurant was Carmelo and he was extremely helpful all night. In the morning the 

We would recommend this place to anyone and would love to go back. ",5,2019,02,18
135,What a find in the City!,"Excellent 
Check in - Perfect
Room - Fantastic, quiet with top class facilities and free soft drinks, snacks and real milk.
Food. We had steak in the roof top restaurant - Superb.
Continental Breakfast - Excellent 
Check out. Seamless with taxi booked and waiting.
Great to see staff pulling not pushing the sign of true team work.
Well done after two weeks.",5,2019,02,17
135,Really enjoyable!,"Stayed a Saturday night here with my husband.  The hotel has not even been open a fortnight yet, so everything’s brand new, trendy and smells freshly painted.  Standard room was nicely equipped, super comfy bed and lovely bathroom.  Plus, a ‘proper’ hairdryer to rival something you’d have in a salon .... not one of those ridiculous ones that hang on the wall.   

Dinner in the Roof Terrace restaurant was delicious and cocktails in the downstairs secret bar DND were amazing.  Breakfast was plentiful and there was lots of choice.

Located close to Mansion House tube station, so was an easy trip from St Pancras for us.   Great area, near to Borough Market and everything the Southbank offers. 

We really had a fantastic grown up night away and would certainly recommend it.  Thank you to all the friendly and attentive staff.",5,2019,02,17
135,Extremely friendly & efficient check in,"Absolutely loved everything about this superb boutique hotel. My friend & I were greeted by the most polite friendly young man on reception, so very sorry I didn't catch his name properly. However all the staff there were extremely friendly. The room although quite small was extremely plush with expensive gadgets.  We had evening meal on the 7th floor which was delicious as was breakfast the next morning. We arrived last Friday & were told it had only opened on the Monday, we were amazed at how efficiently it was all running and saw no signs of any newly opening teething problems.So how surprised was I, as I am an avid reader of the Saturday Daily Mails An Inspector Calls column when I read his review about the hotel. One that he must have been there the same weekend as us, and secondly that he had experienced a problem with his shower not draining properly, even though he was apparently upgraded to a room with a bath. We were not upgraded, however experienced none of the issues he raised thank goodness. What a terrible shame for the V&M that the very room he stayed in had problems. These things happen I suppose in any new ventures. I wish them good luck for the future of the hotel and will definitely be returning.",5,2019,02,16
135,Amazing hotel,Stayed here for opening weekend and was extremely impressed with the hotel and the staff. Service throughout was fantastic and so much attention to detail on the design and decor of the hotel. The rooms are lovely with complimentary mini bar and snacks. Visited the rooftop terrace and basement cocktail bar for drinks both lovely venues with staff very knowledgeable and gong the extra mile - would definitely recommend you go ahead and book you won’t be disappointed.,5,2019,02,15
135,Lovely boutique hotel,"We stayed here 6 days after the hotel opened. 
The hotel is a little tricky to find due to limited signage but is down a lovely quiet cobbled street and the doors are signposted with two planters. I love the way the street cobbles are taken in to the entrance of the hotel and the industrial style windows in the lobby area. 
The lobby has a lovely botanical decor, very friendly staff who happy to assist and please. 
There are a few minor things that need finishing off but nothing that bothered us. 
Rooms are beautifully styled. I found the mattress to be very comfortable, decent lighting with switches next to the bed and where you would expect them to be. USB points, coffee machine, complimentary soft drink mini bar, fresh milk, hairdryer. 
I did feel that the room needed an additional mirror. Full length somewhere as the only mirror available is in the bathroom. 
It would also be nice to have an iron/ironing board in the room rather than having to call down for one. 
We had a good nights sleep. Very quiet and was lovely to hear the church clock (take ear plugs if this is likely to irritate). 
Breakfast was beautifully displayed. Fresh, good quality pastries and breads. Eggs were beautifully poached and the bacon was of great quality. Tea & coffee was good. 
Staff were very nice and attentive. 
We will definitely return. Such a lovely quiet part of London (well on a weekend!). Walking distance to St Paul’s and an underground station within a 2 minute walk.",4,2019,02,10
135,Beautiful Hotel,"Beautiful newly opened hotel. Yes building work was still going on, but we stayed in the hotel the first weekend they had opened. Beside teething problems, which kind of need to happen to help the hotel find its way, you wouldn’t know straight away that it was in its first week of opening, except the fresh smell of every thing! Beautifully modern rooms full of all the amenities you’d ever need.. coffee machine, fridge, safe, bathrooms and slippers and even a phone that you could take out of the hotel! Includes a roof top bar and restaurant, ground floor bar and restaurant and even a basement cocktail bar! Cocktails were lovely and breakfast was good. Quite easy to find and amazing transport links. A MUST STAY!!",5,2019,02,10
135,Has the potential to be excellent when all the work is completed.,"This hotel has the potential to be very good but building work was still going on when we stayed here.  On arrival we had problems actually finding the hotel as the signage had not been completed.  In the end we phoned a very helpful staff member came and stood on the pavement so we could find the entrance (we had actually walked past it several times!).  The staff were all very friendly and helpful.  Some of them weren't able to answer our queries as they explained they'd only just started working there that week.  The breakfast was very good and the rooms were comfortable, stylish and well-equipped.  We generally slept well although found the mattress a little firm and were disturbed early in the morning by noise from the street and possibly building work.  I feel the rooms could really do with triple glazing unless this noise is unlikely to happen once the building work is completed.  Overall its a nice hotel and should be very good once all the work has been completed - we would certainly consider staying here again.  I was undecided between a 3 star and 4 star review but felt the friendliness of the staff, well equipped rooms and potential to be excellent once all the work was completed meant the hotel did deserve a 4 star review.",4,2019,02,10
135,Exceptional ,"Stunning terrace views, innovative food and cocktail menus and a laid-back bohemian speakeasy bar.....V&M manages to effortlessly combine Mayfair class and chic with a contemporary City vibe.

Excellent cleanliness and services. ",5,2024,06,03
135,Beautiful experience,"Convenient central structure near the metro Maison house or bank. The staff is helpful and professional. On the last day of the holiday there was a blackout in the hotel, the next day the Director Dimitri Cigliano and all his kind staff accommodated us in another structure, organizing an early morning transfer.

135,Sehr schönes Stadthotel in zentraler Lage,Wir waren aufgrund der sehr guten Bewertungen hier bei TA kürzlich über ein verlängertes Wochenende im VINTRY & MERCER zu Gast. Die Lage des Hotels im Bankenviertel und unmittelbar an der U-Bahn-Station Mansion House ermöglicht es perfekt mit öffentlichen Verkehrsmitteln anzureisen und genau so auch die Stadt zu erkunden. Unser Zimmer war sehr schön und geschmackvoll eingerichtet - aber leider auch sehr klein. Die Fußbodenheizung im Bad funktionierte garnicht und die normale Heizung war im Betrieb störend. Das Frühstück war - für ein englisches Hotel - sicher OK - wir haben es aber nur einmal ausprobiert. Tolle Empfehlung als Alternative für das Frühstück und nur ein paar Minuten zu Fuß entfernt: das „THE NED“. Das Personal war ausnahmslos sehr freundlich und zuvorkommend. ,4,2019,12,08
135,"Objetivamente, un gran hotel","Subjetivamente, algo falla. 
Empezando por lo subjetivo, el hotel verdaderamente transmite sensación de hotel boutique, casi de bed and breakfast. No impresiona nada más entrar, pero poco a poco vas descubriendo detalles que demuestran que estás en un hotel mejor de lo que a primera vista parece. En mi opinión, la decoración de la recepción no es muy acertada, pero tampoco es algo grave. 
Con la habitación pasa algo parecido. Nada más entrar, decepciona el tamaño y la poca claridad. Luego, recuerdas que estás en Londres y que las cosas son así. Por eso pienso que subjetivamente, no es un hotel perfecto. 
Objetivamente, lo es. La cama es grande y comodísima y la habitación cuenta con el mejor equipamiento que he visto nunca. Tele con Apple y Android TV y bluetooth, altavoz bluetooth, minibar con bebidas y snacks incluídos en el precio, buenos aménities, etc. La habitación está bien insonorizada. La ubicación me pareció muy buena para hacer turismo, a un paseo de St. Paul y del Borough Market, con muchos restaurantes por la zona recomendables e infinidad de paradas de metro en los alrededores.",4,2019,08,05
135,Wunderschöns Hotel!!,"Es gibt nichts zu beanstanden. Wirklich nichts!!!
Kostenloser Minibar, die rund um die Uhr befüllt wird. Sogar Spätabends fragt die Personal ob sie noch kostenloser Getränke oder Knabberzeug wollen
Lage: ausgezeichnet
Service: ausgezeichnet
Schlafqualität: ausgezeichnet",5,2019,07,07
135,Eccellente rapporto qualità prezzo,"Hotel nuovo vicino a St. Paul, a due passi dalla metropolitana di Mansion House. Camere un po’ piccole ma pulite e confortevoli, letto comodissimo, bagno provvisto di prodotti e set da bagno, doccia spaziosa e asciugamani morbidissimi. Macchinetta del caffè Nespresso in camera e frigo bar fornito. Abbiamo avuto un problema una notte, un vicino di stanza ubriaco ed alterato per sbaglio aveva provato ad entrare nella nostra camera, ma lo staff ha affrontato la situazione con prontezza è si sono resi disponibili a cambiarci stanza. Prezzi ottimi per essere un 5 stelle nel centro di Londra. Unica cosa, è una zona di uffici per cui nel fine settimana i locali sono chiusi o comunque aprono in tarda mattinata, anche la stazione di Mansion House era chiusa, ma poco male, due passi a piedi e si arriva alla stazione di St. Paul.",5,2019,06,30
135,"TOP: nuovo, bello e funzionale","Location: l'hotel è incastonato nel cuore della City, vicino al Millennium Bridge e a St. Paul, la cui cupola svetta lì accanto, in viuzze pedonali degne di un borgo Italiano (ma i taxi possono arrivarci). La fermata della Metro Mansion Street è a 100 metri a piedi, mentre The Bank, per la connessione con London City Airport, è a 7-8 minuti a piedi.
Gli spazi comuni, e l'ingresso, sono molto belli, pieni di verde e piante curate. Lo stile è in quel ''Parigi anni 30'' che tanto va di moda oggi, con poltrone in velluto, colori pieni, legno, marmi. 
Bella bella bella Location, più intima di molti altisonanti hotel che hanno ingressi ultra pomposi e camere vecchie.
Soggiornavo per il 40esimo compleanno della mia compagna; lo Staff ci ha accolte con ogni cura possibile, con qualche pasticcino in camera e due calici di champagne a piacere. 
La camera è perfetta: questo hotel è nuovissimo e si vede; nonostante le metrature non siano troppo ampie, soprattutto per le camere di categorie basiche (standard e deluxe), tutto trova il posto in un perfetto incastro, comodo e funzionale. 
La nostra, la 306, è una Suite Deluxe (corner). 
Bagno con ampia doccia filo pavimento (perfetta la pressione dell'acqua), vasca da bagno a immersione totale con schermo tv davanti per il relax, doppio lavabo. 
Kit di cortesia bello, con shampoo e balsamo di qualità che non vi faranno rimpiangere i vostri full size se - viaggiando con solo bagaglio a mano - non li avrete potuti portare. Riscaldamento a pavimento a completare l'opera. Asciugamani morbidissimi.
Letto molto comodo, e per me la qualità del sonno è fondamentale.
Camera - essendo corner - con parecchie finestre a tutta altezza, che si oscuravano con il telecomando accanto al letto. Doppio condizionatore, con doppio comando modulabile, per zona salotto e zona notte.
Accanto al letto la possibilità di settare l'illuminazione in un click con diverse modalità: luci accese/spente/soffuse/sonno/lettura.
Televisione anche nella zona salotto, con possibilità di connetterlo al televisore principale della zona letto.
Molto carina la possibilità di usufruire gratis del frigobar, con latte fresco e succo d'arancia (e di mela) e qualche snack, oltre all'acqua e soft drink.
Perfetto il WiFi.
Bene il ristorante sul Rooftop, leggermente overpriced rispetto le quantità ma di buona qualità e con una splendida vista. Il servizio comunque molto buono, ringraziamo Giorgio in particolare per l'accuratezza e la gentilezza.

Grazie Dimitri per aver compreso l'importanza di questo soggiorno, Linda per la pazienza, e grazie a tutto lo staff! 

Ritorneremo :)",5,2019,06,24

Camere moderne e molto ben curate nel letto e insonorizzazione. La dimensione delle camere è limitata (Deluxe) ma tutto è molto funzionale e piacevole. In definitiva è un hotel che consiglio per la qualità, ma certo non ha le atmosfere degli hotel più famosi di Londra",5,2019,05,12

135,Albergo eccellente,"L'albergo si trova in un vicoletto attaccato alla fermata della metro di Mansion House in mezzo alla City.
subito si intuisce che è stato realizzato da poco, tutto nuovo, tutto bello.
è stata dedicata grande cura nella ristrutturazione ed il risultato è molto positivo.
si parte dalla reception dove ad accoglierti c'è un personale molto preparato e gentile ( ci hanno dato una mano a cercare un pub dove cenare, han trovato valide soluzioni per andare in aereoporto, insomma bravi).
noi avevamo due camere comunicanti, una superior ed una delux per tre persone.
la delux era molto spaziosa, ideale appunto per farci stare anche il terzo figlio.
la superior comunque grande con un bagno enorme, unica pecca siccome presumo fosse una camera adatta anche ai portatori di handicap aveva il wc molto alto ed il lavandino molto piccolo e posizionato in basso, senza lo specchio davanti, discretamente scomodo.
Le camere son corredate di tutti i confort possibili ed immaginabili, frigo bar a disposizione, cassaforte, phon, adattatori per prese corrente, punti ricarica usb, cassa della Marshall per ascoltare la musica, mini ipad per navigare e telefonare con caricate utili app, regolazione luci e climatizzazione impeccabile, pavimento bagno riscaldato, ombrello per giorni di pioggia, macchina nespresso con cialde, etc etc
insomma impeccabile.
I letti erano comodissimi, ed il silenzio totale, per cui si dorme veramente bene, complimenti a chi ha realizzato l'insonorizzazione, non sentivamo neanche i nostri 3 figli che ascoltavano la musica.
Abbiamo cenato al ristorante in terrazza, molto bene e senza spendere cifre folli e con una vista fenomenale, abbiamo anche cenato in camera sfruttando il servizio cucina, molto valido.
la palestra è piccolina, ma ben attrezzata, con spugne e acqua a disposizione.
la colazione non l'abbiamo mai fatta in albergo per scelta nostra, ma sembrava invitante.
Che dire, tutto eccellente.
Unico appunto, ma non certo per colpa loro, la metro durante le vacanze di Pasqua era chiusa per lavori di manutenzione, per cui dovevamo andare a piedi a prendere l'altra linea a Bank, ma si tratta di 5 minuti.
Per il resto, l'hotel è a 5 minuti da saint Paul ed altrettanti dal millennium bridge.
Spero di tornarci presto.",5,2019,04,24
