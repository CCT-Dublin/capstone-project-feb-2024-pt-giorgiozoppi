124,"A phenomenal stay, thanks to the hotel staff! ","We stayed at the Kimpton Fitzroy for my birthday weekend, in the king suite, and couldn't wish for more! This hotel is absolutely stunning, but it is the service that makes it phenomenal.
Carlos who checked us in couldn't have been more attentive. He asked us if we were staying for a special occasion and when I told him it was my birthday, he arranged for a lovely dessert and note to be sent up to the room.
We couldn't go into our room straight away, but the staff made sure to keep us updated via text message as to when our room was ready. 
When we arrived back to our room in the evening, turn down service was being done and the lady who did this was kind and sweet. I loved that we didn't need to ask for this and that the little touches at this hotel were done without a second thought.
In the morning we ordered breakfast to our room and as far as hotel breakfasts go, this one was fantastic. 
Overall, if I could give this more than 5 stars, I would. Thank you to the amazing team who make this hotel somewhere that feels slightly out of this world but also for making you feel at home ❤️ Nobody could do enough for you and each person we spoke to was amazing at their job. ",5,2024,10,18
124,Stunning property with great staff and service!,"This is my second stay at this property, my first stay was when it was still The Principal and I had an excellent stay then too! Every staff member I spoke to was so helpful and courteous, but special thanks to Doreen, Tricia (I think? Sorry if I got your name wrong, you helped relocate me to the new room!) and the engineer who’s name I didn’t catch. I was actually ready to just suck it up because it seemed like it was a building issue, but he insisted on checking for another room to move me to.

I had booked a Queen with Park View room on the first floor, and was pleased that the room was ready for checking in before 2. Room itself was compact but tastefully decorated; comfortable for one and would have probably been tight for two. However to my dismay, there was a low-grade humming sound that was coming from some machinery, the kind that would give me a headache so I called down to see if there was anything that can be done. They sent an engineer right away, and he concluded there was nothing that could be done and informed the front desk that they should look to move me to a different room. The front desk let me know that they did not have anything available in the same category so it would “take some time”. I went out to explore and when I came back, my new room was ready and to my utter surprise and delight, they had relocated me to a giant suite! From looking on the website, the room category was “1 Bedroom Suite Dining Park View”. I have no status and actually booked through BA so I honestly was not expecting anything so this was a welcome surprise.

There was a huge living room, dining area and separate bedroom area with a canopy bed, writing desk and a bathtub by the windows. Also a large bathroom with double sinks, separate shower and toilet “room”. There was also a stand-alone toilet with sink just off the entrance/living room. Complimentary snacks, soft drinks, water and beer, as well as nespresso-like coffee machine and tea kettle. The fridge also had a little jug of milk (I love English hotels for thinking of the milk!)

Bathroom well stocked with nice sized bottles of shower gel, shampoo and conditioner. Also vanity kits with cotton buds/pads, shower gel, toothbrush/toothpaste, shower cap and even bath salts! Oh and the towel warmer was a definite treat. Bathroom floor also felt mildly heated. The water sometimes came out a bit onto the bathroom floor but it would be completely dry by the next morning (I was showering morning and night so this is pretty incredible).

While I didn’t try this time around, I do love that there is a coffee shop (Burr) in the hotel, as well as a cocktail bar (Fitz)There are also many details of the hotel building itself that is worth paying attention to (eg Lucky George!) Highly recommend taking the grand staircase and exploring the hotel. If there is a miss, I think it’s the lack of any sort of information highlighting the hotel’s history and architecture.

Hotel is in across from Russell Square, I really liked chilling out for a bit at the end of my day before heading back to the hotel. Or at the start while planning out my day! Around the corner is the Russell Square tube stop on the Piccadilly line. Easy ride from Heathrow. Tottenham Court Road is also walkable if you don’t have too much stuff for the Elizabeth Line. As is Holburn for the Central Line. Kings Cross/St Pancras is one stop on the Piccadilly line with multiple other lines to transfer to. Or you could take a leisurely 15 minute walk too.

My most important discovery this trip: around the corner/under 5 mins walk away is The Brunswick Centre. It’s like an open air mall with a courtyard area and shops and restaurants lining it all around. Boots, Sainsbury, Waitrose and even Tian Tian, a large Asian market! Next time, Tian Tian will be my first stop to stock up on cup noodles for when I get the munchies at night! I didn’t realize this was there until towards the end of my trip. Sad. Yes the Tesco Express by the tube station is convenient but definitely worth a few extra steps to Brunswick Centre for more choice.",5,2023,05,30
124,A must stay,"Everything about this hotel is perfect. The rooms are comfortable, the lobby is gorgeous, the restaurant is delicious, the coffee is strong, the cocktails are creative, and the service is immaculate. When you are welcomed by the smiling, eager doormen (thank you Alex for all of your kind hellos and warm service) you know you are in good hands. The front desk who is ready and willing to assist any way they can, going above and beyond to make sure you’re comfortable during your stay. I couldn’t recommend the Kimpton Fitzroy enough.  

(You have to try the Fitz’s sticky toffee pudding to end a day exploring London!)",5,2024,10,18
124,Outstanding Service at the Kimpton Fitzroy!,"This is my fourth time at the Kimpton Fitzroy, and I'm still blown away! The rooms are absolutely stunning for the price—it's a steal compared to other luxury hotels in the area. But it's not just the value that keeps me coming back; it's the incredible service. A huge shoutout to Haroon, Maria, Lottie, and Jack—they're the absolute best! They make me feel like family every time I stay here, going out of their way to ensure my stay is not just comfortable but truly memorable",5,2024,10,10
124,Kimpton Fitzroy strikes a chic balance between urbanity and genuine hospitality.,"I’ve stayed at the Fitzroy four times now since 2020 and the experience is always superb. The rooms are well decorated, striking a balance between chic and homey, as well as incredibly comfortable. The beds are some of the best I’ve had the pleasure of sleeping in away from home, and while you can open your windows and look out into Russell Square and the street below, you can also have a restful nights sleep, unable to hear any of the traffic below or your neighbors around you once they are closed. I’ve dined at all the hotel’s interior accommodations, even the tea room and Burr and Co. when it was more of a bistro, and each area is unique and worth visiting at least the once, if not multiple times, to enjoy Charles Fitzroy Doll’s gorgeous interiors with their Kimpton spin on decor. 

Beyond how absolutely beautiful both the interior and the exterior of the hotel are (seriously don’t miss out during your stay - make sure to explore every nook and cranny), the staff are always warm, attentive, and kind. 

From the waitstaff in both Fitz’s Brasserie and the Bar, the wonderful porters and front desk, to the housekeeping and maintenance staff, everyone is friendly and personable. Coming from a hospitality background myself (fine dining) I was delighted at how professional and genuine the staff are. It’s easy enough to find people to smile, but having a staff that is engaging and who also will go out of their way to help even when you don’t know you need it, is a big step beyond and something I look for in my own colleagues. I had many pleasant conversations while waiting for cabs, elevators and the like, and felt welcome in every one. 

Special shout out to Adrian, who I’ve had the pleasure of seeing on the past two trips (2023 and 2024) and who always offers help and a smile, and also to Jack, who was patient, attentive and kind, going above and beyond in helping to us to box some books to ship back to California.",5,2024,10,05
124,Our first visit to the UK - Haroon was very helpful -,"Our first visit to the UK and The Kimpton Fitzroy. - Haroon was very helpful before our arrival he called me and also answered my emails.  Our visit 10 nights September.  Quiet well appointed 12' ceiling but a Small Queen Premium room on the first floor.  Each night they had something going on in the hotel.  Stunning hotel in a area not as busy as Picadilly but close to the Tube and Black Cab easy to get.  The US dollar is not strong so choose wisely.  Our friends were very familiar with London and planned special tours and visits.   The Tube clean quiet not like the filty stink of a Manhattan sub way.   Harrods was a joke.  Crazy busy, Tons of Fancy people that want to be ""seen"".  Not one directory.  Finally all of Mr. Fayed's female victims are coming forward because he is no longer a threat.",5,2024,10,02
124,Wonderful as always,"This is our “ go to “Hotel when we go to London, our happy place! The staff make the stay so great, always helpful and welcoming. Mariia was our check in lady this time and she was so welcoming to our family. 

As always the rooms are spotless and the beds and pillows are the comfiest around. Even provided little birthday gifts for our grandsons which was such a lovely touch.

Thankyou everyone … until next time",5,2024,09,30
124,"Ideal London location and very helpful, friendly staff!","The location is ideal with plenty of buses and the tube located within a block. There are many parks and restaurants very close-by. 

This beautiful hotel was the nicest we've ever stayed in, but the atmosphere was relaxed and welcoming - not stuffy. I definitely recommend staying here if you can afford it!

Our room: We splurged to celebrate a milestone birthday and stayed in a queen premium room for 6 nights. The bed was very comfortable and our first floor room was quiet and spacious. The bathroom was very nice, but it would be improved by adding a towel rail closer to the tub and a bar to hold onto when we got in and out of the tall bathtub/shower. Our toilet ran a few times, so we asked for maintenance to check it and that helped. 

Amazing staff! The hotel's best feature is its helpful and friendly staff! From the moment we arrived we felt well looked after. Jack from guest relations welcomed us and was always happy to help with anything we needed. Ben, Sean, and Adrian at the concierge desk helped us get restaurant reservations. Rosemary went out of her way to show me where I could find complimentary coffee one morning when the cafe wasn't open yet. Wesley the doorman and porters Elliott and Jack were always ready to help with bags, directions, or getting us a cab whenever we needed help. And Ellie and Lottie at reception took such good care of us at check-in and check-out. We didn't get the names of any of the housekeepers, but they always did a great job too! Everyone seemed to really enjoy their jobs. We had so many nice chats with them and hope to see them again the next time we stay there.

Food and drink could be improved: We had the buffet breakfast one morning and it was pretty nice, but fairly expensive unless you have a big appetite. We had drinks one evening in the bar, but they initially said we couldn't get a seat without a reservation. Since we were staying at the hotel and it was fairly early, they squeezed us in for an hour. Our server's English wasn't great and she didn't understand what we were asking for - we had to send one drink back. Also, the drinks were about 20 pounds each for fairly simple cocktails.",5,2024,09,28
124,Amazing hotel with Excellent staff,"This is my third in this hotel and I want to come back again and again here. Starting from the doorman to the reception everyone is very nice and well trained. Everyone over there is absolutely helpful and always there to assist.. Checking in from Sohana was so amazing, joyful and very friendly with us. She made sure our stay was very comfortable and made such an absolute experience here. We recommend everyone to this hotel. It’s an absolute pleasure to stay this kind of nice luxury hotel.",5,2024,09,28
124,A Majestic Hotel,"This was my second stay at this property, stayed here for one night this time. The hotel is located in a gorgeous historic building across from Russell Square. Upon entering the hotel, you are transported into a world of grand, old-timey elegance. The lobby and bar area in particular have a fantastic ambience which oozes character and yet is not pretentious. You can tell that the property has been built and furnished with high quality materials. 

I was able to check in slightly early at 2:30pm. Reception was friendly and accommodating. During check-in, my IHG membership was acknowledged, which I was pleasantly surprised by, given my status as a peasant in the lowest membership tier. 

As a solo traveller, I opted for a single room. The room was small but well equipped, clean and comfortable. The room felt slightly old, but the bathroom seemed newly renovated. Room size was ok for me, but may feel cramped if you are not used to small spaces or have a large suitcase. Not much storage space either. The small wardrobe is also occupied by the safe and mini-fridge, leaving little room for actual clothes. The table in the room is also quite small, so not ideal as a work space. There were lots of amenities: a mini-fridge, safe, yoga mat, kettle, coffee machine, and complimentary water, milk and snacks. There was also a luxurious bathrobe, slippers, vanity kit and shower cap. You can ask for other toiletries and even borrow accessories from reception if required. 

There was a ‘social hour’ from 5pm-6pm, serving complimentary wine, beer and soft drinks. 

Location: The hotel is in a decent location, with Russell Square tube station located a convenient 2 min walk away, where you can take the Piccadilly line to Leicester Square/Covent garden or even to Heathrow airport. Also 2 mins away is a Tesco express grocery store. 

I was able to store my suitcase at the hotel for a few hours after checkout. It also seems like they have started to implement a discretionary service charge upon checkout which I have never encountered at any other hotel before and which also didn’t exist when I stayed here the first time. 

Overall, the single city room at this hotel is a decent choice, provided you don’t mind a small room size. The property is beautiful and has great vibes. I felt taken care of by staff members, which I was especially appreciative of since I was travelling on my own this time.",5,2024,09,26
124,A truly outstanding Hotel,"We have just stayed at this magnificent hotel, and it deserves the five stars that we have given it.
On arrival at the hotel, cases were immediately taken from the pavement to the reception bye very friendly members of staff where we were again met by a wonderfully friendly Informative and very helpful member of the reception team who checked us in.
Our room was a queen sized high floor room with a view on the sixth floor.
On entering the room the first thing which was apparent was how immaculate the whole room was. It was so well presented, and not speck of dust to be found anywhere.
The room was very well appointed, with everything that you would ever need, but on the literature it tells you that if you have forgotten anything, any toiletries or anything like that the hotel can supply them including heated tongues etc and other items that a woman might need to do the hair.
We were informed at reception that the hotel has a social hour in the bar each evening between 5 pm and 6 pm where you can grab yourself a glass of free wine or beer and perhaps other guest staying at this magnificent hotel.
The to the RMS Titanic Amazing but also quite humbling to think that some passengers who were travelling in the first class areas had stayed at the hotel before embarking on their journey aboard The sadly fated ship. the dining room is identical to the first class dining room board the Titanic, and to know people would’ve died there prior to their journey.
The food from the breakfast which has the most generous choices you can imagine of fresh fruit, cereals and of course, cook breakfasts (buffet) and also you can choose freshly cooked poached fried, boiled eggs as well as other dishes was so well cooked, and delicious! In the evening I had the green curry and my wife had the burger on the first night, and the Thai green curry was the best that I had eaten apart from living in Thailand for 10 years, that is how good it was. On the second night I had the slow cooked shepherds pie which had a mixture of lamb and beef in it and I had to top it and my wife had the fish and chips again. The food was delicious, we also had starters of, scallops with pulled pork, and an amazing seafood cocktail as well as desserts of a chocolate bomb with the most incredible cherry ice cream and the sticky toffee pudding, safe to say that morsel was left!
The whole of the staff at this wonderful hotel were attentive, professional, helpful and extremely friendly, and nothing was too much trouble.
I want to give a special mention to 2 members of staff the first of which was George worked in the bar for the social hour, but also was then a waiter who served us on one of the evenings, who was so professional, so polite, but also so friendly and made the dining experience a true pleasure, so thank you George.
The other member of staff I would like to mention was Melissa who served us for our breakfast in the mornings and waited on us and again was so friendly, professional and helpful and nothing was too much trouble, again making breakfast a real happy experience, so thank you Melissa.
If you are looking for a five star hotel, if you are looking for the most incredible history of the Hotel with the highest levels of cleanliness and friendliness and attentiveness then Kimpton Fitzroy is the one you want to book! Ideally located in WC1 overlooking Russell Square and very close to Russell Square tube station it is an ideal place to be able to visit and Site see London from.
This was our first day at this hotel, but we will now be using it each time we come to London because we were so impressed with everything about it thank you so much to all the team at this wonderful Hotel for making our day so memorable, we will see you all again very soon.",5,2024,09,24
124,"Amazing hotel, a perfect stay","My partner and I had the pleasure of staying at the Fitzroy earlier this month. Our experience staying here was everything you could wish for and more. From the very moment you enter you are looked after. The staff are exceptional and really look to make your stay personable and memorable. The champagne and chocolates in our room was an incredibly kind touch, and very much appreciated. This was a special celebration and our time in London was made perfect with the efforts made by the hotel. I will certainly be back and will recommend to anyone who is visiting London! With special thanks to Justyna, we had the most wonderful stay!",5,2024,09,19
124,An amazing experience,"Many thanks to the Kimpton Fitzroy London for a truly unforgettable experience!

I booked rooms for myself, husband to be and my bridesmaids for the weekend of my wedding and the hotel did not disappoint. Upon arrival I was greeted by Omar and Angela who made me feel very welcome! Guest relations were also so kind to arrange a bottle of champagne and chocolate covered strawberries in my suite to congratulate my husband to be and I on our upcoming wedding.

Later on in the evening, one of my bridesmaids and I decided to pop to the Fitz bar before dinner for some small bites and drinks. The cocktails and food were absolutely delicious! If you have a chance, please try the spicy margarita!!

The following evening which was after the wedding, my husband and I arrived to the most romantic set up! It was honestly so thoughtful and we will always remember it. Special thanks to Jack and Angela! We will definitely be back!!!",5,2024,09,17
124,Great experience and fabulous food,Great experience here. Friendly staff and a good location in London. Very close to Euston station. We went for dinner at the hotel and it was fabulous and tasty. Will be back here when in London again. The room was spacious and easy to navigate around.,5,2024,09,15
124,Excellent service,"Excellent service, good communication and accommodating. Will definitely return. 
First time using the London Kimpton Fitzroy. Good size room, and competitively priced for the location. Business this time, but would be happy to use for leisure visits too.",5,2024,09,15
124,Stunning!,"Kimpton Fitzroy is an absolutely stunning hotel with both an exquisite interior and exterior. With four nights still ahead in my stay, I am confident that my admiration for this place will endure. The staff is incredibly kind and attentive, and Jack S, in particular, goes above and beyond to ensure that you feel welcome at all times. You will love this place!",5,2024,09,14
124,100 stars with AMAZING concierge!!!!,"My daughter and I stayed at the Kimpton with my sister in law, niece and some friends. We were visiting London and going to see Taylor Swift at Wembley. Our Kimpton experience exceeded my expectations. In particular, the incredible men who worked at the concierge desk. Sean was so helpful to me, even prior to our arrival. He helped me choose which activities we would do each day and purchased tickets for several things ahead of time. My daughter was so excited to share homemade TS bracelets with all of the concierge members. She shared one with Sean the day we went to the concert. When we arrived back in our room, at 1:30am, there was a hand written note from Sean telling us how much the bracelet meant to him. He went out of his way to make us feel special and even sent an ice cream sundae up to our room! Jack and there other guys were also incredibly helpful. They were so friendly and fun and it was amazing to see their smiling faces each morning when we stepped out of the elevator and say goodnight after a long day of traveling. Thank you to all of you! You truly went above and beyond and made our visit so special. 

One note - my daughter and I wanted to visit Windsor Castle. Of course, Sean booked tickets for us, helped me figure out how we would get there (cab and train) and told me about where to get something to eat and do some shopping. When he printed out our tickets, there was extra large paper in the printer. He told me that he knew I was the perfect person to have this happen as I would laugh - and I did! Check out the picture below! I wish I could have kept the paper as a souvenir but they took it when we entered Windsor Castle!

The rooms at the Kimpton are gorgeous and luxurious. Everything was spotless and so comfortable. We never had even once single issue with anything! We ordered room service several times and it was hot and delicious. Even the gentleman who delivered our food was so sweet - my daughter gave him a bracelet and he was thrilled! We had breakfast in Fitz's every morning and I had the best lattes of my life! I would go back just for the lattes! The lobby of the hotel is also beautiful with many places to sit. We never had an issue getting a taxi when we walked out the door however we also used the open top bus, train, boat, and even rode on rickshaws!

I cannot express how incredible our stay was - I would return in a heartbeat and absolutely stay at the Kimpton again.",5,2024,09,11
124,An absolutely First Class Hotel,"I discovered the Kimpton Brand some years ago when I stayed at The Kimpton Fitzroy in London for the first time. I couldn’t fail to be impressed by the character of the building and the high quality of the accommodation. The staff were first class and came across as very committed to service excellence. Since that time I have sought out the brand throughout the world and The Kimpton Fitzroy in Bloomsbury is the hotel I recommend to my quite demanding clients who are visiting London.

The Fitzroy is a 10 minute walk from Euston or Kings Cross mainline stations and is just around the corner from the Russell Square underground station. Russell Square Park is directly opposite. The building itself is a grand dame that oozes character and quality. The interior is a superb combination of traditional and modern and there are intriguing and charismatic nooks and corners that are styled and furnished with the finest quality materials. It always feels possible to find  private space at all times. I was immediately acknowledged as an IHG 1 elite member and  I received the customary facilities of that status.  The room was ready for the published check in time and I was warmly greeted by Esther, who ensured that great consideration was given to every detail of my requirements. I had arranged a three night stay, paying for the first one and using points for the remaining two.  The separate reservations were joined up seamlessly. The entire check in process  was very professional and my interaction with Esther felt very natural and spontaneous. She explained the timings of breakfast  and gave herself as a point of contact. Esther then escorted me to the secure lift area.

 The public areas of the hotel were extremely attractive and comfortable and the whole ambiance very atmospheric, especially the small sitting rooms close to the grand staircase. Every area of the hotel was spotlessly clean.

Security at the hotel is remarkably high and the lifts are operated from a central panel at ground level.  Guests are then directed to a specific lift and it automatically takes you to the correct floor.

I was staying in a one bedroom, park view suite and this was a delight.  There was ample space which consisted of a small sitting room that included a settee and a writing desk, joined by a  doorway to the bedroom.  Double doors from there opened into a spacious marble bathroom that had a free standing bath tub and a separate rain shower. There were a large number of quality towels and two bathrobes and the toiletries were plentiful and of the very highest quality.  The bed was incredible comfortable with high quality linens. The lighting had four settings and an appropriate mood could be set.  The air conditioning system was more of a climate control and was soundless.  As the windows had very wide double glazing there was absolutely no noise from outside the hotel. The furnishings were well coordinated and created a very relaxing atmosphere. There was a fully stocked mini bar that was replenished daily. 

The housekeeping team were helpful and polite and the “Do Not Disturb” sign was always respected. There were at least two visits to the room each day beyond the main servicing visit and this ensured that everything was perfect at all times.

There is a Burr and Co coffee shop serving drinks and refreshments, Fitz’s Brasserie that has an extensive food menu and, finally, Fitz’s Bar and Parlour.  All were very atmospheric in their own way.  Prices were very reasonable for such a high quality establishment. The ambience in the bar and parlour was extremely comfortable and just being there made me feel incredibly special.

Each evening, the hotel operates “Social Hour” between 17:00 and 18:00, where wine, beer, soft drinks and nibbles are served on a complimentary basis.

Breakfast was taken in the main restaurant and this was a choice between continental buffet and full table service a la carte for specially prepared items.  The food was of the very highest quality. I was greeted on arrival and escorted to a suitable table and my satisfaction was checked. The serving staff were helpful and friendly. Breakfast operates until 11:00, which is an excellently broad time window.

My IHG 1 status entitled me to a late check out and I was able to retain my room until 13:00, which fitted in perfectly with my onward travel arrangement.  I was checked out by Esther, who checked my satisfaction  and left me with an incredibly positive final impression. The Kimpton Fitzroy is an upper 5* hotel offering a 5* service, catering for the more discerning guest.  My visit was immensely enjoyable.",5,2024,09,11
124,Outstanding Service from Marco and Joseph at the Concierge Desk,"I had an exceptional experience with the concierge team at the hotel, particularly Marco and Joseph. They were incredibly attentive, professional, and went above and beyond to ensure all my needs were met. Whether it was helping with transportation arrangements or offering great local recommendations, they always provided assistance with a friendly and welcoming attitude. Their commitment to excellent service truly made my stay memorable. Thank you, Marco and Joseph, for your outstanding hospitality",5,2024,09,08
124,Luxury hotel in the heart of London,"Total luxury splurge, without the ultra luxury price! I booked this hotel through the AMEX portal (which admittedly does come with benefits), but I was so glad that I had chosen this hotel for my stay. Centrally located and easily accessible to all parts of the city, the hotel is a bit of calm in a bustling city. The staff is incredible - kind and thoughtful and patient and accommodating, especially considering that the airline had lost my luggage and I needed the added kindness. Everyone was so generous with their time! The (upgraded) room was spacious and comfortable, and the extra amenities covered me while my suitcase was being found. I appreciated the fluffy robe and comfy slippers too. This is definitely a hotel I will return to! (Special shout-out to Haroon from the front desk, and ALL of the concierges (Marco, Shaun (spelling?), and the one whose name I never got ...)",5,2024,09,08
124,Don’t stay at this hotel if you want twin beds,Booked for one night and requested twin beds. Booking confirmed but later advised a twin bedded room was only available by upgrading at an additional cost of £190.  I cave stayed in hotels all over the world and have never before been asked to pay a premium over a double room rate for twin beds. Needless to say I have cancelled.,1,2024,09,06
124,Just Book the Kimpton Fitzroy,Kimpton Fitzroy is a great hotel with excellent customer service!

124,Fitzroy Excellence,"Excellent service, clean and spacious rooms, great dining options, and a beautiful hotel.

We have already recommended this hotel to several friends who are considering, or have booked, London trips.

124,A perfect stay experience and special thanks to Mr.Elliott,"I had a perfect experience in Kimpton Hotel. Firstly, when I arrived, I noticed there were many rainbow flags supporting the LGBT family and the pride activity. And when I got in there Mr.Elliott gave me a warm welcome and nice accommodation which saved my day and gave my London travel a pretty good start. And I enjoyed a pretty good night and very nice room there. By the way, this hotel has perfect location in London SOHO, so closed to the bars and visiting spots. And when I checked out the next day, Mr.Elliott also gave me greeting and help me take photos. Thanks a lot. I will visit this hotel agian.",5,2024,09,02
124,Amazing service,"The concierge Sean was amazing!  He was kind, funny and was able to help us with some last minute reservations.  The sip, sip, hooray was a great way to relax after a long trip.  The entire staff was helpful and considerate.  The room was beautiful.  So easy - thank you and Bravo!",5,2024,09,01
124,Fabulous Hotel and Staff,"Firstly, what a beautiful property! Their service is second to none. Amazing FD staff, who not only honored our request for early check in but made sure all of needs were met. Carlos at the Front Desk was exceptional and Sergio, who helped with door service and everything else in between.  I would highly recommend this hotel and would definitely recommend this hotel. Thanks everyone for great stay.",5,2024,08,30
124,"Faultless, classy, modern classic","This place is truly classy. A very stylish blend of modern and classic. It very much feels like a five star experience but at the same time the staff are relaxed and unstuffy. We had two connecting rooms for our family visit and both were beautiful and brilliantly equipped. Our suite had a spacious separate lounge and dining area, along with what could only be described as a bedroom wing. It's the most luxurious room we have stayed in, and as is the theme throughout the hotel it managed to capture exactly the right blend of sumptuous, relaxed, classy and modern. All staff we interacted with were excellent. We didn't have dinner so can't comment on the main restaurant. Breakfast was very good, although the Langham still serves the best hotel breakfast in London in my opinion, so maybe that's something to work on - let's face it, there is very little else : )",5,2024,08,29
124,London August 2024,"""We spent a few wonderful nights at the Kimpton Fitzroy London! The location was excellent, with easy access to the underground at Russell Square and walking distance to the British Museum, Fitzrovia, Oxford Street, and Central London. The hotel was very clean, and the staff went above and beyond to accommodate every request and question. If you stay here, be sure to indulge in the hotel's fresh and tasty breakfast. And don't miss the hotel bar at night - it's a great spot to unwind! Thank you again, Kimpton, for a fantastic stay!""",5,2024,08,29
124,Highly recommend the Kimpton Fitzroy for a family stay in London!,"Wonderful hotel - total 5* experience, great food, beautiful and clean rooms. Centrally located in Russell Square (taxi, tube and buses) but also better value than the traditional high end areas of Mayfair, Knightsbridge. Would strongly recommend.",5,2024,08,27
124,Kindness is Free,"This is my second stay at the Kimpton Fitzroy. The hotel is lovely as usual, which is why I chose to stay here for 8 nights. However, on this second stay, I don't find the service and friendliness to be as great this second time around. I dont' feel the same welcoming feeling I felt on my first trip here. The staff is not accomodating, the rooms are small and I don't like that they kicked us out of Burr because the cafe is closing. Guest should feel welcomed to work in the area. I have a few days left of my trip and I hope I can give an updated better experience.",3,2024,08,27
124,Perfect stay for families,"This is a classic & historical grand hotel around Russell Square which is in the center of London.

Great location also which is close to Euston station & King Cross. 100 meters to the Underground entrance, which is convenient for tourists.

Impressive by the hotel lobby- grand ceiling lamp & unique staircase.

British style decoration for the suite & comfortable bedding with park view.

Excellent service provided by guest relations team- Roksana & front office team- Rosemary, both of them are passionate to arrange family’s living preference, also set up an unforgettable dinner for my wife’s birthday celebration, with details & patience.",5,2024,08,27
124,Fantastic london central hotel,"A beautiful hotel, room was well appointed and loved the style and deco, bed was comfortable,  hotel is very clean, the bar is quirky and do fav cocktails,  the restaurant was OK, a little understaffed on the Sunday night so we was waiting a while to be seen, but food was good, nice little offer of a drink on the house between 6 and 7pm, wine available,  staff were friendly and obliging! Would def stay again! ",5,2024,08,27
124,Wonderful stay for our daughter’s 21st birthday.,"We had a wonderful stay at the Kimpton Fitzroy London on our daughter’s 21st birthday. We gave her the choice of anywhere in London (up to a certain budget) and she chose this beautiful hotel with so much history! The hotel rooms were lovely and my daughter’s bedroom had been decorated for her birthday and a beautiful cake was sent to her room. They even organised a delicious cake for us all to share in the restaurant. Thank you Jack for making my daughter’s birthday stay really special. 
I would highly recommend staying at this hotel.",5,2024,08,25
124,A fabulous hotel!,"A stunning hotel. The service was second to
none. All staff were amazing - from the gentleman at the entrance, to the breakfast staff and the cocktail makers. Our room (king premium) was so comfortable and spacious. Would highly recommend.",5,2024,08,25
124,Just awesome,"We stayed here on 23rd August for one night before a flight out to Bali with our daughter. 23rd was our 1st anniversary so thought our pre flight night should be somewhere lovely. This ticked that box and then some.

We'd booked a gorgeous corner suite with a rollaway bed for our daughter. The room was perfect. Separate living room, dining area, bedroom with the 4 poster bed and a massive bath nestled into the corner by the window.

We had a wonderful welcome note with a bottle of wine and a selection of cheeses. Perfectly matching my Inner Circle preferences.

We ate in Fitz Brasserie and enjoyed an absolutely outstanding meal. I frequently see travel articles and blogs saying to avoid hotel restaurants but that would be a big mistake here. The food was delicious and the service was impeccable. If you're staying here, eat here. It's totally worth it for quality of food and proper service. 

From check in to check out we couldn't fault anything. It's been a couple of years since staying here; I normally hit either of the InterContinental hotels in London, but I need to rethink that.

Thank you to all the team that we interacted with during our stay. We will be back. ",5,2024,08,24
124,A Titanic Hotel- and that's just the tip of the iceberg!,"A Hidden Gem in the Heart of London. But there it is in Plain Sight on the Horizon.  A Beacon of Fineness since 1900.

Looming over Russell Square like a Great Ocean Liner. Far Enough from The Tourist Ports of Calls. But Close Enough to Tender Down to it All.

Look Out from your own Bolthole Balcony. To the Quiet Oasis and even Parakeets Trail your Dreams.

By Geogore it is a Five Star Hotel! Dragoons keep watch over the Grand Ceilings and Endless Hallways. You will say wow just on entry. Then soak it all in at the bar or dine away to oceans of a different age. Get Dolled Up Like It's 1912.",5,2024,08,21
124,Superior Guest Relations,"Not only did they accommodate my request for an early check in after a long flight there from the US, but they also went above and beyond to make it a special trip and birthday for my niece.  From the first minute we arrived the door man grabbed our bags and carried them in and the front desk welcomed us warmly.  But I have to say, Guest Relations, specifically Roksana Ivanova, did more than I could have hoped or expected to make my niece's birthday one she'll never forget.  Other team members that helped all this come together were Brittany and Jack.  

I was also impressed by the concierge team, Sean, Marco and Joseph who not only made excellent birthday dinner recommendations, but also made reservations for us and got us the best table in the house.

The staff really made this a memorable trip, but we also enjoyed the room, the amenities in the room and room service.  Hope to get to go back to London someday and would definitely stay at the Kimpton Fitzroy again!",5,2024,08,19
124,Lunch at the brassiere,"Dined here last week for lunch in the brasserie, lovely food and a very amiable service, all thanks to our waiter Fedro.

124,Happy to return for a great experience in London,"Happy to return to the Kimpton Fitz in London.  This IHG property is terrific. The location, the service, the attention to detail continue to impress. While some of the rooms are smaller than US standards, they are all well appointed.  The public areas are beautiful.  The staff, however, was most helpful.  They managed some challenges with ease and empathy.   Everyone in our group was impressed.   It continues to be our favorite in London!",5,2024,08,17
124,Exceptional Service and Comfort at Our Home Away from Home!,"The Kimpton Fitzroy Hotel in London continues to impress us every time we stay!

The staff were incredibly accommodating, especially with our two young children, making our stay comfortable and stress-free. From the thoughtful touches in our room to the warm and attentive service throughout our visit, every detail was perfect. This hotel feels like a home away from home, and we can’t recommend it enough for anyone visiting London!",5,2024,08,13
124,Our go-to hotel when in London,"Another fantastic two-night stay at the Kimpton Fitzroy, London. From the moment we arrived to our reluctant check-out, the staff went out of their way to make our stay memorable. The staff, who are a credit to the Fitzroy, are super-friendly, professional and genuinely passionate about working for the hotel. This is testament to the culture that has been created from the senior leadership and management teams. The hotel is perfectly located next to Russell Square underground, close to St Pancras and the West End.  The hotel itself is stunning, the high-end rooms are light and airy, and spotlessly clean.  We rarely stay at the same hotel more than once but we've stayed here several times and each visit has been a fantastic experience. We're already excited about when we can next visit.",5,2024,08,12
124,Simply spectacular,Simply spectacular. From arrival to departure the whole experience at this hotel was faultless. Stunning room with impeccable service from start to finish. I can’t recommend this hotel enough. Extra special thanks to Carlos for all of the help.,5,2024,08,12

Nice comfortable room.

124,Incredible Experience 10/10,Wow. This place is incredible! The exterior at night is magical and the place feels unreal! Our room is beautiful with one of the most comfortable beds I’ve stayed on in a while. The shower pressure is insane with a rain style shower head. Best part of the hotel is the staff in my opinion. They allowed us to check in early and even held our bags in a secure room until our room was ready! Sean and Joseph from the concierge really made our trip memorable. They gave us a ton of tips and even booked an excursion for us. Definitely recommend using them to help plan your trip!,5,2024,08,11
124,A great place to stay in London,A beautiful hotel that just delivers a wow factor as soon as you step through the door.

Beautiful place inside and out, loved the decor, a great location too in London, central to many of the places most want to visit. I am sure we will return again for another visit.",5,2024,08,10
124,Fabulous & Classy hotel,"I’ve stayed at the Kimpton previously on business. It’s in a great location in Russell Square and close to a tube station. My room was super small to me on that visit. This recent visit I was upgraded to a suite. I loved it all. Words cannot describe that gorgeous room. The staff here is always in top form. My room rate included breakfast which was exceptional. Great options to select. You do have to get there early though but it’s not a long wait. I’ll always stay or recommend this hotel. I was glad American Express had such a great deal for the room, upgrade and food & beverage credit. It was a fabulous experience to close out my solo European trip without my family.",5,2024,08,08
124,Amazing once again.,"Bit of a late review as we visited in June but had to come on here and say what an amazing experience we had. 

I’m currently on my 3rd visit to the Kimpton and each time our stay has been incredible from start to finish. 

Having visited this time for my mums birthday the Kimpton couldn’t have made it any more special for her- special thanks to Angela and Roksana in guest relations who provided a magnificent display in the room for our arrival. 

The room was incredible and spotlessly clean and the hotel building itself is absolutely beautiful. 

Thanks again Kimpton and can’t wait to stay again.",5,2024,08,08
124,Two nights of comfort and luxury!,"Two nights of comfort and luxury! The Kimpton Fitzroy on Russell Square was everything I'd hoped. It was beautiful and luxurious without being pretentious. The staff were uniformly friendly and helpful. The common areas were well appointed offering numerous quiet spaces to sit. The room had so many amenities. I didn't know I needed a yoga mat in my room.... until I found it there. And it was a bit of a silver lining to the pandemic ordeal, we traveled so little while continuing to use the hotel credit card, I got to stay on points!",5,2024,08,08
124,Best Concierge Team in Londo,"This is the first review I’ve ever left for a hotel or property, and I’ve travelled around the world extensively. I just had to leave a review based upon the concierge team at the Kimpton Fitzroy. From the first day there and throughout the stay all of the concierge team were SUPER helpful. Extremely positive, knowledgeable and effective.From restaurant recommendations and reservations to private tour guides (who were awesome).

We had an issue with a gift that was supposed to be delivered to the hotel the weekend before we were to leave and the store made an error and it didn’t arrive until after we departed. The concierge team went well above what I would have ever expected in trying to return the gift, and when the store wouldn’t accept it they went the extra mile and provided several quotes on freight to New York, ultimately posting it for us and all with a great attitude.

Seriously, very impressed. The hotel is amazing on several levels, but these guys are exceptional. Big shout out to Marco, Sean, Joseph and Ruairi — THANKS Fellas!

Luxury and customer service  are paramount.  Every staff member makes you feel like a VIP.

124,A faultless five star,"Easily the best hotel in Central London. I've stayed several times but this time was a treat for my mum. From the moment we arrived to departure, Rosemary, Jack and all the staff could not have made us feel more welcome with their generosity and personal touch. Our room was spacious, clean, quiet, and packed with as many amenities as you'd need. Room service and was excellent and efficiently timed. The building is exquisite and the breakfast room is stunning. Breakfast itself was full of variety and quality ingredients, providing a perfect start to a day exploring the city. All in all, a perfect stay and I can't wait to be back!",5,2024,08,04
124,first time stay,"what a beautiful hotel in a perfectly placed position. The hotel is in between 2 tube stations, has plenty of restaurants and cafes nearby and is in walking distance to all major attractions. The staff make the property though.. from check in with Jack and concierge with Joseph and Sean this place is faultless! Our room was a spacious double superior with breakfast include which is luxe for London. I highly recommend you give this one a go.. you’ll be very happy you did so! 💫💫🏃🏽‍♀️‍➡️",5,2024,07,30
124,Gold Medal for the Fitzroy!,"The Fitzroy wows me every time. From the outside, the building is majestic. Step inside and its grandeur  will take your breath away. The Fitzroy has never disappointed me. Every room I have been in has been comfortable, cozy, and perfectly appointed, even the Single City. Special thanks to the French lady at Fritz ( breakfast service/ she takes the orders) for being so attentive, and taking the time every single morning ( the lemon-ginger tea she recommended is perfect). Special thanks to Jack ( concierge/porter) for paying attention and being so courteous. ",5,2024,07,30

124,Great hotel and staff,"Stayed for an entire week, Building is magnificent inside and out. Entire staff was truly amazing.  Room was clean and comfortable. Special thanks to Abdu the doorman who was so friendly and helpful in navigating London and getting us to the sights we wanted visit. Great restaurant and cafe on the premises. Russell Park is located across the street, great place to sit on a bench and people watch. Centrally located and literally steps from the Elizabeth line from Heathrow. The Fitz will be our go to whenever in London.  A truly memorable experience. Thank you to all.",5,2024,07,24
124,Great Place to Stay,The Fitzroy is a great place to stay; easy access to all the sides of London via the Russell Square tube station around the corner. The staff is friendly and helpful. Excellent food in the restaurant which we use daily for breakfast and a couple of times for dinner. Our suite was excellent. The bathroom was enormous. The bedding was great. Had an excellent time.,5,2024,07,23
124,Our experience was 10/10,First impressions are everything and when we arrived we were greeted right at the steps. The building itself is massive and the architecture is out of this world. Check in was smooth and easy. Jack helped me sort all my luggage and escorted them to my room. He is very kind and professional and eager to help with anything I needed. The room is beautiful and spacious with high ceilings. The bathroom was my favorite.,5,2024,07,22
124,Superb Service,"Have spent the last three weekends in London at different hotels and by far the best for quality, price and service. The attention to detail from before we arrived and at the hotel was amazing. The room was of the highest quality and had great experiences in the bar and at breakfast. Would thoroughly recommend.",5,2024,07,22
124,Top Notch Birthday Hotel,"Visited with family for a special birthday. We were upgraded to a suite, 458. It was the perfect hotel room. Adorable little living room, lovely bedroom with king bed. Powder room off the living area and generous sized bathroom off the bedroom with a pristine tub and amazing shower. Also a large closet behind the bed spanning the length of the bedroom with his / hers areas and a vanity. The lobby bar is dark and moody with an interesting cocktail menu. Breakfast was good and included. Great location near many sights. Highly recommend.",5,2024,07,20
124,Disappointing Experience for IHG Diamond Elite Member,"First time we have stayed here and when we first arrived even though it was raining we were happy until we got to our room. We were given a small room overlooking the air-conditioning units 5th floor. As we were going to a show to celebrate my birthday it was OK. We had a rest then as we were getting ready rain came in between the double glazing and then inside dripping on the windowsill and onto the floor. We called reception and we were moved to a smaller room 4th floor with a worse view and a very cramped toilet, but as we were ready to go out we just left our bags and went. The following morning when we got up we spotted one of the robes was filthy. It was tied up so either was put there by the cleaners or not spotted when they were cleaning and missed by the people who are supposed to check rooms. For the price of the room that is unacceptable. We had breakfast which was lovely however one of the tureen lids fell on my hand even though I opened it fully. This left a couple of small cuts which my wife spotted on the way back to the room. We did speak to Ellie the Manager on check out, she apologised for our experience and also offered a plaster which I declined. She did ask if we are going to stay again and we said we have a lot of trips booked so not sure at the moment so I am guessing possibly get an upgrade if we said we would but she never offered anything. So we left disappointed. We will not return to this hotel as there are other luxurious hotels for a cheaper price which we have stayed at previously and had great stays. The positives for this stay (otherwise I would have chosen terrible). Location is great. The staff are amazing and can't fault them. The bed is comfortable. The building is beautiful and they recognised my birthday too.",2,2024,07,18
124,Unbelievable experience,"From the moment we arrived at the Kimpton Fitzroy London, our experience was nothing short of exceptional. The hotel’s elegance and charm are immediately apparent, and the beautifully appointed rooms are both luxurious and comfortable.

Our stay began with a warm welcome from Alex at the door, who promptly assisted us with our bags. At reception, Mariia greeted us with a lovely welcome that set the tone for our entire stay. The guest relations team, particularly Jack and Angela, went above and beyond by leaving beers and cake in our room—a delightful surprise that made our arrival even more special.

The concierge team deserves a special mention for their outstanding service. Under the leadership of Ruairi, head concierge, the team was impeccable. Sean, Joseph, and Marco provided us with excellent dinner recommendations and helped organize our tours, making our stay seamless and enjoyable.

Breakfast each morning was a treat, thanks to Chalita, who attended to our requests with a smile and ensured we had a great table. Roksana at social hour was also incredibly welcoming, and the complimentary drink was a beautiful touch that added to the hotel’s hospitable atmosphere.

Every staff member we encountered went above and beyond to make our stay memorable. The room itself was a haven of comfort, with an excellent shower—perfect after a day of exploring London in its varied weather.

We will undoubtedly return to the Kimpton Fitzroy London. The combination of elegant accommodations, outstanding service, and a dedicated team made our stay unforgettable. Thank you to everyone who made our visit so special!",5,2024,07,16
124,"Just right - beautiful, quiet, kind, and all the amenities we wanted.","Truly a beautiful hotel!

This was perfect for our short trip to London, and we definitely would stay here again.",5,2024,07,16
124,Warm staff and lovely accommodations.,"This hotel is gorgeous and comfy. I was in a single room which was cozy but the windows were so bright and the bathroom was huge I felt right at home.

The staff here are incredible. Housekeeping is prompt and friendly and would give me extra crisps. The staff at the front door is particularly warm. I had many good chats with them.  Abdu warned me of the weather changes and fixed my sunglasses when they broke. Jack was wonderful and efficient with my luggage. 

I particularly loved the sunny atrium
Next to the palm court restaurant and spent loads of time there whenever there wasn’t a private event. Hope to be back soon!",5,2024,07,16
124,A Terrific London Hotel and Experience,"Incredible service, wonderful facilities and terrific staff, especially Abdu. 

Abdu, Joseph and Ruari went out of their way to make my family of 5 feel incredibly comfortable and took care of all of our needs. They were able to secure reservations and tours at the last minute.

We heartily recommend the Kimpton as the go to place to stay in London.",5,2024,07,16
124,See Abdu at Kimpton Fitzroy for London recommendations,"Very nice experience - clean, friendly staff, and good location.  Rooms a little on the small side but amenities were good.  Abdu, the doorman was super helpful.  He provided us with options for the most time and cost efficient trip back to Heathrow.",4,2024,07,15
124,Amazing Hotel with Fantastic Service!,"Amazing stay - fabulous hotel in great location but most of all, what sets it apart is the people and the service! Special mention to Abdu who is one of the friendliest and knowledgeable doorman we have ever had the pleasure to meet! Social Hour is great also!",5,2024,07,15
124,As good as the first visit!,"Second visit and just as great as the first! 
Lovely comfy beds, good size bathrooms. 
The architecture is amazing, lovely staircase and lots of cosy places to chill. 
Check in quick and easy, even though we were early we still got to our room. 
All the staff are friendly and welcoming, none more so than the door staff, always a big smile, chatty and helpful. Sorry I didn’t get any names but we will return next month so we’ll get them then.
Breakfast was lovely, top quality ingredients, lots of choice. One niggle was it took a while to get our tea and coffee, but when it arrived it was hot and just what was needed to start the day off.",5,2024,07,15
124,Wonderful stay,"We stayed here for one evening, everything was flawless.  The hotel itself is beautiful, the staff friendly and efficient. A special mention has to be said for Abdu, he was so welcoming with a big smile and wonderful sense of humour. We’re looking forward to visiting again soon.",5,2024,07,15
124,Generally very good,"Very good decor, smart rooms and nice staff. Pretty quiet too. Loses a star for not having the outdoor area open (this is not a recent issue) and for the restaurant and coffee shops being pretty soulless. One lift is incredibly noisy and needs fixing. I bet it interrupts sleep in low numbered rooms",4,2024,07,14
124,Just what I didn’t know I needed!,"Just a brilliant experience. I spent one night here when I was in London for quite an emotionally taxing experience. 
Right from pre-check in I felt nothing less than *looked after*. I dropped my bags off at 11am, hours in advance of my 3pm check-in time. The reception staff were friendly, observant, and kind. I’m sure they take the thousands of acts of hospitality they offer every day in their stride. However, for me, being offered a bottle of water and someplace private and luxurious to change clothes and prepare for the afternoon was a godsend. Feeling cared-for changed the shape of a difficult day, and I’m intensely grateful for it. 
The room was, of course, absolutely sumptuous, and incredibly well equipped. The location of the hotel is really perfect for exploring London as a tourist. 
I will absolutely stay at The Fitzroy again, and I’d encourage you to do yourself the favour of being looked after by their fabulous team.",5,2024,07,14
124,Fabulous hotel - highly recommended!,"Spent 2 nights here and was an amazing experience.
The warm welcome from the doormen who  were there to open our taxi door and take our luggage in, to the receptionist who checked us in and all the staff throughout the hotel during our stay.
The hotel is simply beautiful, the architecture and decor is outstanding and on another level, the surroundings are sumptuous.
The breakfast was fantastic and the restaurant setting is fabulous.
The  happy hour is a great touch, 5-6pm.
The location is perfect for exploring London, highly recommended and a truly wonderful experience.",5,2024,07,09
124,It’s all about the decor,"A fun 2 night stay, in a hotel which wouldn’t normally be my style. 
It was made extra special by the surprise installation of the Christmas tree overnight - which certainly added to the ambiance.
The cafe area was not relaxing for food, so only the one visit. 
Room was very small….but it is London.",4,2024,07,08
124,Brilliant London,"Our family recently returned to the United States from our London vacation and I can't say enough great things about the Kimpton Fitzroy.  The rooms were wonderful, the staff was outstanding.  The excellent location makes getting around London a breeze.  The head concierge Ruairi, along with his staff Marco, Joseph and the rest of the team made our London vacation all we thought it could be.  They went above and beyond to get us reservations at excellent restaurants and attractions through out the city.  Their recommendations were top notch.  These guys know how to do it right.  If you are traveling to London give this hotel a shot you will not be disappointed.  5 Stars!!!!",5,2024,07,08

Elliot was very helpful with recommending restaurants and helping with our bags….,5,2024,07,05
124,Nice team,"The front of house reception team all very approachable and easy to deal with especially Lottie and Abdul the front door guy 😁our room was great all all of my preferences where noted and met, made the stay seem-less. 

Slight blimp at Fitz later that day with the host but this was defused and handled extremely well by the restaurant and bar manager - thank you both.",5,2024,07,05
124,Great Stay at The Kimpton Fitzroy,"The bell man, named Jack was very friendly, efficient, helpful and such a great guy.  He enhanced our stay.

Highly recommend!",5,2024,07,01
124,Hotel Perfectionism,"My first trip to London has been absolutely incredible. The best decision I made when planning my trip was to select the Kimpton Fitzroy London for lodging. From check-in to check-out I received the best accommodations, amenities, and service (always with a smile).  The fish and chips in the “Fitz Restaurant” were a mouth-watering delight. I especially appreciated the help I received from “Mr. Jack”.  Jack went above and beyond to see to my comfort and every need; even acted as my personal photographer. Thank you Jack. I highly recommend anyone to seek out the Kimpton Fitzroy when searching for hotel accommodations. This truly was a 5-star hotel experience.",5,2024,07,01
124,Great hotel with friendly staff,"This was our first visit to the London Kimpton, after numerous visits to the one in Denver. The staff are what make the brand and the team at Kimpton were great - knowledgeable, friendly and efficient. Only one team member let them down and the Bar Manager engaged with us and resolved the issues in an efficient manner. We had a Queen room and it was big enough for a short stay with a beautiful bathroom with large walk in shower. The happy hour drinks were a nice touch. We also enjoyed the fact that breakfast was served until 11am.",5,2024,06,29
124,Very good return visit,"Another great stay at this hotel, rooms are great, staff great, good selection of shower products and extras available on request.

Not cheap, but good value if you can pick it up on an offer, so keep an eye out and take advantage where you can.

Will be back.",5,2024,06,28
124,Guest services were extraordinary,"My wife and I stayed at the Kimpton Fitzroy on the first leg of our European honeymoon. The guest experiences staff were phenomenal. We had reservations for dinner and when we had trouble hailing a cab the concierge called ahead to our restaurant to hold our reservation. The door man recommended a ride service that ultimately got us to our destination and made our travel around London seamless. We also celebrated my wife’s birthday on our last night in London and Jack from the guest experiences team made sure we returned to an amazing experience. Flowers, Prosecco, and a dessert were waiting in our room and capped off an amazing birthday for my wife and excellent last night in London.",5,2024,06,28
124,Wedding at the Kimpton,"My wife and I got married at the Kimpton in June 2024 - the Ballroom and Palm Court are perfect wedding spaces for a Central London wedding. The food was amazing with the chef curating a bespoke menu for a cuisine of our choice (Caribbean). The venue certainly wowed our guests and the honeymoon suite oozed class and character. Special shout out to Lucy, Kimpton’s wedding coordinator, who was a massive help throughout, especially given we did not have a wedding planner. All in all, a great hotel and a great wedding venue.",5,2024,06,27
124,Amazing stay at the beautiful Kimpton Fitzroy,"Our family of 4 stayed for 6 nights in June 2024 and had an amazing stay.  We had two rooms - and we were very comfortable with 2 people to  a room.  

The hotel itself is so beautiful with a very ornate lobby, bar and restaurant.  We had several meals at the hotel - breakfast daily and two dinners, and the food was very good.   Our room was well appointed and most importantly - very clean.  All of the staff we came into contact with went out of their way to make sure guests were having a comfortable, yet memorable experience - front desk, bellmen, housekeeping and restaurant staff are all first rate.  

The Kimpton Fitzroy is in a wonderful location right in the heart of London’s Bloomsbury neighborhood. The Russell Square tube station is right around the corner and located  on the Piccadilly line meaning you are a short train ride away from all of London’s main attractions.  

The Kimpton Fitzroy feels like a posh, 5 star hotel without the high price tag of others in that category.  We will be back!!",5,2024,06,26
124,Best Experience Ever!,Best experience ever!  This is the second time we have stayed at this hotel.  It is safe and the staff is so friendly!  The service was incredible.  The gentleman that helped us at check-in was amazing and Sergio and Abdu were both amazing at making sure we got to where we were going and our luggage got there too.  We will never stay anywhere else!  Highly recommend.,5,2024,06,26
124,Only place we will ever to stay in London!!,"What an amazing experience!  At every turn the service was beyond expectations. From the moment we arrived all of our needs were met. Look for Sergio & Abdu to take care of helping whenever needed.   Our check in, usually painful after long travels, was easy and pleasant. I wish I could remember the gentleman’s name who checked us in, because he always remembered ours!!  We will never stay anywhere else when visiting London.",5,2024,06,26
124,Wonderful Experience,Wonderful hotel experience.  Everyone was so friendly and helpful.  Abdu was incredible at making sure we got a cab or Uber to where we were going.  He knew our names and remembered where we had been been and where we were going; he took care of anything we needed.  Would highly recommend!,5,2024,06,26
124,Wonderful staff,The most wonderful staff especially Abdu always at the ready to help us all- he made sure we got where we needed to go all our excursions small or large.  A shout out to the duty manager Sophie for our stay as well who fixed minor problems with grace and speed.,5,2024,06,26
124,Lovely hotel,We loved this hotel. The building and rooms are all beautiful. The rooms are spacious and clean. The staff was all extremely friendly and helpful. Abdu went above and beyond to welcome us to the hotel each day - along with offering advice of things to do and helping catch cabs.,5,2024,06,25
124,"Warm & Friendly, Enticing and Relaxing - Highly Recommended","What a wonderful place. Beautifully decorated with an elegant mix of drama & class in the public areas with calm & classic in the bedrooms.
Staff were so warm and friendly - wonderful welcome and room ready well ahead of time. When they found out it was our wedding anniversary the little surprises just kept coming. Thank you so much as this made a lovey stay a perfect one.
Cocktail bar was enticing and the menu was alluring. Non-alcoholic options were also delicious so don't be intimidated if you don't drink.
Location is perfect for exploring London and/or just pop out the front door and sit bathed in dapped sunlight with a coffee in the Russel Square park and watch the world walk by - the perfect light breakfast.
Warmth of staff was the high light; from my experience this is part of the Kimpton brand - I can also recommend the Clock Tower in Manchester for the same vibe.",5,2024,06,25
124,Another Great Stay,"The hotel is gorgeous! Fitz’s cocktail bar was beautiful and serves outstanding cocktails. To top it all off, Abdu’s (the doorman) whistle is incredible and can literally hail a cab in seconds. This was our second time staying at the Kimpton Fitzroy and would highly recommend it to anyone.",5,2024,06,25
124,A Great Hotel,"Overall the hotel was good. The bed was comfortable, amenities nice, and the bar was amazing. However, the breakfast was alright and a large block mirror was too close to the hotel room door. 
The doorman Abdu was excellent. He turned on the handicap lift to help us with our luggage, had an amazing whistle, and was great with conversation.",4,2024,06,25
124,Awesome whistle from the doormen,"It was a very fancy and enjoyable review, and the doormen, Abdu, had an awesome whistle to get us a taxi. The outside and inside of the hotel were old and eloquent. The bar also had some interesting and delectable cocktails. Overall my experience was quite enjoyable",5,2024,06,25
124,Outstanding service - beautiful hotel highly recommended,"We booked this hotel to stay for 2 nights for our wedding in London

Upon check in we were greeted by Angela who knew who we were and why we were staying. Angela was really helpful and so lovely. We couldn't check in straight away so we left our bags & came back later.

When we got to the room we had a bottle of fizz, cake & card from Angela which was so nice. On our wedding day we also came back to the room and she had put rose petals on the bed, a balloon & another bottle of fizz and a card. Such lovely touches which were much appreciated.

The door staff / concierge were also excellent they made sure we had a taxi for the journey to the wedding venue and were literally running in and out of traffic to get us a taxi on time. 

The hotel is so beautiful the decor and reception / ground floor areas were stunning.

Our room was a good size, the bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was large and fully tiled in marble. 

The only down side was the aircon which was set to 19 degrees lowest which meant a very hot & sweaty first night with no sleep. On the second night they did bring us a fan which helped us sleep better. 

We would be sure to come back to stay here if we came back to London. Many many thanks to Angela for everything!!!",5,2024,06,24
124,Excellent stay,"A huge thank you to all the staff, especially MARIA at the front desk.  She arranged a fantastic room in a quiet section of the hotel
With no steps. 
No request was too big and we had absolutely everything we needed. 
Right by the park and tube station.",5,2024,06,23
124,"Excellent service, lovely hotel made up for a couple of little glitches","This is a terrific place is a very central location.  Its an iconic building and its staff make for a fantastic stay. I booked a single room which I knew would be small and it was however it met my needs...mostly. I noticed on check in that the bathroom and shower had an odour of sewage and my the second day it was a bit of a bother. I mentioned it and a maintenance call was made which said they had fixed it but I still smelled it. The offer was made to change rooms. However, it was to a room of the same type -ie a single. Changing rooms is such a pain when you have all your stuff spread out and as the smell was only in the bathroom, I was hesitant to change. I could live with it. I was not angling for an upgrade - the number of reviews I have show that I don't complain just for the sake of an upgrade. However, the effort involved in gathering all my stuff up just to move to a similar room is not worth it for me. However, for a better room, it would be worth it. The very helpful person on the front desk checked with a manager and the offer was made to upgrade to a double which I accepted. 

The upgraded room had a proper window, the previous room had only a skylight. I am very grateful that the Kimpton was responsive to my needs, I found all staff to be super friendly and also I am appreciative of this also as changing rooms is always a pain so I think if there is an issue, changing to a better quality room reflects the effort involved in changing. The first room was fine, if not for the smell, except that the skylight did not have any curtains so was very bright in the morning and also had very few powerpoints. It was on the top floor and also had some pipe/ plumbing noises which the second room on the 5th floor did not have. 

The second room was lovely. What I really enjoyed overall was the quality of the mini bar - snacks were included and the tea and coffee, with real milk in mini bottles were of very high standard. I had a package that included breakfast and it was of the usual hotel buffet type but nice. I did discover of two of the 4 days I was there that its worth checking out if the breakfast is open earlier than advertised. I had two early starts and on both days arrived slightly earlier than the advertised hours and was able to enter on both occasions as breakfast had already begun for large groups that were staying. My GPS told me that the nearest underground was Holborn but this is not correct, Russell Square is just around the corner and the supermarket and restaurant district of The Brunswick Centre is 5 minutes walk away. Lots of attractions like The British Museum and The National Library are within walking distance and even some of the theatres are within a manageable walk. 

All in all, this was a terrific stay, it was worth the slight dent in my travel budget!",5,2024,06,22
124,Peaceful side of London,"What an absolutely beautiful building with a great location.
Arrived via train and the station is just around the corner. 
Quick and easy check in.
We had a wonderful room with balcony style doors over looking the park. We had luck with the sun so was lovely to have the door ajar seeing the park from the bed.  Room was a good size and clean.
Super tourist location with parks  and Dickens’s house not far away. For London we had a lovely relaxing weekend no rushing, pushing and not much noise considering on road. 
All the staff seemed friendly especially the porters/doormen very welcoming and helpful.
Would recommend the hotel to others for a relaxing break in London or for sure seeing.",5,2024,06,20
124,"Stunning, hospitable, and a unique experience. Make sure you stay at the Kimpton Fitzroy!!!","My family, friends and my now husband stayed at the Kimpton this June and held our wedding there. It was truly a magnificent stay. The staff were polite and went above and beyond for all of us. The architecture is breathtaking and the hotel is one of the most beautiful in the city of London! There cuisine was exceptional. Don’t walk, run to stay at the Kimpton!",5,2024,06,19
124,Beautiful hotel with shoebox rooms,"The Kimpton Fitzroy is a magnificent property in terms of architecture and the common spaces. The location (right across from Russell Square) is outstanding and very convenient for London sightseeing. We were greeted by exceptionally friendly staff at check-in who made us feel very welcome, and they were able to accommodate an early check in. IHG Platinum status was recognized with £15 coupon cards that can be used at Burr & Co or drinks at the hotel bar. No room upgrade was available.

This was unfortunate, because the basic 1 Queen room we booked turned out to be too small for a couple. We could barely get our luggage into the room, and we didn’t have a lot. The air conditioning was not effective (set at 19 but felt more like 25), so we kept the window open all night. The bathroom was so tight it was actually tricky to get in and out. The shower pressure was good, but the water leaked through the shower door into the rest of the bathroom, so you have to put a towel along the bottom of the door to block the water. The bed was quite firm, so if you’re a side sleeper, you may wake up pretty sore.

On the plus side, we liked the high ceilings, and the windows that opened to a balcony were nice. Also, we appreciated the complimentary snacks and water/milk in the fridge.

So on balance, this was an average stay overall. I would recommend booking a larger room category if more than one person.",3,2024,06,18
124,Excellent,"I really liked this hotel. I have really high standards and always want everything to be perfect when I travel (which I know is an unrealistic expectation). This hotel was nearly perfect and I will definitely return. 

First of all, it’s beautiful. The exterior architecture is stunning. The main public areas (entrance, bar, stairwells etc) are also fabulous. 

The rooms are comfortable, though not luxurious. Bathrooms newly renovated and better than many London hotels I’ve stayed in. 

The staff were all welcoming and friendly. Reception was busy to the point of being overwhelmed at times. Concierge was excellent. 

The restaurant and buffet breakfast were both good. PoThe original features in the restaurant give it an extra something special. The bar was gorgeous and an absolute pleasure to visit. 

The location is excellent, 2 mins to the tube. Plus the park is across the road and you can comfortably walk to Kings Cross or Euston stations if you want to. 

The British Library and the British Museum are both close by. SoHo and the theatre district of Seven Dials and Covent Garden are also in walking distance. 

Bloomsbury is a fairly quiet neighbourhood but some nice cafes and restaurants which are more relaxed and not catering to the tourist market.",4,2024,06,16
124,Amazing staff and service!,"The staff were so wonderful and friendly! Alex and the other doormen went out of their way to make us feel welcomed every time we walked in the door. Loved the rooms and the entire vibe of the hotel. They were well appointed and spacious. The restaurant was also lovely. Win all around, we will definitely be back!",5,2024,06,16
124,A wonderful stay!,"I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at the hotel.
Check in was seamless, and my room (Queen premium Park view) was lovely.
Breakfast had a great selection of hot and cold foods, and the service was impeccable without being intrusive.
Special mentions to Carlos at the front desk for his warm welcome and professionalism, and the wonderful Fedro whose sunny personality made going for breakfast each day an absolute pleasure.
Great location, handy for the tube.
The hotel is gorgeous, but it's the staff who really set it apart.
I will definitely be back again.",5,2024,06,13
124,Old class in rejuvenated building,"Great stay! Very friendly staff, from check-in to breakfast! The room was clean and well kept. Breakfast at Gavins had a good choice of cold and hot alternatives. Location excellent. A classic old new London hotel. I've stayed at this hotel many times and I'm sure to return.",5,2024,06,13
124,Great staff,"Abdul on the front door was great! Always helpful , sorted out problems unrelated to the hotel . Was friendly to everyone. We will be back because of the doorman!  The rest of the staff were equally friendly and helpful but we did not interact as much with them.",5,2024,06,13
124,A Perfect Anniversary Escape: Kimpton Fitzroy & Roksana's Warmth,"Choosing the Kimpton Fitzroy for our anniversary stay was an excellent decision.  For one magical night, the hotel offered a luxurious escape amidst the vibrant energy of London, and our room was a haven of comfort and elegance.

However, what truly made our stay unforgettable was the exceptional service from Roksana. Her genuine personality and eagerness to ensure our comfort was evident in every interaction, and what's more, we were treated with a complimentary room upgrade to acknowledge our anniversary celebration. 

The Kimpton Fitzroy provided the perfect setting for a romantic escape, but Roksana's warm service truly elevated our experience. If you're looking for a luxurious and unforgettable stay in London, look no further than the Kimpton Fitzroy – just be sure to ask for Roksana! Her dedication to making guests feel welcome will turn your stay into something very special.",5,2024,06,13
124,Fabulous hotel,We have stayed here many times. The standard of service is always excellent and quality of the rooms is as you would expect a 5 star hotel. This is our home from home and we highly recommend. The bar and restaurant are also very good. Excellent wine list and choice of food.,5,2024,06,12
124,Favorite hotel in London,"My favorite hotel in London. Beautiful reception and lounge area, rooms are relatively small but nicely appointed, the restaurant is high quality. But the people are the standout. The employees are without exception gracious, kind and go out of their way to help you have a good stay. Particular thanks to Abdul and Jack, who helped me wrangle luggage and get settled in cabs, and the housekeeping staff, who always leave the room pristine.",5,2024,06,08
124,The Perfect London Hotel! No better place to stay!!,"This was my second visit to London and the second time I stayed at the Kimpton Fitzroy. When I found out that I was going back, I knew I could not stay anywhere else. Rich in history, beautifully designed, and filled with absolutely the best and friendliest staff you will ever find, the Kimpton Fitzroy is the perfect London hotel! Conveniently located right around the corner from Russell Square train station, with only a 15 minute walk to the theater district and the River Thames. There are lots of local shops and tasty restaurants nearby too. Downstairs, the Fitz Bar is stocked with fine bourbons and whiskeys, which I love. It’s the perfect atmosphere to unwind at the bar or in a dark and cozy corner. Also, in the morning, you can hit the breakfast buffet or the hip coffee shop downstairs. Both are excellent!  

Just a quick tip, it pays to get an IHG credit card and be an IHG member, which was helpful in getting a room upgrade. Speaking of which, let’s not forget about the beds, pillows and blankets, because that was a huge part of our stay, the sleeping part. All three were so comfortable that we looked for the tags to see who made them! Plus, the bathroom was nice and large. BTW, the free drinks, snacks and cookies in the room went a long way too, literally, because you know I had to take some of those goodies back home to my family in the states! 

Most of all, it’s the people who work there that make the experience so special. Whether coming in or going out of the building, good chance you'll see Abdul with his warm smile, greeting you you at the front door, helping tend to your luggage or perhaps providing an umbrella on a rainy day. You’ll also probably run into Elliott or Jason hanging around, readily available to quickly answer any questions or help in any way. Also, a BIG thanks to Maria for all her help with booking a great rate, and to the folks at the front desk for the IHG upgrades, including free drink vouchers! Then, lastly, there's Marco, the best concierge in the business! Charming and friendly, helpful and kind, Marco ""Fitz"" right in as a member of our London family! My wife and daughter want to adopt him, and my son thought he was pretty cool too! And just like any other member of the family, we had to get him his very own Inter Miami Jersey, of course with Messi on the back!

Overall, there is no better place to stay than the Kimpton. The beauty of the hotel and the ""Royal"" treatment from the staff cannot be overstated, nor duplicated. Enjoy your stay, and be sure to say hello from the Glassman's!!",5,2024,06,05
124,Great staff,"Everything was great and the bell hop Jack was amazing! He was so helpful. The location was great and cozy beds. Jack went out of his way to assist us with bags, items we forgot and getting us transportation. Thank you so much for a great stay. I would come back again.",5,2024,06,05
124,Beautiful and luxurious hote,"From the moment our car pulled up in front of the Kimpton Fitzroy, until we pulled away 5 days later, we were treated like royalty.  The staff was so welcoming.   We arrived a little after noon and our room was not yet ready, so we left our luggage and walked to a nearby pub for a bite to eat.  Upon returning, our room was ready and our bags brought up.  The room was small, but very comfortable. Snacks were on the table and cold water and milk in the fridge.  The bed was so comfy, we had a great nights rest. We also enjoyed the service and food each  morning in the beautiful restaurant.  The evening social was nice to get a light snack and complimentary wine or beer.  I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to London.  The tube was just around the corner and British Museum 2 blocks away.  Very convenient.",5,2024,06,04
124,Fitzroy for family and business visits to London,"All staff were professional, friendly and always happy to lend a helping hand. Jack helped us get settled in the room and looked after us the entire time we were there. We appreciated all the effort he put in for us. He is an asset to the Fitzroy hotel, and we are looking forward to seeing him again soon. To add my daughters words, ""Jack is absolutely fabulous"". 
The room was spacious, the bed was extremely comfortable and the entire room was clean. Attention to detail is at the core for this hotel with nothing out of place. 
Dinner and breakfast at the restaurant provided a wide variety of options to choose from. The food was delicious, well presented and had wonderful flavour. 
We are regular visitors to the Fitzroy, either as a family or as individuals and would highly recommend the hotel to anyone visiting London.",5,2024,05,29
124,Lacks polish and professionalism,"Although the hotel is a successful blend of old and modern I was disappointed by both appearance and service of the personnel. As someone trained in hotel management and having spent many years in 5 star hotels , the hotel did not conform to my expectations of a 5 star hotel.

Casual attire, white trainers, no uniform , over loud music (rap at that) in reception area and in the breakfast hall I’m sure the music  is greatly appreciated by the young staff but not I’m sure to the taste of the majority of its clientele.
Service was slow, and it was apparent both during the welcome drink service and at breakfast in the waiting lounge that staff haven’t been trained in the profession and have no experience .
Surprise birthday presents  on arrival in the room had been forgotten despite expressing its importance….
Although the room was of a good size there was no bath , only a shower .
When asked for another glass of wine during the welcome drink I was told there were no more glasses. Having been kept waiting unnecessarily long for another one it was then thrust into my hands. An attitude unacceptable especially when paying £750 a night.
The receptionist was wearing a casual linen shirt. 
Breakfast was slow and was cold. No hot plates, no champagne and no smoked salmon.
There was a wait of approximately 20 minutes where you could help yourself to coffee. Sadly coffee jugs were empty, there were no clean cups. When asked if there was decaf  I was told there wasn’t any.

I won’t be returning as don’t think the hotel despite its beautiful building and decor is commensurate with a 5 star.",3,2024,05,29
124,We will definitely return to this hotel on our next trip to London.,"The Kimpton Fitzroy London is an excellent hotel. We had a beautiful room. 
Very good attention and help from staff.
We spent a very pleasant stay.
Furthermore, to us, the hotel was well located   
We will definitely return to this hotel on our next trip to London.",4,2024,05,29
124,Hotel staff excluding restaurant and cafe staff were stellar!,"I’m only putting a 5 because of Jason and Abdu at the Kimpton Fitzroy - the y were so helpful, friendly, and just so nice every time we saw them. They even hung out in the rain with us waiting for a taxi! The front desk personnel were warm and friendly.

The wait staff in the restaurant and cafe were rude with each interaction we had with them. We chose to eat off site after two bad experiences.",5,2024,05,28
124,Great stay in London,"I’ve recently stayed here for two nights while in London. I was very impressed with the location, appearance and impression of the hotel. The staff are very pleasant and helpful. 

The solo room is one of the quietest and most comfortable I’ve stayed in, great when travelling on your own.

Minor criticism would be the hotel was busy with functions, so it seems most resources are focused on that. This did not impact my stay but I did feel they were a bit overwhelmed with that. 

I would definitely stay again and happy to recommend for an upmarket stay in London.",5,2024,05,27
124,Birthdays stay,"My husband booked this hotel for my 60th birthday… We had stayed before when it was the Russell .  The lobby is stunning as you walk in … We had a queen park view room, at first I didn’t think the price justified the room , however it did , the bed was comfy and amenities great … The hotel made my day feel special , staff to mention are Jack at entrance ( lovely lad) Abdul and the French lady with dark hair in the restaurant ( sorry I forget your name) the only think was at checkout we were asked to pay a service charge of around 50 pounds for two nights ?? This was not mentioned earlier and it was a little embarrassing..
However we most certainly will return ( planning a Xmas visit) so thank you for a brilliant stay 
Also the little cafe in the park is fab !",5,2024,05,27
124,Very disappointing.,"We have stayed in the Kimpton before, and thought we’d go again. I booked directly through the hotel, we are IHG members.  Guest services contacted me asking if there was a special occasion, yes, our wedding anniversary on the Saturday. We checked in and were taken to our room, more compact than expected, I’d describe it as adequate. I had expressed preferences on my IHG account to be near lifts. We weren’t. Our complimentary mini bar consisted of 2 bottles of water and 2 tiny bottles of milk. 

We went to the gym, when we got back they had given us a complimentary bottle of fizz and a dessert for our wedding anniversary. Which was Saturday, not Friday. It’s the little details. 

The following morning we went for breakfast and were sent to the bar to wait for a table to be free. We were called and seated cheek to jowl with other quests who had a party on either side of us, they decided to talk through us. The staff moved us thankfully.  I ordered from the kitchen menu. We waited over 20 minutes for our coffees. 

The next morning same again, only they sent us to Burr and Co explaining the wait would be less and the food the same. We went here to find you couldn’t order from the kitchen, so we headed back. No space so another wait in the bar, this time, no coffee left and yesterday’s papers. Finally seated, where we were the morning before. Cheek to jowl. No one checks on you, no clearing of plates, no offer of another coffee. One member of staff dropped an entire tray of drinks over a quest. I didn’t know who to feel more sorry for. 

Checked out Sunday morning, had prepaid, was asked to pay a charge for ordering from the kitchen for breakfast. But… the biggest shock, would we like to pay a discretionary 5% of your room charges to the cleaner. Now, this did not happen last time we stayed. Had we experienced stand out service we would have considered this. But we will not stay with you again. We will go back to The Landmark, where Rupert holds the door open for you, knows your name and the service is exceptional. Very disappointed and marred our anniversary celebrations.",3,2024,05,27
124,Gobsmackingly Beautiful,"The excitement starts with the approach — a majestic building a block from the Russell Square Tube stop, overlooking Russell Square — and continues as you enter a beautiful lobby with a friendly and helpful front desk. 

Thank you to Maria for the upgrade to a GORGEOUS suite. The bed was insanely comfortable after a long flight from the west coast of the US and I loved the complimentary mini bar!

Thank you as well to Marco, the concierge, who helped me out with a last minute print job. 

I didn't want to leave and I can't wait to come back again.",5,2024,05,26
124,Spectacular!,"A spectacular stay at The Kimpton!
They have the coolest cocktail bar where we spent most of our time when we weren't off sightseeing! All the staff are awesome. Whether it was receptionists or restaurant staff, we always felt very looked after. Special mention goes to Jack, who runs the happy hour and was always down for a chat and hearing about our adventure of the day! Smart guy, so friendly and helpful.",5,2024,05,23
124,great birthday tip!,"We had such wonderful service, everyone was attentive and went above and beyond to make our stay enjoyable! It was my boyfriend's birthday and the staff went above and beyond with special touches to make us feel special - great location and beautiful, clean hotel!",5,2024,05,23
124,very nice hotel in central London but room for improvement,"This is a lovely hotel located in the centre of London. It’s been beautifully renovated since its days as the Russell Hotel (after which the Russell Group of universities is named). 

My small queen room was tastefully decorated and it had a nice en-suite with powerful shower. I was a bit worried about the noise from passing traffic but the glazing kept all but the occasional police sirens out. While there are plenty of plug points including 2 on each side of the bed, they are in such a position that it makes it very difficult for downward facing USB plugs to fit in. This is a pretty basic error for either the hotel designer or electrical installer to make. 

The gym was small but adequate and breakfast was good quality and nicely served.

My only complaints are:

- very slow check-in. Really not sure why check-in should take more than a couple of minutes but it felt like more than 10 minutes to complete.

- Not enough staff. All the staff I met were very polite and helpful but there weren’t many around which meant slow drinks service from the bar and a bit of a queue and a wait to get into breakfast. 

- Dinner was ok but just OK. I’d advise leaving the hotel for meals unless you have a good reason for staying in.",4,2024,05,22
124,2024 london trip,"The hotel is beautiful. The park view is a must, especially on floors 3 and 4. Hotel staff was accommodating to our requests for an upgrade through American Express. The doormen are always friendly. Abdul, specifically was very hospitable and entertained us the entire time we were waiting for our taxi.",5,2024,05,22
124,Refused to honour my reservation and no apology,"Booked a Fitzroy Suite, received an email from them saying that the booking was a system issue and they just downgraded my reservation to a Queen Room outright.

They took it pretty much as granted as there was not a single ""sorry"" in the email. Very unprofessional.",1,2024,05,21
124,Amazing staff!,What a great hotel with lovely and caring staff! We arrived after quite a stressful trip from Kent but we were made to feel so welcome from the first people we encountered. Mariia and Sophie on reception were so lovely and helpful when checking us in. We needed a couple of suggestions for a family meal in the evening and Sean on the concierge desk was a wealth of knowledge in that department! The room was fantastic and a lovely young man called Jack even delivered us a bottle of rose. The icing on the cake. Would thoroughly recommend the hotel - classic decor paired with exceptional service!,5,2024,05,20
124,Excellent hotel in great location!,"Excellent hotel! Very friendly and helpful staff throughout the hotel, a lovely concierge, Sean Keenan (Marco also lovely), very comfortable and quiet room with a firm-but-not-too-firm mattress, great full English breakfast, very good restaurant, delightful park right across the street and well-located for getting to central London.",5,2024,05,20

124,The most amazing hotel! X,"Wow - what a hotel! We stayed here for 2 nights this week for our wedding in London and were pretty much speechless upon arrival. The hotel is stunning and we were kindly given an upgrade which made everything more perfect. The staff at reception, doormen and guest relations were so attentive and thoughtful, we are so grateful and lucky to have stayed here and cannot wait to return for our future anniversaries. It is a special hotel and always will be to us x",5,2024,05,19
124,Recent visit,"I was delighted and surprised by the excellence of the staff here! Two, in particular, stood out. Jack, the doorman was the friendliest and most welcoming person I've ever met at a hotel. A close second was Joseph, the concierge. These men are genuine assets to your organization!",5,2024,05,19
124,Very nice stay in London,"Great spot , everyone was friendly and helpful. Hotel had older feel but many upgrades.  Food and drinks were all well done , drinks were fancier style than the food. Porters and Doormen were all excellent. Abdu in particular. Wouldn’t hesitate to recommend.",4,2024,05,15
124,London Luxury,"Absolutely fabulous!!!  The rooms are stunning- modern, but with character.  The food and room service are excellent. The building is within walking distance of many local restaurants.  The staff goes above and beyond.  We stayed in a one bedroom dinning suite and it was massive, with a tub I wanted to transport back home with me.  Huge shout out to the concierge who went out of their way to take care of both myself and my 14 year old.  Highly recommend- and will return next trip!",5,2024,05,15
124,Great Stay at Kimpton Fitzroy,"I had a fantastic stay during the time at the Kimpton Fitzroy. The entire staff was extremely kind and accommodating . A few staff members even helped us plan the activities of our trip, all of which were great suggestions, and with any questions we had regarding the area or any of our future Europe endeavors in general (shoutout to Marco). When we return to London, we will definitely be staying here again! Only great things to say.",5,2024,05,14
124,Great staff at Kimpton Fitzroy,"From entering the beautiful Victorian hotel, Concierge John stored our bag as until the ready.
The coffee shop had excellent coffees, pastries, service.
The upgraded(Thanks to Andrei-night desk), room was spacious and beautiful.
Cocktails in the beautiful bar were excellent.
Front desk manager Doreen, expertly and painlessly checked us out.
Great property on Russel Square.",5,2024,05,13
124,Good value. Great location. Great staff.,Had a very good experience at the Kempton Fitzroy. Pretty good value for a fantastic room. Great location. The staff were consistently excellent. Marco at the concierge desk was very well informed and helped us think through various dinner reservations.,5,2024,05,13
124,"Stay here, you won’t regret it!!",The hotel is beautiful and our room was very comfortable- I had the best night’s sleep I’ve had in a long time in the bed and the pillows were so comfortable. The hotel staff was exceptional and gave my daughter a beautiful (and delicious) dessert as a gift for her graduation from university. We only stayed one night because we were traveling to Paris the next day but it was amazing!,5,2024,05,12
124,Overall best hotel I’ve stayed at in London.,"Overall this hotel is absolutely amazing. The rooms are great and the location cannot be beat! The food in the Fitz Restaurant is delicious and the cocktails in the Fitz bar are the best. The best thing though is the staff. Jack, the doorman/porter/concierge is one of the sweetest and most caring people I have ever experienced in a hotel. Just great!",5,2024,05,12
124,The best hotel you will ever stay in!!,"The Kimpton Fitzroy London, is the pinnacle of hotels. The customer service is top notch, the staff are so kind and helpful, and the concierge are knowledgeable, funny, and have connections. The room was exquisite, bedding felt like a warm hug, and the snacks (tea, crisp, biscuits) were sooooo delicious.

I appreciated everyone, but I want to name these individuals who always went above and beyond, Carlos, Elliot, Jack, Sean, and Marcus. You were such a blessing and felt like friends. I cannot wait to return!!",5,2024,05,12
124,A Wonderful Weekend at the Fitzroy,"We enjoyed every moment of our stay at the Fitzroy. It's a beautiful old building in an excellent location. The staff were attentive and professional and the facilities were immaculate. When we checked in, the staff mentioned the rain in the forecast and she said she would have a second umbrella delivered to our room so we could walk to dinner that evening. Sure enough, the umbrella quietly appeared while we were out and we were happy to have it later that night. It was a thoughtful touch. I was also impresesed by so many of the small details, such as the live potted plants in our mini-suite and throughout the hotel. Speaking of small details, the caulk lines in the shower and the W/C were bright white and crisp and clean. I know that may sound silly, but caulk in the bathrooms is something that many hotels fail to maintain over time and I've become a bit of stickler. Overall, it was a lovely stay and we hope to have the opportunity to return someday soon.",5,2024,05,12
124,The attentive and friendly staff made my stay in a fantastic setting.,"What a gem of a hotel, right on the corner of Russell Square. Door staff greet you upon arrive and a swift introduction to reception where the staff  could not do enough for you.
Very efficient and a smooth transition to get you to your room even when there’s a queue forming behind you. No one seems rushed or under pressure, calm, organised and informed. Gold star to you all. 
The hotel is a beautiful setting but not pretentious. The rooms are elegantly presented and all the marble and dark interiors gives a luxurious aesthetic. 
As well as the stunning surroundings, the residents drinks social is a really  individual enhancement to the hotel. The servers are good for a chat too, that’s definitely a bonus for the resident. No one doesn’t feel important.
I ate dinner in the restaurant twice - absolutely devine!! It needs to be pushed way more as your chefs clearly know about food and can cook . The maitre de was so pleasant although one very small complaint, the manageress lady could smile a wee bit more please! 
So a big big shout out to Jack and the other two doorman, Carlos on concierge, the lovely Irish blonde receptionist, and not to mention the Fitz bar tender who recognised my face from my stay in early January - that really is attention to detail. 
Keep up the good work Kimpton. Clearly the hotel manager is doing a brilliant job at understanding the needs of the clientele and  conveying that to staff members. 
It comes highly recommended and most appreciated.",5,2024,05,11
124,A memorable stay!,"We had a wonderful stay at this hotel in early March. The Fitzroy Kimpton is a beautiful and unique hotel, but what really stood out was the attentive service. This weekend stay was for us to meet up to celebrate a birthday, which was made even more memorable by Angela from Guest Relations  who made it extra special. 
Thank you, we will be back!",5,2024,05,10
124,Best Honeymoon spot in England,"We were greeted by Lotti when we arrived and made us feel like royalty.  Adrian(?) Brought our luggage up and we headed for The Eye. We came back to Jack P. giving us champagne that was quite delicious. Anything we asked for, we got.  Chalita at the breakfast hostess desk remembered me every time I went.  Lina, the fabulous, remembered our orders. Jack S and Ivarz hailed cabs, gave us umbrella and helped with our luggage into the Uber.",5,2024,05,10
124,Amazing experience at the Kimpton Fitzroy,"We had a fantastic experience at the Kimpton Fitzroy in London while on our honeymoon, and this is largely because of the staff. EVERYONE we encountered was very helpful and friendly, and they went above and beyond to make sure we had everything we needed. We stayed in a suite which was very spacious with a fantastic large bathroom with great water pressure in the shower. The hotel is located in a marvelous location where almost all the major tourist spots are no longer than a 20 minute tube ride away. This is truly a five star hotel, we can’t wait to come back!!",5,2024,05,10
124,"Charming, Conveniently Located Hotel","A very lovely hotel. Very conveniently located around the corner from the Russell Square tube station and with a nice little park across the street. The room was very pleasant and quiet with a comfortable bed and chairs for relaxing. The whole hotel has an understated air of elegance right down to the hallways and the non-hotel smell. One tiny area for improvement is better lighting in front of the mirrors in the room (for putting on makeup) or a makeup mirror in the bathroom (I am too short to reach the shaving mirror!).

The staff were all friendly and helpful, always wishing us a good day. The doorman (from Egypt - sorry, I've forgotten his name) was particularly charming, always stopping to chat and even giving us recommendations on routes to take or places to see. I would highly recommend the Kimpton Fitzroy if you are planning a trip to London.",5,2024,05,09
124,Gorgeous hotel w/ good location and great staff.,"Absolutely loved this gorgeous hotel. From the door guys (Alex is a dreamboat lol) to the concierge everyone is wonderful and have such good personalities. They gave us some great recommendations. We arrived around 2 pm and our room wasn't ready until about 4:30. Only found out it was ready after texting them since i didn't hear from anyone which was really our only hiccup. Room itself was lovely but small (I know UK rooms are typically on the small side) but no room to open up suitcases without having to constantly step over them. Shower, bed, & bathroom were great. Loved that we could crack the window to get some fresh air in the room. Definitely will stay here again!

Pros: friendliest staff, they had a little birthday treat in my room for me which is always such a sweet thought, beds were cozy, nice shower pressure, location is great for parks, tube, & restaurants. There is a cute pub right behind the hotel that we went to almost every night.

Cons: room wasnt ready earlier than 4 (the staff at check in told me they were sold out yet i could book more rooms online that day if i needed to so didnt need to lie about that ((yes i know early check in is not guaranteed and its based on availability, im just a brat about it & we had a long travel day)). Did not get any room upgrades for being diamond again which i know is not guaranteed but would have been nice. The bartender at the ""speakeasy"" wasn't the friendliest and kinda judgey, would have stayed here longer if he didnt turn us off.",5,2024,05,08
124,A wonderful stay at the Fitzroy,"We had a very enjoyable stay at the Kimpton Fitzroy. It’s a beautiful historic building in an excellent location, every member of the staff was welcoming and helpful, and the room was nicely appointed and very comfortable. We wish we could’ve stayed longer than two nights.",5,2024,05,08
124,Silver wedding anniversary weekend,"Wow what a hotel! Made to feel welcome from entering to leaving the hotel, the room was lovely and had everything that anyone would need . Everywhere in the hotel was spotlessly clean. The breakfast again had everything possible and was top notch. Now to the staff! Every single one of them went above and beyond to satisfy the guests,  they were outstanding. Well done Kimpton your staff are a credit to your exceptional management .Just a big thank you for making our 25th silver wedding anniversary so special with the bubbles and cake.We will be back again soon now we have found our special place in London.",5,2024,05,07

124,My stay in London,"All the staff were friendly and welcoming, especially Jack at the door. He especially made us feel welcomed, and always took an interest in our plans for each day!",5,2024,05,07
124,Special and Memorable - Excellent Staff,"Staying at the Kimpton Fitzroy London was delightful. The hotel is classic and lovely.  The staff is outstanding, particularly Marco Russo, a young concierge who is professional, polite and personable. We greatly enjoyed our conversations with him. His restaurant recommendations were excellent, from simple to elegant, and a few last minute ones too. I especially  appreciated his saving our evening with a last minute call to  an authentic Italian family restaurant where his conversation began in Italian and concluded in English. They agreed to seat us despite being very busy. He also regularly assisted me with having confidential documents printed and delivered to my room. This is one young man who will go far in his career.

Another shout out to the  Customer Relations team, Angela, Roxsana and their excellent supervisor for making things extra special for our 30th anniversary - rose petals, wine, and an absolutely scrumptious pistachio carrot cake cupcake. 

We look forward to staying there again in October and seeing their gracious and hospitable staff.",5,2024,05,06
124,Weekend away!,"Wow wow this is a fantastic hotel and worth more stars than it has. Stayed here many years ago pre Covid. It’s had a full refurb, rebranding and there is nothing to fault. Staff are friendly, helpful and professional. Room were clean stocked with snacks , tea and coffee with cold milk in the fridge with water daily added . Incredibly quiet considering how busy the hotel was. Breakfast was amazing, wide variety and nothing too much trouble. This is a central hotel easy walking distance to all main attractions. Not the first and definitely not the last time we will stay. Keep doing what you are doing! Beyond perfection!",5,2024,05,06
124,********** One Hundred Stars Hotel **********,"Not enough to only give this hotel four or five stars...it deserves ten or one hundred! Right from the start the bellmen carried my luggage up the steps and later to my room. Receptionists and concierge staff and front office managers were efficient, polite, friendly and smiling.
My room was nicely furnished, clean and immaculate for the entire stay of a week. It was also quiet and had a lovely view overlooking Russell Square. Anything extra I needed, such as a hair curler, was brought to my room within minutes. 
Then there is the bar with great drinks and little munchies. 
The delicious healthy buffet breakfast is also ten stars. Loved the wide selection, fresh fruit, great choice of breads/croissants/rolls and the special eggs made-to-order.  The decaf latte is the best I've ever had anywhere --- brought to my table by cheerful and helpful wait staff.  The restaurant was so good for breakfast that I thought I'd try it for dinner two nights. Totally exceptional! Loved the fish  - perfectly cooked. 
The interior of the hotel is splendid....mosaic floors, beautiful wood carvings, everything you'd hope to find in a classic olde English building...but with modern touches such as fast wi-fi. 
Oh, it is also in a great location for walking and just a few blocks to the British Museum (make sure to book tickets online in-advance) and walking distance to the British Library. A few blocks from the hotel is a small shopping mall, Brunswick Centre, with  a Waitrose grocery store, Boots chemist and a good selection of casual dining options. The Russell Square tube station is right around the corner. 

Thank you to all the staff for making my stay so special.

Of course, I'd stay here again and recommend it without hesitation.",5,2024,05,04
124,Quick Visit,Called in here on a recent trip.  What a fantastic building.  I just wanted to thank the Manager for his attention and hospitality and thank the wonderful staff too.,5,2024,05,04
124,Weekend stay,Excellent stay  met by a very attentive front of house team . Angela was superb and helped me make my wife’s birthday special…………………………………….     ………………xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx,5,2024,05,02
124,Great Hotel,This is a great property with a wonderful staff. Everybody was very friendly and helpful. Concierge had great recommendations. Abdu was the best ever. Beautiful hotel with a great location and we will for sure be back our next visit to London. Thanks for a great stay.,5,2024,05,02
124,Wonderful experience and service was 5*,"I chose this hotel due to a Facebook ad that was featured on my feed. I always struggle with choosing a hotel because of the vast choice in London.

I was quietly excited about my choice because of the boutique feel that the website gave me but reserved full judgement until we arrived.

Well, a few footsteps from Russell Square underground station, couldn’t be located in a more central spot. On arrival at the hotel the door staff took our luggage from us as showed us to the front desk, where we were greeted warmly by Dorine. Dorine was kind and informative and when we shared the reason for our trip she promptly upgraded us to a suite. We were thrilled!

The room was superb! So, so clean and well equipped. We couldn’t fault a single thing. In the being we tried out the bar, which was an unexpected find! Well worth a visit (I won’t spoilt the surprise). Breakfast was equally as superb and when we asked at the desk if we keep the room until 2pm this request was granted without any hesitation.

In summary, I really feel that the whole team cared about the guest experience so much that I can’t see how I can stay anywhere else now.

Thanks again and very warm wishes to you all.",5,2024,04,30
124,Great time,"A wonderful hotel with great staff, and thw bar has great cocktails. And the greetinsg and hel.we got from Jack was tremendous.

Thanks again, Andrew & Eva",5,2024,04,30
124,Great hotel; better staff.,"We stayed here for a few nights and had a fantastic experience. Great accommodations and staff, most importantly Jack P, who couldn’t have been more friendly and helpful. This review requires more than 200 characters, so I’ll use it to reemphasize the awesome staff.",5,2024,04,28
124,Excellent 40th Bday,"From the moment we arrived to Kimpton Fitzroy, we knew this place was special. We were greeted by the manager Roksana who was just lovely and went out of her way to ensure that we had a great time celebrating my birthday. There was balloons, champagne, and a dessert waiting for us in the room. I made some off hand comments and she was so attuned to what I was saying that she checked on me later in the day to ensure I had everything I needed. Roksana was truly a pleasure. The rest of the staff were warm and professional. 

The room itself was beautiful and very clean.

The location was great, and was situated close enough to things that we could walk or take a 5-10 min taxi to where we needed to be. 

I highly recommend this hotel! You will not be disappointed.",5,2024,04,28
124,We will definitely be back!,"Everyone was eager to help from the doorman, the check-in staff, the concierge, to the servers at breakfast, and finally the cleaning staff!! Josef, the concierge, and his entire team were absolutely the best! They helped us from finding local pubs to getting into the heart of London and into shopping areas.  Our room at the Kimpton Fitzroy was clean and they had every amenity you would need. My husband and I will definitely be back!!",5,2024,04,27
124,Friday night at Kimpton Fitzroy with the girls,Another wonderful stay. We were upgraded and it always feels like we are spoilt when we stay here.  The rooms are unique and the bedding so comfortable. Thank you.,5,2024,04,26
124,Elliot made my day!,"I recently stayed at the Kimpton Fitzroy on Russell Square.
The hotel itself is pretty nice and very convenient thanks to its proximity to both subway and bus lines.
What I was thoroughly impressed by though was the exceptional service provided by a staff member, a young man by the name of Elliot. He went above and beyond to ensure my stay was comfortable and enjoyable. His friendly demeanor and attentiveness truly made a difference. I highly recommend this hotel, thanks to Elliot's outstanding service. Kudos!",5,2024,04,26
124,A clean and stylish stay,"The hotel is clean and stylish. Take advantage of an excellent concierge team to elevate your stay - and the proximity to the British Museum. Don't miss a walk through all the little pocket parks around the hotel, which were beautiful in spring. 

Two notes. You'll definitely want to spring for an exterior facing room to avoid generator noise on the interior side. And for allergy suffferers, the bath products are extremely strong here, as with many upscale hotels these days.  When asked, housekeeping whisked them away.",4,2024,04,26
124,Fantastic again Kimpton Fitzroy,"We had 3 rooms here for marathon weekend based on the exceptional service and comfort on our last trip a few years ago.  And we weren't disappointed. As before the staff were amazing all round.  Special thanks to the attentive front desk staff, the door staff who didnt even need asking for the lift when they saw my daughter appear with her pram, every time.  The restaurant staff who offered help and catered for my grandsons picky eating.  The rooms were very comfortable, with little touches such as an childs amenity kit in the cot.   We will definitely look forward to coming back her in the future.  Our only note would be that the café that is attached had an area for hotel guests.  It was constantly full with students on their computers with 1 cup of coffee lasting many hours.  We were only able to find 1 small table once during our stay as there was no space. so we couldnt really eat there either for a snack etc.  But thats just a bit of feedback for the future.",5,2024,04,24
124,Wonderful stay at Kimpton,"This was our first stay at the Kimpton Fitzroy.  We stayed 4 nights in April.  From the time we arrived, we were impressed with the exceptional level of service, well-appointed rooms, and convenient location in Russell Square.  The daily Social Hour at 5pm was a nice touch and the on-site restaurant was great after a long day of sight seeing.   We plan to stay at the Kimpton Fitzroy for future stays in London and highly recommend it!",5,2024,04,23
124,Exceptional hospitality,"Exceptional service from the team at Fitzroy. The very warmest welcome for our party including my 11 month old daughter. To say the staff couldn’t do enough would be an understatement. Warm, true hospitality. A very special mention to Mladen who took incredible care of us in the Brasserie - a real attribute to the hotel. Our meal was scrumptious and accompanied by excellent wine recommendations. Thank you Mladen and all.",5,2024,04,23
124,Love at the Kimpton,"I discovered the Kimpton a couple of years ago and I immediately fell in love. As part of the IHG group, it gave me the opportunity to enjoy my rewards all the while having the best service. The hotel is gorgeous. Well positioned and the whole staff from the bell boy to the customer guest managers are simply so welcoming and kind. It’s my home away form home.",5,2024,04,23
124,Wonderful hotel with great service,This was our second visit at the hotel and once again everything was great. From check-in to check-out the personell were so friendly and polite. We especially would like to mention Ludmila who helped us when we were a bit late at check-out.,5,2024,04,22
124,"Teamwork (Roksana, Jack and Angela) really makes the dream work!","Well...I heard about the legendary customer service, but I have experienced it first hand and I am not even a guest.  My friend was staying at the Kmpton Fitzroy London, to celebrate a life event and she stayed on the recommendation of some members of our friendship group.

Anyway, at the last minute, I decided to call and see if I could surprise my friend with champagne, flowers and Roksana  (alongside Jack and Angela!) were able to arrange everything I needed.  

I have never encountered such polite and efficient customer service. They all went above and beyond to help me to celebrate my friend from afar. Everything was simple and even payment was via secure link!

On this basis, I am going to book myself there for an upcoming event and look forward to meeting Roksana and the team in person!",5,2024,04,20
124,Show time,"From check in  to check out, we felt very at home, everything was spot on, room was so comfortable but compact, lovely staff with flair,
Black pudding missing on bfast but in no way spoilt our short break 10/10, so comfortable reasonable price and great location",4,2024,04,20
124,Amazing customer service,"We booked here, so we could go to the theatre and stay overnight.

We were delighted to find as Diamond Elite Members that we had been upgraded.

On checking our booking for the theatre, we found that my husband's wheelchair was 1 cm to big for the wheelchair space but the hotel kindly let us use their wheelchair.

We had a lovely meal in the restaurant at the hotel and took part in Social House, which was in the Winter Garden.

We even managed to request a later checkout and had lunch before leaving.

The hotel staff were all great. Our room upgrade was super, we will return to this hotel again.",5,2024,04,20
124,A fabulous luxurious experience!,"We have visited London for decades and have stayed in many hotels, including other 5 star. The Kimpton Fitzroy is by far our favourite. The building itself is spectacular and the service is consistently first class. All staff treat us as though we were VIP’s. We are always made to feel so welcome and nothing is too much trouble. We visit the Kimpton frequently and many of the staff often remember us and our names and treat us like old friends. The rooms are beautifully appointed and have a luxurious feel. We’ve stayed over 10 times since the hotel was refurbished and never once been disappointed. 
We were celebrating my husband’s 70th birthday and so I wrote to Jack Powell of Guest Relations to see if he could help in any way to make my husband’s birthday special. Boy did he! We were upgraded to a Junior Suite (so beautiful!) and were greeted with a bottle of  delicious bubbly. He met with us personally during our stay to make sure we were having a great time. What a super chap! We  thoroughly enjoyed our stay thanks to Jack and all the staff and we will undoubtedly return in the future. A big thank you to all concerned.",5,2024,04,19
124,"Fab hotel, good location","Stayed for just one night at this quirky hotel. It was booked for us so not sure what to expect but hotel is very grand. Staff without exception are very courteous and happy to help. Was in a Queen room booked with breakfast. Was a little disappointed in the room, it was compact and looked out over the void in the middle of hotel. Having said that it was spotlessly clean and I had the best night’s sleep. Breakfast was good and the little extras like tuck box in the room, coffee in reception to help yourself and take out and drinks reception when returning in the afternoon all add up to a great experience. We will definitely stay again and save up for a suite next time.",5,2024,04,19
124,"Great location, friendly and efficient staff.","We (my wife and I) stayed for 2 nights towards the end of March for our third visit. As IHG Platinum members we used reward points so can't comment on the cost. 

Check-in was quick despite it being really busy. The location is excellent, with Russell Square tube station 2 minutes walk away and there's a Pret a Manger, Tesco Express and pub right by the station. The British Museum was only 5 minutes walk away and you could easily be in theatreland within 30 minutes walk.

Every event there is a social hour where you can have complimentary wine or beer in nice surroundings- it seems that the idea is for guests to mingle but I'm not sure how much mingling actually goes on- which was a good pre-theatre activity and significantly cheaper than in the theatres!

The hotel itself is very picturesque inside and outside and you could spend quite some time exploring and taking photos.

All the staff were friendly, polite and good-natured.

The bedroom was a comfortable size and the shower was spacious.  The room was spotlessly clean with an extremely comfortable bed and was well-stocked with complimentary drinks and snacks. 

Being part of the Kimpton chain it's worth checking in advance if there's a secret word or phrase before you stay....
It's definitely one of the finest hotels we've ever stayed in - for us the staff have got the perfect blend of politeness and friendliness and do seem to enjoy working there.  Hopefully we'll get the chance to return!

124,5 Stars isn't enough!,"We visited the Kimpton Fitzroy for my partners birthday, this was our first time staying here and had out usual go-to hotel in London for special events but this will definitely be taking over as our go-to!
Our Room was kindly upgraded to room 352 which was beautifully decorated in a modern style. The bathroom was huge and the bed was a 4-poster which I did not want to get out of in the morning.

Everything was perfect, Staff at check in had upgraded us for the Birthday and made up the room with petals and a bottle of Champagne which was a really special touch. Angela the Guest relations agent was on hand for anything we needed and went out of her way to greet us at check in despite being clocked out for the day.

A special mention must go to the Room Service lady at breakfast who delivered us Pancakes whilst singing Happy Birthday to my partner- she made the day that extra bit special!

Evening Drinks in the bar were a great way to wind down for the evening and everyone we encountered were so attentive and wanting to make each moment as special as they could.

We will definitely be returning for the next trip to London. Thank you for making the trip so incredible!",5,2024,04,16
124,Fantastic Staff & Amazing Hotel,"Upon arrival at the hotel the staff were there to give a fantastic greeting then taking you right to reception to check in. I walk with crutches and without me having to ask they took my bags to my room and they were there waiting for

124,Service.  Ambiance. Design.  Location.,"Service.
 Design.  
Asthetics.  
Location. 

We had a recent  8 night stay at the Kimpton Fitzroy.  My  first impressions of the Fitzroy set the tone for the entire stay. From the  courteous, attentive and professional staff  to the elegant, luxurious rooms, the Fitzroy can set the mood for an exceptional stay while in London. Our entire  vacation was enhanced by the circumstance of our chosen accommodation.

Before  we even stepped inside,  we appreciated the  ornate aesthetics of the exterior façade. It is an inviting entrance, enhanced by the ever present doormen, who  warmly greet every guest upon arrival. I want to call out Sachi ( spelling) and Ivars  who greeted us throughout the day  when arriving and departing  throughout the day, always lending a helping hand. 

Once we were though the entrance,  we were greeted with the charm and understated elegance of the hotel, with polished marble staircases,  shimmering  crystal chandeliers,  dark muted wood walls,  and fabrics.

Upon check in, Carlos, Roxana and Jack were behind the counter, assisting us in an efficient check in and orientation.  They seamlessly provided  recommendations and insights to make our stay in the hotel and the city  exceptional. 

We were upgraded to a  room facing Russel Square, a charming light filled room which was thoughtfully designed   with guests comfort and relaxation in mind.  The library of available amenities is extensive. We found the bed to be  comfortable and inviting with crisp linens and just the right amount of pillows.  The bathroom though modest in size felt larger than it was, with everything  one needs.   The fit and finish of the bathroom was at a high level, with polished chrome,  translucent  tile work and all the amenities one would need. Enhanced touches such as  19-69 bath products, blush bath robes and a towel warmer. 

We enjoyed   frequent room service  and found the prices to be reasonable the  food quality and quantity to be  spot on and the service and delivery to be flawless.  Room service breakfast was a highlight every morning.   A thank you to all the  hotel staff whose names I did not  capture  who  made our stay  such as the housekeepers,  room service staff and those who kept the hotel running seamlessly so guests can focus on their stay. 

The attached bar, the Fitz,  was a pleasure to experience, with a  specialty drink menus for their craft cocktails  making for an absorbing and memorable experience.  Amber was our hostess for the evening and she provided just enough guidance to enhance our unique cocktail experience noteworthy. 

A special thank you to Barbara and Angela who  made our  extended anniversary  stay so special.   There has been a lot of thought  put into every detail  of the hotel, from a highly trained and attentive staff,  the remarkable ambiance,   luxurious rooms and seamless service. It allows guest sink into luxury, feel welcome and special.   My stay in London was  optimized by selecting to stay at the Kimpton Fitzroy.   I look forward to a return next spring.",5,2024,04,11
124,Wonderful staff and stay,"Thank you to the helpful and delightful staff who made my visit a huge treat and wonderful experience. A very high standard of dining and the Fitz's bar is fabulous. I would highly recommend this hotel for the decor, ambience and friendly atmosphere. A delight from start to finish!",5,2024,04,11
124,Gorgeous hotel and great staff! 10 out of 10!,"Incredible hotel for our family visit to London! The staff was so warm and friendly and hotel was gorgeous! Hotel was close to tube station too. Sophie at the Front Desk, Andrea in the restaurant and Marco, the Concierge were all extremely kind and helpful! The rooms were beautiful and comfortable. The bed linens were so soft and perfect for a great night’s rest. We will be back next time our travels take us to London!",5,2024,04,10
124,Outstanding Stay,"This is our 4th stay at the Kimpton Fitzroy and it was the best yet.

We stayed at Christmas and it was one of our first trips away with our 8 month old and it could not have been better.
After a couple of initial issues with our booking we were welcomed to the Kimpton by the amazing Kodjana who arranged a fantastic room for us. The room was gorgeous, exceptionally clean and very spacious with everything we needed for a family break.

We were taken such good care of by every single member of staff including the reception team, restaurant staff, cleaning staff & turndown service. Every member of the Kimpton team was fantastic but special mentions to Klodjana who took exceptional care of us before and throughout our stay, Jack in guest relations, and the wonderful staff in the restaurant who payed special attention to our son every day and made us feel so welcome and taken care of.

The Kimpton felt like a home away from home but with added extras. The hot chocolate in reception each morning was such a lovely touch and made us feel so festive.

We are already planning our next trip and 
can’t wait to be back every year.

Tip: Opt for a room with breakfast include - it’s well worth it.",5,2024,04,10
124,Family stay of dreams,"Everything was perfect from the moment we stepped into this hotel. Steeped in history, the building itself transports you to other eras and faraway lands, but that is carefully balanced by the staff’s approach, which is all about understated, contemporary, luxury without the fuss. Maria, Roksana, Francesco, Alban, Iza, Silvia, Estefania, Patricia, Carmen, Tolga, Nasera, thank you for your hospitality, you are assets to the hotel! 
We were travelling as a family of six, the logistics of which can often complicate things, but we felt at home and relaxed throughout our stay at The Kimpton Fitzroy. 
Beautifully decorated rooms, excellent service with attention to detail and where no ask was too much. The personalised amenities in the room were spot on for us and our children and made the stay even more special. Dinner and breakfast at Fitz’s brasserie was also excellent, delicious food and very attentive service.",5,2024,04,08
124,The best thing about this hotel is the location and the exterior.,"Hotel has unbeatable location in London as it is within walking distance to British Museum. The room is very tight (as expected), this is London. I would say this is smaller than the hotel rooms I stayed in while visiting New York City and Tokyo. The exterior of the building looks amazing and so is the common areas/restaurants. But the hallways and the rooms are dated. The noise is a problem if the room is above the event venue. We have to complain multiple times to be offered an alternate room. If noise is an issue, then you may not want to take your chances. Even though we were eventually offered a different room, it is quite an unpleasant experience to move as we were exhausted after the journey across the Atlantic. The hotel has an interesting elevator system that was not explained to us. Another guest helped us with the elevator.

There was a plate of cut fruit in our room when we returned to our room with a note to apologize for the inconvenience. I appreciated the gesture, but the fruit was not good so we did not finish the fruit. The plate with the leftover fruit then stayed there for the next 3 nights (even with room service).

The bar on the ground floor is quite nice.",3,2024,04,07
124,Fabulous London hotel,"I would like to give this hotel 6 stars out of 5 - such a lovely experience staying here. My husband and I stayed twice (once in December 2023, and again in April 2024). The service from staff on both occasions was impeccable - making us feel welcome, whether at reception, in the bar or elsewhere and being courteous and friendly at every step. The rooms are spotless, the bed comfortable, the bathrooms clean and spacious. Would highly recommend and will definitely stay again.",5,2024,04,04
124,Love this hotel! Great service.,"This has been my fifth stay at The Kimpton Fitzroy London and I will keep coming back. Wonderful hotel. My latest stay was with from friends for a special Birthday, and Patricia in management helped us when there were some issues with our room. We ended up in an incredible room and it made the trip even more memorable. Looking forward to my next stay!",5,2024,04,02
124,Amazing Experience!,"The staff at the Kimpton was absolutely wonderful.  They consistently went above and beyond to make our stay thoroughly enjoyable.  We had told the Guest Services team (Roksana was fantastic!) it was our 11 year anniversary and when we arrived they had placed rose petals on our bed, left a handwritten note, there was a heart shaped balloon in our room, and they gave us a celebratory cupcake.  Amazing!  
They assisted us by booking a car service to pick us up from the airport, helped us hail a cab anytime we needed one,  and provided incredible recommendations on places to visit and eat.  They made our entire trip to London an amazing experience.  
The room was beautiful and the food was excellent.  We will absolutely be staying here again!",5,2024,04,01
124,Look no further,"This hotel is beautiful! And the staff is equal. Well located, comfortable beds, free breakfast & helpful concierge team awaits. The cocktail lounge was inventive and fun. The building is gorgeous! Close to everything. We very much enjoyed our stay.",5,2024,04,01
124,Outstanding combination of all the things that matter,"Great location directly across from Russell Square Park, short walk to underground and Covent Gardens, beautiful hotel, friendly and helpful staff, knowledgeable concierge, comfortable beds, great view, clean and organized guestrooms.l",5,2024,03,31
124,"Great hotel, great staff","Stunning hotel, exterior and interior. Very friendly, really helpful staff. Pricy but you get what you pay. Well situated for tourist, 5 minutes away from The British Museum. Easy 30 minute stroll to Covent Garden, Leicester Square, Oxford Street etc. 200 steps to nearest Tube station (Russell Street). Would stay again.",5,2024,03,28
124,Kimpton Fitzroy Guest Services is simply THE BEST!,"The Guest Services of the Kimpton Fitzroy,specifically Jack and Angela,we’re fantastic in assisting me in ordering up some “Birthday Goodies“ for our daughter, who is visiting London for the week for her birthday… They both represented the high-quality of service, professionalism, politeness,assistance ,and efficiency that the Fitzroy stands for… Not only is it a gorgeous hotel with beautiful rooms, but all the staff, especially Guest Services, are SECOND to NONE in making your travels and all related items, so much easier and pleasant… Hats off to their “GOLD GLOVE “service that was done with genuine care and concern …These days when services and quality is not quite what it use to be,the Kimpton Fitzroy is a major exception to the excellence we all use to receive and expected…The Kimpton Fitzroy is a must stay for all travelers who are looking for the BEST….👍
Michael M",5,2024,03,28
124,"2nd stay at Fitzroy, others will come soon","For my wife's birthday, I had carefully prepared our (second) 3 nights stay at the Kimpton FITZROY (we've been KIMPTON maniacs since 2018): during its important preparation, Roksana provided me with unparalleled and friendly assistance. In such a way, I already expected great surprises: it was even better !
As Diamond Elite member, we are pleasantly welcomed (almost) every time in  IHG hotels, KIMPTON is at the top, more friendly and less posh than many other 5 stars ones but this time exceeded my expectations !!!
What a lovely suite, just in the middle of the authentic façade: romantic , small lounge with fireplace, lovely room with 4-poster bed, incredible bathroom.. The bouquet of flowers and the kindly offered cake accompanied by a purposely handwritten nice little note made all the difference and moved my wife.
For sure, we will come back again, but I wonder how they will do better :) !
More than words, memories bear witness to an unforgettable stay.
Thank you Roksana and your lovely team !
JP & BB",5,2024,03,27
124,Certain Staff Make this Hotel a Traveler's Haven,"I often stay at this hotel due to the excellent customer service.  Certain staff have been very attentive to make this stay wonderful.  I would like to compliment Kadjol (spelling) at the front desk, who worked with me to identify a room that would meet my needs for my week stay. Patricia H., front desk manager, was amazing.  Due to a toddler with an upset stomach on a 9 hour flight, my clothing had extra surprises on it when I deplaned.  When I asked Patricia where I could go to launder my stained and stinky trousers, she told me to give them to her, and she would take care of them.  They were in my room later that day clean and fresh without Toddler upchuck!  Ruairi was very generous in helping me with the processing of papers. 

I was surprised, however, that I was charged full price for one of the nights since I was in a room with so many needed maintenance issues that I was unable to sleep.  Due to a running toilet, I had to take a sleeping pill to be able to sleep through it since I had an important business meeting the next day (they were coming to fix it the next day).  The maintenance guy who came to my room at 10 p.m. to see what he could do in the short term was fabulous. He said, since it would take an hour to fix, he would try a short term fix since I could hear it running through a closed bathroom door.  He said to call downstairs if his short term fix did not work. Alas, it did not.  When I called downstairs to report its running two hours later (after midnight on Monday, 25 March) so I could get on the maintenance man's schedule the next day, the gentleman at the front desk was rude and dismissive.  When I said  I was calling to report a running toilet so it could be fixed the next day, he said, ""What do you expect me to do?"" I explained I was told to report it if it continued. I had to ask if another room might be available that night in case the sleeping pill I took to block the sound did not work.  Rather than offering solutions, he was short and clipped, indicating I was annoying him when I was the one who could not sleep.

In the middle of the same night, a substantial 5 foot by 3 foot panel fell off the front of the radiator with such a thud that that sleeping pill was pointless.  I reported these and two other smaller issues to the front desk the next morning as I dragged my sleep-deprived body to my meeting.  When I returned Kadjol, greeted me to let me know she personally checked that the maintenance issues had been addressed.  A very different response from her late night colleague.",4,2024,03,26
124,Poor breakfast experience.,"The hotel seems confused is it a formal 5* or informal, the hotel looks grand and stunning yet many of the staff are informal wearing trainers or casual clothes, this looks at odds with what the hotel’s trying to be. (All staff polite & helpful) As an IHG platinum member I was greeted and offered a drinks voucher or points. Sadly no upgrades available, I overheard the person checking in next to me being offered free breakfast as there was no upgrade but I wasn’t offered this, I later enquired and got this. Thankfully breakfast was free as it was uninspiring with items advertised not on the hot buffet. On the Sunday everyone had to wait for breakfast due to a large wedding and staff then tried to steer everyone to a the buffet rather than offering specials off the menu. The coffee bar was closed as they had the staff helping cleaning in the restaurant on the Sunday morning. I would recommend this hotel for a tourist type visit to London however I would sadly recommend eating elsewhere. 
The social was pleasant and we engaged with people from various parts of the World exchanging experiences and recommendations for things to do in London.",3,2024,03,25
124,Business trip,"Lottie was amazing! My luggage never arrived. She helped me get some basic things I needed. She also changed my room for me without any hesitation after I expressed my dislike over the bed, size of the room and how far it was from the lift. She's been very accommodating and helpful! ",5,2024,03,23
124,Business in London ,"I stayed during a business trip to London. The hotel is amazing!
I loved the attention to detail, service and really comfortable rooms. The amenities were lovely,  and it was a joy to enjoy a pot of tea in my room.  Breakfast is excellent and the hidden bar is a must! Really worthwhile visit.

Jack S was amazing! Really great service and so helpful. ",5,2024,03,22
124,A suite stay!,"We stayed at the Kimpton Fitzroy for the second time in November, this time we chose to try one of the suites as we were celebrating my partners birthday. The room was absolutely fantastic and incredibly well appointed. We were overlooking the park which although is a great view note its also on the main road. I was amazed to be presented with a bottle of champagne 10 mins after we arrived in the room which was for us to celebrate the birthday boy. What a really nice touch! All of the staff were really friendly and the hotel is so well presented. It’s still one of our favourites.",5,2024,03,22
124,Classy hotel with beautiful atmosphere,This is a very classy hotel with beautiful decor and welcoming staff. I highly recommend. Try out the cocktail bar and it's interesting drink selection. I was told on the last day that the architect was the same one that designed the banquet hall in the Titanic and that the restaurant is themed the same way. There is also a statute in a staircase on 2nd floor that had an identicle one in the Titanic. This is interesting to check out.,5,2024,03,22
124,Beautiful hotel,"This is a glorious hotel. The common areas, staircase and restaurant are beautifully decorated. The location, 15 minutes walk from Kingscross and Covent Garden is excellent. The service was excellent, rooms were quiet and the addition of a bottle of Prosecco and cake sent to our room for our birthdays was a lovely touch. Highly recommended.",5,2024,03,22
124,A sanctuary in a great location,This place is fantastic. The staff is friendly and helpful. Of particular note was the wonderful doorman Abdu who was always helpful getting what we needed (like complimentary umbrellas when it was raining). The bar is also amazing and the food was spectacular.,5,2024,03,19
124,Old World Elegance with a Modern Sensibility in the Heart of London,"The place is extraordinary - literally you walk in and feel like you are in a European Palace - sumptuous old world elegance paired with curated rooms that are thoroughly modern yet timeless in their appeal and function.  All combined with a staff that is polite, well-trained and unobtrusive.",5,2024,03,18
124,Treat Yourself to Opulence,"My wife and I travel quite a bit, and the Kimpton Fitzroy in London is one of the nicest properties we have stayed with.  The accommodations are luxurious, the staff exceptional, and the food was divine.  From the initial check-in, to assisting us with a rental car on our departure, we were absolutely indulged.  Ruairi, the Head Concierge, made us mere peasants feel like royalty.",5,2024,03,15
124,Fantastic,"Absolutely fabulous stay at the Kimpton. It was my daughters 21st birthday. The hotel was amazing, the staff really made us all feel very special, with huge attention to detail and tailoring the experience to our family.

Would highly, highly recommend it!!!

Thank you to all the Kimpton staff for making it so memorable",5,2024,03,14
124,So glad we chose this hotel for our special occasion,"So welcoming ….from the second we reached the entrance until we said goodbye.  We celebrated our silver wedding anniversary during our stay and staff made it extra special for us…. Room upgrade, chocolates, Prosecco and a balloon …. Couldn’t have asked for more.   The room was amazing - very quiet and sooo comfortable. The Fitz bar had a great atmosphere and drink prices were not inflated so we stayed for longer than we would normally.  Breakfast was delicious - especially the omelette.  Overall exceeded our expectations … .and they were pretty high to start with !",5,2024,03,13
124,Beautiful & Amazing Hotel! ,"This hotel is unforgettably amazing! You are greeted by very friendly doormen as soon as you arrive and taken to the friendly front desk agents. The check in was quick but personable. We were then met by Angela who walked us to our room and made us feel so welcomed. She wanted to make our stay special and she definitely went above and beyond with this! The concierge staff are great. We had the help of Marco and he ensured we were taken care of and had a lot of great recommendations. The breakfast buffet was delicious with a lot of great options. The design of the hotel is one of the nicest I've ever seen, very luxurious! The gym is large and has a lot of machines and space. The bedrooms are great, amazing shower and the beds super comfortable. We are already planning our next stay and highly recommend it to anyone going to London!",5,2024,03,12
124,All show no substance,"The building is stunning as well as a lot of the interior from the cocktail bar to the coffee shop. They went to extra trouble to give us some wine and a desert to share for our anniversary. Also the petals on the bed were a nice touch. The staff at the reception were pleasant as was guest services. 

Unfortunately it’s a little all show and no substance. Our room looked nice but the bed and pillows were very uncomfortable. The shower door opens outwards which means you can’t lay a towel to put your feet on as it pushes out of the way when the door is opened. The toilet is in a tiny space and the toilet paper almost at floor level. Another issue for us was the foot wear of many of the staff (bell hops and doormen). Fine to wear trainers as I imagine they are on their feet a lot but bright white ones? They looked so at odds with uniforms and really brought the tone of the place down. The doormen were very casual too and just didn’t make you feel like you were going into a nice establishment.",3,2024,03,10
124,A stunning hotel near everything!,"The Kimpton Fitzroy is stunning architecturally.  The rooms are perfectly laid out for the business traveler or vacationer.  The staff is incredibly friendly and helpful.

The Fitzroy is just across Russell Square from the British Museum and near great shopping and amazing restaurants (although the food at the Fitzroy is amazing as well).

Breakfast is fantastic and there is a wine and beer reception every night from 5-6.  The staff had excellent recommendations for restaurants and activities.  

It is in the center of everything and the adjacent underground connects to London Heathrow.

Although all of them were great, I specifically want to thank one of the luggage porters, Jason, for being extra helpful and welcoming.",5,2024,03,10
124,Excellent stay from check-in to departure,"Carlos was fabulous to work with at check-in.  He took the extra time to help me arrange a room with a tub after I had  fallen asleep on a flight and awoke a human pretzel, Ana kept my room immaculate - the restaurant staff was always welcoming and efficient & the gentlemen at the entrance were always on sight with a kind word, umbrella or directions.   Gorgeous Architecture,  extremely convenient location - perfect for a  conference at UCL and exploring the British Museum.  Will definitely stay with them again the next time I am in London.  The hotel is lovely and their team is flawless.  ",5,2024,03,10
124,Amazing!,"Had a wonderful stay at the Kimpton for my sister’s 30th Birthday celebrations. 

The hotel its self is absolutely stunning and everything is immaculately clean. 

The bar is great in the evening I’d recommend to book a table in advance as it can get busy especially on the weekends. 

Special mention to Roksana in guest relations who organised a wonderful display in the room prior to check in and couldn’t have been more helpful. 

Will certainly be back.",5,2024,03,09
124,GREAT STAY!,"This is my review I wrote on another site:

The hotel, staff, food, and drinks were all top-notch.  The wine at social hour is always a nice Kimpton touch.  The only reason I am not giving this a 5 star rating is because every morning I’d wake up with a sore back.  It was something with the bed (maybe it was almost too soft?).  I just couldn’t get comfortable.  

The food a the restaurant, Fitz’s, was really good as well as the bar at Fitz’s - it had a old bar/pub feel to it and the live music made it better. 

The hotel is 2mins from the Russell Square station. My favorite part about this hotel is it seemed to be more in a residential-type area, meaning we didn’t see many tourists.",5,2024,03,08
124,Excellent Hotel,"Well appointed, central location but quiet, Kimpton Fitzroy checks the boxes. Many times you enter a beautiful lobby to find lackluster accommodations- not here!  Spacious very clean rooms. A stones throw from the British Museum. Very friendly and helpful staff. Will be back for sure!",5,2024,03,06
124,Excellent in every way,"We stayed at the hotel for ten days and have only great things to say about it. The location is unbeatable: most major attractions in London are within walking distance. The room was comfortable and immaculate: big soft bed and pillows, soft carpet, clean bathroom, you name it. And everything was kept the same way until the very last day by the housekeeping staff. The architecture of the hotel itself is beautiful as well, reminiscent of Victorian times, with very tasteful interior design. The breakfast buffet was plentiful and varied, too. Last but definitely not least, the staff treated us very warmly and respectfully. They were all so kind throughout our stay, catering to all our needs and enquiries. Out of all the members of the staff, Elliott definitely stood out. He was very friendly, helpful and made us feel really welcome. His recommendations were on point. He’s all around a good lad.",5,2024,03,05
124,Not quite a five star hotel . . .,"The hotel looks beautiful. The lobby is spectacular, our bedroom was very stylish and all the interiors spaces are beautifully designed. Also, the birthday cake and champagne for my husband were a very lovely touch. But there is a lot of style over service. For example, we arrived late afternoon, it was chucking it down outside and we wanted to relax with a quiet drink. Fitz's bar doesn't open till 5. The cafe is independent of the hotel and was full of students working on laptops. There is a lovely bar and restaurant off the lobby, but it wasn't staffed even though you could walk in and sit down. We decided to get a bottle of wine from the cafe and drink it in there. While we were there at least half a dozen other couples walked in and then walked out again because the bar wasn't open. Early evening we went for a drink in Fitz's. Fortunately it wasn't busy. Later on, it was rammed. If you had been staying at the hotel and wanted to sit in the cocktail bar past 8pm you wouldn't have been able to get a table which is ridiculous. This is a five star hotel. You should always be able to get a table in the bar of a five star hotel when you are paying to stay there. But again, we discovered Fitz's is run independently of the hotel and open to anyone. Hotel guests, it seems, play second fiddle. Yes, you can book but the point is, you shouldn't have to. And if you are going to make one bar open to anyone, then keep the other bar and restaurant just for guests. We were told this space is only used for events. WHY??? We never saw anyone but staff in there for the duration of our stay. Also, the service in Fitz's is painfully slow, and our server in the brasserie verged on rude, they were so brusque. Unfortunately, all of this makes if feel far less than five star. But it's easily fixed. Open up the other bar and restaurant and make it an exclusive space for residents. Oh, and three members of staff just hanging about the lobby watched me try to carry a full wine cooler and two glasses from the cafe to the bar and not one offered to help. Not five star service. Sort it out!",4,2024,03,05
124,Great hotel to stay for business,"Excellent service, probably the most friendly and welcoming hotel that I have stayed in at London so far for business. Convenient location right next to the Russell Square tube station and near tons of eating spots since it's so close to UCL. The location and hotel layout made me feel safe. The doormen remembered me during my stay and were extra friendly, especially Ivar (he is the best!). Thank you for the amazing stay.",5,2024,03,05
124,Unforgettable experience,"As soon as we got to the hotel we were welcomed with open arms. All staff was excellent, especially Jack S. He was so helpful. Myself and my fiancée Aine felt like we were at home it was such a great experience. I would like to thank all staff and look forward to having some more wonderful experiences in such a special place.",5,2024,03,03
124,Simply fabulous,"My daughter and I have just had the best time in London mainly due to the fabulous Kimpton Fitzroy ! Such a beautiful hotel , warm , immaculate the best staff ! Friendly professional and kind nothing was too much trouble ! We will definitely be back thank you .",5,2024,03,03
124,A WONDERFUL WEEKEND,"Had a wonderful stay at the Kimpton with my husband, daughter & her fiance. It was our wedding anniversary and it was made special by Rokshana in Guest Relations.

The breakfast was amazing, we had to wait as it was busy on the Sunday morning however they gave us coffee & pastries while we waited, so no issue at all

Restaurant staff were very friendly and helpful

The beds and the linen were amazing, it was luxury, could have stayed in bed all day !!

No complaints at all - and looking forward to our next stay

Thanks to you all again",5,2024,03,01
124,Spectacular Hotel that Appeals to All!,The Kimpton Fitzroy is a fantastic place to stay in London. It is located in Bloomsbury near the British Museum and Covent Garden.  It is also very close to the Russell Square Tube station. We loved everything from the delicious breakfast to the luxurious rooms to the friendly staff.  Our family enjoyed every minute of our stay.  A very special part of the Kimpton is the doorman Abdul who was always so welcoming and friendly.  He had a great sense of humor and was able to connect to everyone he interacted with.  He even attempted to teach my teenage son how to whistle like a pro! Thank you Kimpton Fitzroy for making our trip to London the very best.,5,2024,02,29
124,Incredible Kindness with Kids!,"My family stayed here this past summer and absolutely loved our visit. But this is a somewhat different review. As the staff welcomed my son, they gave him a dragon stuffy named ""Lucky George"" - a nod to one of the most famous sculptures featured in the hotel. After never having cared for a stuffy to date, Lucky George became my son's inseparable companion traveling with us through London, Ireland, Scotland, and back home to Colorado where he has been presented at school and is THE fixture at bedtime. We have come close to losing this fine fellow a few times (as so happens with kids). So, we wrote the Kimpton Fitzroy to ask ever so nicely if they would consider sending us a spare to have just in case we get in a pickle. Their response was just so incredible - they got right back to us and connected us with Jack Powell in guest services, who personally and quickly sought to putting another Lucky George in the post to make sure that this forever friend is never truly lost for our son. 

It's one thing to have a great stay, it's quite another to have a heartwarming experience that sticks with you long after you've departed. If I could give them 6 stars I would!",5,2024,02,27
124,Work trip,"Just had a wonderful 7 night stay here. I did need to upgrade to a larger room as I needed to work from my room. 

Staff were very welcoming and exceptional all round. Just ask and they will help.

The hotel makes a big contribution to the area as well, it's an architectural masterpiece that needed love and care.",5,2024,02,27
124,Amazing 50th stay !,"Amazing 50th stay ! 
We arrived and were welcomed amazingly well. 
We were given an early arrival entry to our room too! 
Upon arrival in my room , I was greeted with a bottle of champagne , cake and a balloon! 
I was blown away !!
I believe this was arranged via Jack Powell in guest relations as my independent travel agent had liased with him prior to my arrival . A professional feel ! 
We absolutely loved the Fitz bar and Carlos made us two amazing cocktails ! The ambiance in the bar was stunning !
We will certainly be back . This was a certainly a birthday to remember ! 
Thank you to all staff at the Fitzroy .",5,2024,02,26
124,Beautiful Hotel,"Just returned from a 2 night stay … it’s a very good hotel … all the staff are really friendly and happy to help. Plenty of lifts we never waited more than a min or so . The room as other guests have mentioned was a tad small but functional every amenity for a comfortable stay. Only 2 negatives to mention, queue for the breakfast on Sunday morning was a 20 min wait .. unfortunately we had a train to catch and didn’t anticipate such a long wait to be seated so had to give it a miss. Also queue for the bar Saturday night ?? Never had to stand in line to access a bar just for a drink !? It is prob open to the public but feel guests should have priority access  we have stayed in many hotels over the years and this was a first? so again we didn’t  need a drink bad enough to stand waiting to be let into the bar so gave up on it . All in all we really enjoyed our trip and will definitely use this hotel again .",5,2024,02,25
124,Fab one night stay,"Fab hotel.

On arrival - in the pouring rain - my bags were taken and I was shown to reception. My room was fabulous and a really good size for London.

The Kimpton is situated on Russell.Square and the tube a few minutes around the corner. 4 stops and I was in the West End. On a nicer day, I'd probably have walked it.

Breakfast had plenty of choice, hot and cold and great coffee!! 

I'd highly recommend this hotel. Staff were friendly and efficient and its a beautiful building and great location.",5,2024,02,24
124,An architectural gem in the heart on London,"The Kimpton Fitzroy Hotel exceeded our expectations. The hotel was designed by Charles Fitzroy Doll in  1900. The sumptuous architectural design is beautifully preserved while the guest rooms have been updated with all the latest modern conveniences. There is so much history embedded in the hotel. The architect also designed interiors in the Titanic. The main restaurant of the hotel is almost identical to the one on the Titanic. 

We requested an early check-in as our flight got us into London quite early in the morning. Lottie at the front desk did everything possible to make a room available for us. Thanks so much Lottie! All the staff was incredibly helpful and attentive to our needs.

The location is fantastic...just a few minutes walk from The British Museum and other lesser known attractions such as The Foundling Museum, The John Soane House and Museum, and The Charles Dickens residence and museum. 

There are great restaurants within walking distance. The concierge gave us terrific recommendations which we thoroughly enjoyed.",5,2024,02,23
124,Disappointed,"Disappointed to be completely honest , building is amazing from the outside. 

Booked for a valentines treat and expected better for a 5 star hotel 

Staff were friendly at check in 

Staff didn’t look smart wearing trainers and un ironed tops. 

Breakfast was absolutely shocking ! Food is better quality at premier inn , was all cold , it had been sat there for ages as it had all dried up. Staff barely said a word to us 

All areas of the hotel are clean and I expected to pay the price for central London and valentines night but the food quality and service from staff massively let it down.",3,2024,02,23
124,A memorable stay,"My daughter and I stayed at the Kimpton as it was the only 4 star hotel near the Neurological Hospital, where my husband had an operation. The Kimpton certainly knows how to relax two very stressed people and made our stay wonderful. I was initially skeptical as I have an arthritic knee and cannot climb the steep stairs at the front. But those same steep stairs disappear as by magic, revealing a lift, activated by an ever friendly doorman. The other staff were just as friendly!",5,2024,02,23
124,Birthday treat at The Kimpton,"Been meaning to write a review for ages!
we stayed at The Kimpton back in January for my 30th birthday and it was incredible!
My partner emailed back and fourth with Jack from guest relations and he set up balloons, treats and a bottle of bubbles to surprise me. The entire stay was out of this world. Looking forward to the next milestone bday so we have an excuse to come back to The Kimpton!",5,2024,02,21
124,The WONDERFUL Kimpton Fitzroy Hotel.,"Dear Jack, 
We had a truly wonderful time at the Kimpton Fitzroy Hotel.  From the moment we walked in, to the warm welcome of your staff. Our room was BEAUTIFUL the food delicious and right throughout our stay, your staff were amazing! Which made our stay all the more  special. A big shout for Roksava...

Thank you. x",5,2024,02,19
124,Abdu - courteous and hospitable greeter!,"Stayed at the Kimpton in London, nice stay. It was really nice being greeted by Abdu on our way in and out, very courteous, friendly, and professional! Greeters are the first interaction with the hotel, so it is always nice to kick this off with professional and warm welcome.",5,2024,02,16
124,Short Trip To London,"Great hotel all around, decor, staff, and hospitality. Everyone we met was extremely friendly and helpful from the moment we arrived until we departed. Special mentions to Abdu, Rory & Carlos. We will be back next time we are in London. 

Thank you for the hospitality.",5,2024,02,16
124,A great and memorable stay in Kimpton Fitzroy London!,"To be honest, we have checked through Kimpton's review for months and were skeptical of the property after reading many negative reviews on the hotel staff, theft experience, and room size from other travelers. However, my stay was the exact opposite of what I had read online! 

First off, the hotel is located right off Russell Square station, which is on the Piccadilly Line, which you can access directly from Heathrow Airport. We arrived early at the property around 10:30 am and were greeted warmly at the entrance. The hotel staff offered to carry our luggage up the stairs into the property. 

Dorrine at the reception who was handling our check-in was super helpful. She recognized my Platinum Elite status and offered the complimentary upgrade to the Queen Premium room from our original Queen Essential room. She also offered us coffee at the in-house Café Burr & Co while getting our room ready. Not long after, the room was ready at about 11 am when the official check-in time was 3 pm. That is greatly appreciated as we just came off a 14-hour flight. 

Elliot who handled our luggage brought it up to our room and even gave a simple introduction of the room's amenities and ensured that whatever we need can be brought up with just a call to the housekeeping. That greatly assured us.  

The room is exactly like the pictures. Size is decent for a couple. We have 2 big luggage and a small cabin size and the floor area is big enough to open them up and also store them. The room is clean and well-provided. Drinks and snacks are refillable at any time.

The only downside I would say is that the lifts to the hotel rooms are not secured enough as the lifts are easily accessible even without a key card to the rooms. There are plenty of staff in the lobby though but would not hurt to have an extra security measure!

Also last but not least, we left a piece of our newly brought branded T-shirt in the toilet as we checked out, quickly realized and emailed it in and thankfully the hotel housekeeping team managed to find it and reported it! We are super thankful to the team and services received during the trip making it a memorable engagement stay in London for us both. I recommend this hotel to anyone looking to stay in Central London. 

PS/ Pictures are taken from hotel property and not owned by me as it is a pity I did not take any photos during my stay.",5,2024,02,16
124,Relaxed luxury,"Relaxed and indulgent.
Stunning building with lots to look at. The basic room is very small but fitted out beautifully with luxurious feeling bed. Nice toiletries, tea selection, proper coffee machine and a few treats in the room. The bar is indulgent with a cute ‘secret’ cocktail menu. Staff are as attentive as you would expect in a top London hotel, but relaxed and friendly.",5,2024,02,13
124,5 Star Service!,"The hotel was stunning and the service was top notch. The concierge at the hotel really made the trip for me as a solo traveller. Sean was super helpful with restaurant recommendations and tips for around the city. It was great to have a friendly and familiar face at the hotel each evening to answer any questions. Highly recommend this hotel to anyone, especially solo travelers. Be sure to say hello to Sean!!",5,2024,02,11
124,Beautiful Luxury in The West End,"Beautiful, QUIET hotel in London’s West End. On Russell Square, the hotel is convenient to the theaters, LSE, and the Thames for sightseeing. Abdu at the front door is incredible. He greets you warmly and remembers you, checking on you frequently in the lobby. Concierge Marco is top notch and will handle all your questions and needs.",5,2024,02,09
124,"Beautiful hotel, wonderful staff","Firstly, the staff here are AMAZING! So welcoming, friendly, approachable, polite and warm. I will come back for the staff alone, but also because this is a stunningly beautiful hotel with excellent attention to detail. Everything smells wonderful, it’s clean and the building is exquisite - this has been a wonderful stay and I will definitely be #keepingitkimpton whenever I stay in London now. 10/10",5,2024,02,09
124,"There is still a little bit of regret, but overall it is highly recommended.","Enjoy an unforgettable birthday trip at here. The suite was one of my favorite in the UK. The room was very nicely displayed with a great view facing the park.Thecomplimentary minibar was plentiful and was replenished daily. Entertainment in the room was plentiful and the bluetooth speakers had great sound quality, but it was a shame to learn that the system was still being upgraded resulting in the TV not being able to chromecast or airplay.The bathroom was also very tastefully decorated, and the smell of the toiletries was very pleasing. The staff was very friendly and even had recommendations for food around the hotel. The lobby décor and elevator were clearly designed to emulate a classic feel. The location of the hotel is also great, with the metro station downstairs and the train station close by, making it very easy to commute. The only downside was the apparent lack of staff at breakfast as well as the really bad taste. Would much recommend the brunch option outside on the street.",5,2024,02,07
124,"Greta hotel, great staff, great location","It was my first time staying here, it will not be my last. The hotel is in a fantastic location and you have so much of the city within walking distance. Public transport options are nearby.
The hotel itself is very nicely decorated and the room quality is very high. But the main thing that makes it great would be the care and attention the staff show you. Everyone was extremely helpful and cordial. When you travel a lot it’s nice to stay in a place where you feel a natural welcome. From the doorman, the reception staff, the uphouse staff and the bar staff, you will be made feel at home and they will make sure that you are able to relax and enjoy both the hotel and the city.",5,2024,02,06
124,Had a lovely stay,"Super friendly receptionist she helped us very good gave an upgrade and gave us an wonderfull explanation

124,An amazing stay in the heart of London,"Where to start...
From the communication before arrival and up to the check out this was one of our most amazing stays in London.
The Fitzroy is a beautiful hotel with amazing rooms and very forthcoming staff.
I recommend this hotel very much",5,2024,01,31
124,Amazing Stay!,"My daughter and I stayed for 3 nights while traveling. Everything was perfect! The room was clean, the food was delicious, and the staff were very friendly and helpful. This is our second stay here and we will definitely stay again the next time we’re in London.",5,2024,01,27
124,Impolite staff! Not up to standard.,"Impolite and incompetent. 

Whilst staying at the hotel, we (family) went to the bar. First, we were asked for ID’s despite clearly not being minors - and had both picture of copies of passport and university ID’s which were deemed unacceptable. Also, all of-age adolescents were accompanied by the parents. Throughout these interactions the staff was impolite and nonchalant. Several other staff members were not helpful, and simply standing around without offering help. The wait was also very long. 

On a different occasion we went back to the bar. Before having gone down we had called reception to make a reservation but were told this was unnecessary and to just walk in. Once we were there, we were turned away because it was full, and had to have made a reservation. We were then given a wait of 30 minutes. 

Will not be going back.",1,2024,01,27
124,"Excellent hotel, recommended and will return!","Excellent hotel, well appointed room which was spotless. Lovely toiletries and good selection of room snacks!

Simple, efficient, check in and the staff were polite and helpful. Hotel well located for Central London business or holiday.

Not cheap, but the quality fits the price.....keep an eye out for deals!",5,2024,01,27
124,A real treat to stay here,"Literally next to Russell Square station and overlooking the park this Impressive and imposingly beautiful hotel is an excellent class hotel.

We stayed for 1 night only for the Elvis Exhibition at London Arches and was very lucky to have the room early by 11:30am.

Quick check in and helpful and attentive staff, meant we were in our room in no time. The cleanliness was another level, a beautifully appointed room with gorgeous comfy large bed with wide range of pillows. Fragrance from it's custom incense burner lingering, there is a large TV with interactive menu information. Large wardrobe with safe and mini bar. Coffee machine and digital radio...even an in room yoga mat. 

The bathroom was large with high end complimentary toiletries and a rain fall shower. Obviously there is room service and amenities you can borrow from the hotel should you need it.

Now we did not use the spa or gym so cannot comment. We sampled the mirror ballroom cocktail lounge and the restaurant and both are recommended. The hotel also had a free drink in the lounge for guests betwee 5-7pm where you get 1 free alcoholic or soft drink which was very nice.

I believe the snacks in the room were complimentary but not sure so I left them - couldn't find a price. Not sure on the mini bar prices either. They even gave us a nice note and 4 chocolates for mine and my girlfriends 21 year anniversary - a really nice touch.",5,2024,01,26
124,Wonderful hotel and amazing staff,"This is a  gorgeous five star hotel in London, the location is great, room very clean and confortable.

124,Excellent hotel with incredible service!,"Truly an enchanting experience in and of itself, the Kimpton Fitzroy is a hotel that creates a lasting impression on guests. Located in a prime spot in London and beautiful inside and out the Kimpton offers comfort, charm, beauty, and excellent service. I have been fortunate enough to stay at the Kimpton twice and each time I’m always impressed by the top-notch service the Kimpton offers to their guests. As a guest you feel welcomed, cared for, and important; qualities which set the Kimpton Fitzroy apart! The Kimpton is full of history and sights to see, my personal favorite being lucky George on the second floor! 

The service at the Kimpton is truly amazing, specifically their concierge team who make your stay even more memorable. Marco in particular has been so helpful throughout both of my stays and has amazing recommendations! Whether it be restaurants, shows, or various sights to see, each recommendation and the aid he has given us to be able to experience these recommendations, has helped to create lasting memories of my time exploring London. Marco is attentive, enthusiastic, caring, and always ready to assist guests and offer excellent recommendations and personable conversation! My family and I have felt so cared for because of his help, care, and guidance on the best ways to navigate such a beautiful place like London. 

It is beyond evident that the staff at the Kimpton Fitzroy truly love what they do and desire to treat their guests with warmth and quality service. I will be recommending this hotel to whoever I can and it is without a doubt one of London’s gems.",5,2024,01,25

124,High on London,"The staff all around was very helpful. Especially,Diorca Renu Tolga. The food in the various resturants and bar were wonderful. The king canopy bed  felt marvelous, fantistic bedding. Maybe it was the playful throw pillows .
The  bathroom was a nice size. It had high-end touches such as gleaming marble tiling and a spacious vanity  but the real highlight was the walk-in shower, great water pressure, with  one of the best rainfall showerheads I've ever had . With plush towels, a great robe and slippers and I was beyond comfortable.All this made our 5 night stay forgettable!",5,2024,01,22
124,Kimpton Fitzroy 10/10,"I had a wonderful stay at the Kimpton whilst working at a university in the area. The hotel is elegant inside and out, has friendly and helpful staff and a good range of food and drink options.

124,Great hotel stay in London,"Great hotel stay in London. Great location, super helpful staff and amazing snacks in the room! Lotti on reception was so helpful, honestly went out of her way to help with my bookings even when they were last minute. Alejandra, Peter and Ivania were all so helpful when we had any questions or needed help out with our 8 bags that weighed way too much to carry down all the steps into a taxi! Jack at the nightly drinks/social hour provided exceptional service and was always happy to go above and beyond. He was more than willing to help with any questions we had and was so lovely to chat to.
 
As a Dimond Ambassador this hotel is honestly one of the best hotels in London, I will definitely for sure stay again when I am in London! They made sure I got all my benefits and the Hotel just has an amazing vibe!",5,2024,01,20
124,Kimpton Fitz Joy! Everyone was so upbeat and welcoming!,"Wow! We loved our stay here! Our room was cozy, the doormen, concierge and receptionists were so kind, friendly and helpful!

124,Luxury life at the Kimpton - all Thanks to the Staff,"We were celebrating a 21st birthday when we visited London over the weekend in the first week of January. All I can say is that it was perfect, the staff were accommodating and approachable and made our experience one to remember.

The room was amazing! I would also like to personally thank Angela, who took the time to decorate the room for the occasion, it looked amazing and made the visit and celebration extra special. Angela made the Birthday decorations extremely easy to organize through email conversation and took extra care and time to assemble and personalize them in a way that made it really special.

Thank you all.",5,2024,01,17
124,A Memorable Stay & Exceptional service!!!,"My Huband and I visited here for our wedding anniversary, upon check in we were welcomed by Doreen, who was friendly and helpful. Doreen provided a host of information, informing us of 'social hour' and assisted us with early check-in and a complementary room upgrade. 

Upon entering our room, it took our breath away. The room was large, with great views overlooking Russel Square, we took time to really take in the true quality of all the room's 5 star features. 

After settling in, we made our way down to the hotel bar and restaurant for the 'social hour' before we head out for our dinner. We was served by a young lady who was new to the guest relations team, sorry we did not catch her name, she was friendly and asked about our stay. 

Upon our return from dinner, we received a surprise in our room from the guest relation team. Roksana & Jack made the effort and arranged us the amenities, the sentimental part for us was the light up message board with wishes and a hand written message on card. It was a really personal touch, I really can't tell you how much we appreciated your arrangements it was priceless and truly heartfelt. Thank you very much to Roksana and Jack. We had the opportunity to meet Jack on our departure, to express our gratitude in person, he is professional and made sure we had an unforgettable stay. 

This was a perfect stay for our wedding anniversary, we can't think of anything better. We will never forget this experience and the exceptional customer service of the team. We are already planning our return visit, to bring our parents with us to experience this truly 5 star hospitality.",5,2024,01,16
124,The best stay ever,"The best hotel stay we have had in a long time. Perfect staff, stunning hotel, amazing cocktails. Can’t wait to return. The beds are so comfortable and room so beautifully decorated, we barely wanted to leave! Brilliant location very close to tube station too!",5,2024,01,16
124,A hotel considered a landmark in London,"I could feel British here and there of the hotel, the overall condition of the hotel was very clean, and all staff were always smiling, friendly and professional. It's also conveniently located for access to many of London's attractions.
Only one disappointing is that the breakfast was not excellent as I expected even though it's still good.
I would definitely stay at the Kimpton Fitzroy Hotel London again the next time I visit London.",5,2024,01,15
124,Great five star hotel in Bloomsbury area London,I loved this hotel. The concierge and overall service was phenomenal. The rooms/whole hotel have recently been redone. I loved the decor. I walked to many places from their and they have a tube station at the next block. I used that as well. Their bar Fitz's has a great atmosphere for drinks in the evening.,5,2024,01,13
124,Wonderful Hospitality Experience!,"I really loved my stay at the Kimpton Fitzroy in London! 

I have stayed at this hotel for over 30 years. The new owners of this historic hotel have spared no expense on the renovation, and it shows. Everything is top notch. Comfortable clean rooms with excellent high-grade finishes. Amazing beds and fine linens. 

Great dining options with Burr & Co restaurant, that served an excellent full English breakfast, plus a buffet style breakfast. Sadly, no English smoked Kippers though. I happen to love smoked Kippers. 

I would like to commend the waitstaff at Burr & Co. Especially the young Polish/Scottish girl who waited tables. I am sorry but I can't place her name. The restaurant on Jan 3rd was full, and it seemed short staffed. I think because another restaurant at the hotel was undergoing a renovation. However, this young woman was keeping all her customers very happy. I have not seen a waiter work that hard in many years. I have owned and operated my own restaurants in NYC, so I speak from some experience. This young woman was a real professional and deserves a small bonus from mgmt. Perhaps a nice complimentary meal for her and a friend at the hotel. 

All the staff in the hotel were wonderful. Carlos and Sophia (from County Clare, Ireland) at the front desk made for a warm stay. Carlos remembered my name after the moment we met. As mentioned, I used to own and operate several restaurants in NYC. I taught my own staff, that remembering a customer's name, was a very important part of hospitality. Addressing your guests/customers by their name, makes everyone feel welcome and at home.

The Burr & Co dining room manager Christina was very friendly and showed us around the hotel, while also explaining the history of the hotel. Sean Keenan the concierge (from Kildare, Ireland) is a pro and gave us great dining recommendations. Ciao Bella, a few streets away from the hotel, was one of Sean's recommendations. It is a great casual Italian dining spot.

Overall, I can't recommend this hotel enough. Centrally located, impeccably clean, reasonably priced (for London) and a very friendly professional great staff!

I can't wait to stay in this hotel again on my next visit to London! 

Tip: Make sure you take advantage of the hotel's restaurant and bar. Each were designed by the same designer who designed the Titanic.",5,2024,01,11
124,Quality and Very Good Service,"Very helpful staff and good facilities. Room was very clean and comfortable, well stocked bathroom. I liked having breakfast in Burr's and then choices for lunch and dinner. Had not thought about dinner on New Years eve and round up ordering room service as no other options in the vicinity; service was quick and meal fine. Hotel is well located and very convenient with a tube station right around the corner; Piccadilly Line, so a straight shot to Heathrow with no connections.",5,2024,01,10
124,Short and sweet- great stay,"I had a one night stay here at this lovely hotel.

I had read great reviews about this hotel, and they surpassed my expectations!

The moment I stepped out of my taxi, people were waiting to take my luggage.

You walk in and the place smells like a spa (really gutted there wasn't one)

All the staff were so friendly, Angela from guest relations was so lovely and really welcoming in the lobby.

The room was beautiful and the bed was so comfortable! The bathroom was incredible, something you would see in the movies. Breakfast was delicious and I would highly recommend. 

I would definitely stay here again!!!",5,2024,01,10
124,"Tiny room, sub-par service","First, the rooms are the smallest I have ever experienced in a hotel of this caliber in London.  It is not a good place for business travelers as  - other than a minuscule table that is already crowded with a coffee maker and clock - there is no place to work or eat.  Room service must be placed on and eaten on the bed.  Nice bathroom and tub, though, and it is by far the best feature of the room.  Service is sketchy.  People are nice but unprofessional.  I ordered room service the night before, placing the card on the door with the order at 10 pm.  It was never picked up, therefore never delivered.  The phone in my room was malfunctioning so it was hard to hear anyone on the other end and disconnected several times mid-call.   For a KIMPTON, it was so disappointing.   They need to do better.",2,2024,01,10
124,Fabulous hotel,"What an absolutely outstanding hotel. THIS is how you train your staff - warm, courteous friendly service, nothing was too much trouble. From the lovely doorman who met us to the wider door team inside, the friendly reception staff and front of house in both the cafe and the bar, and the wonderful Diego @ Fitz’s who did the hotel proud with his extensive knowledge of the building and it’s fascinating history, this was 5* service with real warmth. Even sharing a lift with staff where staring at the floor is the norm for most of us Brits (!)), staff were lovely and chatty without being intrusive. Haroom and Patricia went out of their way to upgrade us after a minor tv problem, thank you for being so helpful and generous. Yes you’ll pay the premium to stay here but if you’re investing the money then this is the payback. Stunning building and decor, great drinks list ( Fitz’s bar is gorgeous), cosy, modern and well-amenitied room before the upgrade, and the bigger room was just beautiful. Big bathroom and deep bath too. Thank you Kimpton Fitzroy - you have a hotel to be proud of!",5,2024,01,09
124,Excellent ,"Actually The pillows are the fluffiest I had on my trip in Uk , my family and I was very comftable and happy , we had new year’s eve dinner it was amazing ; the hotel is wonderful and all the staff is so nice. 🫶🏻",5,2024,01,08
124,Wonderful stay at the Kimpton Fitzroy.,"Amazing hotel, first class service from when we arrived to when we left. We were greeted at reception by the lovely Shoana who checked us in and she was so kind and welcoming. The room was perfect for us as a small family of 3 and the beds were the comfiest we have ever stayed in. A special mention also to Angela who was very kind to our little boy and ensured we had everything we needed. We will certainly be coming back again and would highly recommend this hotel. ",5,2024,01,07
124,Unforgettable Experience,"I recently stayed in Kimpton Fitzroy London for 16 days during the Xmas & new year break and the experience was fantastic. It looks absolutely stunning, tho that's not surprising anymore knowing its original designer is as well the designer of the dining room on RMS Titanic. Located in Russell Square, Oxford Street and The British Museum are within walking distances. There's also Piccadilly line nearby which makes it super convenient to travel to anywhere in the city. All the staff members are soooo nice, from the concierge to the f&b department, but I really wanna thank Lottie, Carlos, and Sohana at the reception for helping me so much during the stay (especially thanks to Lottie for helping my mom when she had low blood sugar on the last day of 2023). Also, thanks to Jack and Angela for the welcome snack (it was so good!) and the heartwarming handwritten card.  All in all, everything was great and I look forward to staying here again in the future!",5,2024,01,06
124,5 star luxury with exceptional staff,"This hotel is indeed 5 star luxury. Situated on a   square close to London Euston station, it’s opulent and has wonderful facilities. Staff are exceptional. Room was small but was a single. Breakfast was outstanding. All in all a perfect stay.",5,2024,01,05
124,ELEGENT HOTEL WITH EXCELLENT MASS TRANSPORTATION CONNECTIONS,"This is the perfect hotel while visiting London. The Russell Square underground is right around the corner and there are many bus routes within a block or two of the hotel. Perfect for sightseeing in London. 
After a tiring overnight flight,  we were greeted in the lobby by  Angela, guest relations. What a welcoming smile and delightful personality she had. The hot chocolate she offered was great. 
Unfortunately, British Airways made a mistake in our room arrangements. Haroon WENT ABOVE AND BEYOND to fix their mistake. My regret is we ""took it out on him,"" a mistake on our part. He was patient and kind and offered us a substitution that resolved the problem. Thank you, Haroon.
Definitely consider this magnificent hotel, you will have pictures and stories to share with family and friends.",5,2024,01,04
124,Wonderful holiday in London!,"I chose the Kimpton Fitzroy for my first visit to London: Christmas Eve through New Year's Eve 2023. Could not have been happier. The stunning entrance area alone was worth the stay (adding photos) - I felt very at home for the holidays.' 

The room was a bit smallish but adequate, and the bathroom remodel was great. One tip for the hotel - raise the bed up just a bit for a more luxe look.  It seemed terribly low and looked a bit old-fashioned. 

The staff was amazing at every turn, and the breakfast was not to be missed! There is an overwhelming variety of options and lovely, warm staff.  

I should also mention the location - it seemed like we were close to everything. There is a tube station right around the corner (with direct access to Harrod's),  but you can walk to Covent Garden, Picadilly, the Strand (a bit further).  

I 100% recommend the Kimpton Fitzroy! 
",5,2024,01,04
124,Near Flawless Stay,"Almost flawless stay.  After some wrangling, room was upgraded to junior suite as Diamond member.  Although the queen rooms are indeed small, even the junior suites are fantastic.  Gorgeous room, insanely comfortable bed, fantastic bathroom. Note windows to balcony do not open.

Service was EXCEPTIONAL.  ALWAYS.   And I contacted the front desk and room service and the concierge ALL THE TIME.  I was there for six or seven nights, including New Years weekend, and I do not have a single service complaint.   

I would stay here again in a heartbeat.",5,2024,01,04
124,Amazing staff - great location!,6 night stay at the Fitzroy was a real vacation.  Although the rooms are on the small side - the friendliness and helpful staff more than make up for that factor.  Bathrooms are clean and fresh - and the daily room cleaning was thorough and done very well.  Location is literally around the corner from the Russel Square tube stop which is a huge convenience.,5,2024,01,02
124,Highly recommend ,"We had a wonderful stay right before Christmas. The valet, concierge, and front desk were very attentive. The location was ideal. The room was spacious and well appointed. We had dinner one night at the restaurant. It was delicious! ",5,2023,12,30
124,Trip,"Very nice, cozy hotel, friendly staff and great check-out with the help of Lottie🫶our family got the upgrade, for quite and charming rooms, very clean, water free of charge! We recommend it for the short trip to London.",5,2023,12,30
124,Wonderful experience for a solo stay,"The Kimpton Fitzroy London is one of the BEST hotels I have stayed in within the IHG group. As an individual who travels a lot for work, staying in hotels solo can often be an anxiety-induced experience. That is not the case here. From the second I walked through the front doors, it was a welcoming and relaxing experience.

The single room was perfect for a solo traveller and had all the amenities you could need.

Staff from the concierge, front of house and cleaning team were so friendly. I felt at home right away.
The concierge team was even lovely enough to escort me to the bar for the social hour, making sure to introduce me to the bar staff and ensure that I was seated comfortably.
Dinner in the restaurant was the same.
I cannot fault my stay and have booked to stay again in 2024.

124,"Lovely visit, would definitely return!","The customer service I received at the Kimpton was outstanding! I don’t typically require much during standard hotel visits but the Kimpton was excellent at meeting my unusual needs during this 6-night stay. First and foremost I reached out to concierge for planning assistance. Sean Keenan was truly amazing! So helpful, so thorough and extremely patient, many thanks to Sean! Our email correspondence continued for over 1 month, (maybe 2-3!), prior to our vacation. And then we had a phone call 1 week before our arrival to finalize a few details. 

I had questions in various areas snd everything was answered and taken care of exactly as we needed. The #1 issue I had was arranging car service back to the hotel late on a Saturday night after our visit out to Warner Bros. He also made and re-made several lunch and dinner reservations, offered recommendations for activities or to book tickets for our excursions, and clearly outlined exactly where we were coming and going so we felt comfortable heading out. Sean was also an onsite multi-tasker when we saw him assist in other areas of the hotel as well (group luggage organizing and “arranging” for a Santa group dinner visit on Christmas). A few of Sean’s colleagues, Joseph, Adrian and Jason, also pitched in with a smile when Sean wasn’t available. 

I also want to commend and thank the late night reception team lead by Aman, along with Irfan, who helped with kindness and compassion when I had issue with my unwell and jet-lagged young adult family members. Dealing with a nervous mom under normal circumstances isn’t easy, and during the middle of the night, it can be even more challenging. But they, along with room service, assisted with utmost care and helped resolve our issues. 

The restaurant, Galvin, was on overflow for breakfast during our holiday visit so it was tough on that team. I was pleased to see that my simple request of baguette bread which I was told was all out, miraculously appeared when an extra team member heard my dilemma. We had a pleasant, but somewhat slow dinner there. Thanks to them as well. 

Location of Kimpton was excellent. We could walk many places including meals and west end shows. Doormen were courteous and help retrieving taxis for us too. The rooms weren’t huge but very functional. I especially liked their hand and body lotion :). Should my plans bring me back to London someday, I wouldn’t hesitate to return to Kimpton.",5,2023,12,27
124,Beautiful hotel and amazing staff in guest relations,"I stayed overnight and planned a proposal for my girlfriend. The help I received from Angela Kwandahor in guest relations was outstanding and she really made the experience extra special.  She went the extra mile to make the stay memorable for a lifetime. Beautiful hotel, beautiful suite and amazing staff. Couldnt recommend more.",5,2023,12,27
124,Amazing ,"We stayed at the Kimpton in mid-December to celebrate my 40th birthday and we had an amazing experience. 

The hotel is decorated beautifully for Christmas, and feels very festive at this time of year. 

We stayed in a suite for 2 nights, which was beautifully appointed and immaculately clean; with a marble bathroom, large and comfy bed and a sitting room.  

The hospitality was great. We were met at check in by Angela, who had been in touch with my husband before we arrived to discuss how the hotel could help mark my birthday.  In the room, Angela had arranged some treats (including  flowers, chocolate dipped strawberries, and fizz, along with a birthday card). They did everything they could to help us mark the occasion. 

The food offering was good - a plentiful breakfast, which can also be arranged in the room, and we had cocktails in the Grill - which were great. 

A top experience, which we would definitely recommend ",4,2023,12,27
124,Great hospitality experience,"I came today to celebrate Christmas time, and the experience was fully wonderful. Great drinks especially Burnt Ice, but what made it so special was service provided by the team. Massive thanks to Regina, Tommy, Diego and Hadrien for making this evening so special! Hopefully see you soon!",5,2023,12,24
124,A favourite in London,Beautiful hotel made even better by amazingly friendly staff at every turn.  Nothing is ever too much effort for them.  Rooms are nice and clean - not necessarily always the biggest rooms but for a central London 5* hotel it’s definitely the norm compared to others I have stayed in ,5,2023,12,24
124,Passport stolen from inside room…be very careful,"My passport and other documents were stolen From inside the room!!!! No help from management, no follow up, and when we asked that they show us CCTV footage “thr CCTV was down the three days of my stay”, it’s an INSIDE JOB. Never had my passport stolen over 300 international trips…..the hotel’s silence on all my follow ups is proof that thr hotel was involved. They know who I am and can contact me if they actually want to help!",1,2023,12,24
124,The Best Anniversary ever !,"The Best Anniversary ever !
We came he celebrate our wedding anniversary.
We were so gently and  very professionally treated.
We love the hotel because of its location : walking distance of everything but quiet, facing the park.
The difference (with other places I have been to in London ) : Everyone here is nice to you !
No « faux-pas », we will be back !",5,2023,12,24
124,A Bit of a Disappointing Experience,"I debated between 2 and 3 stars, and ultimately went with 3 as I did find the hotel to be clean and pleasant. However, this stay is what may have been the proverbial straw that pushes me to close out my IHG Premier card.

Let's start with the positives:
- the housekeeping team is very good. Aside from a dirty coffee cup, the room was very clean and they were efficient. 
- the building is beautiful and well decorated for the holidays
- some of the staff is very helpful/friendly
- social hour (5-6PM) was very nice and set in Galvin's Bar. Some bar snacks would have been appreciated!
- I appreciate the waters and ""tuck box"" which are nice to have after a long day.

Issues:
- With the card, you become a platinum IHG member. This includes things like a complimentary room upgrade (if available), early/late check-in/out (if available), and a welcome amenity. When I checked in, I wasn't acknowledged as a platinum member as is typically done. While I was able to check in early, I had to ask about the room upgrade to which I was told there were no rooms available. Strange, as I checked the website after I checked-in and there were available rooms. I called the front desk the next day and asked again - this time, the woman who helped me said this ""should not be a problem at all"" and within a few minutes found me a larger room. She asked if I preferred a higher floor room. Previously I requested a higher floor room and was originally placed on the first floor.
- I saw in another review a platinum member was greeted as such and offered a complimentary breakfast. Was this a welcome amenity? I don't know, because I wasn't offered one at time of check-in and given a choice of points or something else. I also didn't ask because I was tired of needing to chase something down that shouldn't need to be prompted.
- At check-in, I used the Kimpton password for the month and asked if they were using it. The woman briefly smiled and said yes and nothing more. ??? I let it go thinking she would later explain what it entailed. She never did, so I finally asked her - she said it was 1,000 reward points deposited into the account. Over a week later, I still haven't received said points.  
- All this indicates that service is uneven and I got unlucky with the woman who checked me in. But it also makes me think about how useful the card is for me - I don't want to need to continually chase these benefits in order to receive them. The same woman actually checked me out - again very pleasant, but I don't think she even asked how my stay was. Just said great you're all set, do you need a taxi?

Additional notes:
- the basic rooms are quite small. The measurements of the room are stated on the website, but for those who can't quite picture what that means it can be difficult. The basic queen had little room to move around. If you have a lot/big luggage this will be difficult for 2 people.
- There is a bar and restaurant on site, both of which we tried.

Overall, I was really looking forward to my stay, but am a bit disappointed. I travel to London a lot as I did postgrad not so far away and lived in the city briefly, so I come back often to visit friends. I'm always looking for my go-to hotel that will feel a little bit like home when I'm here. I think it's a nice property, but the service aspects needs some work.",3,2023,12,24
124,Best stay ever!,"
Stunning hotel with great service, l had forgotten to bring something so I called down to ask if there was a nearby shop I could go to -  instead, the item I needed was delivered to my room in a matter of minutes!!

All the staff are really friendly, especially Angela from guest relations, and the breakfast was delightful!!!",5,2023,12,23
124,Impeccable and great staff,"Sohana was excellent on arrival. She was Very friendly and couldn’t do enough to get my room sorted quickly and ensure I had an amazing stay in this hotel.

Hotel is perfect. In a great location aswell.

I was really pleased with the service and will definitely visit again.",5,2023,12,23
124,Wonderful ,"From the moment we pulled up everything was perfect. All the staff is amazing but Jack especially stood out. We were only initially going to stay for one night, but ended up booking additional night because of the service we received from him was so exceptional. On top of the that the beds are extra cozy:) . We will definitely be booking again the next time we’re in London.   ",5,2023,12,22
124,Stellar Stay at Kimpton ,what a beautiful hotel   makes me smile ever time I enter   and it feels like one big family here from the breakfast staff to the people in the cafe   and then there's the concierge staff    Marco Sean Joesph Ruairi Ben and the infamous Vito   If you ever get a chance seek out Vito he will make you laugh  Also cant forget Dorine at the front desk She makes it all work    ,5,2023,12,22
124,Great hotel with excellent customer service,This is a great hotel with great customer service. Unfortunately was unwell during the stay and the Marco the concierge couldn’t be more helpful or understanding. Thanks to all the staff at the Kimpton Fitzroy.,5,2023,12,22
124,Galvin Bar Experience 🍸,"I stayed at Kimpton Hotel for 4 days, obviously I couldn't miss having a drink at the bar, the host highly recommended it to me so that my first night I was served by Tony or Tommy, I don't remember his name very well, I only know that he is from South America. His service was excellent, he was friendly and polite at all times. I loved the Burnet Ice cocktail and that it was prepared by him.",4,2023,12,20
124,Our new favourite place to stay in London. ,"As a platinum IHG member, this is the first time we’ve stayed at the Kimpton Fitzroy, and it will definitely not be the last time!. Special thanks to Lottie who warmly welcomed us, arranged breakfast as a treat and a late check out due to our late train home today. Brilliant colleagues all round, in the Galvin for breakfast (your breakfast now trumps our previous favourite of the Hilton Park Lane), the chaps looking after the luggage, the lovely touch from the room team who’d lovingly refolded clothes we’d left out.  Quiet, peaceful, warm and welcoming, and a perfect location - easy enough to stroll in from Euston, and always a great wander down through Bloomsbury and into Covent Garden in ten minutes. ",5,2023,12,20
124,What a gem😊,"Warm welcome after long journey!
This is a clean, quality hotel with a nice atmosphere. Great staff to welcome you. Sohana was amazing throughout the stay and was kind to us.Comfortable bed. Fab breakfasts. Near to station and town to explore.
Thank you Sohana will come back...❤️",5,2023,12,20
124,"Wow, what can I say!","The Kimpton Fitzroy is such a beautiful hotel and the staff make it extra special. 

Upon arrival there was a lovely man who met me and escorted me to reception. The check-in process was very quick,  from there another gentleman kindly took my bags and escorted me to my room.

Prior to my stay, I was in touch with Angela from guest relations she was amazing- nothing was too much trouble.

When I arrived in my room, there were the most lovely personalised amenities from Jack and the guest relations team, which was so thoughtful. 

I would also like to say a big thank you to Kajol the guest relations manager -  the upgraded room was such a lovely surprise. 

Honestly, all the staff I came in contact with were so friendly and  helpful, they truly made my stay unforgettable. I would highly recommend this hotel and can't wait to come back!",5,2023,12,20
124,Wonderful birthday stay,Fantastic service by Kajol and the guest relations team to make our stay special. We were celebrating a birthday and so much attention to detail went into making the day extra special. Thank you. Other hotel standouts were the breakfast - fantastic selection in a lovely restaurant. ,5,2023,12,20
124,As good as it gets….,"Sophie and Lottie - THANK YOU
What you have enabled is beyond expectations - a ‘Christmas present’ was a phrase you used, but that falls so far short of the simply outstanding service.
Everything, and I mean everything, has been exceptional.",5,2023,12,19
124,Impressive hotel I keep returning to,"Another fantastic stay at The Kimpton, my preference when staying in London. Used the excellent gym again and had a lovely meal in the room for a change (normally explore but was tired). Lovely breakfast the next day also. One thing not often mentioned but is a factor for me returning again and again is how quiet it is during the evening/night. Some hotels are noisy (guests and traffic) and this might make sleeping harder but not in this hotel. Lottie on reception checked me in and also out the next morning and was super friendly and welcoming. I'll be back in 2024.",5,2023,12,19
124,Gorgeous Hotel with Great Staff,"We have stayed here a few times and always had a great experience.  The staff are always super courteous and friendly.  The room although a little small, was well decorated and welcoming.

A few niceties were glasses of prosecco in the afternoon and a welcome hour for free wine in the bar.

My only gripe was I would have expected more from breakfast.  I’m sure there must have been a change since my last visit.  Even though you have paid for breakfast, you have to pay for the likes of poached egg or avocado, which are on a separate menu, but cost less than the standard breakfast.  It just seemed odd, however, the scrambled eggs were very nice.

The Kimpton, just about pips it as our most favourite London hotel, it’s a lot more friendly and personable than the likes of the intercontinental.
",5,2023,12,18
124,Great hotel ,"Great hotel and great staff, especially Ludmilla, with whom I had check in and check out, both very smooth. Room was spacious, nice and clean. Location is perfect, central and close to the tube station",5,2023,12,16
124,Anniversary in London,"Wonderful experience at Kimpton Fitzroy. Front desk and concierge (thank you Abdu and Carlos) were super helpful, and entire staff made our stay memorable and enjoyable. We hope to be back soon, and highly recommend to others traveling to London. ",5,2023,12,15
124,Upgraded to amazing Fitzroy Suite,"On checking in I was upgraded to the Fitzroy Suite. I have never stayed in a room so beautiful before! 

This is my second time at this hotel and whilst it’s beautiful (obviously) what makes me want to always choose this hotel when staying in London is the people.

Everyone I encountered during my stay from front desk, concierge, bellman and waiting staff made me feel so welcome and they just seemed to GENUINELY love their job so I imagine their employers look after them very well.

I can’t imagine staying anywhere else now. I’ve been spoiled for other hotels! 

Thank you for such a lovely stay.",5,2023,12,15
124,A perfect stay at the Kimpton Fitzroy,Amazing stay at a beautiful hotel complimented with excellent staff. Angela the client relations manager went above & beyond to make our stay perfect. We will definitely be back again soon - 5 star service.,5,2023,12,14
124,The Kimpton was Amazing!,"I had an amazing time at the Kimpton. My sister was getting married the next day so we decided to stay over the night before. We arrived by taxi to the hotel, and was warmly greeted by the hotel porters as we stepped out of the taxi and were immediately relieved of our suitcases as they brought them into the hotel which was fabulous. 

The room was beautifully laid out with wonderful  luxurious beddings- We slept extremely well! In the morning we came down for breakfast which was truly first class! The breakfast was truly delicious, immaculately presented with  an array of wonderful fresh breads, pastries and continental delights. The staff were all friendly and helpful. We were given the option to order a hot full English breakfast from the hotels A la cart menu, which we tried and loved! We were very happy with the level of service we received from start to finish, honestly 5 star! We were greeted by Angela from guest relations! She was amazing, an absolute delight, ever so friendly and welcoming and went above and beyond to ensure we were happy during our stay which really added to our wonderful experience at the Kimpton. I look forward to my next stay!",5,2023,12,13

124,Amazing hotel in an amazing location!,"The kimpton Fitzroy is such an amazing hotel. This is my second time staying here. The staff is super friendly and accommodating. Also, the hotel has so many amenities. The rooms are very modern and comfortable. I also love the bars and restaurants in the hotel. Lastly, the location is super central but not too touristy. Ita right around the corner from a major tube station. I will definitely be returning!",5,2023,12,12
124,Trip to remember ,"Had a fantastic stay. Our rooms were amazing, the welcome from the team and the hotel taking the time to make our moms feel special during the trip was a delight.  The entire team was fantastic and a joy to interact with.  Abdu was engaging and a delight each day",5,2023,12,07

124,Incredible night at the Kimpton,"We stayed at the Kimpton the night we got married and the staff went above and beyond to make it a special occasion. From balloons in the room to a small cake and a bottle of champagne, everything was absolutely delightful and thoughtful. The hotel was festive and gorgeous and the room itself was luxurious, with lovely pillows, a comfortable bed, and incredible bathroom amenities. Thank you to the Kimpton for your incredible guest care and for making our day end on a high note!",5,2023,12,05
124,The hotel you don't wanna leave.,"Another stay af Fitzroy, London.
My fourth time at this beautiful hotel at Russell Sq and I just feel more and more at home.
The rooms are great and the staff is amazing with the very helpful Carlos in the front desk as one of the stars.
And the breakfast is just amazing with brilliant waiters, that are on top of everything, even if they are busy.
Only one thing: The breakfast was included in the price of my room. I can not understand, that you have to pay extra for some of the dishes like egg Benedict  or sandwiches with avocado and salmon. Is that a new thing?
Anyway - I am looking forward to be back in February. Merry Christmas.",5,2023,12,05
124,Festive Fitzroy for another perfect stay!,"I have stayed at the Fitzroy several times, and I have loved every single stay, short or long. This time, for just one night , I opted for a single city room. It was very cosy and comfortable. Located on the 6th floor, it was extremely quiet and perfect in every way. And it is far from being small, even if it is a single bed. The staff were all impeccable, the way they are at every visit. I had breakfast at Burr and Co. The breakfast buffet was delicious and savoury. Because we are getting closer to Christmas, the hotel was beautifully decorated, and there was even a hot chocolate bar! I look forward to going back for longer in January.",5,2023,12,02
124,"Jazzy, Upbeat Five-Star","I loved it. Solo traveler with only a carry on who stayed in one of the small single rooms. My room faced the inner courtyard—it was quiet and private. Slept well in cozy twin/full size bed with good linens. The room was luxe—loved the comforting color palate—and the bathroom was gorgeous (grey glossy subway tiles, mosaic tiles, black accents, and expensive hardware). Some reviews mention the sinks don’t drain well and I had this issue, too, but didn’t find it troublesome. The hotel itself is a jazzy, upbeat five-star with three buzzing, atmospheric restaurants and a grand lobby. Staff were solicitous and friendly. Felt great after a day out to come back to a grand hotel. Location is walkable to Marylebone, but a bit further from Mayfair/St.James.",5,2023,11,30
124,Oasis of luxurious comfort,"Kimpton Fitzroy exceeded all our expectations. The luxurious ambiance and the impeccable service made our experience truly memorable. Exceptional customer service. The staff went above and beyond to ensure our comfort and satisfaction. The welcoming messages melted our hearts  anf the home made, in house cake placed in the room where absolutely delicious.

124,"A great hotel, wonderful staff and help for those travelling with additional accessibility needs","My stays at Kimpton Fitzroy Hotel in London are truly exceptional, largely owing to the outstanding quality of the staff who assist me with my additional accessibility requirements with generosity and warmth.

From the moment I arrived, their warmth and genuine hospitality created an inviting atmosphere. 

The level of service was impeccable; every staff member went above and beyond to ensure my comfort and satisfaction. Their attentiveness, professionalism, and friendly demeanor made my experience truly memorable. 

The dedication of the Kimpton Fitzroy team to providing top-notch service significantly enhanced my stay, and I wholeheartedly commend them for their exceptional commitment to guest satisfaction.",5,2023,11,26
124,Our hotel of choice,"We stayed here for two nights and the stay was excellent.

The staff are all great. The room was well set out for an accessible room.

The only issue we had was that the key to operate the wheelchair lift had been taken by someone on a break and we had to wait a while for that. Fortunately my husband managed to walk up the stairs and two kind German guests carried his wheelchair up the stairs. I believe that the process for the keeping of the key has now changed. The hotel did give us drink to warm us up, after the debacle.

The breakfast staff were all excellent and the food has plenty of choices.

This is still our hotel of choice in London, despite the issue that we had.",4,2023,11,25
124,Posh and fluffy ,"I would say it’s like any other hotel, except it is not like every other hotel. 

1. I am impressed by the friendliness, readiness, helpfulness of the staff. It could look like a run down establishment and the staff made it worthwhile. 
2. But it is very luxurious looking hotel. Very beautiful architecture and looking at the mosaic tile work, paintings, smart elevator system, and chandeliers was an adventure of its own. 
3. Food was delicious, and there were two options to go within the hotel, a venue for events, and a night bar for mingling. 
4. It allows your companion, in my case, service dog from America, which many in the UK are not familiar with that meaning. And the concierge lined up as my service dog knows how to speak the words Hello and How Are You. They made me feel at ease, as if I lived there, and were very professional. 
*If you want your dog to come with you, this is the hotel to stay at. A park right across for walking and potty breaks for the pup.* subway close by, shopping centre, a lot of restaurants.
10/10 and I will hopefully be able make another trip in the future!

124,5* stay,"We had a lovely one night stay at the Kimpton for my birthday. We managed to check in our room early at 1130am which we were very grateful for. 

Our room was immaculately clean and the beds are very comfortable. They are tastefully decorated and have enough storage. You receive complimentary snacks which is a lovely touch. The hotel, despite being busy, was very quiet. We slept well. The hotel is brilliantly located - we enjoyed a slow walk back from the Dominion Theatre Saturday evening. The staff on reception were polite and accommodating. We didn’t have breakfast. 

To be very picky, the plugs next to the beds are a little annoying as they aren’t deep enough to fit in a standard plug, but they do have USB ports. 

A 5* stay for a reasonable price in central London.",5,2023,11,20
124,Family break!,"Jasmin, Ines, Angela and Jack were the loveliest members of staff that we came across. Everyone was wonderful but they went above and beyond to make us feel welcome. Thank you so much. Looking forward to visiting again!",5,2023,11,20
124,The Concierge Service is Top Notch,"The Doorman …Abdu treated us like family. Always making sure we had everything we needed and helped us get to where we needed to go. On our last night there, he was so kind to to take us and introduce us to an Arabic cuisine.  A venture we would have not done on our own. A night and an education we will never forget. The hotel was beautiful, however the service is what makes it stand apart from the many exquisite places we have been. Kudos to Abdu",5,2023,11,20
124,A lovely stay in a great location,"Well, I've never felt so pampered in a hotel before!  This will rate as one of the best hotel experiences I've ever had in my 7 decades of life.  I had three packages mailed here ahead of time and the staff had them waiting in my room upon arrival.  And at the end of a couple of days of walking for hours and hours, all I wanted to do was come back to the hotel and relax.  Food service one night (hand cut chips are heavenly) and Burr & Co the next.  I would definitely come back here again.

One practice that I wish this hotel would adopt (well, all hotels really) is the ability to opt out of housekeeping service.  I left the Do Not Disturb sign on my door but when I came back at the end of the day removed it and in the hour or so that I was downstairs eating housekeeping came in.  While it was lovely I always feel that it is ecologically unsound to change out all the towels and wash them.  It's really not necessary for someone staying only 2 nights.  I hadn't even used one of the sets.

Great location, close to buses and Underground.  And there's the lovely park across the street to sit and relax in.",5,2023,11,19
124,"Lovely staff, TINY rooms","I’m here for a conference and to visit the London office, so a stay of 5 days/4 nights.  Great location, but I’ve never booked a hotel in a major city for business and ended up with a twin bed!  The room is too tiny to set up a suitcase stand, and the closet is so small and filled with a safe and mini-fridge, so there is no way to hang a coat or dress fully.  They do include an ironing board, but since the wardrobe is slim and already filled, the ironing board is just leaning against the wall.  I mean, it’s kind of cool - you can pretend you’re a scullery maid or governess, but for 4 days of business?  No thanks!  I won’t be able to stay here again.",3,2023,11,15

124,Dissatisfied with lack of communication ,"The hotel is beautifully designed and clean, typical of other London hotels of this standard.   Rooms are tiny and although on arrival we were assured (which I have been told otherwise by the management) our room would be ready to get ready in for a wedding we attending at the hotel it was made ready only 10 minutes prior to our taxi arriving to go to the church in Knightsbridge, so myself and husband had to shower and change in mother of the brides room, not ideal for anyone.  The hotel insists they do not guarantee rooms being ready before 3pm and I get that but had we been told on arrival that our room definitely would not be ready then I would not be writing this review.. we did not return to the room until 12am after retrieving luggage from the brides mums room.. it was an expensive nights sleep and not the relaxing start to what was a beautiful day… that said all staff and food at wedding were excellent, breakfast very good too ",3,2023,11,09
124,A great nights stay! ,"A fantastic stay. Our room was spacious and well equipped. The staff were incredibly helpful, nothing was too much trouble and my daughter loved the mini popcorn maker!

124,40th Birthday Celebration RUINED.,"We booked the property, with our family, needing 2 rooms close to each other as we had our children sharing a room alone.

We went for my wifes 40th birthday.

We asked for adjacent or interconnecting rooms on the booking, we called ahead twice to remind the hotel.

We arrived and the rooms were nowhere near each other and they'd downgraded one of the rooms in an attempt just to get the rooms on the same floor.

We asked to see the rooms and they were VERY disappointing. Small, dingy and both had unpleasant odours.

Sophie the front of house manager couldn't provide any solutions.

We didn't even check in.

We walked out and booked the Rosewood in Holborn instead which is a FAR better hotel and thoroughly recommended as they were very accomodating and nothing was too much trouble for them.

AVOID.",1,2023,11,06

It’s a close walk to SoHo and other popular places. The hotel is grand and beautiful. The staff is so kind and offered to share the hotels history with us. The room was spacious enough and the bed was comfortable. The shower was okay. Not the best water pressure, but the hot water worked well. Room service food was decent, too. Overall, we’d happily stay here again.",5,2023,11,03
124,Front desk professionals,"All staff were warm, interested, and helpful. The front desk and especially Haroon Shahid have to be singled out for their wonderful attitude and attention to detail. From advice on getting around in London to help with the nightmare of a possible lost passport, Mr Shahid was outstanding in his personal warmth and professionalism. A marvelous hotel, a professional staff, and detail to guests’ needs. Thank you for the marvelous time.",5,2023,11,02
124,"Glorious hotel, perfect in every way!","Just got back from our second stay at this amazing hotel.  We love everything about it:  it's super clean, luxurious, beautiful, the service is second to none with every single member of staff going out of their way to be welcoming and friendly.  On this occasion we were celebrating a big anniversary and were completely spoiled by the hotel with Champagne, flowers and gifts!  Special thanks to Victoria and Angela in Guest Relations and to Cristina in Housekeeping.  If you want to treat yourself you can't do better than to book the Kimpton!  ",5,2023,10,28
124,Absolutely superb - true luxury.,"What can I say - had a wonderful 2 night stay in this truly luxurious hotel. The attention to detail is wonderful and the rooms were extremely well finished, comfortable and quiet. Very polite and attentive staff. The cocktail bar was wonderful - dimly lit and very atmospheric. Great location and not too far from a selection of convenient tube stations.",5,2023,10,26
124,Great experience ,The best service offered in all London IHG hotel. The room cleaning and turn down service is thoroughly done. Hotel staffs are all friendly and helpful. Much Better comprehensive service received than Intercontinental park lane,5,2023,10,26
124,Another Fab Fitzroy,My second time at this hotel and the staff and facility are amazing! The historic building in a beautiful and convenient (underground stop) neighborhood made it feel like home! I was lucky to receive a free upgrade and the attention to service in my room was the best I’ve had! I cannot wait to return!,5,2023,10,25
124,A great hotel is such a joy,"First class room, bedding, service, breakfast buffet (make sure it's included, it's so worth it). British Museum is so close that we went several times. Grateful to all the staff who helped us, especially Haroon and Jason as well as the breakfast room staff. Frankly, this was better than a week on a cruise. ",5,2023,10,25
124,Opulence at it's finest,"This hotel screams opulence! From the lovely greeting at the door to the rooms. The beds and linens are gorgeous as are the rooms. The staff was delightful. We utilized the gym which was fully stocked. It has treadmills, peloton bikes, weights and matts. We loved the bar and disco ball too!",5,2023,10,24
124,Nice stay with a couple improvement points,"Exceptionally beautiful hotel - the lobby, the bar, the cafe and the breakfast room - all beautiful. Our hotel room was also lovely and the beds were very comfortable. We also used the gym which for a hotel gym was quite good - nice equipment (technogym) and spacious. Two points of attention - breakfast room needs better managed - there were so many dirty tables that more guests could not be seated. Also dishes were not promptly cleaned for our table as we made use of the buffet. When you order an egg dish (or more) it comes on a super huge plate (!) and there's no room to place it on the table. Staff were nice but don't seem to really care about providing good service with keeping the place clean. The other point of attention is the water pressure in the shower - it is amazingly low. I am sure the hotel is saving lots of money on water, it was a pretty shower, but not nice given you could hardly get the shampoo out of your hair. All in all we liked the hotel but there is room to improve.",4,2023,10,24
124,"Great staff, gorgeous hotel but a little disappointed","I'm so bummed because I really loved the Kimpton up until my last night there. The room was gorgeous and comfy, all the staff were wonderful and welcoming. My issue is that there was a large event (maybe a wedding) on my last night at the hotel and I had a 4am pick up with a day full of travel the next day. The music from the wedding was so loud that I could clearly hear it in my 6th floor room. When I called the front desk to ask when it may end, the answer was 11pm. The front desk person seemed shocked that I could hear it but wasn't able to help or offer any remedies. There was no one at the front desk or lobby when I was waiting for car pick up the next morning either. I have written to Kimpton twice and heard nothing back about this and just feel really disappointed. ",3,2023,10,18
124,Absolutely magnificent ,"From the moment we arrived everything was perfect- the best bedding - fluffiest pillows- great breakfast with wonderful service-
Best of all we met Jack who couldn't be more helpful! He helped us in a few tight situations making our London stay an extremely memorable time- we hope to see the Kimpton Fitzroy again in the near future-",5,2023,10,17
124,Gorgeous hotel with exceptional staff,The most gorgeous hotel with a staff of exceptional quality.  Every staff member we encountered was “over the top” when it came to friendliness & helpfulness. I highly recommend staying at the Kimpton Fitzroy when in London.  ,5,2023,10,17
124,My new home whilst in London!,"I spent about a week and half at the Kimpton Fitzroy in October and it was the most lovely stay!  As a Kimpton Inner Circle and IHG Diamond Elite, I'm pretty familiar with their properties in the US and I've been dying to visit the London location ever since they opened (it was fun to get a preview of their rooms during ""Top Chef: World All-Stars"").  

They were nearly at full capacity, hosting a notable American sports organization, but the Guest Services Manager, Kajol, allowed me to use my milestone reward for a suite upgrade.  There initially some issues to make this happen, but Kajol worked her magic. The suite was absolutely gorgeous and the bathroom was the most beautiful bathroom I've ever seen in a hotel.  This upgrade totally made my stay!  

The entire staff was incredibly warm and personable.  From the morning chats with Abdu and Yusef on the hotel steps, to the daily greetings from Jack, Ben and Yuan.  

Daily breakfasts at Gavins were also enjoyable.  The food was great, with a nice variety.  It was a bit warm in there and I hoped they could open more windows, but regardless, it was always a good meal.  The staff was very attentive and helpful, even when it was a full house!

I also grabbed drinks at Fitz's on Saturday night, which had the coolest decor.  I loved the loungey vibe and our server was very sweet, as well.

Marco at the concierge desk was also a massive resource and made two incredible recommendations.  As a James Bond aficionado, he suggested martinis at Dukes, which was really fun.  To cap off the trip, I wanted a special spot for Italian food.  He handled all the research and called for reservations.  We had dinner at Locanda Locatelli, which was the best meal of the whole trip!

The only hiccup was my server at Burr & Co.   I had a late dinner on my first night and she seemed a bit out of sorts.  She was nice, but it took her 10 mins to get my drink, she forgot about my first course and she closed out my tab before I could order dessert.  I noticed other guests were having issues with her, as well, like waiting a long time for their bill and later having to fix some of her errors.  She was a hot mess, but thankfully she was overshadowed by the rest of the experience.  

I cannot wait to visit the Fitzroy again!  It truly felt like my home away from home.  Highly recommend!

124,Eusif is the best ,We enjoyed our stay at the Kimpton. The wooden keys are a nice touch. Smoked Caesar salad was amazing. Eusif was the best Door Man we’ve encountered in a long time! Eusif should be promoted. He was nothing but attentive and kind.,4,2023,10,12
124,Home away from Home,"A beautiful hotel in a super convenient location in the heart of London.

My stay was excellent!  I was lucky enough to meet Kajol, the Guest Relations Manager, at check in, and we had a lovely conversation that made the beginning of my stay memorable.  

Rooms were fantastic, although wish I could have had a bigger one!  Bathroom was gorgeous and spotless, but again wish it was bigger.  The service was what is expected of a Five Star.  Breakfast at the main restaurant was delicious as well.

Honestly hard to find any faults, well okay, you can get a room that is a long walk from the lifts!  Still its a huge hotel, so you can't have everything!

The Bar has to be checked out, super chic.

A hotel I will continue to stay at, as long as I can afford it!

Bravo!

124,Superb central London hotel,Stayed here when attending a 2 day corporate event last week. This hotel is stunning for a Central London hotel. Room was spacious and very comfortable. Food was excellent. Service was superb. Great central location and stunning decor. Will return and would recommend.,5,2023,09,30
124,"Very nice, but small room","I stayed in the single twin room. The room was very nice, but also incredibly small. The location was nice. It’s across the street from a cute little square with a garden. 

I only stayed one night, so I didn’t mind the size of the room. However, it would have felt small for a longer trip. 

It was pretty easy to walk to Covenant Garden and other tourist sites.",4,2023,09,28
124,A magic and lovely vacation,"We checked into the KF on August 30th and stayed for 5 days. The Kimpton did not disappoint. We had a room that overlooked Russell Square. Occasionally, we'd hear police sirens, but amazingly, never once heard a door close or heard other guests. The room was very comfortable, great linens and decor and we'd sleep restfully every night of our stay. We loved the central London location and walkable locations - i.e. the British Museum, Seven Dials, Neals Yard. I loved being in Russell Square people-watching or enjoying a gelato at the darling Caffe Tropea. Breakfast was included in our stay and was a really nice treat with a good selection of juices, fruit, croissants, coffee/tea, and typical breakfast foods for those who enjoy those (eggs, baked beans, et cetera). The staff were always friendly and helpful. I would not hesitate to recommend the Kimpton Fitzroy for its lovely, old-world elegance and dedication to making their guests comfortable and welcome. I hope I can go back soon!",5,2023,09,26
124,Staying at the Klimpton Fitzroy was a treat!,"The Klimpton Fitzroy is a gorgeous hotel that effortlessly blends classic design with contemluxury.  The main rooms and staircases are elegant and there are romantic books for enjoying a cozy cocktail.  The bed was comfortable and  the room attractive and the amenities of nice quality.  If you stay, do try to have dinner in the grill - the chef is special (I hope Klimpton can hold onto the chef!). We will plan to stay again at the Fitzroy the next time we are in London.  It is wonderfully convenient to The British Museum, too.  Perfect London hotel.",5,2023,09,25
124,Fitzroy dream,"A beautiful hotel with amazing staff in an excellent location, so close to ( 10-15 minute walk ) all the main shopping and restaurants in central London. 
Can’t wait to return. The whole staff from check in to bar staff ,  cleaning staff to the wonderful breakfast team will make your stay so memorable.",5,2023,09,25
124,Nice but uncomfortable,"Nicely renovated hotel, classy fittings and good service.  Even though we had a queen room it was very small.  No space for our luggage, tiny wardrobe for 2 people, and no space to work from.  Not great for a business hotel.  Overall an uncomfortable experience.",3,2023,09,23
124,Classy hotel with lovely rooms and lounges,"We stayed for three days while enjoying London.  We had coffee at the cafe on the morning and enjoyed the lounge at night fir drinks.  The common areas are lovely and worth enjoying while staying there.  Our room was very classy, looked newly upgraded, and very quiet. The staff was very helpful and polite.  We would stay there again.",5,2023,09,20
124,5 Star Service and accommodation. ,"I have stayed at The Kimpton Fitzroy probably 6 times now and the reason I return is for the welcome starting with the door people including Amar. The breakfast is very satisfying with fruit, yogurts etc and the best cooked to order Full English. Thank you to Fedro and Lena for looking after me each morning. Jack, Customer relations was attentive and always was interested in my day as all the other staff I engaged with. Maintenance fixed a water problem I had in the bathroom within 15 mins. Thank you Mick, sometimes in hotels I have visited previously I have had to prompt a visit from maintenance. 
The hotel is like staying in a 1920 or 1930’s stylish haven. Expensive but highly recommended as it is luxury in every way. ",5,2023,09,20
124,Sweet Suite,"The Kimpton Fitzroy is a large, elegant, and historic hotel located in the heart of London.  Just a few steps away from the Russell Square Underground station,  you can catch the tube for a short ride to the West End theater district, Soho, Chinatown, or to Westminster.  The British Museum is a few blocks away.  And if you fit, the Theater District is a 20 minute flat walk from the hotel.

This hotel was build in 1912 and was designed by the architect who designed the main dining room of the Titanic.  So you will find elegant mosaics on the floor, stunning marble columns, and dramatic staircases.  The ""Lucky George' dragon statue is found on the 2nd floor staircase: it's twin is still on the Titanic.

We splurged on a suite overlooking Russell Square and the room was fabulous.   A separate living space is a great idea when one spouse is trying to sleep after a 10 hour flight while the other is wide awake at 3am.  Our four poster bed was extremely comfortable.   A special shoutout goes to the amazing walk-in shower with a strong flow of hot water. 

Galvin's restaurant on the ground floor serves high quality food in an attractive setting plus a breakfast buffet.  The informal Burr and Co shop actually has the same prices for ala cart items,  so my recommendation is to select Galvin's for a quieter experience.   The cocktail lounge is a stunning environment featuring a large disco ball hanging from the ceiling.

Kimpton's feature at hosted social hour with complementary wine and beer.  This one was disappointing, poorly attended, and tucked away in a far corner of Burr and Co.

The Kimpton Fitzroy is a splurge,  but absolutely enjoyable.

124,Amazing Hotel with an Awesome Doorman.,"I sumbled onto this hotel in January 2023, walking around the neighborhood. I'm so glad I took time to walk in and take a look. It's jaw-dropping beautiful. The staff is amazing, especially Ammar, the doorman. He greeted  us with a big smile and took out bags up the stairs. Normally, people in his position are polite, but most don't seem to enjoy what they do. Ammar does. 

We had a beautiful small suite that was stunning We visit London often, so we'll definitely be staying there again. ",5,2023,09,13
124,Very good stay with a few negatives.,"Stayed in a city single with a bathroom that was almost as big as the bedroom. I think most just have a shower. The bedroom was about as small as I would want to stay in, but it was well furnished and equipped. The city single rate was fairly reasonable for central London post Covid, unlike the larger rooms.

The main negative was the air con, which could only be set to a minimum of 19 degrees, no lower. I don't think it ever actually achieved 19 either, as it was continually running my whole stay, I think.

The fairly heavy duvet was unsuitable for the weather, and I wound up using the dressing gown as a makeshift sheet. 

The main hotel was excellent and service very good with a real five-star feel. Breakfast was also very good. I'm not sure the DJ on Friday evening/night really fits in with the traditional feel of the hotel.

Fitz's bar was rather dark with a jazz club feel I thought. It seemed rather busy and I only looked in.

The very close Brunswick Centre  is excellent for shopping to stock up on supplies.

I'd definitely stay here again but probably in a larger room and then only if the rate improved.",4,2023,09,10
124,Amazing stay and great personnel ,"Beautiful hotel with nicely appointed comfortable rooms and amenities. The breakfast choices are not bad at all for a London Hotel; plenty to choose from. 
Thank you Mr. Hussein from front office for your professionalism and amazing customer service. I would also like to highlight two superstars who made my stay extra memorable; Mr. Youssef and Mr. Ammar; great hoteliers with a bright future ahead. Keep up the great work and spirit! 
See you soon! ",5,2023,09,06
124,"The Fitzroy's fit, but Jack had my back!","The Kimpton Fitzroy London is a magnificent hotel, and I'm so happy we chose it for the weekend I proposed to my fiancée. The amenities are aplenty. The staff is out of this world, and the rooms are perfect. Old charm, with modern touches, it's practically perfect. My only gripe was the bar on the main floor closed shortly after midnight and on a Saturday night to boot. Which is kind of when the party begins, isn't it? But the main reason I'm writing this review is the magnificent job that Guest Relations did in helping me surprise my fiancée. After a London Eye surprise proposal and a trip to the Darjeeling Express, we arrived back at the hotel, where a surprise had been laid. Led by the incomparable and kind Jack Powell, while we were out having the biggest adventure of our lives, the team carefully moved all of our belongings from our modest room, into one of their largest and most luxurious suites. They left a bottle of prosecco, gifts, and an assortment of desserts for us to celebrate. Jack also ensured that our room and bed were covered in rose petals for an extra touch of romance. Before our departure, Jack made sure to make time for us to meet with him and share our experience, he was lovely. Jack personally emailed back and forth with me for weeks prior to our arrival about how to get all the details just right and he nailed it. Thank you for the tremendous job you did and for helping me make the most important weekend of my life unforgettable. We will be back!",5,2023,09,05
124,Terrible Value for the Price you pay + HORRIBLE PASSIVE AGGRESSIVE CUSTOMER SERVICE,"I was so disappointed in my experience from the moment of check-in to the moment I had problems arise. I cannot believe this is a five star hotel, I have stayed at 4 star who made me feel a much more luxurious experience. 

I was greeted first by a passive aggressive staff , that have to talk in a fake nice tone due to the establishment reputation, I came in at 8:00 AM wanting to check-in early, i was told to wait which is fine, I went and walked around and for 40 min and then came back to follow up and this time I stayed at the waiting area. I noticed how other guests were treated in a way where their room cards were brought to them instantly as soon as the room was ready, where I had to constantly nag the receptionist. 

I would recommend booking somewhere else a holiday inn would provide a better customer service",1,2023,09,05
124,True hospitality at its best!  Very well done!,"Beautiful product right from the facade all the way to the rooms.  Comfortable beddings and clean/modern bathroom.  A bit of a walk if you wanna visit scenic spots, however, the surrounding area is just as lovely so you will not feel bored.  Lovely gesture from the Reservations and Concierge team with their consistent follow up and suggestions.  The team made us feel special and welcomed even before we arrive - true hospitality at its best!   Special thank you to Maria from Reservation, Sean and Joseph from the Concierge, Yusuf at the door and the helpful ladies at the Front Desk.  Highly recommended hotel if you want to experience luxury service and product. Thank you to all of you for making our visit to London even more memorable.  ",5,2023,09,04
124,Pleasant,"Very pleasant stay with the family. Very polite and helpful staff. Special thanks to Yusuf and Yohan, extremely patient and helpful with moving our luggages around throughout the stay.  
The only issue was the way our event was cut short even though there was an agreement, however conversations are being had to resolve this. ",5,2023,09,03
124,Be Warned,"I have stayed at the hotel before and had a lovely time.  This time not so much.  I'm a Platinum member who used points for my stay.  I was put in an interior room on the 1st floor without upgrade.  The room I was assigned was directly above the event space.  I felt like I was at a Generator hostel and part of the party on any night with an event.  On a Monday even.  The room was perfectly comfortable for my needs as a solo traveler, but super small.  If I was a couple it would have been tight and for the price they charge for this room, I would be greatly disappointed if I had forked over the $570 in cash.  I was just disappointed that having been a repeat customer with status, maybe they could have put me on the second floor at the very least.  I would consider staying here again under the right circumstances, but fight to not be on the 1st floor.

124,London home!,"Great to return to the Kimpton Fitzroy, my usual hotel of choice when in London.  A Kimpton fan I love the grandeur of the ground floor alongside the Kimpton touches.

124,A Hollywood Premiere Made Perfect: My Stay at Kimpton Fitzroy London,"In the whirlwind world of film premieres, last-minute arrangements are often a necessary evil. However, when these last-minute plans brought me to the Kimpton Fitzroy in London, I was met not with chaos but with sublime quality and service, befitting the grandeur and historical nature of this magnificent property.

From the moment I walked in, Vivian and Zara at the front desk offered a warm, professional welcome that immediately set the tone for a memorable stay. At the Galvin Bar & Grill, Lina Maria and Monica made sure every dining experience was exquisite, providing not just delicious food but also unforgettable service.

Speaking of dining, room service at Kimpton Fitzroy is in a league of its own. I'd go as far as to recommend almost everything on the menu, given how consistently delightful each dish turned out to be. For coffee and lighter bites, the café next door offers great options. Though it's not officially part of the property and the service can be a bit inconsistent, the quality of the coffee and dishes like the shakshuka are well worth a visit.

One of the standout features of this property has to be its partnership with 1979 toiletries. This small but significant detail added a layer of luxury that distinguishes Kimpton Fitzroy from other high-end hotels.

Above all, what truly sets this hotel apart is its historical grandeur. From its majestic architecture to its lavishly designed interiors, every aspect of the Kimpton Fitzroy celebrates its storied past while offering modern luxury.

In a city renowned for its hospitality, the Kimpton Fitzroy and its commendable staff have crafted a guest experience that stands head and shoulders above the rest. I couldn't have asked for a better stay during such a critical event in my career, and I extend my sincerest thanks to the entire team for their role in making it a resounding success.

Abdul who is on the concierge/doorman team is brilliant. He helped us every time we left & arrived. A genuine star performer for the hotel.",5,2023,08,25
124,Upscale and worth it,"Restored hotel with excellent facilities and very helpful staff. I stayed in a single and was pleased with space in the room and luxurious en suite, particularly the full size tub.
Burr &Co for breakfast quite nice, Galvin’s for dinner with well prepared and served meals.
Around the corner from the Russell Sq tube station, so excellent location to get anywhere particularly the Piccadilly line with direct service to Heathrow.
Somewhat pricy but worth it if not on a really tight budget.",5,2023,08,22
124,"Subpar, not a 5 star hotel","I stayed in the hotel for 6 days. The bedding is not breathable and I was sweating every night. They changed it to a foam duvet and no difference. I think their mattress pads must be made of plastic. The shower did not drain well and got puddles of water on the floor everyday. The maintenance guy came up and as soon as I opened the door he was annoyed to be there. He looked in the drain and told me to call housekeeping to clean the water everyday and left. The sink also did not drain well. The free breakfast was trash. Cold baked beans, unseasoned sausage and cold eggs. I ordered “American pancakes” from the menu and they served me cornbread with berries on top and raw bacon. The AC in the room was freezing, then one degree up was humid. There was no in between. It also made rickety noise through the night. Plenty of other hotels in the Russell Square area which is nice but don’t let the pix of the lobby or exterior fool you. ",2,2023,08,22

124,Great location and beautiful hotel!,"We stayed here for our honeymoon and were absolutely blown away by the beauty of the hotel. The free cocktail hour for guests was also a great touch. We adored the cocktail bar and had a few nightcaps there during the stay. Being that it was our honeymoon they sent us a free bottle of champagne, which we thoroughly enjoyed. The location was also spectacular right near the underground station and plenty of great bars and restaurants. Our room was clean but I will say it had a bit of a wonky layout and we were placed on a lower floor so we did hear some noises that came from the party room on the ground floor. They usually stopped by 11pm but it was a little disappointing. Other than that it was a great stay!",4,2023,08,17
124,disappointed ,"I want to start this review with how beautiful the hotel looked from the outside to the inside but thats as the niceness goes. Check in was very rushed, with no explanation of the extra charges that occurred on my bank account.. no info regarding the breakfast times or the dinning plan - as I booked dinner included in my room rate. I was told at first it was £75 for the whole 4 nights.. then I got told it was £65 for the 4 nights.. abit of a joke as that would not cover for 1 meal for 2 people. Breakfast was included - had no issues there, but to anyone thinking of booking dinner into the room rate - dont bother. 
They charged extra £400 on top of the room rate for the 4 nights - now I know a lot of hotels do this to cover costs but I've never had money taken off straight away and this was not explained at check in and took all my spending money. I explained, and they said they would give me a refund but would take 2-4 working days. This caused me a lot of stress and anxiety as I didn't have any extra money and relied on family helping me out. 
further more to the stress, the staff at Burr & Co were not friendly and made me feel stupid for not knowing where to go for the 2 for 1 drinks the hotel does for guests.  
The room was nice enough - very small.
the location is good - 2 mins away from underground and looking onto Russell square
London was fab but sadly this hotel was not. I paid a lot of money for bad service, to me this is not a 5 star hotel. ",1,2023,08,15
124,My Favourite Hotel in London,"The Kimpton Fitzroy is a dream come true in every possible way! My husband and I celebrated our wedding there on 22 July. We invited our family and friends to stay there with us and everyone is in agreement, it is our favourite hotel in London! 

My father was travelling from America to attend the wedding and he is practically wheelchair bound. It is so truly touching the hotel is entirely accessible! The lift is hidden as an illusion of the front steps of the hotel and the doorman Yussef took such excellent care of our entire family from assisting with luggage, hailing taxis, and of course managing the lift for my father’s wheelchair. We held our cocktail hour in the Palm Court and in a similar fashion, the lift is hidden by the stairs to be discreet but it meant my father could enjoy every single aspect of my wedding day without being “on display” for needing extra help. 

My husband and I stayed in a Corner Suite on our wedding night and I had the room used as a bridal suite in the morning - WOW oh WOW is it absolutely amazing! In terms of a bridal suite, it beyond exceeded my expectations. We were able to have all of the bridal party have their hair and makeup done in one room and I could hang my dress and be photographed getting ready in another. You cannot miss out on the incredible tub which is in its own section of the room with views of Russell Square. This is the most luxurious tub I’ve ever been in and I couldn’t wait to say goodnight to my friends and family just so I could enjoy a fabulous bath! 

Every single member of staff from doormen, to the reception desk, to the cleaning staff, and the serving staff were always happy to assist with a smile on their face. I felt I was entirely doted on and I felt like royalty. The Kimpton Fitzroy is beyond fabulous for staying in London. You feel like you are being looked after by family.

Be sure to check out social hour in Burr Co. for a free glass of wine or beer while staying at the hotel each day at 5pm!",5,2023,08,11
124,SUPERB .!!,"Had a great 4 night stay  from the 4th August , it was great to see some of the staff who has been there since our first stay in August 2021 . It was our 5 stay and would thoroughly recommend.

A special thanks to the breakfast team who work so hard and are very friendly and make it that bit more personal. 

See you again soon .",5,2023,08,11
124,Amazing,"This is now our hotel of choice in London.

It might be a bit more expensive than some of the others, but it is worth the difference.

The staff are excellent. It is clear that Customer Sservice is at the centre of their training.

It is hard to pick out one member of staff, as they are all friendly and helpful but I think on this occasion, Ryan was the stand out member of staff.

We look forward to our next stay.

The rooms never disappoint. This stay we were given a family room, which was super. ",5,2023,08,09
124,"Overall, great stay!","The Wonderful:
- The rooms appeared to be CLEAN. The sheets were clean and comfy. The bed was comfy. The bathroom was clean. No big stains on the floor. A couple of skid marks on some of the furniture, but it still gave off the appearance that the staff tried to prioritize cleaning and having a good appearance. 
- The rooms are well equipped (for being small). There was a side table and a side chair in the room. They were able to fit a small fridge in the room’s closet. There was: a blowdryer, nice smelling shampoo, conditioner and body wash, hotel slippers, robes, coffee machine, umbrella, iron and ironing board, etc. 
- They had a free happy hour for guests from 5 - 6pm which included free wine and beer. This was a touch that I thought was really great! We took advantage of that two of the three nights we were staying there. And they had a couple of common areas you can enjoy your drink in - they had a main restaurant and a smaller more casual cafe, and two spots in their main lobby next to the fireplace and then they had this huge common area near the end of the lobby, which had plenty of seating. 

The Good:
- The location of the hotel was good.  It was near a Tube station so easy to get to wherever you needed to go. It wasn’t in an area that was too overcrowded, and it was across the street from a park so my husband and I would get coffee each morning and just walk along the park, which was really nice. 
- It was also close to a couple of museums and must-sees in London, so that was very convenient.
- Overall, the staff was friendly and nice and was accommodating. 

The Bad:
- The rooms are SMALL, but to be fair, when you book the room it clearly shows how much square footage the rooms are, so you can’t be too surprised when you enter the room and you see that there isn’t much space. 
- As a result, the bathrooms are ridiculously small too. I don’t think there was much time when my husband and I were in the bathroom together at the same time because it was just too small.  For example, when you open the shower door, you were basically blocking the sink. The bathroom felt really crammed. 
- Our room wasn’t ready because we arrived early, which was totally fine, so we left our luggage at the front desk. When our room was finally ready they said they’d send the bags up to our room, and it did take quite a long time for them to bring us our luggage. 

The Ugly:
- No ugly for me to report! It’s a great, standard four star hotel. It’s a great, London stay and we will probably stay again but maybe upgrade to a bigger room with more space. ",4,2023,08,08
124,Anniversary stay,"Beautiful character hotel, great location, pre-theatre dinner in Galvin was good value and delicious. Staff are very friendly, happy to help, but special mention to Ruairi McDowell (Head Concierge) who went above and beyond to make the stay special for our anniversary! ",5,2023,08,06
124,I stayed at a lot of Kimptons,"This is the best Kimpton property I have ever stayed at. I wish I could name all of the staff who made our stay so special. The front desk agents, the always cheerful and helpful bellmen, the skilled mixologists in the lounge and the housekeeping staff all made us feel so welcome. The location at Russell Square is fantastic, with a tube stop just around the corner as well as walking distance to the British Museum. Our room was not large but very comfortable and clean with a really nice bathroom, great Nespresso coffee in the room and very quiet even though we were near the elevator. The lobby is gorgeous with lots of quiet corners, fireplaces and several good eating and drinking options. We will most definitely stay here again in the future. Special thanks to housekeeping for finding and keeping my apple earbud. I checked back for it a week later and they had it! ",5,2023,08,05
124,"Amazing Experience,  Great Team,  Beautiful Hotel","We stayed at the Kimpton Fitzroy for a month on a personal vacation.  The hotel itself is an architectural marvel with some rich history of London.  

From the moment we arrived the entire staff was very warm, welcoming, and attentive. Our rooms were perfect and our luggage, which arrived early, was already in our rooms prior to us checking in, all thanks to an outstanding doorman named Ryan.  Ryan along with the other two doorman, Abdu and Yusuf, were all fantastic, always taking care of anything we needed when we departed or arrived.  

Victoria from guest relations exemplified what the true definition is of customer satisfaction.  

The lovely lady from housekeeping, Cristita, did an amazing job always having everything done perfectly and was attentive to all our specific room needs.   

Additionally, all the porters were great, especially EJ, who would immediately assist with our bags upon returning to the hotel.   Jason and Adrian were also great porters that helped with assistance when required.  

The concierge team that we dealt with, Ruairi, Marco, Sean, & Joseph, always went above and beyond any question or assistance we required during our stay in London.  

With a hotel so grand you need a great staff to make it all the best in class, Kimpton Fitzroy has done exactly that. We will definitely return and stay again.   Thank you all for making our trip just perfect.",5,2023,08,04
124,A Happy Return to London,"The property is gorgeous but we mostly cherished the experiences because we were well treated by members of staff at the hotel.

We’d like to thank Hussein at the front desk. A true professional who has a heart of taking care of what the guests needed. He quickly understood what we needed with the luggage arrangements and happily made it happen.

Anyways, it doesn’t diminish the perfect conditions and maintenance of the hotel, the great choices at the breakfast and the high styled interior and exterior decoration.

We haven’t traveled to London for almost a decade and our stay at Kimpton Fitzroy is nothing less than a celebratory return.",5,2023,08,02
124,Wedding Stay,"We visited London for a family wedding, the hotel is stunning, the rooms are well appointed and very comfortable, breakfast was lovely with a great buffet selection, the hotel is in a great location, provided a good base and easy access for exploring London.",5,2023,08,02
124,Very disappointed,"We had stayed at the Kimpton Fitzroy soon after it opened and loved it.  But this time we were so disappointed. We recognise this is central London and peak holiday season, but we paid a lot of money for a tiny room with a couple of small, high windows. Impossible for two people to be standing up at the same time. My husband was too tall for the shower. When I compare the photos online with our room, there is no comparison. I spotted that the room dimensions are given as 19sq m on the room description and 16 - 25 Sq m on the summary. So are the pictures for a 25 Sq m room while ours was 16sq m?  No wonder we were disappointed. Also, this visit, the bar was almost empty and, generally, the public areas were very quiet and lacking in atmosphere.",3,2023,08,01
124,Wedding ,"Stayed at this amazing, stunning hotel for my son’s wedding.
The hotel is stunning in every single way with all staff going doing their vert best to meet your needs.
Very special mention to one of the Managers Sandra who greets you with her beautiful smile and kind hospitality. Thank you for all you did for us, you made our son’s wedding day so very special.
Another mention to the young man on the door Joseph i think, he was so helpful, smiley and polite at all times.
Thank you to all staff at this amazing hotel.",5,2023,08,01
124,Stunning Hotel in Every Way,"This review is overdue. We stayed at the Fitzroy in May 2023 for 6 nights. The hotel common areas are gorgeous and the staff went out of their way to be accommodating. We dined at Galvins and had drinks at the more casual bar.   Both were excellent. Our king room was huge with a  seating area and large bathroom.  The Russell Square station is just around the corner and the Piccadilly Line is convenient to many attractions. There is a Pret across the street where we picked up a quick coffee and croissant every morning. The Fitzroy was everything one would expect of a 5 star hotel.  In fact, we will be returning to London in January and plan to stay at the Fitzroy again.",5,2023,07,31
124,Even Better Than the First Time,"I’m writing this as my ride is pulling away from the hotel. This was my second stay in as many summers (check out my review from last year for details). I remain impressed and pleased by this beautiful hotel. Again, special recognition to Ruairi M. and the rest of the concierge staff. I’m already planning my next visit.",5,2023,07,30
124,Grand hotel with exceptional service. Will not disappoint.,"WOW! From the moment you lay your eyes on this fabulous building you know you are in for a very special treat.  The interior is spectacular and so is the staff, which is what makes the visit extra special.  The rooms are well appointed and the beds are super cozy.  Both restaurants offer great food, service and ambience, and the bar is a perfect place to lounge for a few drinks at the end of a long day.  Location is perfect, not too far and not too close from all that London has to offer.  There is a beautiful park and Italian restaurant across the street, which offers a nice place to enjoy a glass of wine, good food and take a break.  Amenities surround the hotel so it is easy to pop out to grab anything (Tesco, Boots, restaurants, pubs ...).  
What impressed us the most was the staff - from the first ""hello"" to the last ""good bye"" - you feel welcome and relaxed and never frustrated.  Abdul & Yousef at the door, with their welcoming smiles and charming stories, anticipate your needs (water, taxi, umbrella, restaurant, etc.) and ensure your day gets started, or ends, on a cheerful note.  So many wonderful staff members to name ... Silvia, Harold, Tommy are but a few.  While we did experience a glitch at the bar one night, a little birdie told another birdie, Jack who is head of guest relations, and we found a nice bottle of wine and a sincere note of apology in our room the next day.  Fabulous that for once a formal complaint is not made and yet the experience is rectified and the guests feel appreciated.  Been to London many times, and this is the first hotel I am looking forward to returning to.  Great job to all the staff - Bravo!",5,2023,07,29
124,Love it,Everything was amazing and excellent service with incredibly friendly helpful staff. The food was delicious and fresh and the hotel environments was beautiful and very clean. Will definitely come back.,5,2023,07,27
124,A memorable stay in London!,"Had a wonderful experience at the Kimpton Fitzroy. The moment you walk in you realize what a stunning hotel this is.Every staff member we encountered were delightful, from offering us something to drink or getting us a cab to wherever we were going. Though the room was very small, the beds were super comfortable and the bathroom was spacious and modern. Galvin, one of the hotel's restaurants was amazing. Covent Garden is very close by along with the Brittish Museum within walking distance. Lovely Hotel in a quiet area of London.",5,2023,07,26
124,Amazing tour of a gorgeous building,"We stopped in for lunch while exploring the historical sites right around the British Museum. Silvia and Yusuf took time to give us a detailed view of this rich building--they obviously take great pride in the landmark building. The food was great, and we found out the actual price of a room was much cheaper than the rather plain place where we are staying. Thank you Silvia and Yusuf for all the detail about the architects, artists, and Titanic connections!",5,2023,07,25
124,Loved this hotel!,"This is a wonderful hotel! Very attractive, great services, wonderful staff. Highly recommended! We are very fond of the Kimpton Hotels and this property is as good as they get. Love the fact that they still have doorman!",5,2023,07,24
124,A stay you’ll remember.,"The hotel should be on a tour for amazing spaces. That said, the staff makes it amazing to stay there. Abdu, Ryan, Hussein, Fedro….just a few of the names that made our stsy so memorable. You can’t go wrong staying here. ",5,2023,07,24
124,Nothing like the Kimpton Fitzroy!,"What a lovely hotel with excellent friendly and knowledgeable staff.  We received a new tidbit of history each day.  The rooms were spacious and comfortable, the breakfasts were delicious, and the ambiance was superb.  The location was close to everywhere we ventured.  We will return!",5,2023,07,19
124,Fabulous!,"The hotel is incredibly grand. The lobby is beautiful. The staff were friendly and accommodating to our needs. The bar staff in the evening were incredible!
The room had everything we needed and we all slept well. We would love to return",5,2023,07,16
124,"Felt like home, in the best location ","Was lucky to stay for 2 days, first of all, the location is great, public transportation is close too, and you're overlooking a beautiful green park.

The service can't be more perfect, from the moment you arrive until you leave  they greet you with smile and the concierge is owesome. We had a little chat, and he immediately knew what places to suggest.

The room is super clean and lovely, loved the atmosphere of it and the whole hotel to be honest.

Would definitely stay again and again.",5,2023,07,16
124,Super lovely 5*,This was the fifth hotel stay of a 13 day holiday and what a treat! You are blown away by the beautiful interiors the minute you walk through the doors of this stunning hotel. Its quite dark inside during the day but well lit at night with beautiful chandeliers- room was spacious and well equipped with all that you need and super quiet at night. It is opposite Russell square gardens which the hotel sponsor. This is a gem of a hotel tucked enough away from the craziness of London! Tho only a few minutes walk to Covent garden. After a day of wandering in london we returned to enjoy local beers in the bar the. we enjoyed a utterly delicious four course dinner with cocktails and wine the service was above 5* and the food was divine. We went for a walk and returned to have cocktails in the cocktail bar though should have stuck to traditional cocktails rather than the special ones as they were not for us but the room and experience was super lovely. As it was a nice morning we opted to pick up breakfast locally and enjoy it in the park - the hotel kindly looked after our bags and we collected them later that day with no extra charge. Will def be back!!! Oh and the interiors we later discovered inspired the interior of the Titanic!,5,2023,07,15
124,The Best Hotel in London,"The aesthetics of the hotel, the room, the cleanliness, the SERVICE were impeccable. The Staff performed at the highest level of customer service. Special recognition for Carlos at the check-in desk who was effusively cordial, Abdu (a long-term, trusted staffer) who consistently went beyond the call of duty to make our stay rememberable, Dwayne who took wonderful anniversary pictures of us, and two gentlemen (one who we had a pleasant conversation with on our way to Chinatown to get Boba & another young man who went out of his way to find us a charger-converter  for my wife's flat-iron). 

You guys provided the service of a lifetime. 

Job well-done!",5,2023,07,12
124,"Great hotel, staff and location","Had an amazing experience at the Kimpton Fitzroy. Staff was really lovely, especially Angela in reception. She made sure I was taken care of and was happy to help with our many questions. Will definitely be staying here again.",5,2023,07,12
124,600 euros a night to sleep above a club,"The public spaces of the hotel are very stylish and the decor is grandiose. However, this is the only thing that matches the supposed five star rating and the price of this hotel.

Most guest rooms are tiny to the point that moving around the bed is quite difficult if there are several people occupying the room. The breakfast is passable but not even close to what one could expect from a five star hotel. Some staff members are friendly and doing their best, but others seem to focus on doing the very minimum they cat get away with in terms of customer service.

However, things like tiny rooms and disappointing breakfast are minor flaws compared with the fact that guest rooms in lower floors are impossible to sleep in due to the extremely noisy parties that the hotel is hosting.

The hotel hosts weddings and other (loud) private events, which can be heard extremely loudly in the guest rooms. We stayed in 162 and at 22 PM the club music was coming so loudly to our room that one could feel the bass through the floor.

We naturally called the service number, where the receptionist Beverly(?) lied that they are ”dealing with the issue of loud music” (of course they well know that the parties include loud music that is audible through several floors, but will not break the event). Since the music was not turned down but rather pumped up, and it was becoming unbearable for us to be in the room despite earplugs, we called back. This time receptionist lied to us that ”they have just stopped the music” (when we could hear it loud and clear all the time). 

Finally after the 4th call we made, a manager intervened and promised us a room in the 5th floor in 15 mins. However,  nobody showed up so we had to call back once again. After another 15 mins of waiting, a guy brought us the keycard, but did not offer to help us carry the bags (there are several stairs) or apologize for anything. 

All in all we had to stay in the ”above a club”-like cacophonic room for more almost 1,5 hours before we finally got to change to a normal, quiet enough to sleep room. Not an experience we were expecting in a supposedly 5 star hotel that charges over 600 euros per night!

The next day several staff members we talked to revealed that such loud parties are organized almost every night during the summer, and that ”we were unlucky” to get a room on 1st floor.

Why does a 5 star hotel (or any hotel?) sell rooms where it is known that the guests will be disturbed by extremely loud music well into the night, several nights a week? It is very disturbing that this establishment continues to sell rooms with such high prices with full awareness of the unbearble noise situation, and coaches the staff to lie to the customers.",1,2023,07,12
124,Perfect London stay,Amazing stay at this gorgeous hotel - was staying on IHG rewards points and was made to feel like a valued guest at all times. Highlights were the concierge service and breakfast at Galvins. The location is also great - found it very easy to get around and lots of lovely eating spots within walking distance.,5,2023,07,10
124,Nice hotel but rooms are too small.,Beautiful hotel with a great staff. It's in a great neighborhood a short walk to the British Museum. However the guest size rooms are extremely small. If you have two suitcases there is no place to put the second one. Rather high price for such a small room. ,3,2023,07,09
124,Another Kimpton miracle- over the top!,Outstanding in all ways! Friendly and helpful staff. Xtra appreciation to Marcos Russo.He solved a last minute problem brilliantly.Gorgeous and witty interior design. Food is delicious too.  Our new “home” in London. Kimpton has revived yet another grand building!,5,2023,07,09
124,High standards and five star will definitely come back on the next trip to London,"Amazing property, fantastic “social hour” hosted by hotel staff. We had the pleasure to meet & be hosted by Jack  who was absolutely a delight to chat to.  The property location is fantastic. Ambience is amazing and the property staff are fantastic. The restaurant that’s located on property is a fantastic place to dine.",5,2023,07,06
124,Amazing Hotel & Experience,"My recent stay at Kimpton Fitzroy in Russel Sq was nothing short of exceptional. The service provided was outstanding, and I was particularly impressed by Angela in Guest Relations. She went above and beyond to make our anniversary celebration unforgettable. Angela kindly upgraded our room and arranged for a complimentary bottle of prosecco to be delivered to us, which was a lovely surprise. The welcome staff were also incredibly friendly, always greeting us with a warm smile. Throughout our stay, the room service and cleaning staff were equally accommodating and helped to make our experience truly memorable. It's clear that the hotel is fortunate to have such incredible staff members who take pride in providing top-notch service to their guests.

The hotel exudes a modern, sophisticated vibe that seamlessly complements its rich historical background. Guests are treated to a plethora of breathtaking private nooks where they can bask in the awe-inspiring natural scenery. Our top pick among these serene spots is the stunningly adorned foyer, with its alluring contemporary lighting that adds a touch of mystery and intrigue.

It was quite a challenge for us to depart from the exquisitely decorated room, as the serene ambience and exceptionally comfortable bed were simply irresistible. In addition, the delightful scent of the hotel's bathroom amenities added a wonderful finishing touch to our stay.

During our stay at the Kimpton, we had the pleasure of visiting the Palm Court lounge, which left us in awe of its stunning ambience. We were delighted to learn that complimentary drinks were being served from 5-6 pm, which added to our unforgettable experience. With its dark and alluring setting, the cocktail bar tempted us to try new drink recipes, and we were not disappointed. However, what made our romantic trip truly magical was the exceptional service we received from the amazing staff, particularly Angela. We are deeply grateful and will certainly be returning to this remarkable establishment.

124,Historic hotel - wheelchair accessibility review,"I was traveling on business in June and had a nice stay at the Fitzroy. This was a return visit for me. This hotel is absolutely beautiful and has some very cool nooks that are fun to check out. The bar and lobby area are gorgeous. It also has by far one of the coolest wheelchair lifts that I’ve ever seen! However, while the wheelchair lift was working for us coming down, I think that my chair was too heavy for it to come back up so we ended up having to come through the back door when we were coming back in to the hotel. This was made all the more fun by my favorite doorman Ryan. I would give him all of my stars and five star reviews if I could. Ryan was the absolute best and made our stay totally worth it. He gave us great recommendations and also walked us through the back each time with such friendliness. We really enjoyed getting to know him and appreciated returning back to the hotel each day to have him walk us through to the back of the hotel through what we kept calling the  “VIP” entrance since the lift in the front wasn’t working for me. Ryan even surprised us with a little wine and some treats in the room for the inconvenience. Every day he would have the biggest smile on his face, and we enjoyed great conversation with him. Talk about customer service! 

Besides Ryan, most of the rest of the time the staff was pretty okay though there were a few people who did not understand why I needed to go through the back and that could be frustrating at times to have to re-explain. There was another Door person who actually insisted that I didn’t know what I was talking about and had me actually get on the lift again to show him that it wasn’t working, which is why I am only giving this review 4 stars. 

From the room perspective,  the bed was very comfortable, and they were able to bring in a rollaway bed for my personal care assistant, which was great. However, the bed was not actually accessible meaning my Hoyer lift was not able to roll under the bed. So keep that in mind, if you’re traveling with a hoist or a medical lift that they do not have their bed lifted and there will not be space underneath for you to roll under. The bathroom and the roll in shower were fully accessible.",4,2023,07,04
124,Stunning romantic hotel with first class service ,"My husband and I have recently returned from a magical stay at the Kimpton Fitzroy in Russel Sq.
From the moment we arrived until departing, everything was first class. The Front Desk provided top notch service. In particular, we adored Angela in Guest Relations. She was so friendly and always available. She kindly upgraded us as it was our anniversary and arranged for a free bottle of prosecco to be delivered to our room. She did her utmost to attend to our requirement for a view which directly contributed to us having a very special time with incredible memories. In addition, the welcome staff that greet you upon arrival both at reception and in particular at the main door are super helpful and smiling at any time of the day. This was very much appreciated. Even the room service staff and housekeepers all went out of their way. The hotel is very lucky to have such amazing staff. 
The hotel design and vibe are contemporary but in a beautifully historical setting. There are several stunning areas to sit in private and marvel at the beauty that surrounds you.  We loved the dark décor of the foyer with its incredible contemporary lighting.
Our room was beautifully styled, and we did not want to leave. It was quiet and the bed was super comfortable. The hotel bathroom products have a divine scent. 
Palm Court is a gorgeous lounging area where you can have complimentary drinks from 5-6pm. There is also a dark seductive cocktail bar which entices you to try new drinks recipes.
Thank you so much to everyone at the Kimpton Fitrzoy, especially Angela, for making our romantic trip so magical and truly unforgettable, we will be back!

124,Wonderful stay at The Kimpton Fitzroy!,"We had a perfect stay at The Kimpton Fitzroy. Everything is top notch! The hotel and rooms are impeccable and very comfortable and the Staff is the absolute friendliest and so accommodating. We’ve enjoyed the social hour every evening from 5-6 where the drinks are on the house and include excellent wines. The buffet breakfast included with our room is of the highest quality and includes coffee drinks of any type and exceptional pastries. The on-site restaurants are outstanding. One of our rooms was a bit small, but would not keep us from staying here again. The hotel is in a central location near all the activities we had planned. I highly recommend The Kimpton Fitzroy! We’ll definitely be back!

124,Two Thumbs up for Marco!,"I cannot give high enough praises to Marco Russo, the concierge. He repeatedly went above and beyond.

124,"Fantastic Service in a Lovely, Historic Hotel","I haven't even checked out yet but had to review this hotel because it's phenomenal. Everyone has been amazing. I especially have had great interactions with Yusuf, Krasi, and Ines (I hope I spelled  everyone's names correctly). And it's a very good hotel for elderly travelers - my mom uses a walker and they have a staircase that retracts and turns into an elevator to get guests up the front stairs. It was like living in the future. Seriously, the service at this hotel is fantastic. And so is the room. The bed is lovely, the bath is fantastic, and every inch of the first floor is exquisitely detailed. Kimptons are known for quality and this London outpost is a stellar example of why. ",5,2023,06,19
124,Really disappointed - should have been magnificent,"My husband booked us a room at the Kimpton Fitzroy Hotel as a treat for me and it should have been wonderful. However, the WOW factor was lost pretty much the instant that we walked into the lobby. Loud intrusive music causing a sensory overload. The lobby is imposing, impressive, dark marble and the ambience was spoilt by the casually dressed staff and the sounds of raised voices. People were having to raise their voices to be heard over the music.  A gentler and more discrete soundtrack would be much more welcoming and set guests and staff up for a restful stay.

I am an avid photographer of architecture and décor and was really looking forward to exploring the hotel and getting some interesting shots.  I didn't take my camera out of its bag and didn't even take one photo on my mobile.  
The receptionist who welcomed us turned the music down when I mentioned how distracting and intrusive it was and turned it down again further when my husband mentioned it again.

Our visit was already less that we had hoped for as we were now both a little bit tense.  Going up to our room we were met with yet more music in the lift. Different music than the lobby and not as loud but we were alert to it.  It was a relief to find no music in the corridor walking to the room.

The room that we had was very small when you consider what we paid for it. It was comfortable and well-appointed, but we were constantly in each other’s way and there really wasn't room to move around much.  

The shower was very underwhelming. A huge showerhead looked promising, and I hoped for a deluge of water but got a gentle shower. Toiletries in the bathroom were good, but positioning of the toilet too close to the wall was uncomfortable and the toilet roll holder needs to be moved forward of the toilet bowl so that you can reach it without having to twist.

We slept okay, pillows were very good, mattress very comfortable and air conditioning worked well.

The morning saw us cross and grumpy yet again, the intrusive music in the lobby, and both breakfast restaurants just being too much for us and in the end, we checked out, left the hotel and went somewhere else for a fantastic, relaxed and delicious full English.  I therefore can't comment on the food or beverages in the hotel because we didn't use any of the facilities.

We are really disappointed with our stay; the staff were apologetic and helpful, but it isn't enough.  We almost parked the car up again to go back and ask to see the manager to discuss but decided that we would end up getting crosser, at the risk of spoiling the rest of the day.  

We went to Claridge's for breakfast instead.  It was as glorious as ever.",2,2023,06,19
124,Kimpton Fitzroy is Fantastic! Highly recommend.  Terrific home base while in London. Convenient to tube and tour busses!,"Wonderful historic hotel beautifully restored in great location on Russell square near the British Museum. Staff were all pleasant and helpful especially Ryan who helped us get a cab several times, always with a smile!  Highly recommend.",5,2023,06,18
124,The Fitzroy is a Wowie!,"You will immediately be drawn to the elegance of this hotel! Stepping into The Fitzroy is like entering an enchanted wonderland. The staircase, the chandeliers, ... magnificence in every section. The staff members are extremely kind, attentive, welcoming. My room was on the 3rd floor, in the back, and therefore very quiet. It was very comfortable and provided everything I needed. I can't wait to be back at the end of the month!",5,2023,06,18
124,May 2023 Family Trip,"Lovely room with a view of Russell Square. Comfortable and spacious (by city standards). We love the amenities the property provided: delicious breakfast, 2 nice restaurants, refreshments in the lobby. Staff was very accommodating. Can't wait to return!",5,2023,06,15
124,"Great hotel, good location and nice sized rooms","Excellent hotel, rooms are roomy by European standards, concierge was excellent - thank you to Marco and Joseph for their extra help for our family.   Loved the location and the services from almost everyone was very nice.",5,2023,06,15
124,Totally positive experience -- a memorable hotel. ,"This is perhaps the nicest hotel I have ever stayed at. From start to finish, everything is first class. The front desk was great (Carlos is especially friendly); the concierges are knowledgeable and efficient (thanks, Marco!); and the one little issue I had during my stay was promptly and effectively taken care of by receptionist Hussein and Patricia, a Reception Manager. I am singling them out, but really, everyone here is top notch. Yes, you'll pay ""London"" prices, but the location cannot be beat (one block from the British Museum and a stone's throw from the Russell Square tube stop); there are scores of restaurants in all price ranges and coffee shops in the surrounding area; and everyone at this hotel genuinely seems to want to make your stay as memorable as possible. Overall, this was my first experience at a high end Kimpton property, and it was a very positive one. ",5,2023,06,08
124,Perfection !,"The lobby of this hotel is stunning! Has a seating area with a fireplace . May has cold
Mornings and evenings. 
We got the double room ,was very spacious ,same as the beautiful bathroom with an amazing shower . 
Everyone at the hotel was friendly and very efficient!! Love the location as well ! ",5,2023,06,07
124,Very nice hotel with some room for improvement,"Nice hotel! 
We are Kimpton members and always look for one when traveling. This hotel is very classy. The location is good in a quiet area with an underground station around the corner. The Lobby and facilities are beautiful and the room was nice with a comfortable bed and hot shower. Pros- abundant plugs with usb, iron and board, hair dryer and heated towel bar. 
Cons-there are a few. For one the room was small. We had a standard double room. For 2 people it’s impossible to move around comfortably. If you have the iron board out even more challenging. At one point my husband had to crawl across the bed to get to the other side of the room, lol.  

Second, the bathroom while lovely in decor is of poor design. The shower door is floor level and opens out which means the bat math get scrunched when you open the door to get out of the shower. 
The towel bar is across the bathroom over the toilet. You have to step out if the shower and take a couple steps to reach them. 

There is no shelf in the bathroom to place toiletries. There is one really small glass shelf over the sink which has the glasses and hotel sign reminding you they’ll provide forgotten items. 

We were happy overall but thought these points should be mentioned. 

The breakfast in the am was ok. We felt the eggs scrambled eggs at the buffet were very runny. Not sure if that’s a normal UK thing.  There was enough variety and we could order from the kitchen. 

We had drinks in the Fitz bar. We didn’t get the whole color thing with the specialty drinks but that’s their thing. The bar decor is quite nice.  Dark and interesting decor with Disco ball. They were playing old 70s songs which was fun. 

We’ve stayed at many Kimpton properties. This one is priced high and while nice we would prefer more space for comfort. Not sure we would pay more for a more comfortable room. Probably look for an alternative but wouldn’t hesitate to recommend even with it’s shortcomings.",5,2023,06,06
124,Would stay here again and again.,"What a great hotel!  Location was great. Close to the British museum. Was an easy walk to the National gallery, Soho, Piccadilly. Our room was lovely.  Had a mini fridge and coffee maker. Bed was comfortable, bathroom was roomy, water pressure was good. Gym was sufficient. Had an English breakfast at the Galvin Bar & Grill and drinks during their “social hour” at Palm court. All staff were super nice, friendly and helpful. 
Hotel is right in front of Russel Square. Around the corner, maybe a 5 minute walk is a shopping center with multiple grocers and many fast casual restaurants. Also, a conveniently located pub right behind the hotel as well. Lots of eateries close by. We got Indian take out our first night, walked to dinner at a Turkish restaurant one night and a cute little Korean restaurant another. All close by and within walking distance.  Would stay here again and again. We found out after our trip that they filmed Top Chef World All-Stars here. ",5,2023,06,03
124,Fascinating stay in the beautiful heritage hotel,"My sister and I stayed at kimpton for 2 nights. It was our second visit to London and we were excited to stay at the most gorgeous hotel in London. 
Yusef, the poter boy was perfect. 
He delivered our luggages to the room and explained the service available. 
He also told us about the great history of the hotel and when I realized the person who built this lovely venue also designed the titanic, it was a goose bumping experience.
He was helpful gentle and delighful staff.
I will certainly come back to the kimpton to enjoy its fantastic facilities and services.

동생과 함께 2박 묵었는데 감히 최고의 경험이었습니다. 영국은 두번째 방뭄이었규 우리는 란던 최고의 호텔을 경험하게 되어 설렜습니다. 
포터 유세프는 매우 친절했고 호텔이 가진 헤리티지와 특징, 유무료 서비스에 대해 자세히 설명해 주었습니다. 
타이타닉을 설계한 사람이 호텔을 지었다니 소름이 돋을 정도였어요. 
유세프 정말 고맙습나다!",5,2023,06,03
124,Grand Dame worth enjoying ,Delightful Hotel immaculately restored to its full glory this is like stepping back into the 1920s and an art deco era. So tastefully done and maintained. The physical is matched by the detail of staffs attentiveness only disappointment was no one had name badges so you couldn’t acknowledge individual contributions. Found reception and concierge helpful throughout stay.  While my room didn’t have view could see some did overlook Russell Square. The noise is minimal rom outside. Rooms and bathrooms are good size with all you’d expect and some nice complimentary food provisions ie chips and popcorn. Staying you feel touch of the glamour this place exudes. ,5,2023,06,03
124,A great experience,"The Kimpton Fitzroy, is conveniently located in the Bloomsbury Neighborhood, overlooking the picturesque Russell Square.  The Hotel was completely refurbished a few years ago, with the wood paneling, fireplaces, mosaic tile floors and stained glass windows maintained.  The rooms are modern and extremely quiet.
 
The people are what helps make this property so special…….the Concierges Rory, Sean, and Marcos help make your stay eventful and they are extremely informative.  The servers, particularly Lina Marie, Ash, and Fedro make dining, particularly breakfast, a great experience. 
 
The hotel is just a few hundred yards from the British Museum, and a great pub, the Ships Tavern, is just a few blocks away.  On the other side of Russell Square is Charlotte Street….. there are many great pubs and one Michel Starred Restaurant, The Ninth, whose Head chef /owner won “Chopped” twice.
 
The Gym in the hotel is fabulous… two rooms with all the equipment you could want, and never crowded.
 
We truly loved our stay there, have been there previously, and look forward to a return. 
 
Enjoy!",5,2023,06,01
124,Top notch,"As soon as you enter the hotel you are struck by all the details and nooks and crannies to explore. The interior design is quite impressive. 

Such friendly staff too. They are everywhere, smiling, greeting you and they genuinely seem to enjoy working there. 
Service needless to say is excellent. 

We stayed in one of the beautiful suites that was more like a small appartment with lots of space, sitting area, good size closet, big bathroom and the icing on the cake was the bathtub in the bedroom. 

Sometimes the hotel standard in London can falter with more or less problems with musty smells because of moisture damage. But not this hotel. 

There are two breakfast areas, one with a buffet and the other with a set menue you order from. Both with nice selections that left you ready to take on the day. 

The hotel is located in a nice, quiet area with a park across the street with a small café. Just around the corner is the underground station so getting around is easy. 

All in all a Fantastic experience!! ",5,2023,05,31
124,Perfect place to stay in London,"Elegant hotel, perfect location and delightful staff. The doorman Abdul repeatedly went out of his way to be helpful, yet never intrusive. There is a Tube station right around the corner.We cannot wait to return to London and when we do, it will most certainly be staying at the Kimpton Fitzroy.",5,2023,05,30
124,Nice building but room small,"2 night stay, queen room, 4th floor. Street view.
Concur with other reviewers who have mentioned some of the rooms are small.

Queen rooms are very tight, bathroom one of the smallest I've seen. Room is very non functional, nowhere to put anything. Had to put the multiple superfluous bed cushions in the tiny coat cupboard. 

Booked a points night. It took 66k points so not a small amount. I have platinum status with IHG. However no upgrade at checkin. Receptionist declared emphatically that 'we are fully booked'. There is little recognition of IHG platinum members. That's what I found anyway. Recognition is by way of being handed a letter at checkin stating standard IHG benefits that you can read on their site, and I knew of anyway. 

Room was on the fourth floor. Thankfully on the street side. Wi-Fi ok. No info given on the facilities at check in. Have to read them off the room tv. Bed was comfy. One thing I did like was the lift was very efficient and you got allocated your own lift to go up to your room!

I surmise people who have got upgrades or stayed in bigger rooms would have been perfectly happy and rated it accordingly. However to me the room is just too tight, nowhere to put anything.

To summarise, handy location, spectacular looking building. Room is in good condition. The provision of a chest of drawers or some shelving and coat hooks would improve the rooms greatly.",4,2023,05,29
124,Lovely hotel in a great location but we had couple of issues.,"A beautiful building in a great central London location. The hotel had a stunning entrance hall and staircase. However the check in process was slow which was a shame. We arrived at the room and there were dirty dishes outside the door which were only taken away several hours later. Room was on the small side for a hotel of this standard but all the amenities were very good and the bed was particularly comfortable. 
We were only staying one night and were looking forward to having a drink in the bar before heading out for the night which is why we were disappointed to be told that the bar was closed and we weren’t able to sit in there. For a 5 star hotel with such a unique bar area we would have most definitely expected it to be open at 5pm!",4,2023,05,28
124,"Beautiful hotel, close to the tube, tiny bedroom, huge bathroom","We stayed at the Kimpton Fitzroy London and would recommend if the price is right. 

Absolutely stunning hotel, was previously the Russell Hotel. It sits right across the street from Russell Square (park), and is around the corner (1-2 minute walk) to Russell Square station that is only served by the Piccadilly line. There is one flight of stairs from the platform, and then lifts to take you up (or 175 steps).

Our room included breakfast, and we dined at the Galvin Grill most mornings. They had a lovely full breakfast buffet with sausage, bacon, scrambled eggs, baked beans, cheeses, meats, fruit, pastries, etc. Alternatively, if you do not go to the buffet, you can select entrees from the menu, such as American pancakes with crispy  bacon and fruit. If you had the buffet AND ordered, there was an up charge of £5-6. We were told the other restaurant had the same menu, but we only dined in the Galvin grill because it was absolutely beautiful. Staff was lovely and very efficient. 

We had a room with a queen bed, and it was the smallest hotel room I have ever stayed in (smaller than those in NYC, which surprised me). The bathroom, in contrast, was one of the largest. The room came well equipped with a kettle, tea cups, tea, water refilled daily, and complimentary snacks refilled daily (chips, popcorn, chocolate, cookies). 
There are several gorgeous restaurants within the hotel, such as the Palm Court. 

Check in and check out were seamless, and the front desk staff was incredibly helpful. 

Overall, I think if the price is right, this hotel is a great option in London.

Biggest benefits:
-great access to the Piccadilly line, super close to the tube station
-tesco express across from the tube station
-boots pharmacy, sainsbury’s, waitrose grocery store 
-lovely hotel and would recommend breakfast 
-walk to kings cross/st pancras
-walk to Euston station
-walk to the British museum

Recommended nearby restaurants:
-Casa Tua Italian (10 minute walk)
-Museum Tavern, Greene King pub across from the British Museum, classic, historic pub and great drinks (5-10 minute walk)",5,2023,05,27
124,"Kimpton Fitzroy, first class Hotel","First class hotel! Great location neat the tube, and park right across the street. The entire staff was very friendly and helpful. Beautiful breakfast and fun bar. The room was quiet with all ameneties  working as they should. Our Porter Umaar, could not have been kinder or more helpful. We will look forward to staying there again the next next trip to London. ",5,2023,05,27
124,Excellent Hotel in Central London,We stayed at the Kimpton Fitzroy for four nights and had a lovely time. The staff were especially kind and helpful. Definitely opt in for the hotel breakfast (great buffet options). Diorka was a very friendly hostess and Huseyin took great care of us in the restaurant. The hotel is right next to the Russell square train station which made it super easy to get around town. Will definitely be back here!,5,2023,05,27

124,Amazing weekend. We’ll definitely be back!,"From the moment we stepped into The Kimpton, we were greeted with a very warm welcome. The architecture is stunning and the Queen room was beautifully furnished, amply proportioned, and the bed was just divine! 
We had planned to go out into London for the afternoon, but having been tempted by social hour in the Palm lounge, we decided to stay put. We enjoyed a wonderful meal and wine in Galvin Bar and grill, and topped the night off with some cocktails in Ftiz bar. Every member of staff were exemplary! Can’t recommend this place enough!

124,"Great hotel, amazing staff!","Our stay at the Fitzgerald was nothing short of amazing. The hotel is a marvel and the rooms are quite comfortable and lovely. However, the best part of the stay was the attentive, friendly and charming staff. They accommodated every need. Particular credit goes to the concierge team including Marco, Sean, John and the others. They secured some difficult reservations, provided great recommendations, confirmed tickets etc. they were so lovely to work with and greeted us every day with smiles and asking how our dinners and excursions were  Top notch team!  Thanks for making our trip a memorable one :-)",5,2023,05,22
124,"Highly recommend, incredible staff and property","Beautiful property with exceptional staff. The front desk was wonderful and accommodating.

The rooms are spacious, perfection of cleanliness, and very comfortable. Well appointed bar and restaurants also. Highly recommend. ",5,2023,05,18
124,Good service,"Really good service, in particular Lina and Diorka at the Galvin Bar & Grill. 
After a bad first night due to a loud party on the premises, the reception person was helpful and we were moved to a suite the day after and one night price was reduced. That was appreciated",5,2023,05,16
124,"High hopes, let down by very poor service","Where does one start! This was a IHG Points Reward stay that I booked some months in advance as it was the coronation day of King Charles III. I had used a considerable amount of IHG points to book 2 rooms for my family for one night. I had high expectations having visited the hotel before to check it out for a possible corporate event for my business.

Having been stood in the rain at the Coronation we arrived to see if it was possible to check in at 2.00pm (1 hour ahead of the stated check in time of 3.00pm). The rooms were not ready, OK no problem we are early we will take a drink in the bar and wait until 3.00pm. I was promised a call to my mobile when the rooms would be ready.
3.00pm came and went so I approached the reception again given we had passed the check in time. I was then informed only 1 of the 2 rooms was available, but not to worry the staff assured me the second room would be directly next to the first and they would treat it as a priority. 

Upon arrival at our room it was clear there was no maid or cleaning activity going on in either of the neighbouring rooms. After another 60 minutes I called the ""Everything Else"" number to be told they would call me back, which they did in 5 mins to explain it would be at least another 20 minutes before we could get our second room! The lady also explained that she would speak to her manager about some kind of credit for our inconvenience. 

That 20 minutes came & went, no call! So somewhat irate I went down to reception we had an early pre theatre dinner reservation looming and had been unable to settle in, shower, prepare & dress for the evening.
I spoke with the same receptionist whom now feigned a lack of knowledge about the situation, but then immediately found me a room on the same floor but some 18 rooms away!

So we finally got our second room some 90 minutes (4.40pm) after getting our first room.

Upon returning to the hotel after the theatre it was evident there was wedding taking place in the ballroom. Despite being on the third floor the noise was quite incredible, having been awake since 4.30am that day we had hoped for a restful night, unfortunately it was not to be the case.

At checkout the next morning there was no record of any kind of credit or awareness of the room situation. The receptionist acknowledged the previous nights noise issue and apologised. I asked to see someone in a position of authority, but was told no one was available, instead I was informed the Guest Services Manager would call or e-mail me. I have waited 10 days for that contact, it hasn't materialised so hence this review.

Disappointed is an understatement regarding the service here at the Kimpton Fitzroy, You will in my experience receive better service at the Holiday Inn located directly across from the hotel for less than half the price. It has also confirmed for me that I would not consider this venue as a location for future business events off the back of such poor service.

124,"4.5.   Great place, mediocre service. ","This is a magnificent hotel.  Our room was quite expensive but very beautiful, great bathroom.  Yusuf and Abdu were extremely helpful and gracious towards us. But the service is somewhat lacking. I called the hotel concierge twice a few days before our arrival for some help and never received a return call.  The morning of our early checkout we requested two luggage carts and no one ever showed up.  All in all, a terrific experience but with a few blemishes. ",4,2023,05,15
124,New Favourite Hotel!,"I was having a horrible trip, with the airline losing my luggage, but as soon as I arrived at the Kimpton Fitzroy, I felt I could (somewhat) relax. Upon check-in, I advised the receptionist of my situation and she informed me that there were many amenities in the room and what was not already there, they could send up. They even let me use the phone to call the airline for updates on the location of my bag. When I arrived at my room, it was beautiful! Small, but not too small - a perfect size for one person. I loved the decor, and it was so clean. 

The bar was amazing! The bartender remembered me when I went for pre-dinner drinks each night and always remembered my order; although I would sometimes change it. They just made me feel so welcomed! He made the perfect Old Fashioned, too.

Breakfast was lovely, very cute cafe. Honestly, I loved everything about my stay. Except that when I tried to extend because I didn't want to leave, the rates had gone up too much 😥. All I know is, I'm not going back to London, until I can afford to stay here for my entire trip!",5,2023,05,10
124,Water on the floor - known issue! ,"The hotel lobby and friendly employees made this a 5-star experience but there were a few things that needed attention. We stayed in a suite, lovely room BUT the shower door leaked all over the powder room. There was evidence that this was going on for a long time. When we checked in another customer was complaining on the water pouring out of the shower so it's obviously a design flaw and known issue. High walking score made this a great location too! The bar and breakfast service was VERY SLOW but worth the wait. ",4,2023,05,09
124,Awesome Wedding Venue,"We stayed Thursday to Sunday over the Coronation weekend as parents of the Groom at an amazing Anglo-American  wedding on Saturday. We pulled up at 8:00 am Thursday morning with suits and dresses for the whole family. The doorman immediately took charge of empting our car and putting everything into safe keeping so we could rush off to the legal proceedings in Chelsea. From the moment we returned until we left on Sunday nothing was too much trouble. All of the staff were just so friendly and helpful.  We upgraded our room as there was one available an hour before ours would have been. So glad we did. The standard queen rooms the rest of the family had were, lets say, ""cosy"". Absolutely nothing wrong with them, well appointed but a touch on the small side.
Would we stay again ?  Without hesitation. 
With a balance of Victorian architecture complimented by  21st century facilities on the interior The Kimpton Fitroy is hard to beat.  Thank you for an amazing stay.

124,Amazing place to stay.,Our good friends chose the Fitzroy as a venue for their wedding. What an amazing place. The building is incredible inside and out.

124,By far my favorite luxury Hotel in Central London,"I often visit London for business and since its fantastic refurbishment, I always stay at Kimpton. It occupies a full block in Bloomsbury, a location central, with a cosmopolitan feel yet quiet. You can walk pretty much anywhere in central London from Kimpton including museums and galleries. The building feels modern yet classical. 

The rooms are spacious, beautifully decorated and very clean and the customer experience always excellent. The staff really make a difference in standing out from other London hotels by being friendly, knowledgeable and helpful. 

Extra touches that I appreciate during my stay are, among the many, a nightly wine social hour to help bring guests together in a relaxed, friendly atmosphere, a yoga mat in every room, the collection of William Blake poems in the night table drawer and plenty of coffee and tea.

I could not recommend it more.",5,2023,05,07
124,A lovely experience from the moment you arrive.,"What an incredible experience!  The majestic Kimpton was not only beautiful and luxurious, but the staff really made a difference in standing out from other hotels.  A special thanks to Carlos, in reception for his patience, Yusof and J/Loan our magnificent luggage porters, and Sean, the loveliest and most helpful concierge, doormen and housekeeping staff.   Everyone who works at the hotel was extremely helpful and kind.   That is what makes the stay!",5,2023,05,07
124,mindblowing,"This hotel blew my mind. The hotel itself is obviously spectacular, and its location could not be more ideal. But it was the extra touches, which always sets a Kimpton apart from others, that blew my mind, like the collection of William Blake poems in the night table drawer. I stayed in a city single which was perfect for my needs. I loved that there is a little entryway area. The room itself and the bathroom is surprisingly spacious for a small room in centrally located hotel. It blows my mind that you could get such good value for money in such a gorgeous hotel. The front desk was able to give me an early check-in and late check-out. Thanks to Zara for her wonderful service from the beginning to the end! They don't charge you extra for the snacks in the room. This is one classy hotel that has me dreaming of my next trip, which hopefully will include staying at a Kimpton. ",5,2023,05,06
124,Great Hotel with Impeccable Service ,"The room I stayed in was quite small but very well appointed and decorated. The staff and service were impeccable, and the breakfast was top-notch.

I think this is a steal of a place for the price.",5,2023,05,03
124,Wonderful ,"Visited this location twice. Service is fantastic and understated. Staff cares about your experience. 

Building has been refurbished wonderfully and feels modern yet classical. Very clean.

124,Brilliant stay,"I booked this hotel as part of a birthday weekend in London for me and my partner and also planned to propose to her the same weekend.

The hotel itself is absolutely fantastic and the staff were all so friendly and helpful. They went out of their way to make the proposal as special as possible and even upgraded our room for us.

Special mention to Kajol in the guest relations team who helped me plan the proposal at very short notice and even emailed the next day to see how we got on! A credit to the hotel.

Can’t wait to return the next time we are in London!",5,2023,05,01

Ruairi, Joseph, Marco and the rest of the team including the porters, really made me feel at home, nothing was too big or small, and the suggestions and direction were always on point, great job team and look forward to seeing you again for my next stay!!

I stayed in a junior suite for my stay and definitely the best room that accommodated my stay being very spacious, especially with the morning view of the park, an evening cocktail bar is a must-try.

This is a special place to stay as the team makes it one!!

124,"Stylish, Modern Hotel in a Grade II Listed Building: Wonderful Staff, Bars and Restaurants in a Super Location","This is a stylish hotel, with wonderful staff and plenty of different places to sit and relax, or work. There's Palm Court, the large central space with a bar, and quiet, comfortable sofas, or smaller hideaway spaces, which are great for private meetings and with access to facilities. 

The Galvin Bar & Grill's fixed price menu was excellent and terrific value. Fitz's is a modern cocktail bar and like it says on the website, it is glamorous. It's in a lovely old, comfortable room with a relaxed ambience - perfect for couples. I had a beer in Burr & Co, which was very popular with diners. I was staying on business and opted for the Single City Single room, which was very comfortable, and had a beautiful bathroom.  

Overall, this has to be one of the most in vogue, sassy hotels to stay near Russell Square, Covent Garden, Soho and the British Museum. A few of the other guests were using it as a stopover before taking international trains from St. Pancras. Angela and Zahra checked me out very efficiently, and if I could remember the names of all of the staff, then I'd list them and give them a shout out too!

PS Lucky George, the Dragon Mascot is worth a quick look. ",5,2023,04,30
124,Wonderful evening from start to finish!,"Had a beautiful evening with friends at the Kimpton last night! Started in the Burr and Co bar and was welcomed by Alin and Bogdan, then enjoyed wonderful food, oysters, steak, lamb, Mac and cheese in the Galvin restaurant. 
Alban explained the steak cuts, Serhan chose our wine and Stacey served us and they all were effortlessly brilliant! And thanks to chef Dan for cooking us such a wonderful feast! 

Silvia on the front desk was lovely and then we went to the theatrical Fitz's Bar where 
Nick went through the menu with a torch to reveal the secret wordings on each page and 
Lua served us some fab cocktails. Would highly recommend as nothing was a problem and was all a pleasure! ",5,2023,04,30
124,Marvellous stay at Kimpton,"I had a wonferful experience at the Kimpton!
This hotel is in a great location, serves delucious food and its staff goes above and beyond.
Every member of staff I encountered during my stay were eager to help but I would like to highlight Estefania, Karol and Krasi from the recepcion team. I would definitely recommend  the Kimpton and wilm stay there again!  Thank you",5,2023,04,30
124,Great concierge staff and restaurant,"The personable concierge staff was excellent (Marco and Joseph in particular). They helped us quickly when we faced a minor medical issue. The hotel design, restaurant (Galvin) and room service are all top notch (try the pancakes!). It’s also well located, in a quieter area but still walkable to Covent Garden and other neighborhoods. Look forward to returning to the Kimpton Fitzroy!",5,2023,04,29
124,A beautiful hotel with comfortable rooms and delicious dining,"We had a comfortable ensuite room.  We had dinner in the bar one evening, and another evening ordered room service.  The food was delicious, and room service was fast.  Breakfasts were lovely, and you could get a cooked breakfast and/or continental breakfast.  The blueberry pancakes were incredible!",5,2023,04,28
124,Small room,"Very small room on the second floor.
Bathroom is tiny, probably the smallest I have seen in a 4/5 star . Clearly not to the standard of what is supposed to be an upscale hotel.
Friendly staff
Overall hotel is very dark with almost no light from the outside",1,2023,04,27
124,Perfectly situated for your capital visit .,"Perfectly situated for your capital visit .
Have stopped in other  Kimptons before and this one keeps up the brands qualities 
Literally 1 minute from the tube station and just  4 stops from Central London , perfect for West End shows , Westminster , Leicester square , Covent Garden etc 
There is an NCP car park within in 3 minutes walking distance based at the Holiday Inn Bloomsbury Russel Square 24hours for £20 online 
The Hotel is very grand , the reception  area is modern and efficient  , we arrived early and left our cases with the luggage team , the receptionists all smiling and happy 
Checked into our room a few hours later on the 4th floor , room 421  , queen size bed , more than enough room for two of us , 1st critic that the "" window "" view was a stone  brick wall , i understand  that we can not all have a wonderful city view ,  but  "" it is what it is "" and i accept that , 2nd critic , there is a very annoying "" humming "" all night long , from maybe the air-conditioning  units out side the room  , if your a light sleeper don't take this room . Amble size beds , nice TV , very nice shower , coffee machine , fridge  etc 
The hotel itself is , like i mentioned very grand , with some very nice lounges and community areas , am i mean very nice to sit and take a drink or two , very  typical of the Kimpton brand 
Small mention but the lifts ..... excellent idea , no stopping at all floors they take you straight to your floor i.e not stopping at every floor on the way up and down 
I would recommend this hotel 100 % for location , quality and price ",4,2023,04,26
124,Favourite hotel in London,"We love staying at the Kimpton Fitzroy whenever in London. The building is impressive, the staff friendly, the rooms clean, and the cocktail bar incredible! They were very accommodating of our check-out even though technically we were late doing so.",5,2023,04,26
124,"Luxury, Home, History","A palace opposite Russel Square, beds you would sink in and staff that lighten up your day, everyday. I cannot say enough about the Kimpton Fitroy, and for many reasons, our stay would not have been this great without the team behind it. Everyone was superb so forgive me if I forgot to mention your name. From the moment you get there, Sophie and her team of capable concierge/porters welcome you as if they have known you forever. Ryan and Jason were superb. Then the reception, smiles and great personalities: Angela, Hussein, Patricia ..... thank you so much. The housekeeping team that made our rooms impeccably, Nina C and Viorika .... thank you. No wonder my daughter remembers it as a Palace. If you ever stay at the Kimpton Fitzroy, please visit Galvin Bar & Grill located in the hotel and admire the history in that space aging back to over a century. Again, super service, really great meals, Andrew, Stacey, Roberto all took care of us. While at the Kimpton Fitroy, walk across the street to Russel Square, peace awaits you. My favourite mornings are spent there at Caffe Tropea, but they deserve a review on their own so will do that next :) ",5,2023,04,26
124,Wonderful,"The interior is gorgeous, the food is delicious, and every staff member was terrific — especially Inez at the front desk, who made me feel super welcome and looked after. My queen room was snug but I didn't mind at all, as it helped me feel cozy and sleep deeply. I only had one night but thank goodness I'm coming back later this week.",5,2023,04,25
124,awesome stay,"great hotel...amazing rooms and beautiful hotel    services are top of the line   very attentive to all my needs in a timely manner  definitely deserves its 5 stars   ..and the concierge is awesome   great recommendations for restaurants and can help you with any of your needs from theater tickets to hair appointments ..my second visit here and will return and even extended my stay. Special thanks to Ruairi, Sean, Joseph and Marco: made my stay.    ",5,2023,04,25
124,Faultless - great place to stay - excellent customer service.,"This hotel really is Five Star, the staff overall are outstanding, nothing was too much trouble.

If I was to mention anyone special it would be Sophie, the Head Porter, she will excellent and so friendly.

The breakfast was lovely and we had the Social Drinks in the Palm Court.

Tolga in the Galvin Restaurant was great, at both dinner and breakfast.

Our room upgrade was also great.

We look forward to our next stay.",5,2023,04,23
124,Pleasant stay. Modern and friendly staff,"Very nice hotel which was relatively close to St Pancras station.

Room was clean and modern.

Lunch was nice although children disappointed that the staff could not make a non alcoholic cocktail (even though on their website it shows a menu for it).

Breakfast was quite limited but good quality.

All in all a pleasant stay with friendly and helpful staff",4,2023,04,21
124,Best Kimpton is the world?,"Been staying at Kimptons for 20+ years and, honestly, have recently been a tad bit down on the brand. But, this hotel is the best of the best Kimptons that's I've stayed at.

Classy but chill. Great location -- close to anything but not in a crowded, noisey area. The gym was perfect. The room covered all the needed bases. Excellent breakfasts and a nice place to grab a drink in the evening. Oh, and the elevators are super fast and efficient. ",5,2023,04,20
124,Practically perfect in every way,"The hotel is absolutely beautiful, clean an comfortable, without feeling overly fancy. All of the staff were kind and friendly. We had a premium room with two double beds (for a mom and two young adult daughters), and the beds and pillows were very comfortable. Our rate included breakfast, and we were able to order whatever we wanted to our room with just a small plating charge. The Russell Street tube station is right around the corner, which was so convenient. It’s also within easy walking distance to the British Museum. There is a small Tesco’s around the corner as well, and a lovely park across the street with a yummy cafe in it. Being three women in one room getting ready at the same time, we could have used a couple more mirrors and outlets, but I’d be more than happy to stay there again and bring my husband along, I’d just get two rooms. I can’t recommend this hotel highly enough. I’m on the lookout for other Kimpton hotels for my future travels.",5,2023,04,19
124,Stoning,"Very clean and the staff is so kind!
The breakfast is great!
The localization is near everything, mainly if you are professor or student.

The hotel arquitetura is so
Beautiful, if you can not stay there you must pass bay to get a tea.

It will be an good experience!",5,2023,04,19
124,It doesn’t get much better," Very impressed. Weekend stay for just the two of us. Met with a very warm welcome by the doorman. Formal yet casual. A very modern service, yet still adhering to traditional ways. The building is magnificent, and the decor amazing. We had dinner and breakfast in the restaurant, Galvins, which was superb. Location was really good, near St Pancras and round the corner from the tube. 
Love the happy hour and the use of the traditional bicycles. 
The room didn’t let them down. The bed was very comfortable and the shower was so good we didn’t want to get out.
Having stayed in numerous fine hotels in London, I can honestly say that this is our new favourite. ",5,2023,04,17
124,Great stay at a fantastic hotel,"Stayed at the Kimpton Fitzroy end of March 2023.  As usual, did not disappoint.  Status recognized at check-in, offered all the usual choices for diamond elite as a welcome amenity (chose breakfast), as Inner Circle upgraded to a fantastic junior suite overlooking Russell Square.  GREAT in-room welcome amenity of wine, fruit, meat and cheeses. They now have complimentary coffee and tea available in the morning in the lobby (standard in the US for Kimpton’s, but not standard in the UK and EU, this is a VERY nice touch).  Marco the head concierge was very helpful, as was all the rest of the staff.  Social hour was great, they offer beer in addition to wines.  You just can’t beat the location, (Russell Square station 150 feet away, a 15 minute walk from the Elizabeth line, which takes you directly to LHR, British museum maybe 2 blocks away, within walking distance to many of the theaters, plenty of great eating choices).  Marvelous public spaces (look at the pictures, this is actually what they look like).  We ALWAYS stay here when visiting our daughter, which happens twice a year.  Can’t wait for our next stay.",5,2023,04,16
124,Moms first trip to Europe and Kimpton Fitzroy was amazing ,"AMAZING hotel, staff, customer service from the Kimpton Fitzroy London! It was my 73 year old mothers first trip to Europe and i wanted her to get the full experience, so I selected this hotel. In part because of the architecture, but mostly because I’m an avid fan of the Kimpton brand, and they did not disappoint. I let the customer relations office know we were coming and asked if there was anything they could do to help make this trip a more special time for mom. She insisted that we share a room because she was not comfortable staying by herself in a foreign.  Kimpton upgraded us to a suite with a master bedroom and installed a rollaway bed in the living room portion (obviously mom got the king bed). They also provided a bottle of champagne and a few welcome chocolates for us to enjoy during our stay,as well as let a note welcoming mom to London. Class act top to bottom. I’d recommend this hotel for the reasons listed above,  it also due to its proximity to central London and it’s relative quietness from the hustle and bustle of the city.",5,2023,04,15
124,Great family vacation,"We stayed here over Easter weekend 2023 - two adults and two teenagers. It was perfect. Great location - not too loud and right by a lovely park, not to mention right next to the Underground and also walkable to the theater district. The staff was so lovely and helpful. Special thanks to the entire concierge team, who helped us secure sold out Harry Potter tickets, made some spot-on dinner recommendations, and were all around accommodating. They had easter candy out for the kids, and the social hour in the gorgeous Palm Court was a nice touch. The hotel is beautiful inside and out, as well. ",5,2023,04,12
124,April stay,We had a wonderful experience during our stay. The staff was friendly and accommodating and the location of the hotel is superior. We were right around the corner from the underground station. We will definitely be coming back! ,5,2023,04,07
124,Beautiful but lacking substance,"The Kimpton is a beautiful building, all the common areas well kept and clean. Check in was great, our room was ready early, staff were lovely.
The room itself was very small, it’s London I know so no problem. Bed was small and uncomfortable. Shower was pathetic. The room was however in perfect condition and spotlessly clean.
We had breakfast in the Galvin, there was a short wait for a table but just a few minutes. Once sat we were told our menu choices which was ridiculous, have some thing from that buffet or something from this but you then have that or have this and it’s extra. My wife had a croissant but because she wanted a piece of toast as well she had to pay the full hot buffet price. It was £27 per person for a very average Buffett and more on top if you wanted anything off the al-a-carte.
Surly £27 for breakfast gets you anything you want. 
Its an Ok place, certainly won’t be rushing back",3,2023,04,07
124,Max for the win,"Max  took very good care of us, made the best lemon drop martinis, and showcased a good knowledge about the property, max also tends to possess a very deep knowledge about their signature cocktail menu,, which is theory of colour.  Win win win.",5,2023,04,06
124,Fabulous hotel ,"Best hotel we have ever stayed in (and we have stayed in a lot!)
Beautiful decor, lovely staff and great breakfast 
Rooms lovely. We had family room for the 4 of us and plenty space (2 teenage boys!) 

",5,2023,04,06
124,Great location,"Staff were fantastic, small room, not the best of beds. Fitz bar had a very poor selection of wines by the glass. Breakfast not the best. Great gym, lots of places to sit and the building is just stunning ",4,2023,04,06
124,"Superb service, location and amenities","This hotel was included in a package to see Elton John.  We didn’t know what to expect.  However, the Kimpton Fitzroy is simply amazing or ‘brilliant’ as the Brits would say.  We‘ve been lucky to stay all over the world in lovely hotels and would recommend this as one of the best!  A special thanks to Marco Russo, concierge, who went out of his way to ensure we had a wonderful holiday.  

Ps Don’t miss the ‘Holiday Pour’ at the complimentary happy hour",5,2023,04,05
124,A business retreat,"Recently stayed at the Kimpton Fitzroy for business . I have stayed at many hotels but the splendour of this particular property is unmatched. From the external decor to the welcome from the doorman, the building interior to the bedroom. I couldn’t fault anything. Staff made me feel very welcome over my two night stay, service was swift and professional . Room service was great , I had the chocolate sundae . The Sunday lunch in Galvins was well executed. I will definitely recommend this Hotel , whether it’s for business or pleasure . Thanks for a great stay!!!!",5,2023,04,05
124,One of the best London has to offer.,We received a superb welcome from the Receptionists and all of the staff the we  encountered were helpful and polite. The hotel has been refurbished to a very high standard maintaining its original classic glory but not lacking in any up to the minute facilities and amenities. The hotel is situated in a great location overlooking Russell Square and a few minutes walk from the British Museum and two minutes from the tube. We had a great night of sleep in a very comfortable room followed by a superb breakfast. It is certainly one of the best hotels that we have stayed in in London and we look forward to returning.,5,2023,04,04
124,A spot on hotel and location in Central London,"Really nice stay, and the staff were most helpful, particularly Angela on the front desk. Only 300m from the British museum. Great breakfast. Would stay again if in the area. Complimentary bottles of water given during checkout. ",5,2023,04,04
124,Felt Welcome Even Prior to Arrival - Best Customer Service,"First, THANK YOU to concierge Marco Russo for his exceptional attention to detail and help. Making my upcoming arrival/stay seamless. 

Second, Ana in reservations was a delight and also provided a great customer service experience.  ",5,2023,04,04
124,Will be returning - love the historic building,"My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Kimpton. One two pleasant surprises were the daily 5pm free social happy hour for guests only. Because it’s a hotel you get to meet a lot of interesting people around the world. Another benefit was the card in the bathroom of, if you forgot shaving cream, toothpaste, etc you can request to have some. The staff was very nice. My wife and I will return. The hotel is in a prime location, next to the tube (subway), and easy walking distance to a lot of shops. Highly recommend!",5,2023,04,03
124,Great. Marvelous. Splendid   Lovely. Great service from Marco as a PR to make us reservations everywhere ,"The best hotel in London.  Great sevice. Beautiful beds and pillows. Nice old building with extremely ultra modern inside Places. Excellent service form
Marco:  this young guy was making us our reservations to the best places in UK. ",5,2023,04,03
124,"Exquisite hotel, wonderful staff, great location.","We stayed for two nights over the last weekend in March but with free IHG nights so I can't comment on any costs. We were in room 412 which was away from the lifts and very quiet.

The first thing I have to mention is that ALL the staff we spoke to were great. Friendly and efficient but with personalities rather than the robotic nature often encountered.  They even seemed happy to work there which is something I can't empathise with....! Check-in took around 1 minutes-despite us arriving before 12.00 the room was ready for us as I'd said we'd be early. 

The fact we'd visited before was recognised which was a nice touch, and was appreciated. 

The location of the hotel was superb. Only 2 minutes walk from Russell Square underground yet it was quiet at night. You can walk to theatreland or be by the Thames in around 15 minutes if you're ok with walking.

The social hour is a nice touch, the wine and beer was welcome after a day's sightseeing. 

The bed was one of the most comfortable we've experienced. The bathroom was spacious and spotlessly clean. The only negative thing I would say is that people taller than me might be a bit too tall for the overhead shower. 

Checkout took around 1 minute and an issue with the bill was sorted out immediately.  

The building itself is beautiful and very nicely-furnished.  All in all it was an excellent stay and once we've collected enough IHG points I hope we can return for my birthday in October!
",5,2023,04,01
124,Fabulous Stay,"Had a wonderful stay at the Kimpton Fitzroy.  Great location and enjoyed being able to walk to the British Museum and to have access within a very short walk to the Russell Square Underground station.  Thank you, Ruairi, for your great information on how we could get to Stonehenge.  We took the train from the Waterloo Station to Salisbury and then the bus to Stonehenge.  It worked out great!  Plenty of pubs near the hotel too. Every staff member we interacted with were exceptional.  From the moment of arrival to departure, someone was there to assist.  We would definitely stay here again. ",5,2023,04,01
124,Great hotel with wonderful staff,"Wonderful hotel with a lovely staff.  I visited London with my three children and we decided to stay at the Kimpton. The entrance is grand and the reception area very classy and cozy.  We had rooms with two queen beds and they were ideal for our needs. The views we had were not spectacular, but at least  the bathrooms are spacious and the beds extremely comfortable. Especially Angela at the reception was very accommodating to our needs and made sure we had everything we needed.",5,2023,03,31
124,Excellent hotel and wonderful concierge staff!,"Accommodations were top notch.  It was located quite close to UCL where our daughter was attending a semester abroad.  You are nearby Russell Square tube station, so you can get anywhere in the city quickly.  The concierge staff headed by Ruairi was top notch! They went out of their way to accommodate all our requests!",5,2023,03,30
124,LOVELY HOTEL…ATTENTIVE STAFF…GREAT RESTAURANT AND BAR,Staff was great.  We booked with IHG points and the “ELIGIBLE” room was unsatisfactory in size….the bathroom was lovely however but the Queen room was really  unsatisfactory!  No where to put anything it was so tiny!!! However the second night we were upgraded to a king and then all was good for the next three nights.The restaurants and bar in the hotel were great as well and the staff couldn’t have been nicer.  A truly lovely and historic hotel with great metro access to Piccadilly line and one stop away from Pancras international!!,5,2023,03,27
124,Old and modern,"A well deserved 5stars review. A beautiful hotel that managed to keep the old spirit of the building with great services. A special mention of Marco, a very dedicated to ne efficient concierge who’s recommendations made our stay even more enjoyable. 
The breakfast would need a small update in terms of quality, maybe more organic and farmers products. 
I will definitely be back. ",5,2023,03,26
124,A special stay,"Absolutely first class service from the moment we walked through the door. Lovely lovely interior, marbled throughout, very nice room; we stayed in the queen essential but it was more than just comfortable. Not a speck of dust anywhere. We enjoyed the complimentary social drinks hour too-nice touch. 
The real gem here however are the staff, attentive, knowledgable, pleasant, smiling helpful… especially Zivelle who went out of her way to ensure our stay was extra special, thank you for the fizz Zivelle, we shall not forget how wonderful this visit was because of your efforts. Ruairi McDowell you must be wonderful to work for, I’ve never seen so many happy employees! Well done. Looking forward to our return",5,2023,03,25
124,A great stay that clearly showcased the value of customer service.,"Thank you for a lovely stay and our particular thanks to Adrian Marin for his excellent customer service skills. Adrian went the extra mile to provide a warm welcome, quickly building a rapport and showcasing the hotels restaurants, bars and services. He is clearly a valuable asset to this property. Thank you ",5,2023,03,24
124,The staff are what elevates this hotel from excellent to exceptional,"We stayed at the Kimpton for 2 nights for a birthday weekend. It is our favourite hotel in London, and once again we were in no doubt why.
The staff were all exceptional, and went out of their way to make the stay special and memorable for us, and our friends.
The rooms are exceptionally comfortable, and all food/drink first class.
Be sure to enjoy the free wine at social hour, then follow it up with some  insanely good cocktails at Fitz.
We also ate for the first time at Galvin one evening, and that was very relaxed. Order the Cantemerle if you like good bordeaux, the sommelier knows!!
We'll be back! 
PS don't miss the daily social hour in the wonderful marble  and chandeliered 1st floor area above reception. :-)
",5,2023,03,23
124,I think I was stuck in a cupboard!,"The tiniest of rooms for 86,000 points a night. No desk. Nowhere to put room service. Nowhere to open my suitcase apart from the bed. I’ve had twice as big in a Travelodge.
The hotel is lovely. Fitz’s bar great. Burr and Co cafe great. Just stay elsewhere unless you want to pay £500 a night. I won’t return. Room  620. Avoid.",3,2023,03,23
124,My home away from home in London,"The Kimpton Fitzroy is my go to hotel in London. It's a little oasis of calm but opulent chic with top notch great service from friendly staff.

The refurbishment has been wonderfully done and everywhere exudes a quality charm of a bygone era. 

I have stayed many times, and the rooms are always immaculate and to a high standard. Some can be on the small side. The gym is above average - with a good set of modern treadmills, cross-trainers, a rowing machine (sadly not a concept2) Pelaton bikes and a range of free weights and weight machines. The gym is monstrously hot though, but the windows can be opened with a little effort. If running is more your thing, it's 1 mile to Regent's Park albeit along the not very pleasant A501, or a mile down to the Thames

Room service quality is excellent,  but be prepared to pay a chunky tray charge + 12.5% automatically included tip and still have space of the receipt to add additional tip...

Breakfast at the Galvin Bar & Grill is lovely - with a decent buffet plus a la carte menu which is available as a Diamond member benefit. The space is impressive and it's well worth pausing to look up and soak up the atmosphere.

Checkout can be slow at peak times, but it's easy enough to drop your keycard off in the red postbox key drop before the doormen helpfully call a taxi for you.

",5,2023,03,22
124,A Truly Marvelous Hotel,"Fabulous! That's the only word that fits this elegant, beautiful, perfect hotel.

It has everything we wanted for our visit to London for Valentines Day: Romance, location, comfort, dining, and genuine Edwardian charm. The interior of the public areas is almost all marble, almost like a palace. The staff are so helpful and I need to compliment them all. We were early on arrival, and we just took a chance that our room might be ready since we'd flown all day and night, but since it wasn't the staff took our bags and held them for us. We went sight seeing and when we returned the bags were waiting for us in our room. 

The location is perfect for touring, with a Piccadilly Line tube station about a block or so away. That gives you access to nearly everything you'd want to see and do. The British Museum is a stones throw away and you could spend your first morning there. There are other interesting things and places to see in the area as well. We arranged to have high tea at the Royal Albert Hall on Valentines Day (very nice!) and we took a taxi to be sure we were on time, but that's the only taxi we used in 4 days. You can walk to many things or take the tube, you don't need to spend money on taxis. Because we were there in February it was cold and the park across the street was leafless, but in the summer it must be gorgeous. It's Russell Square and the hotel used to be called the Russell Hotel, so you might see it referred to like that online.

The dining rooms are very nice, posh really, and the breakfast menu was very complete. I love oatmeal, which they call porridge, so I was happy to see it was available every morning, as well as other pastries and toasts and eggs and so on. The full English breakfast looked good but what I really wanted was porridge.

Any hotel is a place to sleep and rest, and that you can do here. The room was quiet and the queen bed was like floating on a dream. So comfortable! The large flat screen TV had many stations to choose from, so you won't have to watch CNN unless you want to.

I could go on for hours, but you get the picture. A wonderful hotel and you'll be fortunate if you stay there. My wife and I have already made a promise to each other to spend next Valentines Day there again, and maybe we'll make a tradition of it.

If you're trying to find a good hotel for your trip to London you'll do well to stay here.

And maybe you'll make a tradition of it too.

124,It’s the DJ for me,"I have visited this hotel a few times now. The building itself is beautiful but I always go for the brunch at Burr & Co. The food & drinks are consistently great. They have an amazing DJ usually on a Saturday afternoon who creates such an incredible atmosphere. 
Such a good spot for a chilled afternoon or a few drinks with friends. I’ll definitely be back.",5,2023,03,21

124,Amazing!!!,"Cannot rate this hotel highly enough! From beginning to end the service, atmosphere  decor and quality were first class. The reception staff were amazing and we were delighted our room had been upgraded to a suite for my birthday. There were amazing touches throughout the stay too such as a birthday card and chocolates in the Galvin restaurant and Prosecco and dessert in my room. We tried breakfast in both the restaurant and Burr and Co. Both amazing but we loved Burr the most! The decor throughout the hotel and in the rooms is stunning. Overall a really special experience and I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend! Can’t wait to return! ",5,2023,03,15
124,Ace place,Stunning architecture and really lovely staff make this a fantastic central option.

124,What a lovely stay in this very beautiful hotel!,"What a lovely stay in this very beautiful hotel!  We were there for three days whilst in London celebrating my husbands birthday.  Reception was welcoming and friendly, but on first going to our room I was disappointed as the room was so very small, it was hard to even walk around! However I was soon OK as we did not plan to spend much time in there anyway as the public areas are so comfortable and elegant. We enjoyed the cocktail bar where the service was friendly and professional.  We also had a little disappointment  on the first morning at breakfast, but after speaking to them all was rectified to our satisfaction. It snowed that weekend and when we were leaving the doorman went with his umbrella (and a smile) to the street corner and spent quite some time trying to flag us a taxi (he succeeded).  This lovely hotel will become our new ""go to stay"" in London.",5,2023,03,11
124,Stunning Hotel in Central London,"One of the most beautiful hotels ever. The architecture, building and rooms were stunning.

124,Kimpton Fitzroy London 11/10 Stay,Kimpton Fitzroy London was an 11/10 experience. From the cafe to the service everything was top notch. Russell Square was also relatively quiet compared the hustle and bustle of the rest of London so it was a nice escape after spending the days all over London but still very immersed in the city. My only regret was not staying longer and enjoying what looked like what could have been an amazing meal at Galvin Bar & Grill! Highly recommend.,5,2023,03,10
124,"Rooms small, service average, Breakfast disaster ","The bed was very comfortable but room is small and then the shower ! The amount of taps - a colleague said he saw less on a submarine. The shower so low I had to crouch to shower .. also had thought coffee pods and milk would be somewhere neat machine .. took a while to find them in cupboard other side of room. Odd

Then came the breakfast.. OJ concentrate, cold burnt coffee, cold toast, and gloomy porridge sprinkled with cinnamon and bananas (could not disguise how poor it was .. at least it was luke warm). 

I went out and had a proper breakfast nearby. Very disappointing after reception dealt with us at checkin so efficiently. ",1,2023,03,10
124,"Location, staff and charm!",We stayed at the Fitzroy a year ago and liked it so much we had to return. This property is terrific!  It’s   marble and old world charm with all the modern touches. The staff is very friendly and welcoming  and the location is fabulous. Close enough to everything yet a peaceful reprieve at the end of a long day of sightseeing. Happy hour for guests is a nice way to wind down and regroup.   Restaurants are convenient and high quality for sure. We will return with pleasure!,5,2023,03,10
124,First Time in London,"Gunther was our concierge and had great info on sights to see and overall great customer service. I love the Kimpton. We visited Fondrum and Mason for some amazing cheeses, wines, charcuterie, and coffee. ",5,2023,03,10
124,Gunther gave us a very interesting tour.,"This authentic Victorian style hotel has been renovated in grand style. The several luxurious and splendid ground bars and breakfast room are inviting you for a relaxing stay, close to British Museum.",5,2023,03,10
124,A remarkably beautiful hotel with a gift for hospitality,"My family and I truly enjoyed our stay at the Kimpton Fitzroy. Great location in an historic neighborhood, surrounded by many great restaurants, close to trains for day trips, and more.
Our rooms were lovely with the kind of details I like (tea and coffee, snacks, robe and slippers, and a glorious shower).
Perhaps the best part of visiting this hotel, along with the stunning beauty of the place, is the staff. The team at the front desk, the gentleman doormen, the staff in the hotel restaurants, the concierge we're all very generous. I must give a special acknowledgement to the entire concierge team, especially a gentleman whose name I believe was Marco. I must of asked twenty different questions of him during our stay about where to eat, which shows to see, which trains to take. He offered spot on advice, gave insider tips, and abundant encouragement. 
This has been my favorite place to stay in London.",5,2023,03,08
124,Just a joy!,"What a wonderful hotel. Every detail was flawless. Beautiful decor, exquisite food and cocktails and the service was out of this world. Gunther was a jewel in the crown. Well done to the whole team.

I would totally recommend this hotel to anyone wanting a fairly central location and a relaxing stay.",5,2023,03,06
124,Luxury,Best hotel we have been to in London. Professional services and good food. Nice rooms. The surrondings is perfect and the hotel is close to public transportations. We will gladly return to this hotel next time going to London. ,5,2023,03,05
124,A memorable stay,Myself and a friend stayed here at the Kimpton for a couple of nights to celebrate my birthday. We had an amazing time. The room was gorgeous although the floorboards were a little bit creaky in places. The staff are very friendly. We happened to be in for the 5pm-6pm meet and greet where refreshments and snack are offered complementary. Gunther the host was very attentive ensuring everyone had their drink’s replenished. I have stayed here before and can definitely say I shall be returning for the truly memorable experience again.,5,2023,03,05
124,Birthday weekend treat,An excellent hotel. Beautiful room and attentive staff. The location close to a tube station was ideal too. It was a lovely touch to offer social hour and Gunther and his staff were lovely. Our room was beautiful and the facilities were fantastic,5,2023,03,04
124,"Beautiful hotel, well situated, close to underground station and lots of attractions that London has to offer!","Very well located in the city of London. Walking distance from the British Museum. Great coffee shops and restaurants near the hotel. The hotel itself is very beautiful and clean. The staff are very accommodating, friendly and always available if ever anything is needed. Will definitely be coming back!",5,2023,03,04
124,Kimpton Connoisseurs,"We have been to over a dozen different Kimpton Hotels across the globe. We love them all , but this one ranks as one of the very best. The highlight was of course Gunther at happy hour. He was working the room like a truffle in a chocolate factory.",5,2023,03,03
124,10/10!,"Gunther was an amazing host during social hour and very pleasant to speak with, while telling us about the history and luxury of the hotel. It is stunningly elegant and classy! All the other hotel employees have been wonderful. Would recommend the Kimpton Fitzroy to any and all that want to visit London! ",5,2023,03,03
124,Great place,"Great hotel with an outstanding service. Special shout out to Gunther from concierge, his tips and special places to eat and discover made our trip way better. If we have to come back we will choose this hotel once again. ",5,2023,03,02
124,Beautiful Hotel,We booked this hotel based on pictures and reviews. We were not disappointed and the facade and building itself is historic and just has that extra special something to make your stay feel wordly. We highly recommend staying herea,5,2023,03,02
124,Beautiful hotel,"The hotel is beautiful.  The staffing are always willing to help and very attentive. This hotel has charm and character. Would recommend for a quick stay. Their happy hour is also a great plus, wine on the first floor, try the Rosé, it’s a must.",4,2023,03,02
124,All-round great experience,"The building is absolutely a gorgeous piece of architecture with an incredible atmosphere. Staff is helpful, breakfast opens early and closes late, with a great selection. Located close to the tube and lots of traditional well-kept pubs",5,2023,03,02
124,A Perfect Visit ,"After a poor experience last year we re-visited the Kimpton Fitzroy for an overnight stay in February.  

We were given an upgrade to a Junior Suite right at the front of the hotel and it was truly perfect.  A welcome drink and free selection from the mini bar made our day.  The long bathroom and roll top bath were unusual but a pleasure to use.  We had a sitting room area too and this was lovely to relax in and watch the television.  The television in the bedroom did  not work and this was reported to reception, but it did not spoil our stay.

We had cocktails and lunch in Burr and Co and both were superb.  We also had breakfast in Galvin and that, too, was a delight.   The Happy Hour - 5-6.00p.m. on the mezzanine level, where beer, wine or soft drinks are served free, was good too.

Our positive experience this time, with a belated anniversary celebration, more than made up for our previous visit.  

We hope to return again later this year.",5,2023,03,02
124,Amazing experience,"We had a amazing time at the Fitzroy from day one, thank you to the manager Gunther for looking after us during our stay, we felt very welcome, we will definitely be back next time. Highly recommended.",5,2023,03,01
124,Wonderful hotel!,"Great service, good rooms, and super kind staff. We were very pleased with the location as well. 

Multiple pubs close by, park across the street to relax and they are near a lot of great history. Coming back again!",5,2023,03,01
124,Amazing hotel! 10/10,"This hotel really is something else! The eye for detail and personal touch throughout our stay is absolutely remarkable!

We stayed with our (young) kids to visit the Harry Potter tour and the kids also had a great time! The staff looks after them!

Amazing breakfast and great room! 

Would recommend to stay for everyone 

Special thanks for Albon (breakfast) and Carlos (reception)!

See you next time ",5,2023,03,01
124,Thanksgiving in London.,"We stayed in this London hotel during Thanksgiving week 2022. For us, the location of this hotel is excellent. It is right beside Russell Square Park and walking distance to the British museum. It is also walkable to other touristy areas of central London such as Covent garden, Soho and Leicester square which are busier and more crowded areas. The location of the hotel is quiet and not  that crowded. The hotel has a lot of character. The facade of the building has intricate architectural design details with the arches and statues. The lobby looks luxurious with the high arches, columns and the grand staircase. It looks like a palace. The decor of the check in area is modern but still able to retain its historical character. We booked a standard room but my husband is an IHG member so there is an automatic upgrade. They were not able to upgrade as during the first night due to high occupancy. The standard king room is a little small. We had a big luggage and 2 carry-ons and with all the luggages in the room, it made the room feel cramped. We transferred to a king bedroom suite after which is bigger. It did not have a view but it had more space. The rooms looked updated with modern contemporary feel. We had free breakfast with the room that we booked. At that time there were two restaurants that served breakfast and we tried both and we enjoyed the food. The hotel is close to a lot of restaurants nearby. We recommend Master Wei Xi’an. Really good noodles! The hotel is also close to the Russell square tube station if you want to go around the city using the train. We enjoyed our stay and we would love to stay here in again in the future.",5,2023,03,01
124,Couple visit,"I was visiting the hotel for a romantic weekend with my girlfriend, all the staff was amazing. I remember Gunther that made us feel like at home. We will recommend the hotel to all os our friends and we hope we will visit it soon too!!!",5,2023,02,28
124,"Stunning Hotel, will definitely!","With so many hotels in London, it's sometimes hard to choose where to stay, however having recently enjoyed three nights at the the Kimpton Fitzroy London,  I wouldn't look anywhere else! 
My partner and I had Park View Suite (502) which was an ideal size for 3 nights, gorgeous bathoom with a rolltop bath, the perfect amount of storage, and a tasteful, homely feel.
The bar areas are gorgeous with friendly staff and a great selection of drinks. In fact, all areas of the hotel are beautiful, with an interesting history too!
The gym was well equipped and overall we were very impressed with everything the Kimpton had to offer.
All staff we spoke to were knowledgeable and friendly, and throughout our stay we felt very looked after. Thank you, we'll see you again!",5,2023,02,28
124,Great experience,"The hotel is beautiful. The staff are friendly, approachable and knowledgable. The rooms are spacious and extremely clean. Not cheap but still value for money. Breakfast was delicious and plentiful. I would definitely recommend ",5,2023,02,28
124,Magnificent hotel!,"Wonderful hotel with a grand, classic facade that is attractive in every way. Also the friendly and helpful staff made our twelve-night stay extremely pleasant! My family all enjoyed breakfast at Galvin’s with various menus to choose from every day! :D We would definitely choose this hotel again for our next trip back to London!",5,2023,02,27
124,Old World Charm Meets Modern Comfort,"Pros:

Check in process was fast
Hotel is clean and common areas are tidy
Location
Suites are plush and comfortable
Extremely high water pressure
Quick/hot water
Great in-house food and drink options
Actual 5* service in terms of responsiveness, staff availability, etc etc
Decent soundproofing 

Cons:

No driveway (makes loading/unloading bags a hassle) 
Popularity!

This was the first time in two years I didn't get a one-level upgrade upon check in as a Diamond member. The hotel was booked full - understandable, but then when we finally arrived in our premium king room around 9 PM after a full day of activities, we were disappointed. It wasn't like the photos and had the tiniest bathroom with no tub.  

I called reception to confirm that we indeed had the right room and to ask about a possible upgrade, as my husband had done the initial check in while I was off to the side on a work call. The operator and reception staff - particularly Delphine - quickly and graciously explained the situation. We had been very unlucky to get the smallest room in the premium king category. Delphine then offered an upgrade two levels up as a gesture of goodwill and even accompanied me to see the new room. 

The new suite is simply wonderful. My husband and I love to travel (32 countries so far) and live in a Four Seasons property in our home city. This suite easily ranks in the top 5 and is on par with what we have at home. Having tried several different hotels around London, I can say the Kimpton Fitzroy is my new favorite.",5,2023,02,27
124,Nowhere better,"This hotel is simply the best in London.  From helpful, friendly staff to the incredible setting and location - this place is a must. 

I first used this hotel several years ago and it has lost none of its charm.  We look forward to returning again soon (inc. our dog)!",5,2023,02,27
124,Guest Experience,"Upon entrance of this Historically rich Building you can feel the elegance with classic beauty welcoming faces and smell of light perfumed air . Service is anointed and beyond I have traveled extensively most of my adult life and this is one on the very top. 

    My husband and I were greeted with genuine hospitality by Gunther an employee who is a pleasure to speak with . The hotel staff are eager to help and accommodate within their means , 
I would recommend this Hotel and restaurants within to anyone who appreciates the finer things in life . Also dog friendly!!🐾🙏🏽

     The Hotel location is conveniently located to local pubs sightseeing and across from a park and the British museum. 
Side note you can book a walking tour  with the concierge  complimentary when you are a guest with the Hotel Fitzroy  👍🏼

124,Classy hotel without the 5 star prices,"We stayed at the hotel  for one night as we were traveling through London.  In the evening, we stopped by the social hour at Burns and Co.  Gunther was great and a wonderful host.  We had a wonderful time and will plan on coming back the next time we are in London.",5,2023,02,26
124,Kimpton Fitzroy Hotel,"Excellent location, friendly hotel staffs & beautiful decorations. Complimentary drink 5-6pm daily for guests who staying at the hotel. Breakfast selection can be improved. Overall is a great experience of staying, will definitely come back again on next visit to London.",5,2023,02,26
124,Lazy Sunday!,"We visited the Kimpton for Sunday lunch, enroute Euston to Heathrow. What a great way to spend a stressfree afternoon, the hotel is beautiful, staff are super interactive but not overbearing and the food was excellent.  We're now fuelled and prepared to take on the ques at Heathrow. Happy holidays!",5,2023,02,26
124,Very good place,"Good food, good customer service, waited a bit long for some chips but overall no complaints. I recommend if you’re looking for simple but high quality food in London. The place looks very nice too and easily accessible",5,2023,02,26
124,Great place,"I come here almost every week to study and work a bit. The food and the coffee are really good and the people are nice, have a great service and the vibe is also pretty chill to have a nice dinner/ cups.",5,2023,02,26
124,Fantastic stay at the Kimpton (Russell Square),"Beautiful hotel, such a calm relaxing atmosphere. The attention to detail in every area was phenomenal. Friendly polite staff from the reception team, room service, cleaners, bar staff - everyone was so polite and always smiling. The Fitz bar is definitely worth a visit - cocktails were amazing and the staff were very upbeat. A variety of places to eat all serving top quality food. The room was clean with a super comfy bed. Would definitely recommend to others and will be back to stay again!",5,2023,02,26
124,PERFECT experience,Hotel bar? Incredible (staff super kind and witty and CAN WE DISCUSS PERSONALITY TEST COCKTAILS?)! Concierge? Patient and helpful. Everyone was absolutely incredible and the facilities were above and beyond. Even a kind man who works there asked us why we chose the hotel in the elevator. Everything was perfect.,5,2023,02,24
124,"Visually spectacular, disappointingly ordinary","The Kimpton is visually a very grandiose and attractive hotel both inside and out. The staff are very friendly and the location is great. It is spotless, nice views, comfortable bed and has a great gym.

However, it is style over substance. If you are looking for value for money and a reasonable size room this is not the place. As I long time and frequent user of the IHG group hotels I have had a far better overall experience staying in a standard Holiday Inn.

Principally the room sizes are very disappointing, there is literally no room to place your belonging beyond the wardrobe, such as toiletry bags have to be left on the bathroom floor due to lack of shelves, once the excessive cushion are removed from the bed there is no place to store them apart from the floor, bedside units are cluttered with hotel paraphernalia and there is little room to even charge a phone, no coat hooks etc. The toilets is wedged so far into the corner combined with the placement of the roll holder you need to be an acrobat to use it. The room is overcrowded with a chair, stool, bench, table etc, in all very badly designed and is trying to fit too much in.

As an IHG diamond member the typical member greetings  from reception are replaced with being handed a paper print out of the benefits I get from being a diamond member…. All of which I can read on the app anyway and already know. Furthermore an upgrade room was not offered as they seem to overlook this benefit at the Kimpton.

In summary, whilst very attractive and well placed hotel it is certainly not worth the cash value, I wish I had booked a Holiday Inn for less money, more space and a far better experience as a Diamond member.  

Would I stay here again, no.

Do I think this is a 5 star luxury stay, absolutely not",3,2023,02,24
124,Always a great stay!,"Immaculate room on in a small suite. Nice views of park and sunset. The staff was extremely helpful and lovely! The bar and room service were excellent. Food came hot and delicious. Thank you kitchen chefs! This is our go to hotel. Convenient location!  Coming back again and again! Comfy, cozy and clean!",5,2023,02,23
124,Business visit,"Very professional and curtious staff 
Room well cleaned
Due breakfast grade lowered from 5 to 4,
low quality and quantity selection of food
ie fried egg looked miserable
Even though breakfast low quality I would recommend hotel because of all other qualities 
Good gymn

Excellent location",4,2023,02,23
124,Wonderful hotel in a lovely part of town,"Amazing location. Stunning hotel and architecture! Staff were lovely! The garden view rooms are perfect- excellent views. Comfortable bed, great bathroom, truly not one negative thing to say! Will be back!",5,2023,02,22
124,Beautiful and excellent service hotel,"This is a beautiful hotel, it’s clean, elegant with polite and friendly staff. We were greeted nicely by every member of staff, and nothing was too much of an ask. Our hotel room was immaculately cleaned every day with new bedding and towells. The bed was so comfy we struggled to wake up and leave! The doormen are especially helpful and welcoming when enetering and leaving. Gunther the guest relations manger asked us for any feedback when we checked out, he was very polite and interested in our feedback. 

Room service was wonderful and each staff member who brought us what we asked for was wonderful. 

I would 10000% recommend this hotel it’s 5*, we can’t wait to come back!",5,2023,02,22
124,Simply The Best!,"The Kimpton Fitzroy is top tier, truly one of the best hotel stays of my life. This was my first time visiting London and after combing through what felt like hundreds of options, I chose this hotel based on positive reviews, location, and the beautiful rooms (I went for the suite to treat my friend and I to an epic girls weekend). 

We had a rough start with check-in, to the point of almost regretting my decision to stay here, but all was corrected and the rest was a dream. The service is what makes this place so special--they listen, truly go above & beyond to delight you, and exceed your expectations with thoughtful touches.

The suite was nicer than my apartment and I didn't want to leave. Heavenly beds, spacious bathrooms with heated floors and towel racks, delicious snacks and beverages, really any amenity you can imagine they had thought of. After long days of walking and sightseeing, nothing sweeter than coming back to your room that's been turned down for you, taking a nice soak in the tub, with a beverage in hand. The evening cocktail receptions are also a nice treat.

I could go on and on, but you really need to stay here and experience it for yourself. You will not be disappointed. Thank you to the wonderful staff for all that you do. Warm welcome from Farhana, course correction and royal treatment from Kajol, and local recommendations/assistance from Gunther and Marco. Hope to return very soon!",5,2023,02,20
124,This could become my go-to London hotel - loved it!,"Fantastic stay! Absolutely loved this hotel. 

The staff were superb and the genuine, warm, caring service is what really makes this hotel - special shout out for Carlos and Aristide on reception for their charm & helpfulness, and Dorine for her professionalism, efficiency and care.

The hotel is super grand with luxurious beautifully designed rooms - they have thought of everything right down to the complimentary organic chocolate and popcorn in the rooms, a yoga mat and a mini fridge. 

There is an amazing, good value room service menu full of things I actually want to eat, including both healthy and treat options. 

The Galvin restaurant is wonderful. 

There was a problem with my original room, so I had to move rooms, and they upgraded me to a Queen Superior which was lovely, and went above and beyond to compensate for the issues. 

There's a few tiny areas for improvement: collecting food trays more quickly (my breakfast tray sat outside all day until 10pm one day, even though the room was cleaned) and it would be good to have full length hanging space in the single rooms. 

Location is great, the doormen and concierge are great, in fact all front of house team are so polished and warm, and it's so unusual to find this level of consistency. 

I have already booked to stay again! This could become my go-to London hotel. 

",5,2023,02,20
124,Amazing hotel in the centre of town.,"Incredible hotel, excellent location, hard to fault in any way. What makes it really stand out is the staff, from front desk team, porters, wait staff, so friendly and helpful. Nice size gym. My only tip I would give is to try and make it to breakfast early otherwise there can be a wait for a table. No big deal. I will definitely be back!!!",5,2023,02,20
124,A true 5 star London experience,"I stayed at the Kimpton over the Christmas holidays and through the new year. I was at the hotel for almost 3 weeks and got to experience every amenity that the hotel had to offer. Simply put, this hotel is my new favorite in the city. I like to stay at 5 star hotels in London and I can tell you a couple of things. The Savoy is gaudy experience that seems empty. The Ritz is too crazy to offer any real attention to their guests. On the other hand, the Kimpton Fitzroy is a beautiful hotel sufficiently set a short walking distance to Mayfair. Your needs are anticipated at Kimpton and nothing is too big of a hassle for the staff. For example, the manager, Isabel had emailed me a week before our arrival and asked if she could do anything special for us. I asked for a Christmas tree. She said “leave it to me.” A day later, she sent me a picture of two trees (one for each suite) asking “will this be ok?” It was perfect. I had not told her anything beyond a request for a tree and it was like she read my mind. That’s what you hope for from a great hotel. 

The staff intuits when you want something and when you want to be left alone. Galvin Restaurant cannot be missed and the staff made special last minute accommodations for us during the holidays, twice. The hotel’s proximity to the British museum and a bunch of great pubs were delightful. The doormen made friends with my son and even found him another friend his age to hang out with while the wife and I were out to dinner. What an experience. Gunter looked after our transports and checking in and out was a breeze.

This is the best hotel in London. No question. Book it now.",5,2023,02,18
124,Luxurious and Beautiful,"Magnificent hotel that is well located in Russell Square in London. Hotel is visually stunning and your jaw may drop as you enter the splendid lobby. Staff was very warm and kind, immediately coming to assist me when I entered and swiftly took my bags to assist me. Front desk staff were efficient and very polite/professional. Everyone who you ran into would say hello, ask how your stay was, which impressed me. The rooms were clean, comfortable, spacious. The bathroom was really beautiful and I enjoyed the shower. I do think it would be helpful to keep a small card in the bathroom explaining how to operate the shower/bath because there are a lot of faucets and it took some trial and error to figure out how to operate the shower. Overall a really beautiful hotel that was well worth the money and I am glad I stayed here.",5,2023,02,18
124,Great spot,"Really great central location, with great breakfast and a funky adjacent coffee bar / cafe. We also really enjoyed the bar and some of the unique cocktails. Park across if you feel like a walk, felt like a safe area and near enough to central London without being too busy",4,2023,02,18
124,Only wish we stayed more Nights !,"This hotel is a jewel ! 
and its easy to see why ! the staff are exceptional ! 
I could bang on all day ! all the other 5 star reviews speak for themselves ! 
make sure you book the breakfast its  definitely worth it !",5,2023,02,16
124,My Stay at the Kimpton Fitzroy Hotel,"I had the best stay at the hotel, from entering to leaving I could not have asked for better staff and lovely food and the accommodation was wonderful.  This is a gem of a hotel and I would recommend it most highly.  I would Personally like to thank Olivia. Karina, Sophie, Gunther and all the other staff for their kindness.  I look forward to seeing you again soon 😋😊",5,2023,02,14
124,"Fabulous hotel, beautiful room.","We stayed in a suite as a birthday gift. Everything was perfect from check-in to check-out. The staff are amazing, the suite was out of this world and spotlessly clean. All of the decor in the public rooms is wonderful.
Also thanks to Mick from maintenance for his assistance.",5,2023,02,13
124,An absolutely incredible stay at this perfect hotel !,"My partner & I were visiting London for 3 nights and we could not have chosen a more gorgeous hotel than the Kimpton Fitzroy Hotel in Fitzrovia. 

First, it’s the best location because you are minutes from SoHo, Covent Garden, Marylebone & Mayfair whether you’re walking or riding the Underground, which has a station right behind the hotel. You’re literally close to the best museums, shopping, restaurants & parks in London. But the best part is that it’s more local people than tourists so you can enjoy the city without feeling overwhelmed. 

The hotel is historic & absolutely gorgeous. No detail has been overlooked in the re/design of this hotel. While everything is modern & updated like the beautiful, comfortable rooms to the stunning restaurants, you definitely feel a part of its long history.

But the best part of the Fotzroy experience is the staff. Gunther & his staff in Guest Relations make you feel so special & taken care of whether it’s making restaurant reservations for you or asking you how your day was. We had delicious breakfasts in both restaurants and our servers in both were fantastic. Our French server at Burr & Co. was the most wonderful way to wake up every morning with such a positive, calming attitude - she was beyond fantastic :) In all honesty, the entire staff made us feel excited & special and we couldn’t thank them more for an unbelievable experience 

Though it was difficult to leave today, we can’t wait to come back !!

10 stars  ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

Thank you Kimpton Fitzroy team !

124,One of London’s finest hotels for sure ,"Amazing hotel - an exquisite property with phenomenal  rooms,,amenities, restaurants and staff.  It’s a great location adjacent to an underground station making it very easy to get anywhere - and it’s also in walking distance to many of London’s top sights and attractions. Gunther , in guest relations, is the most professional and skilled customer service provider I have ever encountered.  The entire staff went above and beyond from check in to check out.  The concierge was able to get us hard to get last minute reservations.  Both of the on site  restaurants are great too and highly recommended  especially for breakfast.  The Kimpton Fitzroy is a first class property all around. ",5,2023,02,11
124,Amazing hotel!,Beautiful hotel- brilliant location and so central! Just a few stops from Leicester square but quiet enough that you escape the hustle and bustle. Brilliant free upgrade to a beautiful suite for being IHG members! Beautiful decor- faultless! Discovered a “secret” free bar on floor 1- run by Gunther who was extremely friendly and charismatic! You would struggle to find a better hotel than the Fitzroy,5,2023,02,11
124,Amazing Birthday Treat,"Once again, an utterly fantastic stay at The Kimpton.  Special thanks to Sophie, the Lobby Manager and her team for making it SUCH a special surprise for my wife's birthday. Would never hesitate in returning.",5,2023,02,10
124,Excellent stay! Highly recommend it!,"The hotel was perfect in all the ways. The room was super cozy and had a very warm feel to it. The staff were incredibly polite and helpful, especially Gunther, the manager. Its got a beautiful lobby giving you that royal feel. I would highly recommend for anyone looking to experience great hospitality!",5,2023,02,09
124,Improved a lot,"The hotel building is worth a visit by itself, just to admire the architecture, the noble materials and the professional and knowledgeable refurbishment that has bought this London classic to modern time.
We had been there twice in the last times, with just one week in between the two and, after highlighting the remarkably obvious weak points first time, a dramatic improvement has been made visible in our last stay, with better and more professional check-in process, better breakfast service and quality and range of available options.",4,2023,02,08
124,Fab hotel!!!,"A really lovely hotel. This was our second stay having been recommended the hotel by a good friend and it hasn't disappointed at all on either stay.

The building and its history add to the character of your stay and the room was excellent. Really clean, a lovely big bed with crisp white bedding. 

The staff, which there are plenty of, can't seem to do enough for you and overall it is a hotel that I would highly recommend!!",5,2023,02,06
124,Excellent Stay,"We came to London for the very first time for a birthday trip and I am so glad I booked the Kimpton Fitzroy. The hotel itself is beautiful and the location was great. There was quick and close access to the “underground” which is their subway/transportation system. The staff were pleasant and Angela made us feel welcome right at check in. Gunther, from guest services was outstanding. He made sure we had a great stay, and even helped recommend things to do or places to eat! We stayed for 5 nights and we ran into him a few times and he always checked in on us to make sure we were having a great vacation. The continental breakfast was also great. There are a few restaurant/bars and a coffee shop right inside the property which was a nice added bonus. I highly recommend this hotel.",5,2023,02,05
124,Kimpton London stay,Highly recommend and definitely would stay again. Gunther from guest services was the best! Super nice welcoming. Even went out of his way to set us up with reservations at another popular bar. The Kimpton was a beautiful hotel with really nice staff members. Would love to revisit.,5,2023,02,05
124,This hotel is a keeper on my business travel list in London. Loved my stay.,"Extremely polite and professional staff, location, and the sheer beauty of this hotel make this a keeper for my business travel to London. I stayed in a single room that was extremely well appointed with water, free snacks (popcorn and chocolate :-)  ), a frig, and nice quality toiletries.  Any sundries I might have forgotten at home, like toothpaste, a bag for my liquids for the airport, etc--could be requested from the desk. I didn't need this service, but it was nice to have a card in the bathroom to let me know what was available if I needed it. The curtains were also fantastic for making sure the room was completely dark until I needed to be up which was great. A pod coffee maker was available in the room as well.  
My rate came with breakfast which was very very nice. You have a choice of the two restaurants OR you can pay a tray fee and have breakfast delivered to your room if you prefer. Breakfast might include continental, or depending on the restaurant you could request a full English breakfast, Eggs Benedict omelettes, eggs, espresso coffees, American pancakes, and more! It was a very nice deal and the food was good. The service in both restaurants was diverse and extremely friendly which I really loved. What I also loved in particular was the music playing in both restaurants which was mellow and really boosted my mood before my work day before I hopped on the Tube at the easily accessible Russell Square stop (Piccadilly line---very short distance walk from station) and went on my way to work.  
I have stayed at several business hotels in London in the last year and the most important thing for me was a comfortable and quiet room.  The room was clean, nicely arranged, had a huge bathroom, and a small luxury tub/shower.  No question in my mind, the Kimpton had the best bed and linens out of every hotel I stayed this year. Not the poshest or softest, but I slept well for a change. The thermostat wasn't the simplest thing for me to understand but I was able to adjust the temperature in my room effectively for a change as well. I was on the first floor so I could hear noise from events going on from the ground level until about 11PM and then it was quiet. It wasn't terrible but if you are sensitive to noise you might request a higher level floor. It was not enough for me to feel I needed to move and I did sleep very well.

Would I stay here again? No question in my mind, I would absolutely stay at the Kimpton Fitzroy again in a heartbeat. The staff at this hotel work very hard clearly. They made sure I felt appreciated and welcome as a guest and I loved that. It made my work week so much better.",5,2023,02,04
124,Magical Holiday Stay,"We stayed right before Christmas and had a wonderful time.  In a fantastic location blending a quiet street facing a park but within walking distance of the British Museum and so many other must see attractions, this was the perfect location.  The tube was easily accessible as well.  The hotel was beautifully decorated for the holidays with glittering lights and a majestically decorated Christmas tree by a warm glowing fireplace.  The rooms are well maintained and cleaned every day with a plentiful supply of fresh towels replaced.  The breakfast delicious with so many options.  The staff were attentive and helpful. Traveling as a family during the holidays we were so pleased to find two art kits (for creating Christmas Cards and constructing a decorative Wreath) both beautifully boxed and left as gifts in our room for our two older teens. Bravo!  This was an amazing stay!",5,2023,02,01
124,A magnificent hotel,"My recent stay at the Kimpton Fitzroy was perfect in every way.  We were greeted immediately by Gunther Schildwachter who welcomed us and took us to our rooms and explained everything.  He made sure we were comfortable and he made a dinner reservation for us.  During our stay he continued to check in. He truly made us feel at home.  He also showed us all around this magnificent restored Victorian hotel.  Over the years we have watched it being restored and were delighted to finally stay there. Both Joseph and Marco at the concierge desk helped tremendously with theater tickets and taxis. Dinner and breakfasts were also excellent. The location is superb.  The hotel is right next to the Russell Square station and Russell Square.  It's a short walk to the West End and Covent Garden. The rooms are very comfortable and the beds and pillows  are as well. It was also a treat to have free water, popcorn and chocolate provided. My only complaint was the volume of the music in the dining room.  It could be softer. We loved our stay and are looking forward to making this our London hotel of choice. A huge thank you to everyone there who made our stay memorable.
",5,2023,01,30
124,Nice hotel in great location,"The hotel is very convenient to the tube, British museum, walking distance to Kings Cross. The breakfast was basic but still did the job. the room was nicely decorated but pretty tight. It's London, I guess. 
We enjoyed our stay, and I would suggest it to others as well.  ",4,2023,01,29
124,Wonderful experience,"Lovely hotel located right by Russell Square. I usually tend to lean towards smaller, boutique hotels but for as big as Kimpton Fitzroy is (334 rooms), I really had a very nice, personalized experience here.

Property is gorgeous and the restaurant (Galvin's) and bar (Fitz's) were both excellent. I was telling friend that rarely do I give such accolades to a hotel bar but Fitz's was quite special, from the cocktails to service. I came back days later after check-out and the server (Akira?) still remembered me. That's how personal they are. They also offer a social hour from 5-6pm of free drinks for guests which is a nice touch.

In all areas of the hotel, plenty of space to spread about, and the staff is kind and accommodating. Rooms are also a good size, including the bathroom.

I accidentally left my blazer there upon departure but Mark from Security was so friendly and professional with helping me arrange pickup. All in all just a 5 star experience across the board, and will be back.",5,2023,01,29
124,A Very Merry Christmas at the Fitzroy ,"Staying at the Kimpton Fitzroy for Christmas was absolutely delightful. Even before my stay, my interaction with the concierge team (Marco is the best!) was excellent.

The Fitzroy is stunningly beautifully and was so beautifully decorated for Christmas. The location is wonderful in that it’s close to so many things yet far enough away to create a sense of peace and calm. Being Inner Circle and IHG Diamond, the upgrade to a suite for my first 3/6 days was lovely and most appreciated! The warm tile floors were heavenly.

Absolutely loved the creative cocktails at The Fitz Bar and also loved the delicious Shakshouka as a breakfast option at the more casual cafe on property.

Finally, the way the GM and AGM handled one major and a few minor issues that arose during my stay speaks volumes to their commitment to outstanding service and attention to detail. I highly recommend the Fitzroy and look forward to my next stay when the spring theatre season begins!",5,2023,01,27
124,Retaining its crown as the best European Kimpton,"The Kimpton remains our favourite London hotel.

There is such a welcoming, comforting atmosphere on arrival at Kimpton Fitzroy. You really do feel ,you are in your London home.

We have stayed in a range of rooms from essential,to the 1 bedroom suites and they are all good, and have the same sense of luxury.  The beds and bedding are sumptuous.  The bathroom products are excellent, albeit I was disappointed to lose their original brand to the new 1969:range.

This Kimpton does all of the Kimpton extras well.  The wine hour is excellent, friendly and generous. 

Fitz’s cocktail bar has the essence of an Edwardian Speakeasy, and is a wonderful way to end your day.

Breakfast at Galvins is a great way to stater your day, with outstanding service and quality of food.

Our only disappointment is that the hotel has become mean with their room upgrades.  Despite the fact that we are Diamond Ambassador IHG members and have stayed here many times before, on our last visit which was a Sunday night in January, one of the quietest day pets in hotel calendars were were offered the minimum upgrade.  This wasn’t because there were not better room, as they said we could pay for an upgrade - even just for a park view.   It’s a shame hotels don’t look,after their regulars when they can. It was also y husbands birthday.

Despite the above disappointment we had a good stay.",5,2023,01,27
124,Angela is a star!,"I booked through Hotwire for a business trip and my fiancé was coming to join me for a night. Unfortunately, Hotwire did not inform me that it assigns room categories on booking and I ended up with a single room, and a leaky shower! Angela at the front desk was an absolute star, so kind, and did everything she could to work it out so I could change to a bigger bed for the night he arrives. Very grateful and will book directly next time!",5,2023,01,26
124,Amazing,"Amazing hotel, beautiful scenes and the staff are excellent! A massive shout out to Kajol Kamble for making the stay extraordinary. The service was 10/10 and the cocktails at the bar were to die for! I can’t wait for my next visit. ",5,2023,01,23
124,Mrs,"I had a great and amazing  stay again when visiting my daughter in London.

All the staff are great staff and nice  Angela is the best!
Good food, I forward to coming back
Super super super!
Nice rooms.  See you soon!
Thank you",5,2023,01,23
124,Last time visiting felt unwanted,"This is not the first time we have visited this hotel, and we are always very satisfied, but during our last visit we encountered a very rude hotel receptionist even twice.  The second time was on a Saturday evening when we called to ask if we could get a late check-out option.  The communication of the hotel employee was unpleasant, cold, she seems to have no experience with customers, and is not interested in maintaining the excellent name of the hotel.  We were disappointed.  We would like to believe that this is just an isolated incident and that the hotel staff will perform flawlessly on our next visits. ",3,2023,01,22
124,Fantastic stay!,"Hotel is very clean and located in a great area - at Russel square, 5-10 min walk to British museum and 15 min to Soho. Hotel also features 4 restaurants / bars - so plenty of choice!
But what really made my stay special is people! The whole team is extremely welcoming and will go an extra mile to make you feel super comfortable (reception team, doorkeepers, concierges, cafe team)
Special thanks to Victoria and Chrystina - they have ensure the personal touch throughout my stay, and was there for me for any special request!
Highly recommended!",5,2023,01,22
124,Delightful,The Kimpton Fitzroy London is absolutely gorgeous! The staff was so helpful and kind. The breakfast was delicious with unlimited coffee!! The Christmas decorations were stunning. We were greeted by friendly staff and a warm fire at 2:00 am We will definitely stay here again. ,5,2023,01,20
124,We had a wonderful time!,"We had a wonderful time at the Fitzroy!
We especially loved the guest services. All of the folks in the bars and restaurants were kind and welcoming. We enjoyed the food and the atmosphere. It is such a beautiful hotel. We hope to come back and stay here again next year.",5,2023,01,19
124,Excellent - Five Star Service,"We stayed here for the first time in a while.

This visit was faultless, the staff were all helpful and friendly and nothing was too much trouble.

The Accessible Suite is amazing and it is great to be able to get round most of the rooms in the Suite.

The hotel is very customer service orientated and this shows with every staff member.",5,2023,01,18
124,Petcation is fun in here,"Staying with my princess dog in this hotel is a great experience.  Everyone is so friendly and welcoming.  The dog staying is no extra charge and they are so thoughtful to provide two dog bowls and a dog bed, my dog loved her comfy bed.  The hotel is in a good location for many dog friendly places and direct opposite to a park for her nature calls.",5,2023,01,16
124,Unforgettable stay !!!,"You won’t forget this hotel and create unforgettable memories here.
Wow effect when you arrive, day or night the historical building is magical.
Amazing service, smiles from all employees, this place makes you feel at home.
If you wish to have a drink or a casual meal or a fancy meal, the bar and the two restaurants are perfect. And breakfast is delicious.
I just love this place, it’s my second time here and I l will absolutely be back very soon !",5,2023,01,15
124,"Stunning hotel, amazing service & incredible amentities!","Incredible hotel with exceptional service and staff! Each area is beautifully kept and has its own character/decor so it felt like I got multiple experiences from one place. An amazing location too! The room was immaculate and despite being in a busy area, you would have never known from the room! The ambience of the entire hotel was fantastic.",5,2023,01,14
124,Night away,"We had a lovely night away at the Kimpton. We usually stay at the Intercontinental in Park Lane but I must say that the Kimpton has raised the bar in terms of customer service and character of the property. The guest relations manager, Gunter was very friendly and took time out to chat with us. Highly recommended.",5,2023,01,14
124,Absolute standout hotel in London!,"What a fabulous hotel, cannot recommend highly enough! My husband stayed here with my daughters a few months ago, so when we were planning a return trip for the four of us they all immediately said this was the place we needed to stay again. With all of the options in London, I thought that was a big statement, but now that we have been here I could not agree more. The hotel itself is beautiful, the beds are incredibly comfortable, the food and drink fabulous, and the service impeccable! Everyone has been beyond kind and helpful - the concierge staff is unsurpassed. Thrilled to have found this gem in this magnificent city, and already can’t wait until our next visit!",5,2023,01,14
124,Short stay @ fabulous Hotel,"Amazing hotel, location ideal, for visiting UCL and the British Museum, decor is stunning and very helpful friendly staff. Staff couldn't have been more helpful. Top hotel but represents good value. I will be back very soon",5,2023,01,14
124,Great old world hotel,"Wonderful hotel in a super location in central London. Staff all super friendly and efficient. 

Stayed 1 night in a standard queen essentials room which was spotlessly clean albeit quite small for a five star hotel room and very well maintained. Bathroom was clean with nice toiletries and plenty of towels.

Stayed 2 nights in a king suite which was amazing, spacious with a four poster bed and lovely large bathroom. Again spotlessly clean and very comfortable.

Social hour is a very nice touch to chill out with a glass of wine after a day of sightseeing. Breakfast good although we have found other hotels provide much better choice and selection of hot dishes for a hotel in this class, service was very quick and friendly.

All in all it was a super 3 nights at this hotel and would definitely stay here again.",5,2023,01,14
124,"Fabulous, top class!","We stayed here last night for my husbands Company Christmas Dinner and drinks.
Lovely welcome and all the team here are so friendly and helpful.
Beautiful hotel with stunning architecture inside and out.  
Had happy drinks in the bar then pre dinner drinks in the ballroom.
Fantastic meal of salmon, brisket of beef and gateaux - all cooked to perfection. 
All the staff are amazing especially guest relations.
Thank you to the lady in the black Ralph Lauren dress (guest relations) for finding my earring and delivering it to me in the bar.
Top class 5 star hotel. 
Would definitely stay here again.",5,2023,01,14
124,Partners Birthday,"I would like to thank the staff at the Kimpton.

The staff offered 5* friendly service.

Every detail thought of! 

The hotel is stunning, clean, and quiet.  I highly recommend the Kimpton.

 Perfect location, stunning decor and fabulous staff. 
Bur and Co is lovely for breakfast.

124,Superb,"Amazing, Friendly Staff. Hosted a business event and did a superb job. Amazing knowledge of London. The interior of the hotel is gorgeous and really took you away from the Centre of London. Would 100% go again",5,2023,01,13
124,Love Kimpton Hotel Fitzroy,"I love Kimpton hotel brands and I lucked upon this hotel with my vacation planning and really enjoyed my stay. First, the hotel has all the amenities you'd expect at a 4- or 5-star hotel, including 2 restaurants, a concierge, bellman, and a gym. It's also right near the underground stop Russell Square. So I could get around like a pro or Uber. The hotel was still decorated for Christmas and is quite lovely. Also, the food at both hotel restaurants was  quite good and the staff was helpful. I would definitely stay again. London is quite expensive, so being near a underground stop is essential. Also, there are lots of places to eat nearby and also the British Museum in walking distance. Admittedly, the location is not as central as say Knightridge , but I enjoyed my stay and look forward to my return. I might book that next trip now. Lol 
Enjoy and cheers, mate 🍻 ",5,2023,01,13
124,Very disappointed,"Hmm. This is tricky. It’s a beautiful building with a  history, the public areas are great, and it has a veneer of a 5 star luxury brand, but the story stalls there.

This once grand building has maintained its outwards magnificence, and beautiful marble interior, but once leaving the public areas, cracks appear in the facade.

Rooms are less than functional for the modern traveller and extremely small. With scatter cushions everywhere, there is barely any floorspace.

The rooms are draughty, and air conditioning is noisy and inefficient. Courtyard views look out upon air conditioning units.

No shower gel but shampoo and conditioner. Hand gel and lotion barely fitting under the bathroom shelf.

The shower head dribbling dismally with multiple streams in a multitude of directions.

No master light switch, so a nightly round of all fixtures and fittings before bed.

Common to many hotels, unable to stream my Apple devices, but Android is just fine. Is this 2010?!

Sorry. I expected Radisson, and got Premier Inn (with a nice cocktail bar and concierge service).",3,2023,01,12
124,Mrs.,Excellent hotel! The rooms are beautiful and spacious. The staff were very helpful and friendly! Great location and public transportation is easily accessible. I highly recommend booking a stay here!!,5,2023,01,12
124,10/10 - 5 stars!,Very good customer service! The bar is also really nice and the cocktails are excellent. We got a room with a king bed. It is very spacious and the bathroom is also huge. Highly recommend this hotel! ,5,2023,01,12
124,"Beautiful hotel, great room and outstanding service!",Stayed here for a week long business trip and spent a fair amount of time in hotel for meetings and meals. Everything was amazing! Rooms were beautiful and beds were super comfy! The overall space is gorgeous. But the highlight was the staff. Every person we met was kind and accommodating. This will be our go to hotel when in London.,5,2023,01,12
124,Great hotel + staff!!,"We’ve had a great experience at the hotel! Great people working at the hotel that we’re going above and beyond.

We’ve experienced an issue where the phone of my wife went missing, but with the help from the staff, it was found again and couldn’t have wished for more!

This is definitely a great hotel and I’ll certainly come back with the family!

Renu was a great person as well and the kids really loved her!",5,2023,01,12

I wanted to arrange something special for my girlfriend upon arrival, Khrystyna from guest relations helped me with this immensely and even upgraded my room (as I'm a platinum elite member). I'll never forget my wonderful experience at Kimpton. Thank you Khrystyna ",5,2023,01,11

Looking forward to returning!",5,2023,01,10
124,Fabulous Hotel,"Great location and great building. Wonderful hotel and interiors and great vibe for any occasion. 
Easy to walk to Covent Garden etc, tube station wry handy and lots of shops within a few minutes walk. 
Fabulous & very friendly staff, would definitely would stay again",5,2023,01,09
124,What a wonderful hotel,This was the 4th time I stayed at this hotel. The suites are spacious and overall lovely. The staff is very kind and so helpful. The atmosphere is super welcoming and the architecture is gorgeous. 10/10 would highly recommend.,5,2023,01,09
124,Wonderful stay,Mother daughter trip to London and we both absolutely loved this hotel!! The building is stunning and was even more beautiful decorated for Christmas. The staff were extremely friendly. We did arrive early from our flight and our room was ready which is always a bonus. The rooms were super clean and well decorated. The heated towel rack was a great touch!! Location was perfect for us as we used the tube for most travel and it was right around the corner. Breakfast was included in our package and was full of choices and delicious both times we ate there. Very nice atmosphere in the restaurant area as well. Just an overall gorgeous place!! Very happy we chose this hotel over some others on the list!! Would love to return someday!!,5,2023,01,08
124,Nice and I will return,"I booked the smallest room with a twin bed which turned out to be perfect as I spent most of my time out exploring until the evening. While the room was tiny, the bathroom was a nice size especially the size of the shower. I like the value I got for it. It’s a handsome hotel. 

Room for improvement: The quality of room service food was average. The air condition in the room didn’t get cold enough for me. I had it set at 19°C but it didn’t get that cold. I called the front desk and they said they could fix it remotely but it didn’t change. I was too lazy to move rooms after long days out.",4,2023,01,08
124,Extraordinary service and beautiful rooms ,"Such an amazing place, extraordinary service and perfect location! Rooms are beautiful and meet all expectations of a 5 star hotel, we will definitely come back to Kimpton when traveling to London again!",5,2023,01,08
124,Amazing hotel and very well connected,"Beautiful rooms, lovely atmosphere and really lovely staff! We had another wonderful stay (as we visited this time last year too) and enjoyed the wide range of facilities and the beautiful architecture. Can’t wait to come again :)",5,2023,01,08
124,Fantastic hotel,Came here last year as a treat and we loved it so much we came back. A really stunning hotel in a perfect spot for tori g around London. The staff are incredibly friendly and helpful. The choice of bars and restaurants is very good. The rooms are large and very comfortable. I loved the bed so much last year I went home and orders the same mattress. Basically I love this hotel! ,5,2023,01,08
124,Great stay at the Kimpton Fitzroy London,In London for a conference we enjoyed a stay at the historic Fitzroy hotel. Service was outstanding. Special thanks to Gunther Schildwachter in guest relations who took personal interest in every detail of our stay. Great location and restaurant options as well.,5,2023,01,08
124,Holiday Trip,"I have not posted in “forever.” But felt compelled
 to provide feedback. 

The experience was overwhelming positive. The hotel is grand. Our suite was wonderful. And the location was great. 

Concern surrounds service. While everyone seemed to want to provide excellence. The hotel (perhaps the overall management fell short). 

Room service and other requests were spotty. And check in took way too long (they had incorrect information in terms of room type upon check in. The front desk was helpful and corrected the issues. However - the hotel seemed a bit understaffed and while lovely - I don’t think translates to a 5 star hotel from a service perspective. 

All that said - the overall experience was positive and I would recommend this property if you place weight on rooms and hotel restaurant amenities. 

If you are looking for flawless 5star hotel service / it’s not the location for you.",4,2023,01,07
124,Phenomenal Place to Spend Christmas and Get Engaged,"I usually stay at Kimpton hotels, but this is one of the very best. The hotel is magical and an architectural gem. Likewise, every single staff member was exceptional. There was not one person who was not helpful or welcoming. I want to specifically thank the guest relations staff Gunther, Kajol and Sophie specifically, as they helped me make my visit memorable- and assisted me even before my stay there- so I was able to plan a proposal to my partner on Christmas morning. With their help, I was able to pull off a special proposal by beautifully decorated Christmas tree and fireplace in the lobby, have flowers waiting and a bottle of champagne in the room.  The rooms were wonderful, the location was excellent for getting around London, and the hotel was overall a quiet and comfortable haven to return to each day. The food at the Galvin was also superb. This will be my go to hotel in London moving forward. Everything about my stay exceeded expectations. 

Overall it was amazing and I'd especially recommend this hotel as an LGBTQ+ Affirming  one!",5,2023,01,06
124,The Best Hotel in London,"I stayed in so many five star hotels in London and this one is defo my favourite. The staff are so friendly and the buildings is very very posh and clean! 

I would recommend this piece of art to any London visitors who are interested in staying in luxury hotels.",5,2023,01,04
124,Merry Cozy Classy,"I visited the Fitzroy in mid November and it was THE perfect place to kick of the holidays! So many reasons to love this property but here are just a few….super easy to get to from LHR on the Piccadilly line, the hotel is literally half a block away (was able to run through the raindrops without an umbrella!). Given the proximity to the college there were lots spots to grab a bite and not break the bank…and a super cute pub just across the street on the back side. There’s a Tedesco for snacks and water etc. The hotel faces Russell Square and those rooms get great light and feel just a little bit bigger. It’s the UK so be realistic in your expectations on space, it’s right but the bathroom was a really decent size and the shower pressure great! The Palm Court (I believe that was the name) was booked with events everyday I was there but I did sneak in to sit have a tea and do some work calls…all my zoom colleagues were jealous of the grievous space. There are at least three or four bus stops within a block or two that can get you most places in the city without issue. I’m a local by day luxury by night traveler so I loved grabbing coffee (there’s a spot on the corner or the in house Burr & Co) and sitting in the square or at a window to read. I can recco a bunch of great eats and bus lines for anyone still reading! Clearly I loved it and it will be part of my annual tradition to get there to start of every Holiday Season.",5,2023,01,03
124,Wedding at the Kimpton Fitzroy London,"We recently got married at the Kimpton Fitzroy London on 10 December and cannot rate this hotel and their team highly enough.

Karina Bertolino da Silva, our wedding coordinator put us at ease right from the start. She coordinated all of our many external suppliers and the hotels internal staff seamlessly on the day, taking away any stress from the bride and groom. She and the team went over and above for the smooth running of the day, providing advice and the attention to detail when it came to service was second to none.

We are excited that we can return to the Kimpton for our anniversary every year and relive what an amazing day we had. 

Aoife & Andy",5,2023,01,03
124,Great hotel in the heart of London.,Very friendly staff all around and great environment. The cafe and bars really helped to step up the experience. Amenities and everything else are also top notch. I would highly recommend this place for a good time in london.,5,2023,01,02
124,Stylish Room & Lovely Breakfast,"My Stay was Very Enjoyable and the staff were very nice. The rooms are beautiful and comfortable, My Platinum Elite Status was recognised and I received an upgrade which was very appreciated.  

The Breakfast was also very nice and I would like to thank the restaurant staff for being attentive as I was in a rush.",3,2023,01,02
124,I keep coming back,"I keep coming back to this wonderful hotel. The rooms are, in my opinion, the best value for money in the area. Beautifully decorated, clean and comfortable. Reception staff are friendly and helpful and this time I had a great service from Kajol. My IHG Diamond status was recognized and I got a nice upgrade. Overall great experience.",5,2023,01,01
124,Beautiful Hotel ,"The hotel was beautiful. A very good blend of modern luxury with being an old historic building.

The staff were on top of things and there are many options to dine and wine. Location is very good so that helps.

Got the basic room as used points and I would say the room could be bigger. No complaints. 

All in all excellent hotel and will surely recommend. ",5,2022,12,31
124,Lovely stay in an opulent historic hotel,"My wife and I stayed for a couple of nights, shortly before Christmas, to celebrate her 50th birthday. In December 2019 we had afternoon tea in Fitz's Bar and were determined to come back and stay - we were not disappointed.

The Kimpton Fitzroy has a fascinating history (as the Russell) prior to a thorough restoration of its opulent interiors. The public spaces are extensive and beautiful - especially so at Christmas time! The sunken palm court in the heart of the building is glorious, and we managed a peek at the stunning ballroom behind it. The staff were, without exception, from initial booking through to checkout, friendly and helpful.

We had a king room on the 7th floor, looking into the centre of the hotel - the late Victorian architecture gave us a ""Mary Poppins"" view across the rooftops! The room was well appointed and the bed comfortable. Even though the hotel was clearly busy for the festive period it was never noisy and we had a peaceful stay. We had breakfast in both Burr (smaller a la carte cafe) and Galvin (magnificent dining room with buffet spread) - both delicious.

In terms of location, the hotel faces onto Russell Square, and it's a short walk into Soho and the West End. Bloomsbury is a part of London we could never afford to live in, but some time spent at the Kimpton Fitzroy goes a little way towards making up for that - keep up the great work, we can't wait to return!",5,2022,12,31
124,look for different hotel,"I got double charged by the hotel, spent hours on phone to resolve and still not fixed. 

make sure they don’t overcharge

beyond that an overpriced hotel for what they bring and give. I would consider stay at different hotel on that basis alone already",1,2022,12,26
124,Exceptional hospitality,"I spent a very nice stay at the Kimpton Fitzroy hotel with a fantastic staff! A special thank you to Dorine at the reception who was so helpful and caring at all time and Marco/concierge, a so nice person very professionnal and attentive to give the best advise to visit London . I came for my 60 birthday and thanks to them I felt a ""Queen"" during an amazing and magic week end!",5,2022,12,26
124,Amazing stay,"My partner and I attended an engagement party in the Palm Court and it was sensational. It was so beautiful and the food was phenomenal. We decided a few days prior to stay over and we’re so glad we did. Kajol on reception enquired about our stay and when she knew it was a special occasion she upgraded us to an amazing room. The Concierge team were fantastic obtaining some cuff links for my partner, lifesavers. To top it off, my family were having some issues walking in our high heels all night and Phillip on reception got us some slippers to change into. Amazing service all round.",5,2022,12,25
124,Outstanding Service,Having travelled around for over 40 years I haven't come across such levels of service particularly at the concierge desk where Gunther and Joseph were so helpful and nothing was too much trouble.  They were both so knowledgeable and were very patient answering my many questions.  Overall an excellent experience and I thoroughly recommend this hotel.  Within a nice leisurely walking distance from Oxford Street.,5,2022,12,22
124,Spectacular hotel in the heart of London,"This is definitely one of, if not THE best hotel in London in my opinion. We booked a couple of nights here as I was taking my niece to see frozen at Drury Lane theatre and needed a central base to explore with my family who were visiting from the USA. Our three person suite was spectacular. The customer service was unmatched and the decor of the hotel was amazing. Attention to detail and little extra touches like the make your own card pack (for my 7 year old niece) delivered to our room made all the difference. I would definitely recommend this place and can’t wait to stay again. Thanks to Gunther and the rest of the team for an unforgettable experience. We will definitely be back",5,2022,12,21
124,My favourite,"This hotel is my number one when staying in London, the staff, the food, the rooms, THE COFFEE.
We always receive the warmest welcome too.

Stellar service and the comfiest beds.

I couldn't recommend it anymore.",5,2022,12,21
124,"Wonderful Hotel; well appointed, friendly staffs and walking distance from the Russel station","My family and I had an amazing experience at Kimpton Firzroy hotel. Our experience started with a warm welcome on a chilly and wet London weather at the entrance of the hotel.  Check-in was a breeze by very helpful front desk staffs.  In the mean time the concierge staff had our bags ready on the cart to be delivered to our rooms.  Effortless and efficient. 
When we were ready for breakfast the time was almost up.  The restaurant staff courteously accepted my family of 6 to have our breakfast.

Breakfast was so good; wide selection and complimented by staffs with great personalities. 

We love our rooms.  Cozy and just nice for a couple.  The toilet / shower room is very clean, works perfectly and kept clean everyday by able staffs.  Our room gets cleaned everyday.  It was felt good to come ""home"" after a long day out and about to see London.

The hotel is just 2 mins away from the Russel station and walking distance from local stores and restaurants. 

Lastly, we had a great chat with Gunter from guest relations.

124,The most phenomenal hotel in London!,"Can't say enough wonderful things about our stay at the Kimpton-Fitzroy! The staff was phenomenal and did absolutely everything in their power to ensure we had the most perfect stay possible. We were treated like royalty every single day of our stay. Always greeted with smiling faces and were constantly asked if there was anything we were in need of to enhance our stay. Everything from helping book flights to Norway, making sure we had an umbrella for the rain, made us reservations at the very best restaurants for exactly what we were looking for. This hotel is truly top tier. We attribute a large part of our stay to Gunther, I believe he was one of the managers. He was so so helpful and honest with his recommendations. I wouldn't stay any other place in London but at the Kimpton-Fitzroy.",5,2022,12,20
124,"Beautiful building, faultless service, stylish & comfortable rooms, wonderful food. Would recommend!","We stayed only one night, but would have happily based ourselves for a week here. Great location for access to tube and what a wonderful building! Check in was super busy, but slick and our room was lovely, bed and pillows amazing, bathroom high quality and the products were good and plentiful. There were some lovely touches, fresh milk in the fridge (inspired). Good coffee machine, nice snacks... faultless. The hotel really is spectacular and worth a visit for a drink at the buzzy bar, it looked even more beautiful with all the Christmas decorations. We had a lovely meal at Galvins, service attentive and faultless and I had a really good steak tartare. Breakfast was cooked to order and there was a excellent quality buffet with beautiful fresh fruit, a really well made birscher, seeds/nuts and again good coffee along with smoothies and excellent pastries. 

We're delighted that we stayed here. Would recommend and will most definitely return. Keep up the good work!!",5,2022,12,19
124,Perfect,"This hotel is immaculate.
The rooms are beautiful, the public areas are lovely and staff could not be more helpful.
It is perfect as a base to explore central
London and we had a great time.
We will be back again!",5,2022,12,19
124,"5 Star all the way, Fantastic stay !","Sumptuous Hotel with excellent facilities and staff. Wonderful sleep in the comfort of a well appointed room. Everything you could wish for in a 5 star establishment. 
Breakfast in the Galvin was delicious and serving staff all smiles and attentive. Didnt want to check out - but had to go Christmas shopping and travel home. Would love to stay here again soon. Our sincere thanks to Gunther at Guest Services for his excellent attention to detail. Merry Christmas to all at the Kimpton !",5,2022,12,18
124,This is a fantastic hotel,"After our previous - very enjoyable - visit to the Kimpton Fitzroy in September we decided to spend another weekend in December, this time to enjoy London Xmas vibes.
Again we had a wonderful stay. The hotel is simply beautiful, with tasteful interiors and stylish rooms, and this time of course with a stunning christmas tree. 
The hotel has a unique atmosphere, both luxurious and laid back at the same time.
The staff is also extremely friendly and service-minded, always ready to help with anything. Special shout out to the professional concierge team handling our last minute restaurant bookings with utmost dedication. 
We will for sure be back, both for business and leisure the Kimpton Fitzroy is our no 1 choice!",5,2022,12,18
124,Wonderful Hotel & Staff,"Lovely hotel , rooms beautifully decorated and comfortable. Staff very welcoming and approachable. Cocktails in Fitz’s bar  are exquisite for that last drink before bed. Location is great for getting anywhere in the city .We stay here as often as we can, it is always our first  choice when staying in London. Highly Recommended.",5,2022,12,17
124,Beautiful hotel with lots of character,The hotel is quite stunning. Very grand and super impressive. We got a corner room facing the Main Street and it was very quite and spacious. Overall it was a lovely stay outside of the front desk staff. They are either under staffed or so incredibly slow. It took us over an hour to check in which is just too long.,4,2022,12,16
124,Anniversary Staycation & Surprise Proposal,Our stay at the Kimpton Fitzroy will forever be memorable. It is a grand and luxurious hotel and provided the perfect setting for our anniversary staycation and my surprise proposal plan. Khrystyna and the team in Guest Services were phenomenal in helping to organise the events leading up to the surprise and ensured it all went according to plan. I can’t commend her efforts enough! My fiancé had no idea and was simply enjoying the hotel experience! We loved our cosy Queen room and the food and drinks on offer at Galvin & Fitz respectively were incredible. I didn’t know much about Kimpton Fitzroy before booking but it is now definitely in my top 10 lists of London hotels. My fiancé and I hope to return someday soon!,5,2022,12,14
124,Wonderful Hotel,"Stunning hotel, super clean, lovely room. The shower was great. Lovely little pizza place behind hotel next to Russell Square tube station. Would recommend. 
Drinks rather pricey £25.00 for two small glasses of wine
",5,2022,12,13
124,My new Favourite,"Went to London for a Christmas weekend and stayed at the Kimpton Fitzroy for the first time. The staff are so helpful and friendly - nothing is too much trouble, and they are always there without being overbearing in any way.

The rooms are also good sized and well appointed - and the actual building itself was resplendent in Christmas decorations and a stunning tree in the lobby.  Some little touches like real milk in the fridge in your room to allow a proper cup of tea, and a nespresso machine made little but important additions to the norm. 

Gunther in particular seems so proud of the building, and rightly so - the design and history of the place is really something to behold (lucky George for example and the zodiac mosaic).

Looking forward to a return visit when next in London!",5,2022,12,12
124,Great experience,The hotel is a story in and of itself. The staff here is quite pleasant. I did have a bad experience with a hostess at one of the bars. But it was short lived due to the rest of the hotel staff. The history and up keep of the hotel is amazing! The food and drinks at all the bars and restaurants was amazing!!,4,2022,12,11
124,Beautiful Hotel,"We spent an amazing evening celebrating a family engagement party in Palm Court. Everything was so beautiful and well considered- the atmosphere, flowers, candlelight, food, music, cocktails, service….it was out of a movie! The staff were very nice & friendly! 
We will definitely come back to experience afternoon tea at Palm Court & some drinks afterwards at Fitz’s Bar.",5,2022,12,11
124,Luxurious Xmas stay,"Had a lovely 2 night stay for our annual pantomime theatre trip. Staff so welcoming & friendly. Rooms & guest areas spotlessly clean. Good size bedroom & very comfy bed. Sunday lunch was out of this world! Such a nice experience. 
Will definitely return.",5,2022,12,11
124,Wow!,"I recently attended an engagement party at the Kimpton Fitzroy London in the Palm Court room. I don’t usually write reviews but I felt compelled as I was so wowed by everything about this hotel! The service was more than excellent, I felt like I had paid a million pounds to be there. The picturesque Palm Court is just beautiful and such a perfect place to host a party, especially a special day. The hotel had the Christmas decorations up in the lobby and throughout the hotel, it looked and felt amazing! It’s definitely the best hotel I’ve been to in London. If you’re looking for somewhere to host a party or even stay, don’t look a second longer! Book, you won’t regret it!",5,2022,12,11
124,Special place for a meal in London,"went for a celebration lunch with the family  - including a restless messy 1 year old.  Food was excellent and reasonably priced for the quality, setting, location, etc.  Service was very good- very professional but also personal and friendly.  Definitely recommend it!",5,2022,12,11
124,Wonderful Stay,"We just spent three nights here and enjoyed every minute. The room was on the sixth floor and had a separate sitting room besides the bedroom. Both rooms overlooked the square. We also had a roll top bath as well as a separate shower. The place was spotless and towels etc was replaced daily. There are two breakfast rooms to choose from.

We were in London for the theatre and shopping so after a long day, especially with the extremely cold weather, we enjoyed a good nights sleep every night.

This was our second visit to this hotel and would highly recommend staying here.
",5,2022,12,10
124,A wonderful and warm moment in december,"A wonderful place, with a beautiful view on the Park.
We slept like babies in the wonderful beds, everything was made to please us.
The team was awesome, thanks for everything, we probably never been received like this before.
Special thanks to Gunther who take good cares of us for the welcome and gave nice advises to visit the town.",5,2022,12,10
124,Fantastic Hotel with excellent service,I stayed at the Fitzroy for 2 days while in London on business. The hotel is absolutely beautiful and the staff could not be more helpful. Service with a smile from the front door to the cleaning staff. It is a great location and very quite as well even for the central location,5,2022,12,09
124,Beautiful hotel in a very nice location,"It's my home far from home - the location is very central and walking distance to majority of the main spots such as Covent Garden, Lamb's Conduit Street, Oxford Street, King's Cross. In front of a Russel Square park which is a big advantage and close to British Museum. The personnel is very lovely and accommodating, especially Mr. Gunther who takes care that day-to-day is seamless and perfect. Rooms are super clean and I recommend to use Queen Premium for the stay with more comfort against Standard. ",5,2022,12,09
124,Blown away!!,"I got the opportunity to celebrate my engagement party at The Fitzroy and I was blown away! Everything was done to perfection, the team was very helpful and took care of every single details to make sure we were happy with our party. The level of service exceeded our expectations! 
The hotel itself is just stunning, from the majestic entrance  to Palm Court and even our bedroom, it was all so beautiful!",5,2022,12,08
124,Luxury Stay,Stunning hotel in a fantastic location.  From the moment you walk in they do everything they can to look after you. Exactly what you expect from a 5 star hotel. The concierge team are outstanding! VIP  treatment with a smile.,5,2022,12,08
124,Magical Place,"The hotel is beautiful, the rooms are comfortable and well appointed.  The coffee shop downstairs is lovely.  The bar is spectacular and staff is friendly and eager to be helpful.  The hotel location next to the underground stop is completely clutch and makes travel anywhere in the city easy.",5,2022,12,07
124,Amazing hotel!,"I have been very surprised by this hotel, the building is immaculate, in and out, the location is great, and the staff is absolutely amazing, great hospitality. I've had an amazing night, and will definitely be back.",5,2022,12,06
124,Excellent stay!,"We spent three nights at The Kimpton Fitzroy in late november. The hotel is located very conveniently for British Museum, Covent Garden, the Theatre District, etc. And the Russel Square tube is almost literally in the back yard of the hotel. The room was very nice, housekeeping efficient and the service first class. Very friendly and helpful staff. We had three breakfasts at Galvin, where one more coffee machine might be a good idea. We also enjoyed Fitz's bar with excellent drinks, tasty nibbles and a lively atmosphere.",5,2022,12,05
124,Wonderful Hotel...a real gem!,"Had dinner at the Galvin this evening. This hotel has the best customer care. My elder mother in a wheelchair was treated to superb lift service outside the main entrance. The staff especially Gunther (events management) was exceptionally friendly, helpful and went above and beyond to ensure my family was very looked after. The Galvin served wonderful food and service was top notch. 
A huge thank you to all staff at the Kimpton Fitzroy... you made us feel so special ",5,2022,12,04
124,My new favourite London hotel,"An absolutely stunning building and what a great refurb. The staff are friendly, fantastic breakfast, great bar with live music and the room was spotless. 

We had a superior room, which did feel somewhat small and basic in design, but the bathroom was beautiful.",5,2022,12,04
124,Bad service and tiny rooms,"Nicely refurbished hotel. Service was not on par. Check in agents clearly stressed out and not happy about tourists.
Rooms are horribly tiny. Booked a queen room. I travel often throughout Europe. Do not book a queen room unless it’s one person traveling only. My husband and I barely had room to walk around the bed.",3,2022,12,03
124,Quick trip to London,"Wow what an amazing hotel, just along the road from Euston Square, such a welcoming team, great breakfast and could not be more helpful.

Gunther the relations manager could not have been more accommodating
",5,2022,12,02
124,Delightful stay at the Kimpton,"I was originally scheduled to work in London and booked my stay at the Kimpton; however, when my company announced that we all needed to cancel business trips through the end of this year, I decided to go anyway (and pay for the trip). As such, I requested to reinstate my reservation with the same travel agency, at my personal expense. Thinking this all worked well (I got a confirmation), I only realized when I arrived at the Kimpton that the agency reinstated my reservation with a different room type. I arrived with my teen daughter only to find that the room type had been changed to a single room (single bed), and the hotel was fully booked. Jet lagged and frustrated, I wasn’t sure what to do. The Reception Manager, Patricia Herdoiza, took the time to understand the problem and while the hotel was fully booked, she explained that the room type provided was not suitable for my daughter and myself. She was professional and kind, and given that we were booked to stay 6 nights, she arranged for us to stay in a slightly larger room for the night, and see what she could do to move us to another room the next day. 

As luck would have it, I happened upon a familiar face from The Marylebone Hotel - Gunther Schildwachter (2018) as I was walking upstairs to the social hour. What a wonderful surprise! Gunther was helpful to me in 2018 when my travel agency made a somewhat similar mistake with my reservation and he was able to accommodate me for a long business stay. When I explained we had just arrived, he immediately wrote down my name and went to the front desk to see about my reservation. I had explained that Patricia had taken care of it, but I love his extra enthusiasm to ensure that our stay would be perfect. In the end, Patricia kept her promise and we had a comfortable, quiet room, with everything we needed. 

Overall, I highly recommend this hotel. The staff is top notch, friendly, and ready to help you at any given moment. The Galvin bar is sexy, dark, and has very creative cocktails to choose from. We had breakfast one morning in the main restaurant and it was lovely to see that the room had been designed after the Titanic’s First Class model. 

The only area where I thought could use some improvement is the cafe (Burr & Co) adjoined to the hotel. What a wonderful space to gather with friends for a coffee, drinks, and nibbles! We even watched the World Cup match (France v Denmark)! The only downside is that the staff was not as friendly as the hotel. Rarely did anyone smile or greet you without having to approach them yourself. This seemed unusual for the hotel caliber. Perhaps the staff is annoyed that students camp out there all day for the free Wi-Fi? (Maybe I would be annoyed)

In any case, I want to personally thank Patricia and Gunther for their warm hospitality and care in making sure our stay was not disrupted by the fault of the travel agency. I also celebrated my birthday during this stay and the experience was memorable and very enjoyable. 

(As a side note, we have thoroughly enjoyed Kimpton stays and have had the pleasure of more recently staying at the Rowan in Palm Springs - also highly recommend.)",5,2022,12,01
124,Lovely Stay,"I stayed here for a business trip recently for 4 nights, the rooms are small but I think that is standard in London. The room really feels 5* in terms of the quality of sheets bed bathroom etc. The staff were lovely and very helpful, thank you!",5,2022,11,30
124,"Amazing hotel, great l9cation, 5 star customer service!","This hotel is worth every penny! Every single staff member from the front desk to the cleaning staff was extremely friendly and helpful.  The hotel is gorgeous and located in an ideal location,  just minutes from the Russell Square underground station, restaurants,  Starbucks and the British Museum! The rooms were very well appointed and provided a free mini bar with beer, cokes and popcorn which was restocked every day. I cannot say enough about how fabulous the Kimpton Fitzroy was!!!",5,2022,11,29
124,"The Kimpton Fitzroy is a gorgeous hotel, but the staff is what makes it special.","Where to begin? Mr. John Buckthorn made excellent recommendations before our visit for special meals and assisted with reservations. Everything was perfect. 
Desiree, Front of House, and Sophie, Head Porter made sure that everything was just right—they truly went above and beyond. 
Special recognition to Raffi, Porter, who greeted and assisted us every day. 
The staff at Galvin, particularly Diorka, Lina, and Sara were all so professional and such lovely people—we felt incredibly well taken care of. 
Mr. Ruari McDowell went so far out of his way to assist us when our daughter needed earplugs. I just couldn’t believe the level of service we were provided. 
I asked for a cloth to clean my boots after hiking through the Lake District. Instead, my boots were retrieved from my room, cleaned beautifully, and returned to my room while I attended a West End show!  The whole Kimpton experience was like a dream! Thank you so much!",5,2022,11,29
124,"Great Stay, Great Experience","The staff was excellent, every detail was taken care of for my family. The Hotel is beautiful with a great blend of Historical charm and modern sophistication. We cannot wait to come back for Christmas",5,2022,11,29
124,Incredible Service and Amazing Stay,"I recently had a wonderful stay at the Kimpton. Each and every staff member was truly incredible. Prior to my arrival, the concierge team received many of my parcels (equipment ) On check-in I was greeted by the most amazing Angela who went above and beyond to coordinate my stay. Guther ensured everything was perfect for my event. I have stayed over 60 nights in IHG properties in the past 10 mths. Kimpton London made me feel like I was home. It was truly a pleasure to spend 8 nights at this wonderful hotel.",5,2022,11,28
124,Wonderful stay!,My family and I had a wonderful stay at the Kimpton Fitzroy. The service from the staff was wonderful and we want to especially thank two stand outs. Victoria was so helpful as we checked in at the front desk. She was professional and very pleasant. Andrea was our amazing server at breakfast the following morning. So nice and accommodating. These two ladies are great ambassadors to your hotel and you are lucky to have them on your team.,5,2022,11,28
124,Great stay and view,"Great stay and service. Great location just outside SoHo and Mayfair. Get a view of the park; it’s worth it. Room snacks and drink are great too. Gym is very useful too. 

Bar with live music is great for evening drinks.",5,2022,11,27
124,Incredible boutique hotel experience in London,"This has been my favorite hotel experience so far. The hotel itself is incredible, historic yet beautifully updated. From the common areas (restaurant, bar, cafe, fireplace, stairwells, study areas with charging ports) to the rooms, this place is a must stay. 

The bathrooms in the room were absolutely gorgeously renovated. I also used the gym several times and found it to be clean and contemporary. My only suggestion would be to include kettlebells, but that’s a pretty me-specific request. 

Also, Marco in concierge was helpful in securing dinner reservations and recommendations. When I had trouble with a shoe repair place, he offered to send a runner with my shoes and charge the room directly. How convenient!

I’m not sure what Gunter’s position is, but he did excellent work always welcoming me in the lobby and inviting me to the famous Kimpton happy hour. Thank you for making my stay and experience so special. 

Next up, Kimpton Paris! They have big shoes to fill after my time in London. ; - )",5,2022,11,25
124,The perfect stay in London.,The perfect stay in London. We arrived after an overnight flight early in the morning and being an Inner Circle member I was able to use a room to shower and relax as the Fitzroy Suite was not quite ready. Thanks to Zaine at the front desk for helping us out with that room. Now on to the hotel. This place is beautiful and in the perfect location to explore London. The Fitzroy Suite was amazing and spotless. Everyone that we met was great.,5,2022,11,21
124,Lives up to 5-star standards,"Excellent staff, wide range of services.  Special hats off to the concierge.  fantastic breakfast in the dining room.   Breakfast with a more limited menu is also available in the casual restaurant on site.  We ate in the restaurant one evening and it was fine dining at its best.  But it’s not open every evening, so plan accordingly.  The casual restaurant  is open until late every day.  It has a somewhat quirky all-day menu, but staff is charming.   Hotel location, of course, is wonderful - across from the park with convenient tube and bus transportation.  Everything you expect from a five star hotel.  Take some time to look at the display on the hotel’s storied past near the registration desk. Another tip - there’s a great Italian cafe right inside the park entrance across the street.  Good coffee. Also serves breakfast and lunch.  And, of course, the British Museum is just on the other side of the park.",5,2022,11,21
124,New favourite Hotel in London. Amazing hotel with incredible service ,"Outstanding hotel with exceptional service. Accommodated my early check-in at late notice after a 26hr flight. Gunter the concierge was remarkable and attentive, organsing cars/transport and always ensuring every need was met. Rooms comfortable with all amenities. Exquisite hand carved marble throughout. The FF bar was a great place for a cocktail in the evening. ",5,2022,11,17
124,If Only the Food & Beverage Service Could Match the Beauty of this Hotel…,"The Kimpton is a hotel of contrasts.  The public spaces are beautiful.  From the lobby, to the Palm Court, to Fitz’s, to Galvin’s, and to Burr, all of the physical spaces are very appealing and inviting.  I found the same with my room, which was gracious, elegant, and well appointed.  I also loved the bathroom, which was spacious, had beautiful fixtures, a nice rain shower, a free-standing bathtub, and marble surfaces throughout.  The building itself is old and historic — everything you would want in a fine London hotel.  So far, so good….

But the Achilles’ heel of this hotel is the food & beverage service in the restaurants and through room service.  In both Galvin’s and Burr’s, the service was painfully slow, as they are clearly understaffed (or, more likely, the staff is not well trained).  There were missteps throughout my stay.  Food items were overcooked or not delivered as requested.  Bakery items were served with butter and jam but no knife to spread it with.  Coffee would take nearly 30 minutes to arrive after being seated.  Guests who arrived after me received their food before I did, even though their meals were no easier to prepare than mine.  You get the picture — obtaining proper service became a chore, which should never be the case at a 5-star hotel.  Sadly, the people running and working the restaurants/room service in this beautiful hotel turned what could have been a superb experience into something less.",3,2022,11,16
124,Beautiful to behold.  Less wonderful to actually stay at.,"The building is glorious, as is the lobby, Fitz's bar, and the Palm Court.  Burr & Co has the college cafe vibe.  We'll get back to actually using these places in a minute.

The rooms, well, argh.  I've stayed here 3-4 times.  Rooms consistently small, claustraphobically so at times.  The furniture, even in the suites, is low, small, uncomfortable.  The windows might be larger at certain prisons than they are here.  If you look carefully at exterior pictures you can see why -- only the first floor actually has big, nice windows, every other floor seems not to.  Your call, but if you want American-style space, this is not your place.

The lovely Palm Court is basically a rental venue, inaccessible at all times I wanted to use it during a 5-night stay.

Fitz's is crowded and not terribly welcoming of hotel guests.  From closing off the door from the hotel (so you have to go around to the side, if you even realize it's open) to being told ""you cannot use an iPad at the bar,"" this is not a hotel bar designed for the guests who actually stay here, but more the posh locals who seemingly can't resist the temptation to read your screen.

Burr & Co has hard uncomfortable chairs, the barstools are hopeless (ever notice that nobody seems to use them?) and is consitently overwhelmed by college students.  It's a fun energy but I'm trying to have a business meeting over a coffee not intrude on the Economics study group meeting.

I continue to stay here because it's near our offices.  But I will definitely re-look for other options.  Rooms aren't worth the price.  Service is meh.  And they seem to care more about the locals  than the hotel guests.",3,2022,11,12
124,Above and Beyond ,"I typically do not write reviews but this hotel deserves one. This was my second stay in two weeks and this one triggered the review. The first was really good, but I have high expectations of five star hotels and it ticked all the boxes: good bedding, polite staff, great breakfast, happy hour, heated towels, lovely decor, room snacks, etc. I especially loved the lounge. And of course, 24H room dining. There was an issue with my reservation and the front desk and manager handled them really well. For the second stay though, the team went over and beyond, and well above my expectations. Complimentary upgrade, late checkout out so I could attend a sensitive meeting, help with shipping a package to DHL, quick response to email so I could clarify concerns with my account, and the manager, Gunther, calling and checking on me during my stay. I had many random queries and asks and they were all addressed promptly. Phillip at the front desk was so kind! I think those two have made me a believer. I have now reserved another room for next week - looks like KF is now my go-to for London stays.",5,2022,11,12
124,Amazing Staff! Beautiful Hotel!,"This hotel is GORGEOUS!  High ceilings, fire place, it has it all. The room my family and I stayed in was spacious  (enough room for our way too many suitcases for our shopping habits), the beds were comfortable and very clean as well! The staff was very accommodating to our needs and the concierge was very helpful and FRIENDLY when it came to recommendations, and reservations.  Gunther quickly became our friend as he  picked up on our interests and shared his personal favorite places to go and things to see. The restaurants and bars in this hotel are warm and welcoming. Breakfast was excellent and all staff attentive and helpful. I couldn't have imagined a better stay.  I will be sure to recommend this hotel to all friends and family when traveling to London. And I'll be looking forward to coming back as well! :)",5,2022,11,11
124,Mum’s 80th Birthday trip,Four generations of our family had the most wonderful time celebrating my mums big birthday. Kimpton Fitzroy hotel was truly wonderful and all the staff went above and beyond to make our stay unforgettable. Huge thank you to Gunter for his exceptional service and kindness. We feel like we’ve made a great friend. We will be back very soon for a Christmas shopping trip,5,2022,11,09

124,Excellent hotel and Staff,The hotel is so elegant and have a very nice decoration. The room was clean and the bed was comfortable. We went for breakfast to the restaurant and the staff was nice attentive and caring. Diorka and Eva made sure we had a great experience!,5,2022,11,07
124,Good disability access in a premium setting,"A modern hotel set inside the skin of a victorian building from the 1900's. Beautifully restored and modernised with just the right touches.

The hotel is in fantastic condition. Heavily staffed and attentive. 

The hotel is accessible from a wheelchair platform lift which is cleverly concealed under the marble steps at the front. It's very magical. Though a tad unreliable. Do not be too concerned as there is also wheelchair access in an emergency through the back staff service entrance which is ramped down into the basement. The lift broke down 5 times in 3 days. But once they fixed it.... it was fine for the rest of the stay.

The Queen accessible room has a roll in shower. Grab bars all located as per regulation requirements and concealed neatly into the wall when not in use. However there is no flip down shower chair. A portable shower chair was provided on request. 

The room was pretty simple and not very large. Just the bed space, wardrobe with safe, mini fridge, and the bathroom. There is no study desk. Snacks are provided for free and refreshed every day. I am told that all Queen accessible rooms face the internal courtyard which has no view and the room is dark. Lighting isnt very flexible. Either is dark and cosy or a very plain vanilla brightness that makes the room feel soulless. Thick pile carpet in the room is a difficult to roll on. 

There is a King accessible room which I hear has a facing to Russell Square. But this is double the price of the Queen. Not much the hotel can do to change this given the limitations of the design decisions made. But more choice for people with disabilities across a price range would be fairer.

And as per Kimpton tradition; there is a social hour from 5-6pm with free wine and beer on offer. I would suggest that the social hour is not held in a very social-able space. It's a huddle around the landing of the grand staircase. Would also be better if some snacks were provided.

All in the stay was enjoyable. Though a little bit pricey for what you get. For value; either the Queen room should be larger or about 80GBP less per night to remain competitive with similar hotels in the area of same luxury offering.

124,Fantastic Stay,"We stayed here for 2 nights last weekend and have to say we were both very impressed on many fronts with this hotel.

Firstly it’s a great location with Russel Sq station 50 metres away, just off Covent Garden which is 2 stops on the tube or a nice 10 minute walk.

The hotel is an architectural gem, beautiful ornate stone facade combine with stunning marble interiors and tastefully decorated bars, restaurants and garden room.

The hotel benefits from 2 lovely atmospheric bars, Fitz bar with its dark woods, leather settees and rich colours offers a beautiful place to sit and relax with a cocktail.

Burr and Co a light and buzzy coffee bar offers an alternative venue to relax with a drink.

The Galvin restaurant is a beautiful art deco style room designed by the interior designer of the Titanic was a great location for breakfast and combined a lovely ala carte service with amazing service.

Special shout out to Gunther in guest services who whilst chatting found out that we were celebrating our wedding anniversary and sent a lovely hand written note along with a bottle of red wine and some chocolates and cake, excellent customer service which I must say continued from the minute we checked in at reception. We will definitely be back and wouldn’t hesitate in recommending this hotel.

Ps our room was very nice, cosy and well appointed",5,2022,11,07
124,Six star hospitality four days long,"Our family of seven have been treated beyond expectations: grandparents room changed for a more accessible room, late/afternoon check-out, concierge help for our pick-up at Stamford Bridge, table for 7 always ready upon arrival, … and always with a happy smile!

124,Lovely anniversary celebration,"This is our second time staying at the Kimpton and it did not disappoint. Gorgeous interiors, warm and accommodating staff - nothing was too much. We had a small noise issue when the dj for a wedding downstairs was testing his sound. The staff immediately swapped our room and gave us our room service breakfast for free the next morning. All in all a very relaxing trip. Thank you Kimpton (and Gunther)!",5,2022,11,06
124,Great hospitality even when grabbing some coffee,"Wonderful place to come for food or stay. Our second visit, had come for coffee and as previously the atmosphere was great and Gunther made our hospitality a little better. Will definitely come again in near future.",5,2022,11,04
124,Great hotel in a great location,"We stayed there as a family of four in one of their corner suites, which was spacious with a fabulous roll top bath. It’s a beautiful building with wonderful staff. They have a great breakfast served in the Galvin restaurant. It is practically next to Russel Square tube stop, which is on the Piccadilly line and super convenient to get around. Equally it’s around 10/15 minute walk to Covent Garden. Would definitely recommend.",5,2022,11,04

124,The best stay,"We absolutely adored this beautiful grand dame. Upon check in we were looked after by the very lovely and attentive Shirin. We were upgraded to the most luxurious corner suite. 
Late check out is only 15£ per hour (pending). Breakfast at Galvin is 5 stars. Everyone at the hotel is absolutely lovely. Location is great. Walking distance to the buzzing Soho and all the museum. We can't wait to come back. If only all London hotels are like this.",5,2022,11,01

124,"Sumptuous, Grand, Excellence in this warm an welcoming Hotel situated in one of the best locations in London.","This was our 3rd stay in this amazing hotel. It definitely is our favourite. 

This hotel is GORGEOUS. From the architecture, the decor, furnishings,  ceilings and the incredibly grand marble staircase. It is like stepping back to a time of grandeur and privilege.

From the moment we arrived outside the hotel we were bowled over by the sheer beauty and magnificence and tranquility of the building.

The staff were there to welcome us as though we were returning home and we certainly did feel so very welcome.

Every time we passed a member of the hotel team, they would smile or ask how we were or if we needed anything. They were so attentive whilst not at all invasive. 

The rooms are always scrupulously clean and luxuriously appointed with the comfiest beds and very high quality linen.

The food is amazing. We chose to celebrate a family engagement in the Galvin restaurant and nothing was too much trouble for the staff. Every single component of our meal was expertly presented, served and cooked to perfection.  Simply could not be faulted.

I can’t say enough about this hotel and the superb staff who create such a wonderful experience for their guests. Would like especially to thank Gunther from guest relations for his particular attentiveness.

You really have to go and visit for yourselves.",5,2022,10,28
124,September 2022,"We had the most incredible wedding at the Kimpton Fitzroy in September. We started our search of venues and found the Kimpton and fell in love with it entirely. From the Palm Court to Ballroom, you really do feel like you are in a private venue as you do not see any other hotel guests during the whole event. Jen to start with was a great help and helped us source and find suppliers which made the start of our wedding planning so much easier! Karina moved in with seamless transition with her team to help us create the most magical and memorable weekend we possibly could have. 

From having the most beautiful suites to get ready in, the most magnificent cocktail reception in palm court and such a spectacular layout of the ballroom for our 150 guests. We moved through all stages of the wedding seamlessly, running totally to time with seamless service and help. Even during serving our main course, they managed to serve my dog his own main course during it. 

Our wedding guests have told us that the food was the best that they have ever had at a wedding. From the canapes, to the meal to the evening snacks everyone devoured all of the food. 

Cocktail reception was wonderful, the staff were brilliant at making sure that everyone had a full drink, wine was constantly topped up during the meal and the staff during the party mixed cocktails at lightening speed. Whilst there were lots of sore heads the next morning, everyone thoroughly enjoyed themselves. 

Several of our guests finished the evening out at Fitz's which was great to finish the night off. 

The following morning breakfast spread in the Palm court was the most exceptional way to finish the weekend and was much needed to soak up the alcohol! 

Many of our guests stayed at the hotel, even some who live in London because the rate was so reasonable. The rooms were exquisite and furnished to the highest standards. 

It was the most magical weekend and I would not hesitate to recommend the venue for any wedding or event. 

Finishing off the weekend talking to the GM as we loaded up the car it felt like a home away from home and can't wait to come back. 

We wish we could do it all over again. 

Thank you Karina and team! You are the best!",5,2022,10,28
124,Very enjoyable,"Stayed at the Kimpton Fitzroy for 5 nights on a business trip last week.  It's well located, right around the corner from Russell Square tube and a short walk to Soho/Covent Garden/Kings Cross/St Pancras.  Hotel decor is a nice mix of modern and traditional, done to a high standard.  Breakfast was very good, especially when included in the rate (which it was for me, may not be for all rates).  Staff are exceptional - friendly and willing to help - even with small things like hailing taxis.  Big thank you to Gunther who spent about 5 minutes in the pouring rain hailing a cab for me at check out, also quick to help with luggage.  This place will definitely be one of the first I check when booking my next stay in London.
Good: Staff, decor, breakfast, location, vibe, comfort, cleanliness, and the beef Wellington at Galvin's restaurant was delicious.
Cons: I booked a 'single' room, which was quite small.  Will book a bigger room on my next stay.  It is fine for a single traveler if you don't mind living out of your suitcase, but very little space to hang anything up if you prefer to settle in.  ",5,2022,10,24
124,One of the best hotel experiences ever!,"Amazing service. Very helpfull and friendly staff!
Do not hesitate to get the breakfast when you stay there as it is Unbelievable!

Excellent room inclusions (They even had a flat iron for me to borrow) Quick room service. Excellent customer service from everyone…from the reception all the way to the concierge.

124,Edwardian delight and modern coolness,"The KIMPTON FITZROY which I used to know as the Russel Hotel is a remarquable building predating WW I and it has just been refurbished with exquisite taste. We spent two nights there last week and enjoyed the greatest confort and the warmest welcome. Beds and pillows are excellent, breakfast - both continental and English - is gorgeous and the staff eager to please. All in all a very nice combination of present and past, a balance between Edwardian grandeur and modern coolness on top of a very pratical location (British Museum, Bloomsbury Holborn...)",5,2022,10,11
124,Great spot for a coffee by Russell Square,"Visited the cafe within the hotel, a stylish and well located spot for a coffee, accompanied by a great soundtrack spun by a DJ in the room, which I enjoyed very much. A cool vibe in a nice room populated with friendly staff.",5,2022,10,08
124,Fantastic Stay!,"We recently stayed for 3 nights and it was a wonderful experience. From the time we arrived two bellman helped us with our bags, Fast Efficient check-in and a beautiful guestroom . Everyone of the hotel staff were very pleasant and accommodating.

Therefore I would really like to thank all the staff: thanks to the cleaners who always make me find an impeccable room, thanks to the young ladies who welcome me at breakfast time with a big smile, thanks to the bartenders for the excellent cocktails, thanks to the chefs for the very high quality cuisine (I'm Italian), thanks to the waiters for always making me feel pampered and thanks to the staff at the desk who are always ready to satisfy any of my requests.  In particular I would like to point out Marco the concierge with whom I have had the pleasure of conversing many times.  He is a knowledgeable, helpful and affable person.  He is absolutely cut out for this job and I wish him all the best.",5,2022,10,07

124,Best service imaginable,"This for the Kimpton review?

We had our wedding at the Kimpton Fitzroy London at the weekend. We had exclusive use of Palm Court and the Ballroom for our party of 150 people. A selection of our guests also taking rooms for the weekend. 

Wow, this is the most amazing venue we could have wished for. It was perfect in every single way. Venue, location, food, service, everything! 

We searched high and low and found this to be the best option and boy, they did not disappoint. 

The hotel staff in general were unreal. The service was excellent from start to finish. The staff so personable and friendly. Going beyond the call of duty and doing anything to be of assistance. 

Specifically, we had Radhika manage and plan our big day. We’d give her 100 out of 10 if we could. She was an absolute joy to deal with and professional in every way. A total credit to the hotel.

The guest relationship manager was praised by many of our guests. He is such a lovely kind man who also went above and beyond to make us and our guests feel welcome. 

Lorraine managed the team on the day for our wedding breakfast and evening party. She was also amazing and very accommodating in every way. 

This is the most beautiful venue inside and out. The photos and videos are incredible. The stunning classy interiors and lighting are simply unmatched, I have never stepped foot in a hotel that has it all in the way this one does. (And I have been to lots of lovely hotels around the world).

If you are planning a vacation, wedding or function, you seriously need not look anywhere else. You will be so pleased with your decision. Service like this is hard to find these days, we are so pleased we found you…. Thank you team Kimpton Fitzroy London, YOU ARE THE BEST.",5,2022,10,05
124,Wonderful stay in Russell Square,"Stayed for 2 nights to celebrate a big birthday. Had booked a bedroom suite with bath and was delighted to be upgraded to a truly fabulous corner suite on the first floor. Loved the exterior and interior decor of the hotel - very striking with some interesting historical touches. Location is super convenient being round the corner from the tube station, so the very best bits of London are easily accessible. Also easy walking distance to the British Museum.  
The cooked breakfast at Galvins really hit the spot for us  - high quality and just the right size to be supplemented by a trip to the buffet section (relatively limited range but still had everything we were looking for). Service was excellent - we received 2 birthday cakes and we were very well looked after throughout. The only (minor) gripes to mention are 1) we were not informed about the evening social hour upon check in so missed out on that on our first evening (no big deal) and 2) being greeted with  “hello guys”. Guess that’s the casual vibe they’re promoting but prefer a touch more decorum myself. That said, would love to return!",5,2022,10,05
124,"Perfect accommodations, staff and experience.",This was our first trip to London and the staff at the Kimpton made it even better! Huge thanks to Gunther and Ruairi for helping us feel right at home and offering above and beyond service. Truly next level. The rooms were lovely as well! We will absolutely return!,5,2022,10,04
124,Amazing Stay,"We visited for a weekend and really enjoyed our stay. All of the staff were lovely but one member in particular;  called Gunter, gets an 11 out of 10. He was an amazing in all senses and made our stay just that little bit more special.

124,Best Hotel Stay I’ve ever had.,The Kimpton Fritzroy London is the epitome of luxury and comfort. Service was outstanding and The staff went out of their way to ensure we were well taken care of. The rooms are beautiful and the beds extremely comfortable. I was hesitant at first to spend this money much money on a hotel but it was totally worth it. You won’t be disappointed.,5,2022,10,02
124,Birthday celebrations,"Had a fabulous stay, room wasn’t ready so we we’re offered a cocktail each on the house. The room was lovely - no complaints. 
They have a social hour where you can go and have 2 complimentary drinks wine or beer.

The honeymoon suite room was amazing, spacious, bright and relaxing...just what we needed the morning after the event! 

The food on the day was fantastic and the staff made sure nobody was left without a drink.

A huge shoutout to Radhika and Gunther for all their help across the weekend.

Would HIGHLY recommend the Kimpton, not only as a place to stay but as a place to host an event!",5,2022,09,29
124,Happy “londoning”,It is so nice hotel with beautiful rooms and good service. The hotel bar is amazing. Breakfast is really nice. Atmosphere is so about “londoning”. Interior and exterior are looking so beautiful. You can feel London 1800th. But get service and all the good of 2022.,5,2022,09,28
124,Perfect Short Stay,"Just had a night at the Kimpton Fitzroy after travelling with the family from Sydney (via Paris). The service and amenities were exceptional. The hotel itself is stunning and the level of service from all of the staff was second to none!

124,Best weekend of my life.,"We stayed at the Kimpton over the weekend of 24/25 September. Our daughter's wedding reception was held in Palm Court/The Ballroom. I cannot recommend enough the Kimpton, the staff and the service. Gunther who operates at front of house was exemplary. Words will not to justice to the amazing experience we had. Please go there and experience it for yourself. From the moment we stepped into the hotel we felt special.  I cannot thank everyone enough for making my daughter's day so so special. I am eternally grateful.",5,2022,09,28
124,Beautiful hotel with refined service,"Stayed at the Kimpton Fitzroy for two nights on business and had a wonderful stay.  Hotel is sparking clean, well appointed and so comfortable; even though they were sold out I rarely heard of noise.  Well located by the British Museum and across from a leafy park which makes for a lovely view if your room faces street side.  Walking distance to Soho. Peloton bike in the spacious gym. Would definitely stay here again on the return trip to London!",5,2022,09,27
124,Gorgeous bldg but tiny accommodations,"This hotel is gorgeous. But the room and bathroom were the smallest I have ever seen.  Like unbelievably small. Location good-by train and walkable to everything. Don’t think I’d return unless I intend to spend zero time in the room. The bar on ground floor was ok, but it insisted upon itself quite a bit. I did like being across from a park, though. That was lovely.",3,2022,09,26
124,Review,The staff was friendly and attentive. They greeted you with kindness and see to your every need. The room was clean and the housekeeping staff were great! I would definitely recommend to family and friends to stay. Would go back.,5,2022,09,25

124,5 Star Service,"Spent an incredible night at the Kimpton Fitzroy! From start to finish, the service was over and above what we expected. Gunther made us feel like VIP's when he welcomed us.

124,Beautiful hotel with impeccable service,"We loved our week-long stay at the elegant, beautiful Fitzroy. Our room was big and comfortable, with a luxurious shower, plush bed and awesome slippers that, sadly, I forgot to bring home. The service at daily breakfast (included in our room) was excellent, though it took a few days for them to figure out that people would like their tea before the meal. Gavin's restaurant is upscale and delicious. Everyone who works at this hotel is friendly, warm and helpful. Shout out to Marco the concierge, who helped with dinner suggestions, transport to the airport and other advice.",5,2022,09,23
124,Magnificent  Russell Square Property,"We just returned from a very interesting week in London.  We booked this trip months ago not knowing we would be there for all the events surrounding the funeral of Her Majesty the Queen.  Russell Square was the perfect location to stay.  While London was packed, Russell Square was just far enough away where we could enjoy all it had to offer. Yet, the Russell Square Underground is just behind the hotel and the 14 Bus (we preferred this mode of travel) is just across the street making it quite easy to get to Piccadilly Square, Leicester Square, Covent Garden and every place else in London.
The hotel itself is magnificent with all the high Victorian style one could imagine, yet completely renovated a few years ago to make it a fine five-star location. If you are a Downton Abbey fan, think of this place as where the Crawley girls would stay on one of their trips to the city.  Our room was beautifully decorated looking over Russell Square.  It was delightfully quiet.  The staff was extremely helpful.  Our flight home was scheduled for the day of the Queen's funeral and was canceled.  For a while, we did not know when we would be able to catch a flight home.  The hotel staff graciously put a hold on our room for an extra night, just in case it was needed.   The staff member said, ""No flight, no hotel, we can't let that happen.""
We had beverages at Fritz's Bar on several nights.  Lively, fun, beautiful room and excellent drinks.  We also had dinner one night at the hotel's Galvin Bar and Grill.  We had the set menu.  The restaurant was beautiful, the service excellent and the food was awesome.  I wish to give a shout-out to Corin Stavarache for helping to make our stay at the Kimpton Fitzroy simply perfect.  
We will definitely stay here again.  I strongly recommend this hotel.",5,2022,09,22
124,Stunning hotel and impeccable service,"Our two night stay at the Kimpton Fitzroy was a great way to end our trip to Europe. This hotel exceeded my expectations. The building occupies a full block and is beyond beautiful with its carved facade, tiled lobby and grand staircase. On booking, I had mentioned our stay coincided with my birthday, and waiting for me in the room was a delicious treat and handwritten note. 

The heated towels, terry robe and slippers, and a very, very comfortable bed all helped us unwind and relax after a busy day. Upon request, housekeeping even provided a flat iron so I could manage my frizzy hair!

We are especially grateful to Gunther who introduced himself the first day. We were craving Italian food, and he recommended a nearby restaurant called Ciao Bella where I enjoyed the best spaghetti carbonara ever. His recommendation for afternoon tea at the Beaumont in Mayfair was also spot on. When I forgot my sunglasses at the Beaumont, it was thanks to him I got them back. Every hotel should have a Gunther.

My only disappointment is that the Kimpton Fitzroy no longer offers afternoon tea. Hopefully, the hotel will again host afternoon tea since its unique venue and dedicated staff can provide this iconic British experience with much class. 

We definitely are returning to the UK and staying at the Kimpton Fitzroy.

124,Weekend with friends,"Beautiful hotel in Bloomsbury nearby the British Museum and Covent Garden. Great architecture and interior design. Very helpful receptionist Betty, great service and food in the Galvin Bar&Grill. Beds are very comfortable, nice 19-69 toiletries and a spacious bathroom even in the smallest rooms. Wifi works well. Russel Square underground station next to the hotel, so one can easily reach a place from the Heathrow airport. Clean and well kept. We ll be back.",5,2022,09,21
124,First rate service,"My two cousins and I stayed at the Fitzroy for 4 nights during our vacation in the UK. From the moment our taxi pulled up, a porter came outside immediately to help us with our bags. Zain at the front desk was wonderful checking us in. Our room was ready, which was a pleasant surprise. Yes the room is a bit small, but we are from Canada are are used to larger rooms where 2 queen beds are standard. Galvins restaurant was an amazing experience every morning for breakfast. The food was delicious and the service was amazing. All the staff were friendly and couldn't do enough for you.  One day when just 2 of us went out, and the other stayed behind to read in front of the fireplace in the lobby, one of the gentlemen asked her if she was OK and needed anything.
We had such an amazing experience at the Fitzroy. Thank you for everything.",5,2022,09,21
124,Style of substance,"We spent 8 weeks in Europe and stayed in countless luxury hotels and the Kimpton Fitzroy London takes the cake for being the most lack luster overpriced 5 star hotel we stayed in the whole trip. The hotel is skating by on the fact that it is in a gorgeous building but is lacking any of the heart and personality of a 5 star hotel. I can only assume they let all their staff go during covid and struggled to rehire as they were not up to the standard of a 5 star hotel in any shape or form. If it was a 4 star hotel at $300 a night I wouldn't care, but it's >$500 a night.

1. Check in was at 3pm, arrived at 3:30pm and was told our room would be ready in moments. We said we'd go get coffee, staff told us they would message us when the room was done. 4:30 rolls around and surly the room is ready right but they forgot to message us? Nope. Room not ready. Staff just stare at us until I ask where they expect us to go. Finally go into a room just before 5pm. I can't imagine what this would be like if you got off a long flight.

2. Staff at the front door watch as you struggle with your bags up the steps. Literally watch. It's a 5 star hotel. It's >$500 a night. Your staff can at least OFFER to help with bags. I watched an elderly woman struggle to carry her own bag down the stairs with the door boy watching. On the topic of bags; this is the only 5 star hotel I have ever been too in my life where the staff didn't offer to take my bags to my room.

3. I am unsure of ANY amenities this hotel offers. Primarily because when I checked in the staff did not explain anything about the hotel. Did not tell me if there was a bar, restaurant, gym or spa facilities, nothing. Strangest welcome I have ever received at a hotel. 

4. This is going to be petty but it's 22', if I can't airplay or chrome cast to your hotel tv it's time it's upgrade them. Once again just bizarre choice for a 'luxury' hotel to have tv's that only android's can pair too. It's the type of stuff I expect to run into at a 3 star hotel.

5. Day after check in there was a fire alarm drill. They had a very tiny sign in the foyer (which my husband missed) but this seems like the type of thing they should mention the day before on check in! My husband and several other guests had no idea what was going on as they only notice was a small sign in the foyer. I understand a drill is out of your control and essential but talk to your guests. 5 star hotels require a bit of service! 

Honestly bizarre experience. We went to the Langham for high tea and felt like more welcomed guests of the hotel than at our own hotel. Staff a really not up to standard for the price of the hotel, a 5 star hotel is more than just a pretty building. It's really turned me off Kimpton as a brand. There is better options for the same money.",2,2022,09,20
124,I will definitely stay here again!,"I can't praise the Kimpton Fitzroy London enough! I just spent 5 nights there, and everything was wonderful! Starting with check in, the staff, especially Angela, was friendly and helpful. 

Can't say enough about how excellent the concierge desk personnel are. Prior to arriving, I communicated with them for restaurant recommendations.  Everything recommended was amazing! We had a private tour booked shortly after we arrived, but the tour guide didn't show up. Concierge Sophie contacted the tour company for us and worked everything out. Gunther was so helpful and friendly and one other concierge was able to secure afternoon tea reservations at a lovely place when everywhere else we had tried was booked. 

The hotel itself is gorgeous and in a convenient location. The food and service at Burr & Co and Galvin's Grill was outstanding. 

In short, I highly recommend the Kimpton Fitzroy London!",5,2022,09,20
124,"Beautiful building, lackluster rooms","This was, unfortunately, an abysmal hotel experience. We were excited to visit and had a positive service experience with the front desk, but the room left much to be desired. The room was missing basics like a lamp (overhead and headboard task lights only), outlets in the bathroom, luggage racks and desk space. The view was of a brick wall and the coffee maker didn’t work. We came for our anniversary and had a wonderful time in the city, but were extremely let down by this hotel specifically and wouldn’t recommend it.",2,2022,09,18
124,Incredible,"The Kimpton is a wonderful hotel, with an incredible staff. All of the staff members are so incredibly kind, attentive, and all around perfect. They were always there to greet us, help us with anything, all of the taxis — just truly first class service. I will 100% be staying here again. The customer service is some of the best I have ever received and coming from a well seasoned traveler, that compliment isn’t given freely. They’ve made my stay in London a remarkable one. The true genuine kindness and readiness to help, has made my trip unforgettable.",5,2022,09,18
124,Stunning Rooms. Great Service.,"My wife and I stayed at the hotel while on vacation in London. We were very impressed by the service and the quality of the rooms. The recent renovations do not detract at all from the historically significant environment, but rather seamlessly integrate modern necessities. Highly recommend!!",5,2022,09,17
124,Outstanding,My wife and I had our first visit to the hotel with friends for a wedding nearby. The hotel is a beautiful Victorian building with lovely decor and ambiance. We had two meals at the hotel which were both excellent. The hotel’s staff attention to our needs was outstanding. We have been lucky enough to stay at many 5 star hotels and our stay at the Kimpton was amongst the best. A special thank you to Gunter for going out of his way to make it wonderful experience.,5,2022,09,15
124,One of the best hotel stays of my life.,"I just returned from a week's stay in London at the Kimpton Fitzroy. There are just not enough good things that I can say about this hotel. My experiences with Kimpton have been varied in the past, but I'm an IHG Diamond Elite member, so I tend to choose from their properties. Usually, that means an InterContinental, but this time I was taking my family on a trip to London and needed three rooms. I found an excellent rate at The Fitzroy and booked the rooms. I could not possibly have known what was in store for me when I did that. From the start, as we planned our trip before leaving the USA, I dealt with the concierges. For the most part, that was an Irish gentleman named Ruairi M.. I can say without hesitation that Ruairi was the most competent, professional, and helpful member of hotel staff I've ever had the pleasure to deal with. No request or query was too much. He was knowledgeable, kind, and patient. He set me up with theater, opera, & tour tickets as well as ground transportation from Heathrow. It all appeared effortless on his end, such was his mastery of his job. I was traveling with my elderly parents and teenaged nephew, so there were some challenges. Ruairi met them all with a smile and a ready solution. As did the admirable Joseph, the other concierge, albeit with whom I dealt less. 

Finally, when a minor disaster struck on my last day in London and I hurt my back badly enough that I needed to see a doctor and had trouble walking unassisted, Ruairi not only had the doctor in the hotel within about 2 hours, he managed to obtain a cane for me to make walking easier. I'd also mention the very kind manager named Gunther who was of tremendous help to me on that last day. None of this could have been anticipated when I arrived in London. But how the Fitzroy team, from bellmen to concierges to managers, rose to the occasion to help a guest far from home and in a great deal of pain. They have my boundless gratitude and admiration, having demonstrated the very highest standard of service and care. 
 
Beyond that, how was the hotel? It was also a revelation. My king bed superior room was silent, immaculate, and well appointed. I heard no hallway noise nor noise from other rooms at all. The a/c worked like a dream. The bed was extremely comfortable. The bed and bath linens sparkling white and of the best quality. The location in leafy Bloomsbury around the corner from The British Museum was ideal. The Russell Sq Underground stop is directly behind the hotel. How can you beat that? The public areas were stunning. The breakfast offered in the Galvin restaurant was extensive and delicious and I had excellent coffee, lunch, and drinks at Burr & Co. several times during my visit and was most pleased. 

I recommend this hotel as highly as one possibly can. I can't wait to return to London and stay there again.",5,2022,09,15
124,A wonderful treat,I stayed here at the end of August. The stay was classy from start to finish. The hotel was stunning. The staff were very friendly and efficient. The breakfast was delicious. The bar was so atmospheric and relaxing in the evening. I would highly recommend this hotel for a weekend away in London and would definitely book again. Thank you to the wonderful staff who made our stay so nice.,5,2022,09,14
124,Great stay...but with a few niggles,"The hotel is located in a wonderfully ornate building in a great location...the foyer area is particulaly impressive as is the Palm Court. 

Pros: 

Our 1-bedroom suite was superb and the service we received throughout our short stay was equally good. 

The gym is a good size with weights area.

There's a daily social hour with complimentary wine, beer or soft drinks.

Fitz's Bar is dimly lit and has a warm ambience. They serve a good range of interesting cocktails and we actually found the prices to be quite reasonable given the location. 

Cons:

Galvin Bar & Grill and the Palm Court were shut on Monday evening, reducing the dining options to either room service or Burr and Co. We chose the latter, but found the food mediocre coupled with long waiting times. 
 
Breakfast is also quite mediocre. The small buffet is poorly laid out and you only get one cooked-to-order item as standard. That said, the omelette and Eggs Benedict we tried were fine. 

Notwithstanding the niggles, we really enjoyed our stay here and would not hesitate to stay again in the future.",5,2022,09,14
124,Solid choice for comfort and location; single room okay for solo traveller,"Visiting for a conference, I stayed at the Fitzroy for 11 days. After staying at airbnb’s during the pandemic, it was wonderful to return to a lovely hotel with full services. Traveling solo, I was rather surprised by the small size of the single. However, the bed was very comfortable and the bathroom well appointed. I realized after a couple of days that my room felt perfectly ideal for my needs. I felt safe walking around Bloomsbury on my own, either during the day or at night after meeting friends. And except for a few exceptions (we all have bad days, right?), the staff at the Fitzroy made me feel very welcomed. Particularly of note, the service in the breakfast dining room was outstanding. The concierge service was also up to Kimpton standards. The street-level cafe turned out to be ideal for working, providing strong WiFi and places to plug in my laptop. The other attendees were staying at nearby dormitories without air-conditioning during the heatwave this summer. But even when it was over 100F(37C), the Kimpton kept me comfortable. I would stay here again and look forward to bringing my family next time.",5,2022,09,14
124,Beautiful hotel in great part of London,"Excellent hotel in a great part of London. The hotel went through a major renovation and it shows. The rooms are large for Europe standards and have great finishes. The shower in our room was huge and much nicer than I expected. There are plenty of restaurants close by and the metro station is just a block away. It is easy to get to the hotel from the airport by taking the Piccadilly line from the airport and get off at Russell Square. If you add breakfast, it offers a few different options. You could either go to the coffee shop on the one end and get a quick continental breakfast or go to the restaurant on the other side of the lobby and have a full sit down breakfast with table service where everything is included. It was one of the best breakfasts I have ever had in Europe. They also offer a free cocktail hour from 5:00 - 6:00 every evening. I will definitely stay here again the next time I come to London.",5,2022,09,12
124,Another fab weekend at the Kimpton Fitzroy,"Another lovely weekend, with friends, at the Kimtpon Fitzroy hotel. The hotel itself is stunning but the staff, they deserve credit for making our stay extra special. Attentive, friendly and genuinely want the stay to me as perfect as possible.",5,2022,09,11
124,Fails to match initial impression,"We stayed for a couple of nights at The Kimpton Fitzroy and eventually enjoyed the experience, it just took a little bit of effort to get there.

The building itself is stunning, both externally and when you first enter, the lobby is vast and ornate, you cannot fail to be impressed.  There is however a downside to this as the building has some of the most varied room sizes and odd shaped rooms of any hotel.  This can obviously lead to very different experiences, the first room we were allocated had a couple of rather major issues, as it was an internal room on a low floor the noise level from the windows from the machinery below was unacceptable, the double glazing was essentially not working or sealing and this pointless.  There was also the smallest bathroom I had seen, where you could barely operate the toilet due to its location.

We moved rooms to something a little bigger and facing a different direction which certainly solved the noise problem.  The bathroom was still interesting in its layout, but it was more workable than the initial room.  It was dissapointing as a IHG Diamond member with Ambassador status to get allocated the original room and it certainly felt like they keep trying to give that room out when the hotel is busy hoping someone will not complain, but more thought should be given overall.

The social hour, we went to look at but the stuffyness of the location meant we decided not to stay, also the white wine they were serving was warm, so while we appreciate the thought of a complimentary social hour, it seemed maybe better not to bother.

The room we ended up with had a very comfortable bed and reasonable shower, so it was at a level that we found acceptable.  The breakfast was also good.  
The exterior of the hotel along with its lobby blow you away, but after that everything is is more ok rather than continuing the theme of being amazing, some of this is simply the building isn't really suitable for being a luxury hotel, or at least parts of it are not.

If we return to the hotel we would never consider it when much time is needed in the room as unless you book a suite they are just not acceptable for the price point they are at.",4,2022,09,11
124,Beautiful Hotel!,"Wow what a beautiful property. The staff is excellent, the food is excellent, and the location is perfect! Located right next to the Russell Square Station, were never more than a few minutes away from any where we needed to go. You have to stay here.",5,2022,09,11
124,Best stay in London,"This place is amazing! It was luxurious and clean. The staff was wonderful. Everyone was welcoming and helpful. Great vibe. All restaurants onsite are awesome. The best stay in London!!! When we come back to London again, we’ll always stay here! I can’t wait to visit again!!!",5,2022,09,11
124,What a great night,What can I say? Everything was perfect. God the drinks were so good. A big thank you ti Akira Kris Mario Regina and Andrej you guys made my night. I wish this holiday never ended. Will definitely come back here on my next visit,5,2022,09,08
124,Lovely visit,Thank you so much Regina!! You really made our night. I think i have never experienced such great service. Loved the live music and the drinks!! Will definitely come back. The drinks were super nice and the service even better. Will definitely suggest to all my friends,5,2022,09,08
124,"Not bad, good location","I chose this originally as it was close to a Tube station and St Pancras terminal. I thought the hotel was nice, as well as the staff. Heard some others that were also pleased with their room. My only complaint was the size of the single. It’s not really a surprise and know European rooms can be small, just be sure that you are a single. 2 people wouldn’t fit very well. Otherwise, pleasant visit overall.",4,2022,09,08
124,A little Disappointed and Confused,"We booked using a free night award from a credit card - we had to spend a considerable amount plus pay an annual fee to earn this reward, it wasn't a freebie!  We are also Platinum Elite IHG members and had received an advance email to buy an upgrade at a discounted price!  I found this strange as a next level upgrade is a Platinum Elite perk.

We arrived early at 12 noon, and appreciated that we would not be able to check in until 2pm, another P E perk.  We were told the allocated room 211 was not ready and to  come back at 3pm!  We were also told that we would get a phone call if the room was ready before 3pm!   The receptionist acknowledged our status but did not seem aware of the early check in perk.   She gave us each a voucher to use  to ""Raid The Bar"" and we clarified exactly what that entailed and where we could use the perk.

I mentioned that we were celebrating our 32nd wedding anniversary and was assured that we had been given a ""lovely room"".

We returned to the hotel at 3pm, after having no call and to a change of receptionists.  We were told our room was still not ready and that they were not sure when it would be.  We had a business meeting at 4.30 p.m. and had to change and get back to the meeting.  The receptionist abruptly moved us to room 409.  I asked if this was the same sort of room and she said it was.  She also amended the room number on both Raid vouchers.

On getting to our room it was clear that this was not a nice room.  It was tiny, overlooked noisy air conditioning units and was dwarfed by a massive sloping mirror construction and a wardrobe that was clearly on the tilt!  

We had checked online that there were still upgraded rooms available, so why we did not get the PE perk or the option to pay the £30 upgrade fee was a mystery.   

We visited the Palm Court with our two £15 vouchers and, once again, clarified what was part of the offer and were told that it amounted to a joint £30 food and beverage credit.  We spent £24 of the vouchers and were not given the opportunity to use the remainder nor given any receipt for the items we had.

On arriving back after a trip to the theatre we were surprised to find a £15.25 charge on our in room bill - for food and drinks that we had not had!

A late trip to reception was met by another team of staff.  I showed them a screenshot of the room account and also a photo of us at the table with the drinks we had in front of us.  The receptionist went off the the Palm Court and was gone for quite some time.  She returned to say that we should not have been given two vouchers, despite us checking this at the time of issue and my husband also being an IHG member at the same grade as me!   She produced a bill that showed what we had consumed and the very strange way that this was accounted for - but it still did not equate to the items we drank or the sum that was showing on the screen.  All very odd!

I did feel quite humiliated, as there were others at reception, that it was implied that we had used something we should not have, especially as we had confirmed the way the vouchers worked.  It was intimated that we may have been dealt with by an inexperienced member of staff!  The charges were eventually removed, but it did leave a sour taste.

All in all, a disappointing stay.  No status room upgrade, the issues with the vouchers took the shine off the stay and, after reading about the little extras that celebrating couples received, we thought a 32nd anniversary may have got a little something too?  Seems those next door did.   Of course, we did wonder if room 211 was in receipt of anything we may have got - including the upgrade!

We both felt that our anniversary stay was not what it should have been.  We had also mentioned our anniversary on our booking and on the hotel Facebook page.",3,2022,09,08
124,A Lovely Hotel,"This has been my fourth stay at Kimpton Fitzroy and three years since it became my recommended hotel in London to clients for whom I create personal travel itineraries. The hotel is a building of character located opposite Russell Square, with an underground station just around the corner and Euston station just a 15 minute walk. London Heathrow is 1 hour by underground and huge numbers of places of interest, including main London theatres just tube stops away.

The hotel has rooms of varying levels of  size and feature and the staff are generally extremely helpful and attentive. Getting the negative out of the way early, I have noticed some areas detailed below where standards have reduced and I would urge the senior management to address these as a priority if the Kimpton Fitzroy is not to lose ground at the higher end of the London hotel market.

There is invariably someone on duty at the main entrance so you are guaranteed a warm and friendly welcome on arrival. Whilst reception isn’t signposted it is just around the corner from the main door. The public areas are filled with character, not least of which is the sweeping staircase, the Burr & Co Coffee Shop at one end of the lobby and the upmarket Fitzy’s Bar at the other. Both are lovely to visit.

My check in was quite swift and I was acknowledged as an IHG 1 Platinum member, with benefits awarded. The brand offers a “reward” if guests work in a set expression during check in. The receptionist missed this, or was I very subtle in doing it? I had a 3 night stay booked as 3 separate reservations and I contacted the management team in advance to merge these into one so that I wouldn’t need to change room. This was done, but not without issue as my key card stopped operating every day at standard checkout time.

When selecting a room type, the website has changed and junior suites are no longer listed and these are simply included under suites. This makes it challenging for guests to be sure what they are booking. To add to the confusion the price has increased by 32% on my last visit for what was listed as a junior suite in 2021 (upgraded to full suite due to Platinum status). This caused me to believe that the room this time was indeed a full suite. This year, my suite upgrade for Platinum status was not applied on my first night. It was only at checkout that I learned my room had been a junior suite and not the full suite I was anticipating. Both the website and my confirmation stated “1 King Bed Suite Park View.”

Junior Suite 152 was quite adequate and had a sitting area as an annexe to the bedroom and a spacious bathroom leading off. There was ample comfortable seating and two TVs. The bed was king size and incredibly comfortable, which is one of the main reasons for my love affair with Kimpton. The bathroom had underfloor heating and a roll top bath, with separate marble shower room. The bath plug did not fit well, allowing the bath to drain continually. The room was very effectively and substantially double-glazed, eliminating all noise. The room was serviced daily, with a freshening taking place in the evening. On the morning after my first night the room servicing did not take place until after 15:00, which I felt was very late. When I met the cleaning staff they were very pleasant and friendly. Suites come with the benefit of a stocked mini bar with complimentary soft drinks and beer. The hotel failed to replenish this each day without a specific request being made. There was no bottle opener in the room and each time I wanted a drink I had to have someone come to open the bottle. I was advised that guests kept stealing the openers and only when I finally insisted that one was provided for the room was one delivered on a permanent basis.

Breakfast was taken in the Galvin Restaurant and this was the biggest disappointment of the stay. Staff have stopped greeting guests by requesting their name and following up with their room number. By requesting the number only, the guest is reduced to being a statistic rather than an individual.  The restaurant was pleasant enough and the staff appeared to work as a team. I added daily breakfast to my reservation at check in however this was not recorded correctly and staff at Galvins were not aware of this and did not handle the situation as well as they might. The usual range of items were available, with cooked dishes being individually prepared. These were very poorly presented and the Eggs Benedict (very little Hollandaise Sauce) were just sat on the plate with no garnish of any type (photo attached) and did not appear appetising in the least. The English Breakfast was the same and appeared and tasted to be of  low quality.

From 17:00 to 18:00 the hotel hosts “Social Hour” in Burr & Co. Soft drinks, beer and wine are available and this appears to be very popular with guests. Nibbles such as nuts or crisps would raise the effectiveness and impact of the experience.

The day before checkout I arranged to keep my room until 13:00 the next day. My request was received warmly however, come check out morning, staff began knocking on my door at 12:30 enquiring when I would be leaving.

The service highlight of my stay was Gunther, on duty near reception. Gunther chatted to me about my visit and was clearly disturbed that quite a few areas had fallen below expectations. He advised that he would escalate the lack of clarity for guests regarding suite types. He proactively cancelled my breakfast charges. Gunther did a great deal to recover my service experience and I would strongly recommend that his efforts be recognised in some way.

I have highlighted quite a number of shortfalls in my review however I hope the significant positives have also shone through.  I am a fan of the Kimpton brand and I hope the standards are pulled back to those evidenced previously.",4,2022,09,06
124,Will always be my go to hotel in London!,"We love Kimpton hotels because they are consistently reliable in quality and service that make you feel like you are staying with friends! The Fitzroy London stands out as one of our favorites!  It is in a great location….a few blocks walk to St. Pancras and Kings Cross train stations and the Piccadilly tube station is around the corner for easy access to many city attractions. The hotel is in a very cool building and the interior has the usual Kimpton eclectic decor!  It is stunning. The rooms are inviting and cozy, beds comfortable and  the bathrooms are beautiful and upscale with fluffy robes. But what truly set this hotel apart was the staff!  Everyone was welcoming, friendly and professional but the concierges, Joseph and Marco, really stood out!  They helped us plan excursions, answered questions with a smile and were just fun to interact with. And when one of us needed medical attention, Marco went above and beyond to accommodate our needs. We will be forever grateful! The entire staff made us feel very special and contributed to an enjoyable stay from start to finish. Thank you to all!  We will be back!",5,2022,09,05
124,"Love, love, love, will return","I absolutely loved everything about my stay in this hotel. The location (close to Russell Square tube station, the British Museum, walking distance to many theatres, close to the international trains leaving from King’s Cross), the beautiful building, the wonderful staff and the excellent rooms. I had a small (I was traveling alone, so had a 1 p hotelroom) room, but it was perfectly laid out with enough space for my luggage. It didn’t feel cramped at all (looking at you Ludlow Hotel, NYC), but felt like a home away from home. I can’t imagine staying anywhere else on my next visit to London.",5,2022,09,03
124,Wow and I mean WOW!,"One of the best hotels I have ever stayed in. I have been very fortunate to stay in some wonderful hotels in my life and this one is out of this world.

Great location, a lot of things to do all so close to the hotel. The building itself is gorgeous; huge and eye-catching with Russel Square right outside. Walking into the hotel, it took my breath away with how stunning the main lobby was.

The room we had was well kept with a modern decor and new facilities (Nespresso machine, TVs etc) The staff were fantastic. Helpful, friendly and very accommodating.

Will be coming back again and would highly recommend!",5,2022,09,03

124,Amazing location and prompt service 🌟,"Excellent amenities, excellent location, and extremely polite service. I had an issue with a room earlier with the AC not working. Mr Gunther took care of that by upgrading our stay and making arrangements for a new room. This is my second time at Kimpton and I’d continue staying here for all my visits to London. The bar and the breakfast is phenomenal as well.",5,2022,09,02
124,really incredible staff!,"I own a luxury travel agency and I've stayed at hundreds of hotels around the world. There are plenty of properties that are nice like this one. What's REALLY special is when you find one with incredible people. That's what hospitality is - it's the reason people should stay at hotels over Airbnbs. Isabel, the front office manager, and Dorine at the front desk, have both gone way above and beyond to take care of us. I am blown away by the special experiences they've created. If you're looking for a hotel where people will treat you like they did decades ago, this is the one.",5,2022,09,02
124,"Wonderful hotel, amazing staff!","Instead of writing complaints here on Tripadvisor, I prefer to complain to a hotel's staff if I have a problem. And I also try to remember to give positive feedback.

But this praise to Reception Manager Patricia Herdoiza, I must write here. She provides a service beyond the ordinary.

We stayed overnight at the wonderful Kimpton Fitzroy in London at the end of August, 2022. 
When we were to collect our luggage in the afternoon, which we had left with the concierge in the morning, we forgot a shopping bag with groceries and personal belongings. 

On arrival at the airport we contacted the hotel.
Ms Herdoiza was very helpful and offered to send our belongings by Royal Mail to Copenhagen. 

They arrived today.
A long trip. Processing in customs has been slow, but we are happy and all our belongings are in perfect condition. 
Thanks Patricia Herdoiza. You make a difference!

We are looking forward to coming back to this iconic hotel with beautiful rooms, great atmosphere but above all: fantastic staff.",5,2022,09,02

Would thoroughly recommend!",5,2022,09,02
124,Absolutely splendid!,"My first time staying at Kimpton Fitzroy and had such an amazing experience. I'm a solo traveller and felt really safe in this hotel.

My hotel stay included breakfast as well as a social hour from 5-6pm daily at the hotel bar. The breakfast included a mini buffet of cereal, bread and juices and you could order one main from the menu. Staff at Galvin were hospitable and professional. 

Social hour was great as well! you could choose between red, white, rose wine or beer. 

Rooms were small but adequate and cosy. Perhaps if there was one thing i didn't like - it was the noisy aircon. Had to wear ear plugs to sleep.",5,2022,09,02
124,Perfect wedding hotel,"My wife and I stayed at the Kimpton over our wedding weekend and couldn’t recommend it more. The corner suite was beautiful, the perfect place to get ready for our big day and to stay for the next two nights. The concierge team (Joe, Sean, Marco) were all incredibly accommodating, from letting us drop our bags off days before we checked in to arranging champagne and chocolate covered strawberries the morning after our wedding.
Room service was great and very prompt. All of the staff (Zain and others at reception, Gunther from guest services) made us feel really special, and were very attentive.
We’re hoping to go back for our first anniversary!",5,2022,09,01

And location was not that good have to hire a cab for city centre !!!,4,2022,09,01
124,Outstanding experience,"I chose the Kimpton Fitzroy because it is very close to the British Museum and I had limited time, but it proved to be a wonderful location as most of the people I had meetings were willing, and found it easy to meet me at the hotel. 

The hotel had great places to meet and eat. They were buzzing, but had quiet spots too. 

The staff at the hotel are super welcoming, helpful, and easily facilitated any request. When I arrived I had 15 mins before I had to get on to a conference call and the reception staff got me into the room with time to spare. Gunther, the guest services manager, was super helpful and guided me with lost guests, luggage, taxis and a couple of issues with my room. 

The room was compact but had everything I needed and was really quiet which helped with odd sleep times due to jet lag. The wifi worked brilliantly the entire time I was there. The amenities too are really nice. If I’d not just done so, I’d have filled up my travel bottles again! 

Russell Park (across the road) is lovely for chilling too!

Overall, I had an outstanding stay. I highly recommend the hotel.",5,2022,08,31

124,Fabulous hotel,"The best accommodating staff, breakfast beautiful, room service food was great. The only issue was we had a noisy room next door!! Central location which was fab and the interiors were divine we can’t wait to come back x",5,2022,08,29
124,Lovely Sunday afternoon drinks,"Lovey hotel, amazing place for a relaxing drink and light dinner with friends and/or family. Strong and good value cocktails, relaxed ambience and friendly staff. A special shout out to Gunther who was AMAZING! So friendly and hospitable - spoke about the hotel and gave us a mini tour of some of the main spaces",5,2022,08,29
124,I can’t thank the doorman enough!,"I attended a seminar in London on 27 th August and I could not find a taxi and was starting to panic! I saw your wonderful’Posh’ hotel and thought they will find me a taxi. I found a young man in reception and explained my predicament and he was wonderful! He came out with me, wouldn’t leave me despite me saying I would walk further down, and waved down the few taxis we saw! He eventually got one for me and I sailed off to Marylebone. Being an ‘old girl’ from Oxford I was very impressed with the care and felt safe.

If this is the level of care I can only dream of what it is like inside - and the hotel looked absolutely gorgeous!",5,2022,08,28
124,Luxurious without being pretentious,"Fantastic few days at the Kimpton.  The hotel staff were so attentive to our every need.  Angela on reception was wonderful and made us feel so welcome at check in.  The decor was gorgeous throughout.  The hotel is spacious with lots of staff on hand to help.  There is a total sense of relaxation and calm at this hotel.  
Cannot wait to return.",5,2022,08,25
124,Imposing old building thoroughly up to date inside,"Central London location only 10 minutes walk from Euston Station.  Lots of attentive staff, easy check-in.  Modern facilities inside all well maintained.  Downside is the cost - I had a deal for the accommodation but chose not to take the £25 breakfast for example.   Complimentary drinks during the welcome hour (5 - 6 pm) were great.",5,2022,08,25
124,Weekend Break - Kimpton Russell Square,"Cannot recommend this hotel highly enough. Myself, wife and 9 year old son were warmly welcomed at 11am to be told that our room was ready for us. A great start! We absolutely loved the decor and feeling to the hotel with its gothic charm. The room was a perfect size for the 3 of us and the bathroom was huge. One personal highlight was the hotel bar. Davide and Nacho were absolute stars and the cocktail choice was innovative and varied. Have read some reviews on here saying the cocktails lack alcohol! My head the next morning would seriously beg to differ. The bar team, led by Chis are welcoming relaxed and nothing was too much trouble. Breakfast both mornings of a very high standard. We cannot wait to go back here, the location is perfect as well for walking to London's hot spots",5,2022,08,22
124,Never again at the Kimpton,"We have stayed at the Kimpton Fitzroy hotel more than 3 times during the last 2 years, all stays were not less than 10 days.
 The last one was this last December where we booked a suite for me and my husband, and a room for my daughter which was upgraded to spacious room next to us too.
This year i deciced to book at another hotel with a pleasent staff and a wonderful room but as it had a tiny bathroom i decided after the first night to go to the Kimpton, as my husband has the IHG elite membership and should get a complimentary upgrade without hesitent.
Called them the night before to make sure that i get the upgrade and they said that they cannot garantee and it's only upon arrival and i should call at 9 am the next day to make sure.
Called at 9am the next day again to say that it's only upon arrival that they will decide on the upgrade. So it wasn't a YES or NO, it was clearly decidable upon WHO do they want to give an upgrade to!!
Went at 10 am to check in and the receptionist asked the manager for an upgrade infront of me and she said no, and that we do not have the suite for your whole stay, although i was available on the IHG app which i always do the booking on!! 
Had a talk with the manager who left us waiting and dealt with other customers, to say that she's not going to  give us an upgrade, so, you can be rude and say that, and you can be polite and professional and give us your time and clarify why we cannot get an upgrade. Right? Although we have stayed at the hotel last December where it was empty and there was no managers nor receptionist's, and it looked like a ghost hotel, and now when it's full of people they treat us like we've never stayed there!!
Left to another hotel and on the next day i got a call from my husband informing me that the Kimpton has deducted £387 from the card!! Tried calling them but no one answered, i decided to go, just to face another rude receptionist to say that it was the rules to charge a one night if the guest haven't cancelled 24hrs before!! How do i notify you and i came directly upon booking with you! The matter was solved after i talked to the same manager who was there the day before and told her that they do not have the right to deduct the amount,,,,

124,"Fantastic, delightful, magnificent!","Mrs Electric and I have certainly got the Kimpton bug. It started in New York when we went to the Eventi to celebrate a milestone birthday. That hotel was so good, we decided to visit the Kimpton in London. It was superb!

My only complaint was that I had nothing to moan about!!!

I was having the day from hell and consequently by the time I arrived I looked rather like a scarecrow. In fact, much to my embarrassment, I can honestly say that it was the worst that I have looked checking into any hotel in the world......and I have checked into the odd one or two...haha. And when I entered, I found the most fantastic Gothic splendour that I have ever seen in a hotel. My jaw dropped and I went to check in. And I was checked in wonderfully. Clearly the staff have been trained to be as nice to scarecrows as ordinary folk. lol.

Quite remarkably, using London's finest Black Cabs, I arrived to meet Mrs. Electric and our friends only 20 minutes late.

When we arrived back to the hotel much later, she fell in love with it too. And no....she most definately didn't look like a scarecrow......
Breakfast was magnificent and it must be said that we ate enough to stuff 10 scarecrows into obesity.....haha. All of the staff that we met were wonderful. But there were a handful who went that extra mile. Would the following staff please come into the Electric Warrior spotlight. Chalita from Thailand, who was fantastically helpful and very funny. Lena, from Columbia, The Turkish man who served us at breakfast( Tolga ), Diorca (Dominican Republic) and there was possibly another one whose name I have forgotten. What a fantastic breakfast team. And last, but not least, Geraldine from the Philippines who looked after us so well in the bar the night before.

We look forward to seeing you all again some day.

A late review that was caused by everyday life being a real challenge at times and getting in the way. We stayed here on 25th March 2022.",5,2022,08,19
124,A Not so Luxury overnight stay for 2,"This is a review of Kimpton Fitzroy official Luxury overnight stay for 2 which I have included pictures  of the room we actual got so if your buying this as a gift for a special occasion you may want to lessen the recipients expectation and read till the end . 

Checking in was very efficient staff were friendly , helpful and informative making a good first impression but from then on it was all downhill.

When we got to our room there was someone in the room having a telephone conversation we had to double check we had the right room , gave it a minute or two before trying the door and yes someone had decided to use our room as an office to make phone calls .

The room itself was small with little natural light and really rather disappointing to be honest ( see Pictures ) The TV on the wall did not swivel round ?? so you could not watch it from the bed , I have never  stayed in a hotel where the TV was not viewable from the bed ( see Picture ) and if you wanted to watch the TV from the seating area you could only there was one one chair ( see picture ) so considering it was supposed to be a double room where does the other person sit maybe perched on the bed , all sounding very 5 star .

The Tea and coffee making facilities was stingy .. only 2 coffee pods No biscuits and a small selection of tea . 

The Fitz cocktail bar , lovely setting , but the cocktails had about much imagination as they did alcohol  all smoke and mirrors quite frankly and for £15 each very poor value for what is effectively a fruit juice.

Breakfast was a shambles , we were left to stand there for a minute or two before WE asked if we sit anywhere .. No one came over to ask if we would like Tea or coffee I’m not sure there was a system in place at all and it certainly was not explained.
The plates were not warm and having selected the supposedly hot breakfast which was barely warm to touch  I asked where is the toast and was told it would be put out and pointed to the side so standing there a minute or two I asked again as my food is getting even colder  and can they keep it warm , that was met by a look that I was from another planet , I explained again my food is getting cold while I’m waiting .. again I think the girl thought I was joking ( the request just did not initiate a response ) so breakfast was cold , the service was non-existent and really not up to the standard .

This Luxury overnight stay for 2 was a major disappointment for us but As it was purchased as a gift we will of course pretend it was wonderful … we ended up going to the shard for dinner as we had enough of the hotel and didn’t want to give them any more money for such a disappointing stay .",1,2022,08,18
124,Luxury in the heart of the city.,We stayed for a weekend. Two adults and two children. One of the most amazing places I've stayed in London. The staff are friendly and fabulous.  Room was so big too.  The breakfast was amazing.  Luxury in the heart of the city.  The location was 10 out of 10.,5,2022,08,15
124,Great (but expensive),"Wonderfull hôtel with beautifull heavy pillows and beds. It was great to find popcorns on the rooms and we had a marvellous bathroom with a bath we all enjoyed. Maybe it is a little expensive and the breakfasts are too fancy / complicated  to fit with kids… but it’s OK, despite this I think we ll come back later if we can afford it because it truly was beautifull and nice !",4,2022,08,14
124,Wonderful birthday stay,"Arrived to a lovely reception and check in room
Immediately ready 2nd floor reasonably sized room for. Standard inc all usual amenities  coffee machine water etc and a nice complementary bottle of fizz kindly arranged by Kajol as it was my birthday. The decor throughout the hotel  was beautiful .We had a quick drink in the palm court which is light and airy then went onto the other bar Fitz for their social gathering between 5 and 6 pm whereby you can have a complimentary drink. I think this is a lovely idea by Kimpton. We had breakfast both days in the galvin bar  and grill greeted by two friendly faces Sara and diorka …the food is a. really nice mix of buffett and sit down meal offering continental or full English or salmon n eggs to name a few all really tasty.  Nothing is too much trouble to ask for I this hotel and I would certainly recommend this to my clients and friends thanks again for looking after us we had a wonderful stay",5,2022,08,14
124,Great visit.  Highly recommended hotel.,The hotel is spectacular.  Great location. Super service from all staff.  Nicely air conditioned for a hot London Summer.  Terrific breakfast in the Galvin Bar.  Nice happy hour in Fitz.  Picture in Fitz is with Francesco who is a terrific host.,5,2022,08,12
124,Perfect London stay,"I just stayed here for a week with my son during our London vacation and we couldn't be happier with our stay.  It's so daunting to find just the right hotel for a special vacation, and the Kimpton Fitzroy was perfect for us.  

Location - I loved the location - it was easy walking distance to many places, and with a Tube stop on the next block, it was very simple to get all over London.  The area felt very safe, and we were walking in the area most nights around 10 pm.  The Tube is great - I am nervous of the subway in NY, but in London we used the Tube every day - it goes everywhere, there's a train every minute or two, and it's clean and safe.  Definitely the way to get around London!  The hotel is a few stops from the main tourist sites, like Big Ben, but that area was so crowded during the day that we enjoyed getting back to our quieter neighborhood in the evenings, and we were still able to walk to our show near Covent Garden.  

Back to the hotel - Our Room - we had 2 queen size beds.  The beds were extremely comfortable, the room was relatively spacious.  The bathroom was lovely with plenty of space for our toiletries, and my favorite - plenty of light and a makeup mirror.  The room was spotlessly clean and fresh.  Also I never heard another person while in our room - the sound proofing was amazing and we never heard other guests either in the halls or the rooms - wonderful.  There was also no street noise at all.  The air conditioning worked great - we enjoyed perfect weather during our stay, but it was still in the low 80's during the day, so having excellent AC was key, knowing that some London hotels don't have central air.  

Dining - we ate both breakfast and dinner at the hotel.  The food was delicious and the servers were excellent.  The coffee was outstanding!  One night we were looking for a little dessert, but the bar was not open to my son because he is not 18.  The kind young man working at the restaurant brought us a little plate of complimentary truffles for our sweet tooth - a simple but kind gesture that typifies the staff attitude here.  

The Reception - the hotel is in a beautiful building, and the interiors were lovely, without being pretentious.  The entire hotel is recently renovated, and was in great shape. 

All in all, we loved our stay here, and would highly recommend it to anyone visiting London.",5,2022,08,11
124,Amazing Concierge,"I stayed at the Kimpton for a week for a business trip to London and service was impeccable. After I checked in and got to my room, a few small dessert bites were prepared for my arrival and it was just such a sweet start to my trip. Rooms were very clean and it was very convenient to be able to text my designated service person if I had any needs or questions. She always responded very promptly. 

The top 2 highlights of this hotel was the breakfast and concierge. 

I booked a room that had breakfast included and I was able to choose from 2 of the breakfast restaurants to eat at each morning. My favorite was definitely at Galvin Bar & Grill. The ambiance is just so nice – very upscale, wonderful service and each item on the menu was delicious. 

My 2nd highlight was Kimpton's Concierge service. Near my last 1-2 days of my stay at the Kimpton, I had a free day where I wanted to have some afternoon tea for that London experience, but all the popular places were booked out days/weeks in advance and I didn't realize you really can't walk-in and eat at a lot of popular restaurants in London without a reservation. So I decided to ask concierge for a near-impossible task of helping me find a high tea place that would take a same day reservation. I understood my request was potentially really difficult to do so I tried not to be picky but did want to stay under a budget of 80 GBP. Marco Russo from concierge was helping me and said ""Leave this to me, I will find a place for you!""

Omg what an awesome feeling to have someone help with this. So I went about my day and did a little shopping and sightseeing. Marco called me a few hours later to give me an update that he hasn't found a place yet but is continuing to look. THEN, an hour later, he called me back to let me know he's found a great place, way under my budget as well, called ""The Wolseley"" (30-40GBP/person). I've never heard of this hotel but it's apparently very popular as well! I was SO EXCITED. He emailed me the details and all I had to do was show up for my reservation. That seriously made my day because, I know its super touristy, but I do love to enjoy an afternoon tea at least once whenever I visit London. It such a fun experience.

To end it all, I seriously want to give Marco Russo from Kimpton's concierge a HUGE thank you for his efforts in helping me find a place and book that same day afternoon tea reservation. It was definitely one of the highlights of my trip :)",5,2022,08,08
124,Fabulous Hotel in Bloomsbury,Hotel is stunning! Great location. Well appointed rooms with comfortable beds and rain head showers in the bath. Staff is knowledgeable and friendly. Inclusive breakfast was delicious with many options...a great way to start the morning. Gym/ workout room is 5 star!,5,2022,08,08
124,Second visit and would stay again,"We stayed at the Kimpton Fitzroy two nights after a week of driving around Wales and it was great to be so centrally located that we could walk everywhere.  This was our second stay, and although I wasn't quite as thrilled with the room as I was with the room we got the first visit, it was very comfortable and furnished nicely.  Bathroom somewhat small but good water pressure in the shower.  Bathrobes would have been a nice addition, as would a top sheet on the bed - I know it's become the norm in Europe to just have a bottom sheet and a duvet but for many that is too warm, especially during the summer.

We were able to take advantage of one of the social hours and enjoyed breakfast in the casual restaurant.  Staff was congenial and helpful, and the building, as others have commented, is unique and beautiful.

The one criticism I have is that the housekeeping carts were left out in the hall all day and night.  It does not make a nice impression to get off the elevator and have to pass three or four carts piled with cleaning supplies and bags of laundry as well as vacuum cleaners left out.  Apparently there is no closet to store the carts but perhaps they could at least be pushed to the end of the hall when the housekeeping staff isn't working?",4,2022,08,02
124,Fitzroy Joy!,"Beautiful hotel situated perfectly within reach of all London has to offer.

The building itself is absolutely stunning, inside at out. As the hotel sits opposite Russell Square, the park offers the hotel some breathing space so you can really take it all in.

Despite its size, Kimpton have nailed the intimacy, and the common areas are individually beautiful, and never feel overwhelming like in some larger hotels. As you move either way from the lobby you are ever greeted by visually stunning lounges, bars, stairways & hallways. Letting the architecture speak for itself, with that signature Kimpton contemporary twist.

The staff were fantastic, super friendly at all hours and always offering their service & time throughout our stay. Again, helping with that intimate, boutique vibe.  

As part of IHG rewards we were upgraded to a Queen bed premium. Very high standard of finish and a really good size in comparison to other London hotels I have stayed in. As it’s an old building you do get the odd creaks and clunky pipe work, but nothing to cause any fuss. Probably due to the bed being so comfy that no noise could have woke me.

We would not stay anywhere else in London and will definitely return. Hopefully sooner than we hope!",5,2022,07,31
124,Lovely Hotel even better staff,"I recently stayed here for 2 nights with my wife and son. this is the first time we stayed here and the first thing that hits you is what an amazing building and decor the hotel is. the place is spotlessly clean and tidy. You quickly forget this as you are blown away by how friendly the staff are. nothing is to much trouble and everyone is pro active at helping. you. 
I do need to single out the male who was on Reception Saturday 23rd am through to when we left on 25th July. Not only was he polite and kind he took the time to interact with my son answering his questions. what was more amazing was each morning he had remembered what we had done the day before and asked my son about it. I am a firm believer in that it is the attitude of staff that make a hotel great and we will certainly be back. 
the amazing location helps but it is defiantly the staff that stand out here.",5,2022,07,28
124,One of the best hotels in London,"Amazing hotel! All of the staff are extremely friendly and accommodating. Angela on the front desk is an absolute credit to the hotel. Everything about this hotel is first class. Loved the “social hour” in the bar when the drinks were free and we could talk to other hotel guests. Yes, this is at the upper end in terms of price but you get what you pay for. Highly recommended!",5,2022,07,27
124,Fantastic hotel experience,"Our family of 5 stayed at the Fitzroy for 3 nights which was one of the best hotel experiences we have ever had. The outrageous suite, the phenomenal concierge service, the delicious daily breakfast and the awesome vibe of the bar at night were just a few of the many hotel amenities  that contributed greatly to our overall experience in London. Would highly recommend and plan to visit again!",5,2022,07,24
124,"Fabulous hotel with friendly, wonderful staff",Fabulous hotel with a great vibe and lovely welcoming staff. The staff instantly put you at easy and seem genuinely happy to welcome you. I have always walked past this building and wanted to stay. This was great value for money for such a lovely hotel and room. The facilities are stunning and the bar is great fun too! A must stay if you want elegant luxury and contemporary Instagram design!,5,2022,07,23
124,"Fantastic instagram photo of exterior and tempting to stay in but, better just to get your photo and look elsewhere","The hotel has a fantastic charm look from the historical building, the stairs are also great and the room hardly disappoints yet, service says it all and the breakfast area is shared with  no guests looking for free wifi and place to work so hard to get a table. Receptionist not helpful and do not even think to book through booking.com as the hotel will not honour your points.",3,2022,07,14
124,VERY DISAPPOINTING,"Very disappointed.. room was so small, literally on top of each other.. air conditioning did not work {30 degrees}...staff very unhelpful...asked for an ice bucket and wine glasses and the response was 'do you think you will need anything else'... well I don't know yet!

No doorman to take your luggage, upon check-in we weren't given an option of having our luggage taken to our room - extremely bizarre considering its a 5*..

We asked on several occasions if we could change our room and kept being met with we'll need to check & get back to you... I actually had to go to reception & tell them not bother as no one had the decency to get back to us...

Considering its supposed to be a 5* establishment-its the first of a kind that I've stayed at that doesn't offer a turn-down service - apparently this is only for suites.. but I've paid for a 5* service, which we certainly did not receive.

Breakfast in both restaurants was very sub-standard..in fact there was a very long hair on the buffet table, which i had to bring to the attention of the staff that were making drinks right next to it.

Overall, the staff are not pleasant.. everything is too much effort.. we weren't even asked how our experience was upon checking out... seems a case of taking your money in advance & thereafter no service!",3,2022,07,13
124,4 night stay in July,"Our family loved this hotel. The reservation team and the concierge were extremely helpful in the booking process and planning our visit. 

We booked a ONE BEDROOM CORNER SUITE for our 4 night stay. We are a family of 4 - two adults and two children (ages 5 and 2). It was just beautifully set-up and furnished and just what our family needed for our journey. Great separation between spaces and room to move around and enjoy the downtime at the hotel. Our children LOVED the big bath-tub, something separate from the main bathroom...situated in an alcove surrounded by windows - just great. The King bed was wonderfully comfortable. 

We hit one snag our first night with the room and management recognized that it was a significant maintenance issue. We realize these things happen. The overnight management team dealt with it and actually moved us to a different room of the same category the following morning. We were very impressed with how the team operates and can only say positive things. Our family felt valued and taken care of during our stay and will not hesitate to rebook in the future - in fact, we fully recommend it to others traveling to London. 

The concierge was also able to help us arrange car service to the hotel upon arrival to London and to Gatwick upon departure. It was seamless and easy. You know you are in good hands. 

The hotel is gorgeous and you can tell that every detail was well thought out when designing. The restaurants were great - we especially enjoyed Burr & Co. 

The room service menu could use some enhancements. Very few, if anything for children, which surprised us a bit. I think this is the one area that could use some attention. We had to order and pick-up from Burr & Co. to access kid friendly items. Additionally, some added healthy snacks and appetizers- dips, veggies, more fruits. 

All in all, the hotel is a class act and really makes you feel fantastic upon entry. The concierge, front desk staff, front door team and management go above and beyond. You will feel special here. They even left lovely gifts for both us and our children in the room. 

Btw, the elevator system is probably the most efficient that I have seen in a hotel. You barely have to wait. You wave your key, select your floor and are automatically assigned an elevator that will take you directly there. Nice touch. 

Again, when back in London this is where we will be staying - a very well managed and beautiful place to enjoy your time.",5,2022,07,12
124,Fantastic Service,Great to come back to London and stay at The Kimpton again as one of our favourite IHG hotels.  Highlight this time was definitely the delicious breakfast with the best coffee and amazingly friendly and helpful staff.  Xavier in particular is a real superstar and made our stay that much more memorable - thank you!,5,2022,07,09
124,Stunning....,"Just stayed one night in a premium room with two very comfortable double beds, it was lovely.  Surprisingly spacious with a sitting area.  Very big bathroom beautifully appointed. 

The hotel itself is stunning inside and out, it's so so elegant.  We found the staff very welcoming and extremely helpful every time we approached them.  Breakfast was very nice.

Rather expensive but well worth it.  We would definitely return.",5,2022,07,08
124,Fantastic Stay!,"We stayed here in April as we were booked to see a show at the Shaftesbury theatre. The hotel itself its amazing with a real character and very well designed / furnished. The hotel bar is a must visit. Its not particularly cheap but absolutely worth it.. i’d say one of the top
Cocktails we’ve tried. The rooms are also fantastic and full of real charm with high quality amenities etc. We do love the Kimpton both here and in Manchester and will sure to be back!",5,2022,07,06
124,Super service,"What I like the most with this hotel experience are the varieties of great restaurants, all with their own styles and characters. You can choose between different restaurants for breakfast. Lovitt! 

I had some problems when I arrived and it was treated very professionally and personally so I was super happy.

My Kimpton experience continues to be absolutely great. Hold on to it!",5,2022,07,05
124,DON’T choose here of all the choices in London,"Horrible experience. Bathroom hardware is loose and hard to operate. Staff is slow to respond and NEVER answers the phone. EVER. Unaccommodating with simple requests. The front desk is unmanned at odd times and dismissive of questions, constantly looking down at a computer doing something else while you’re trying to speak with them. Just not what I expected from a hotel like this. Disappointed. And with as many hotels London has to offer, I’d chose another one.",1,2022,07,04
124,Loved it,"We loved our 3 night stay here. A stunning historical building with an equally stunning, high end, chic, contemporary yet still sympathetic renovation. 

This is a hotel that you could never leave and still love your London experience. It has a sophisticated English restaurant, Galvin, a nice all day diner, Burr and Co and a classy and lively bar, Fitzroys so lots to choose from. Also a great gym on the ground floor with a large selection of new Technogym equipment. 

Our main room, a 1 King Bed 1 Bedroom Suite was simply gorgeous with a handy sitting room, beautiful bedroom and luxurious, gigantic bathroom. Definitely worth the splurge. Our kids had a Queen Bed Essential room which was quite pokey but still very nice. Try booking a better category room if you can to avoid disappointment with room size. 

The proximity to the Russel Square underground station was great and there is also a large selection of takeaway restaurants close by which the kids really appreciated.

The staff were always nice and tried hard to make our stay pleasant. 

Will definitely be back and wouldn’t hesitate to recommend to friends and family. This is a great Kimpton hotel.",5,2022,07,03
124,Wonderful hotel in London,"We received an upgrade to a king bed  suite due to the hotel not having our Two Double Bed Premium Park View available (I believe there were HVAC issues?). They provided a rollaway bed to give us the extra sleeping space we needed as a family of 3. The suite provided a nice amount of room and comfort for our family. The park view was great. The bathroom was beautiful and spacious. The beds were comfortable. The room was quiet, clean and the a/c worked very well.
The only sour note was when I went to grab pastries and coffee to go on morning 3, like I had every other morning. Unlike the other mornings, I was made to sit a table then charged a service fee because I sat at a table. Other mornings I had just walked up to the bar with no trouble. If you just want something to go, firmly tell them that you do not want to sit.
We didn't have time to use the hotel's amenities but enjoyed walking around and looking at this gorgeous property.",5,2022,07,02
124,Tiny rooms and untrustworthy with lost items,"I recently stayed at the Kimpton Fitzroy and although the outside of the hotel and lobby evoke an image of grandeur nothing could be further from the truth. The rooms are unacceptably tiny. To the point where they look more like a closet than an actual room. Moving around in the room is a challenge and forget about finding a place to leave your personal belongings in an organized fashion.

The minuscule closet in the room is meant for hanging clothes but also to prepare tea/coffee. How is that even possible? Unfortunately I forgot a pair of pants behind in my hotel room and after several calls to the reception they mentioned they were never turned in. Who steals a pair of pants? If they are unable to find a pair of pants in this tiny hotel room it is not a stretch to assume other more valuable items are at risk there as well of never being located. Would definitely not recommend this hotel.",2,2022,07,01
124,Beautiful Inside and Out.,"This is my second stay at the Kimpton Fitzroy. If you've never been to just admire the architecture of this beautiful building - it's worth a trip for that alone.
The period styling continues inside, with bars, restaurants and hideaway snugs furnished with thoughtful taste.
Our room (a King Suite) didn't disappoint. An impressive, modern four poster and a cavernous, luxurious bathroom ensured we had a very comfortable stay.
Breakfast was a choice between two restaurants (continental and cooked). My ""full English"" vegetarian was superb and my partner's smashed avocado/smoked salmon was apparently top notch too.
Finally, but no less importantly, the welcome we received from doormen, reception and everyone Kimpton was five star plus. Everyone smiled and couldn't be more helpful and professional.
A special thanks to the manager, Roberto who definitely knows how to make guests feel valued.",5,2022,06,29
124,Good Location,"Very close to Russell Square tube station. We had afternoon tea booked at the Ritz and wanted to change, at 14:50 there was still no rooms available in this massive hotel...admittedly strictly our room shouldn't have been available for another 10 minutes. The hotel offered a toilet for us to change in, hardly going the extra mile. The ""superior"" room was very small (number 358) Good breakfast...we got the hotel using Tesco Points...wouldn't go back.",3,2022,06,28
124,Legal Ceremony Stay,"I will start this review by saying I should have known.. I had called the hotel a few times before our stay and must admit I was less than impressed with the service I received over the phone. I had requested if we would be able to check in early so we were able to get ready on the day of our legal wedding ceremony. I was told they would do their best but couldn’t guarantee. I had called a few more times to ask different questions and each time and would mention about the early check in possibility each member of staff seemed none the wiser about this request. Spoke to Beverley about what their breakfast menu was she was none the wiser and just told me on the day reception will tell me. I do think a big part to the frustrating phone calls was the language barrier. I got the feeling that I wasn’t being understood no matter how many times I said it or slowed down.

When it came to the day of our wedding to no surprise they said once again they couldn’t guarantee an early check-in. I then told reception I had flowers coming which are in my name - gave my name and explained that the booking of the room is in my fiancé’s name also gave his name. Once again felt like there was a language barrier and reception weren’t understanding. My florist then rang me and said I’m here but they’re saying your name doesn’t have a room.. I gave my fiancé’s name once again and left it there. When however we arrived they had said we have flowers but there’s no name ?! I was beyond frustrated at this point and had been frustrated with the hotel all morning of which you shouldn’t have to deal with on the day you’re getting married.

Staff weren’t very friendly and although stood very clearly in a white suit and (eventually) a bouquet of flowers not one person congratulated us or wished us a good day.

This hotel is saved by its architecture and decor - it’s absolutely stunning. However service and staff very poor unfortunately.

Will never be staying at this hotel again and will make sure to let friends and family know of our ordeal here.",2,2022,06,26
124,Not coming back here,"Tries to be upscale but service is just average. Staff not particularly helpful or friendly. Room not ready even though arrived after 3pm check in. Then room not cleaned after being out all morning and afternoon and snippy response was cleaning service runs until 5pm. Restaurants are overpriced and food is not very good. With all the hotel and dining options in London, I would not return here.",3,2022,06,24
124,"Visually arresting, solid choice","The building’s architecture is a visual feast designed by man who did work on the Titanic design . Location is a block from the Piccadilly line Russell Square station making it easy to take a tube from Heathrow and skip a cab ride. It’s not far from St. Euston station (5 mins by cab), but I would not walk with luggage.  Hotel Bar is lovely gathering place for drinks or coffee with pleasant mixed local and visitor crowd.  Room was very well appointed and clean.  Staff were terrific.  

We usually stay at the Rosewood which is a ten minute walk to the south in Holborn.  It is a five-star hotel, luxe and expensive.  By comparison, the Kimpton is a bit less costly yet is essentially as comfortable and as visually attractive.  The rooms are a touch fancier at the Rosewood and the location a tad more upscale.  But for however much money you save at the Kimpton, the experience is quite comparable.  I prefer the Rosewood’s better location yet if the prices there spike (as they do on occasion) or if I were on personal holiday paying my own way versus on a business account,  I would definitely be happy to return to the Kimpton Fitzroy.",4,2022,06,19
124,Very disappointed this time round,"First, I asked for early check-in, although I never receive it. But check-in is stated as 3:00 PM. At 4:30 I had to inquire as I had a meeting at Holborn at 5 and wanted to change. The room was ready, and no one bothered to let me know, even though I was seated next to the check-in desk. At check-in I was asked if I was a Diamond member, I don't get it. To be fair, this is the only IHG member that has asked since the IHG 1 'upgrade.' 

Secondly, I never get an upgrade. If upgrades are only for full cash reservations, say so. No big deal, but I would expect a 'We value your Diamond Ambassador loyalty, but we have no upgrades.' Cool, I can deal with that. 

Also, I left my bag with someone and was told it would be delivered to my room. When I got to my room, there was no bag. I called Beverly to inquire and she said someone would bring it around. I had to leave to make my appointment and ran into the person delivering my bag to another room. I told him it was mine, but he waited for the other room to confirm it wasn't theirs. I get it, but now I was just annoyed. 

Let me say, I have stayed here previously, and it was amazing. Can't say enough about how great it was. But this time was not. The rooms are clean and adequate. And the breakfast and drinks were fabulous, but honestly, Kimpton doesn't seem to be suffering from a lack of staff, but rather too much. It just feels disjointed, also the one guy that literally stands there looking over the front desk is very off-putting. He never smiled or said hello, just stood there looking as if he was ready to bounce someone out. 

This time was disappointing, but surely it was just a hiccup and not a habit.",3,2022,06,17
124,Thoughtful attention to everything … concierge went above and beyond,"The hotel itself is elegant yet approachable, just across the street from lovely Russell Square. Once you are there for a night, you realize how much thought has gone into the room design and amenities selected.  While the rooms aren’t big, they are so well designed that they feel bigger and you’re never at a loss for what you need. 

That said, the most outstanding area for us was service and in particular the concierge, I think named Rury (?).  First, he tried to call us back about a dinner reservation.  Because I accidentally left the phone off the hook, he came up to the room with the information.  Also, while we were having a quick bite, he researched how to get to an event we had booked, printed instructions and delivered it to us in the cafe.  On the very rainy day we left, he joined a colleague in flagging down a hard-to-get taxi. Also, he was very attentive throughout in our comings and goings.  

We appreciated Burr and Co. Cafe as a reliable and tasty option, especially when on the go.  It’s always lively and serves many needs from a coffee to glass  of wine and snack or full meal. Excellent service there as well.  

Definitely will stay again.",5,2022,06,15
124,Lovely,"Had a fantastic 4 night stay here.  Lovely.  Thoughtful.  Clean.  Classic.  Location is perfect, steps from Russel Square Station.  
The two double bed room was small but it was as stated on the website.  Maybe next time our family of 4 should pack less :)",5,2022,06,14
124,So enjoyable,"We stayed here for 3 nights with a wedding party.  I couldn't fault the hotel or its staff.
We booked a small upgrade and it was well worth it. Had a lot more room than others and bathroom was huge. 
Breakfast was excellent.  Staff were brilliant and I would return without hesitation. 
Lovely pub next door which was easy to meet up in, but we did use the hotel bar too. The service was perfect. 
What a gem this hotel is, but it's not for a cheap trip.
Thank you for making it stay so enjoyable.",5,2022,06,14
124,Gorgeous hotel but inconsistency in room category,"So glad we stayed here.  Just a beautiful hotel.  We stayed for 5 nights at the end of May, went to Paris for 5 nights, then returned for 1 additional night before flight home.  Booked a premium King through Expedia for both stays.  Arrived very early from an overnight flight from the U.S.  Not surprised that room wasn't available but was told we would get a text when room was ready.  Never received a text but after coming back to the hotel early in the afternoon, we were told that our rooms were ready and bags had been delivered to rooms (traveling with another couple).  Anyway, would have been nice to be texted since we really wanted to freshen up after an overnight flight.  As soon as I got into the room, I questioned if we were given the correct room category.  Much smaller than what the description had said.  I was told that the room was indeed a Premium King.  Since it's been a couple of years since we traveled due to COVID, there must have been a change in European hotels in terms of no longer including a topsheet on beds.  We asked for a topsheet and I had also asked for a topsheet for the other couple (after talking to them about it).  We never received it and had to ask again.  The next day, housekeeping took away our topsheet and remade our bed without it. Just little issues that I had read about in other reviews - rainhead shower is about 68 inches up from the bottom of the tub.  I was fine with it but I can see how anyone above average height would have issues.  I had also contacted the hotel prior to our arrival asking if they had a backgammon table (we had intended on playing backgammon with the other couple).  Was told they did not have it, so we purchased a travel set just to bring with us.  After we sit at a table near the front desk, we discovered a huge backgammon box, so we played with that daily.  Rory, the concierge, was GREAT!!!  He was able to get really good seats for Phantom of the Opera on short notice when we could not get any online.  He also boxed up a very inconvenient souvenir from the Chelsea Flower Show (long brass poppies - garden decor) without charge.  Also stored our large suitcase while we went to Paris for 5 days.  Upon our return from Paris, we checked in and was told that our rooms weren't ready again but we would receive a text when it was ready.  I told the front desk that we were never notified when we checked in the first time.  She apologized and showed me how she highlighted on our check-in sheet that we would be called on the phone and texted when room was ready.  And AGAIN, we were never notified and we got back to our room at 4pm with no notification but our rooms were ready.  This time, the room that we were given was what I had expected of  Premium King.  I called down and asked what category room I was given and was told it was a Premium King, far better than what we stayed in the first 5 nights.  Both times, we had a king sized bed but the room size was significantly different.  The room and the bathroom were larger than the previous 5 days.  I certainly plan on returning to London as we had a wonderful time (excluding the HUGE disappoint with The Savoy about an error in OpenTable giving me a reservation for Afternoon Tea on a day they don't even serve Tea!!).  I would certainly make sure that I receive the LARGER Premium King room rather than their smaller one. It really should be more consistent, if I really did get a Premium King room the first five days, which I am a little skeptical about.  Wish they would serve hors d'oeuvres with their afternoon cocktail hour, like many other Kimptons (in the U.S.)",4,2022,06,13
124,Amazing time at Jubilee weekend,I booked the room few days ago for my parents and they enjoy the hotel and all facilities a lot. I want to say thank you to all Kimpton Fitzroy London team and specially thanks to Isabel Ulzurrun De Asanza to take care of my parents.,5,2022,06,07
124,Beautiful Hotel and Great People,"My husband and I stayed three nights in a corner suite. The furnishings were so lovely and well thought out. The interior designer did a fantastic job. Aside from the beautiful architecture and furnishings, the staff were wonderful as well. One particular person on staff stood out -  Debbie. She greeted us every evening right as we came through the front doors with a beaming smile and personality to match. I actually miss her she was such a nice person. I highly recommend this hotel! 

Oh I almost forgot, this hotel is steps from Russell Square station so it was extremely easy and efficient to get around the city with it being so near.",5,2022,06,06
124,A great stay,"Stayed at this hotel for a birthday get together with family. At first there was a little confusion with the type of room booked,  but this was quickly rectified by Angela. Angela dealt with our request efficiently and we were exceedingly pleased with the upgrade she arranged for us. She was very friendly and obliging  throughout our stay, helping to make the occasion even more special.
The hotel is absolutely beautiful with everything we could possibly need. The complimentary cocktail hour was the icing on the cake!",5,2022,06,06
124,Disappointing,"We have stayed this hotel a few times, but our recent stay was very disappointing.

We were delighted to learn we had been given a room upgrade, on Check-In, were told Breakfast was included with our room rate.  We were greeted as Diamond Elite Members and asked if we wanted the 600 points or a £15 credit towards food and/or drink. We always have points, but as we knew we would either be having Room Service or eating in Burr, pre-theatre, we opted for the credit.When we saw the lovely room we decided to have Room Service but ended up having to go down and order it, as no one answered the phones. The food when it arrived was was delicious. 

Whilst getting ready to go out and removing the second key from the envelope we found a voucher for £15, to be used at the Bar. We realised that the £15 was not a credit toward food and drink, on our account, but a voucher we needed to use at the Bar.  If we had known that we would had not have Room Service and would have ate in the bar.

Before checking out we wanted to complain about some of the issues we had experienced at the hotel, as we had been given lots of misinformation about the credit, the breakfast (which wasn't included) and the bill. We waited more than 20 minutes for the manager, who never came to see either of us.

Whilst I have been very disappointed with all the Staff on Reception and the Staff in the Bar, Wallace and Johan, the Porters, were excellent in assisting us and the Manager has since been in contact with me.",3,2022,06,06
124,Great from start to Finish,"Check in was smooth. We arrived early and our room was ready so we were able to go straight up. Staff were excellent, polite and helpful.  The Galvin Bar and Grill has great Food, The bar also has complimentary drinks between 5 and 6 for residents which is a nice touch. We had breakfast in  the hotel  brasserie Burr and co which again was very good. The hotel is beautiful and in an excellent location. Upon checkout we were able to leave our luggage and spend the rest of the morning and afternoon in London. Would definitely recommend.",5,2022,06,03
124,"Better Than Average, But Not Very Good","We stayed for two nights at the Kimpton Fitzroy, in what was described on our reservation as a ‘One Double Bed Urban’ (although interestingly, this doesn’t fit any of the descriptions on their website). We arrived ahead of check-in time, but we were told that we could leave our bags and they would send us a text when our room was ready. We didn’t receive a text, so we made sure we arrived back after check-in time. We were told that our room still wasn’t ready, but then after conversations between the reception staff they decided that a room was available after all. This, coupled with the lack of signage to find reception in the hotel, did not create a good first impression or make us feel very welcome. 

Our room was small, but reasonably well laid out, with mirrored doors on the wardrobe to give the impression of a little extra space. The bed was comfortable. There was only one chair to sit on. The bathroom was big, well lit and with a reasonable amount of shelf space (including the windowsill). The towel rail was as far away as possible from the bath/shower - a simple hook next to the bath would have been helpful. We were given only one bathrobe between two of us. Toiletries were nice and in full-sized bottles rather than wasteful miniatures. The shower combination over the bath had a handheld and fixed rain shower heads. The height of the rain shower head was ridiculous - anybody over about 5 ft 8 inches would not be able to stand under it.

The room had a safe and mini fridge, with two bottles of water and a carton of milk. There was a kettle and a selection of teabags, but no instant coffee. There was a Nespresso machine, with two coffee pods. On our first day we used two teabags and one coffee pod. None of these was replaced, and the second (unused) coffee pod was removed! We didn’t realise this until early the following morning, when we were unable to have a cup of coffee.

One lady on reception did make amends for the less than perfect welcome, by being friendly and helpful, giving us an extra bottle of water and telling us about the 5pm ’Social Hour’ - wine, beer and soft drinks. It was a little tricky to work out where this was (it was in what I think is Galvin’s Bar, although again the signage in the hotel isn’t particularly helpful), but once we found it, it was a pleasant experience, with good service.

Our package included two cocktails in Fitz’s Bar, £100 credit towards a meal in Galvin’s Bar & Grill, and breakfast in either Galvin’s or Burr & Co. Our cocktails and dinner were very good indeed, with generally good service (apart from the lady who tried to persuade us to choose different starters from each other, pushing one dish in particular. Maybe they were trying to get rid of it?). On our second evening, we had been out all day and just wanted a quiet drink in the hotel. This proved difficult, as Fitz’s had a live band and was very busy and Burr & Co. had a DJ, playing loud music. We did get a seat in Galvin’s bar, where the live music from Fitz’s was being played through speakers, but it was pleasant enough and we were at least able to have a conversation without shouting above the noise of a DJ.

Our breakfast experience was mixed. On the first day we chose Burr & Co. My husband wanted to order just bacon and egg, which seemed to cause a great deal of difficulty amongst the staff, who wanted him to have the full English breakfast (I heard two members of staff next to the ordering station, talking about him). Presumably their ordering system is automated, so it would have been easier for them if he had ordered the full English. But surely this isn’t the first time somebody has asked for just a couple of items from the selection on the menu? And a simple chat to the kitchen staff shouldn’t be too much to ask for. And whatever happened to the maxim ‘the customer is alway right’?? Anyway, he did get just bacon and eggs. We were offered a choice of coffees when we arrived and we both chose Americano. However, when we asked for a second cup, again we were met with puzzled looks and told that there were pots of coffee that we could use to serve ourselves. On our second day we chose Galvin’s for breakfast and had a much better experience, although parts of it were still odd. On each table there was a plate of 3 packs of butter and some little pots - our selection turned out to be one honey, one jam, one marmalade and four brown sauce! We asked for some of the brown sauce pots to be replaced with a better selection of jams, which was okay. When we wanted more butter, that seemed to be a difficult concept, with the waiter wandering around for quite a while before he managed to bring some out of the kitchen. And again, when we wanted a second cup of coffee, the staff seemed to be surprised. But overall, we would definitely choose Galvin’s rather than Burr & Co. for breakfast.

When we checked out, the receptionist took the £100 dinner credit off the bill, but didn’t seem to be aware of the included cocktails, so that took a while to resolve.

The hotel building itself is very impressive and there are a few areas around the lobby where you can sit and read or people watch. It really should be a perfect experience, but, for a hotel of this class, standards and staff training should be much better.",3,2022,05,24
124,"Thank you, Angela, a nice and thoughtful lady.","We spent 7nights here, one receptionist named Angela impressed me. She is very nice, thoughtful and passion while my waiting in reception counter as my husband checked out already and went for renting a car. We enjoyed the stays here, of course the room and the food are all great, the people working here are always greeting guests and smiling on their face. I will recommend this hotel to my friends defiantly.",5,2022,05,20
124,Enjoyed it,Me and Mrs enjoyed it the place is nice and service is good and location is good near everything. Rooms are bit small which might bother some but we were fine with it. Obviously bloomsbury is a draw and we will stay here again when  we come back. Lots of things to do in that area thanks to everyone at the hotel,5,2022,05,17
124,5 Star Service,"I stayed here with a friend for the Fury vs Whyte fight on April 23rd. The hotel is situated in the affluent and touristy Bloomsbury area which is right in front of Euston station making it perfect for travel to virtually anywhere.

We stayed in a Premium Double room which was well equipped and spotless. The interior of the hotel is impressive to say the least and the bar area which opens from 3pm was fantastic with some of the best cocktails I’ve ever had.

What truly made our stay special were the staff who were truly world class. From reception through to the bar and cafe staff everyone was not only professional but also incredibly warm and keen to help. There is sometimes an air of snobbery at five star establishments (especially when you return post-boxing slightly tipsy wearing a hoodie) but this was not the case here.

This is now my go to hotel in London, can’t wait to stay again!",5,2022,05,15
124,Lovely Visit. Hamza is such a sweetheart!,"Visited there yesterday after drinks with two of my friends at Burr. The ambience was amazing and there were not too many people around. It was even more amazing when Hamza one of the staff gave us a personalised tour around the hotel and letting us know about the history of the Hotel and the Titanic. It was so lovely, the rooms are lovely and the place is a scene from a movie. Would be coming here again!",5,2022,05,15
124,"Stunning hotel, Super location for a Special occasion in London -","A group of 9 stayed at this hotel for the weekend to celebrate a special birthday. 

We specifically wanted a  luxury hotel with a central location, easily accessibly from London Heathrow. The Fitzroy ticked all these boxes. 

We checked in on Friday afternoon (around 2) we were early for check in so concierge  kept our bags and we had a drink and a bite to eat in the Palm court  - Poh  served us in the Palm court, he was so friendly and welcoming  - food was good , simple but tasty - would recommend the ham and cheese toastie with a glass of champagne! 

The hotel is a  stunning building and certainly was a perfect back drop for a special occasion   - we ate in Glavins on Friday evening  - food was excellent, service was really good also! Bonus with live music in the cocktail bar after - atmosphere was nice and mellow - perfect for conversations. Cocktail menu is super fancy, probably a bit over thought but  if you are in to cocktails this will delight!

We stayed in a suite on the 6th floor  - stylish, cosy, HUGE  - with all the amenities you could possibly need  - a massive bath over looking the park - bliss! 

Breakfast was in Burr and Co (I like a different restaurant to dinner)  - easy going, efficient service - great coffee and big tables so our group could eat together! 

Just when I thought  this place is perf - I stumble across the resident puppy  - Ceaser - a 12 week old boxer who is carefully minded by a lady called Hannah  - his bed is in the lobby for all residents to dote over and he is divine! 

The Fitzroy is a fabulous hotel and is the perfect base for a weekend in London - beautiful hotel, central location, great staff and a fun atmosphere - its fancy but not stuffy....",5,2022,05,09
124,All style and no substance,"Whilst the building and decor are very nice our room (638) was so bad. The walls sloped but the curtains didn’t, and as there were no blinds the sun shone through at dawn, directly onto the pillows. The aircon needed regassing as the room didn’t cool down to required temp and gurgled all night. So little sleep was had. 
Then in the morning whilst trying to shower, the rainfall shower head was shorter than me and I’m only 5’3”.  My 6’2” husband could not even stand upright to use the flexi hose. 
Only one coffee per person was quite stingy also.
House keeping let themselves in at 9am on check out day, despite having the do not disturb sign on the door whilst we were still trying to recoup some sleep.
The good points were:  nice snacks in the room; although we didn’t get round to trying them, comfy (albeit small queen) bed and power sockets with USB ports next to both sides of the bed.

Overall I was very disappointed, as being able to sleep and get clean are key requirements to a good hotel stay. As a IHG Ambassador level loyalty member I would recommend the Park Lane Intercontinental over this hotel in the same chain and price bracket everyday of the week.",1,2022,05,09
124,"Beautiful building, friendly staff","My daughter and I stayed at the Fitzroy for a little over a week. We arrived early in the morning and were kindly given a room right away. I can only assume because of that request we were given a room at the back of the hotel.  Therefore, I don't want to complain about it, but if possible request a room at the front, overlooking the park. Otherwise, you will have a view of the alley.
The rooms are cute and fairly spacious, especially for a European hotel. The hotel is clean and decorated beautifully. The architecture is stunning, exactly the thing I want on a European holiday.  The restaurants are nice and were easy to get into. We especially enjoyed having a cup of tea in the Palm Room, at the end of the day.  We used the gym daily, and it is one of the nicest gyms I have used in a hotel.
The only draw back is the location. It is in a lovely area, but for most sight seeing and tours you have to take a cab (unless you are ok with using the underground). Cabs can be expensive and with London traffic you will have to allow plenty of time to get where you need to go.  You are within walking distance of the British Museum and Charles Dickens Museum, so that is nice.  All in all we had a lovely time and were happy with the hotel and staff. ",5,2022,05,07
124,Great stay except not having been told about the complimentary drinks,Great stay in this beautiful hotel. However having stayed 6 nights we were never told that in the evening there was a complementary during social hour. Just learnt about it when we checked out. Shame the receptionnist who welcomed us never told us about this.,4,2022,05,06
124,Not good experience for us,"We were overcharged on checking out, and a number days later and several calls later still not refunded or a call back to advise when being sorted.

Also a little disappointed as one of the robes in the room was dirty, and milk in the cooler out of date. There were other cases of lack of attention to detail which is surprising. Although, quickly replaced when requested.

The Fitzroy bar is funky and cocktails bars lovely and so fully recommended for drinks.

The Galvin Bar and grille food was not especially memorable, but the staff absolutely wonderful which made up for the dining experience.",2,2022,05,06
124,Highly Recommend,"We celebrated our 20th anniversary two years later. Kimpton held our reservations the whole time and worked with us without a hitch. We had a lovely time, we’re actually there in March and the weather was amazing. It’s perfectly located across the street from Russell Square, Park where there is also a cute little restaurant. The neighborhood feel safe at night and we can’t wait to return and stay at the Kimpton again.",5,2022,04,27
124,Excellent Conference Venue,"Very well looked after by the staff. The ballroom was perfect for our event of 200 people with production staff. Catering was first class. 

The rooms are incredibly luxurious and the location is perfectly central without being too hectic.",5,2022,04,27
124,Wonderful,"My husband and I stayed here after staying at Batty Langley's.The Fitzroy was such a relief after that, with it's modern bathrooms and conveniences, room service etc. The Fitzroy has managed to combine traditional and modern touches very elegantly. We loved the decor, and the staff from check in to check out were wonderful. Thanks to Shuja, Krasi, Joseph, Estejauia. 
The Fitz Bar was beautiful and we received excellent service from Akshit, Akira, Ka-Sarnya. There was also a wonderful waiter at the social hour whose name I forgot, ( he was Indian and new). He was very helpful too. 
The food and drinks at Fitz Bar was delicious. My husband and I had a wonderful evening. We watched the snow fall from the bar's beautiful large picturesque windows. It was a lovely sight.
This hotel is truly beautiful and in a great location,but what makes the Fitzroy stand out is it's amazing , friendly staff who go out of their way to make your stay is comfortable and memorable. The rooms are lovely with thoughtful touches. To find such a beautiful, elegant hotel  at such reasonable prices isn't easy in a beautiful tourist city. We travel to London a lot and this will be our home away from home hotel. Highly recommend.",5,2022,04,25
124,Quick stop on the way to Paris!,"We stopped here for 2 nights on the way to Paris. Fabulous hotel, staff were excellent and efficient. Our room was a little small but we were out all day so it didn't bother us too much. 
Only downside was the rather load music playing until late on our second night for a function taking part but the Easter eggs in our room and the invite to complimentary drinks for residents at 5pm made up for it! ",4,2022,04,22
124,"Olde world charm, pure class","A beautiful old hotel, with a sense of style and an interesting history to it - read up about it on wiki, etc for a bit of background. Service was impeccable throughout, beds were super comfy, room was nice and quiet, despite this being central London. Highly recommended.",5,2022,04,20
124,Lovely stay,"We had a two night stay. I had booked my room on a night free as part of my IHG offer for a weekend. The hotel is lovely, clean and all the staff are very friendly. 

We had breakfast booked both mornings. On the first morning we eat in the restaurant, they are not so good at getting your order right but it all came eventually. The second day we didn’t have our room order breakfast in bed arrive at all. We rang at 10 to say it hasn’t arrived and they sent it but it was all wrong. Anyway we decided to get up and get ready. The room was lovely and clean, comfortable and had everything you needed. The TV didn’t work, the reception in there is awful. The connection services don’t also work. But we managed to get the radio working so we listened to music. 

I have given 5 stars as I thought the reception staff were great at listening to the issues and put it right. Great customer service. We will be coming back as I want to have breakfast in bed.",5,2022,04,19
124,Excellent service again,"Having stayed before, I thought it was worth noting the excellent service we had on our last visit. Andrea on the front desk was great, and the concierge (unfortunately didn’t catch his name) was very friendly and helpful with leaving our bags when we arrived early. There was some confusion with housekeeping on ordering some decaff coffee pods (which they heard as coffee pots, so arrived with two teapots…), which took a while but did eventually get resolved. The room was lovely again, although the layout of the light in the bathroom meant that you blinded the other person in the night if you got up for the loo. Both minor issues though, and it’s still one of our favourite places to stay when in London.",5,2022,04,18
124,Beautiful Hotel and attentive staff.,"Overall We enjoyed the hotel, its location, amenities, food, drinks and amazing coffee.  The staff is responsive and moves quickly.  Room service and housekeeping were quick and thorough.  The room was very clean and comfy.  The architecture is beautiful, and the food in the cafe was great.  We didn’t eat in the other restaurants because we were all over the city.  We were a little disappointed that weddings all week long took over the restaurant and the bar one evening.  We had invited friends over and were surprised we couldn’t go in the bar.  I think the bar in general closes unusually early (11:30 last call), especially for a holiday week with a sold out hotel. One night we were there and the bar was FULL.  They announced last call.  It just wasn't what we are used to from the US.  Who closes a full bar?  Seemed odd to us.  And the bar menu was a little boring.  Again, I see that as a missed opportunity to sell more and people would drink more.  The rooms are lovely, very clean, but small, and they desperately need more counter space, like a dresser for personal items, and drawers for clothes etc.  The bathroom was very clean and had nice towel warmers, full sized shampoo, conditioner and body wash- very nice shower head and plenty of hot water.  Unfortunately, we did have numerous issues with our room key- i think we had someone working on our door at least four times, and needed new room keys daily.  I realize things break, and the staff tried to handle things, and quite apologetically might I add. But a manager somewhere should have tried to “make up” for the repeated inconvenience that most of the hotel staff knew was a big issue. Offer a drink at the bar or a pot of coffee in the am… something.  The concierge Marco was great, and helped us with a bus tour, dinner reservations and made some good recommendations.  Our favorite of those was definitely brunch at Duck and Waffles! Highly recommend!   His colleague, Joseph assisted us with a ride on the eye as well as in house, pre travel COVID testing.  Take good care of them and they will take amazing care of you!  Even the bell hop Theo was so helpful and smiling grabbing Taxis for us, delivering things to our room, and handling bags etc.  I would certainly recommend this hotel, and management should be very proud of the staff.  We felt very at home here.",4,2022,04,16
124,Truly Elegant Hotel with Excellent Service,"The hotel is an architectural gem with fun and innovative design. For anyone who likes historic architecture, the building itself is worth the stay. In addition, the customer service was exceptional, with staff members committed to making my stay as pleasant as possible. I used the concierge service a great deal and they were excellent, particularly Marco, who went above an and beyond to make my stay in London worry free. I highly recommend the Kimpton Fitzroy and will be back on my next trip.",5,2022,04,16
124,Downgraded and disappointed,"I was extremely disappointed with this hotel, it ruined my experience in London, and it’s made me question my loyalty to Kimpton and IHG. We were heavily downgraded when they acted like they acted like they had given us an upgrade. I booked a superior king room for 1 night using cash, and a standard double room the 2nd night using as that was the only room available for IHG points. I’m usually upgraded rooms as an IHG platinum elite member anyways, but I was planning to offer to pay the difference to upgrade to a king for the 2nd night since you can only book basic rooms on points. I was very excited to see that the 2nd night’s reservation had automatically been upgraded in the IHG app ahead of time to match the king room I paid cash for, and I figured that was settled. When I arrived they said we had been upgraded to a superior room just as I had seen in the app before. The bed seemed small for a king, but we figured it was just a European-style king since we had just arrived from a different region with more spacious Hotels. Well, we realized by the time we tried to sleep that we had actually been downgraded to a queen bed that could barely fit my wife and I. By that point it felt like we couldn’t exchange the room at 1am since we had already used it for the day. We tried talking to the front desk, but they insisted they had upgraded us since it was a premium park view w/ a queen bed. They said we didn’t reserve a king bed even though we showed them the king bed reservation in my email… because IHG changed and downgraded it to a queen in their app and system by the time I checked in. The manager wasn’t available at 8am and they had nothing to offer to make up for the downgrade since they insisted it was an upgrade. We had an early flight the next morning that would have made it impossible to get a good night sleeping to 2nd night so it wasn’t even worth the trouble of trying to upgrade rooms by that point (even though they offered to upgrade us to the room I initially reserved… for more money!) A park view and queen bed may be a premium room, but we specifically selected this hotel because it had a king size bed in central London, and the app reflected my award night had been upgraded to the same room prior to check in. We would have absolutely avoided this hotel if we weren’t going to get a king bed even for 1 night as it was really only a convenient walk to the British Museum.",1,2022,04,12
124,AmazIng Lindon hotel ( rare to find ) a must stay,"Amazing hotel, right in so many ways, well appointed , great rooms  Location brilliant a short walk to Covent Garden , St Pancras station or. oxford street , service unreal.  Recently refurbished , fresh  new

Most important… Every hotel needs a Steve on reception",5,2022,04,06
124,Grand hotel.,"Over the last 30 years, I had often walked past this historic London hotel, apart from a long ago dinner and a visit to the bar, I had never ventured much inside until this recent stay. A very comfortable easy going hotel, grand in design, from another era, echo's of the titanic but fully refurbished and once checked in, very reluctant to venture outside, with a great Galvin restaurant and atmospheric bar to fulfil our needs. However British Museum is a short walk, and a tube station is alongside the hotel.",5,2022,04,04
124,Very good.,"Had a three night stay there with family. Got upgraded to a one-bedroom suite. Rooms are very comfortable if somewhat impractical (no coat hanger, no place to keep soap near the bathtub). Very clean. Comfortable Beds and quiet. Loved the quality of breakfast in Burr & Co, and our dinner in Galvin's Bar and Grill. However, the service by staff in Burr and at the bar wasn't that great as they seemed to be overworked and understaffed...will be back!",4,2022,04,04
124,Loved our stay for our first trip to London!,"First, wanted to acknowledge how patient Kimpton Fitzroy London was with us postponing our reservations that were initially made for May 2020.  We rescheduled three times, and each time they were accommodating.  We finally decided to travel March 2022.

Approaching the hotel from the tube (which is a quick 3 minute walk), the terra cotta exterior was a welcome sight.  It was a relief that the pictures really do the hotel justice...inside and out.  We were charmed by the aesthetics of the interior design.

Every interaction with the staff was great too.  I did have a concern that the general manager Garreth Walsh assisted with and I was very pleased by the outcome.  Also, Andrea at the front desk and Patricia the manager were very helpful too.

And definitely dine in at Galvin Bar and Grill!  It was a delicious fine dining experience, and thoroughly enjoyed each course with the drinks.  Say hello to Alex the manager and ask for Leo to be your server.

I highly recommend staying!",5,2022,04,02
124,Family Birthday,"Fantastic stay. Marco, the concierge from Kimpton Fitzroy was so helpful. He booked us private dinner rooms for our party at  Michelin restaurants. We had excellent service and delicious food at both places. Marco handled everything, which was exactly what I needed to create the perfect itinerary for our large group. Highly recommend staying at this hotel and having Marco help you plan your itinerary.",5,2022,03,27
124,Rated 5 star_Service and product not reflective of that rating,"Staff not welcoming bar a few exceptions at the grill restaurant.
Housekeeping forgot to replenish towels or refill minibar
Nice lounge off from the lobby always occupied by special events so always closed to in house guests 
“Coffee shop” Limited menu and again, staff seem to be doing you a favour when taking orders.",3,2022,03,22
124,Such a dissapointing stay this time.,"If there is an event on refuse a room overlooking the courtyard, There was a wedding on and the noise from the music was so loud you could feel the vibration through the bed,  The music went on until midnight which one doesnt mind for such a happy occassion , took the headace pills and thought will sleep well now, Oh no. there was the cleaning up after the wedding vaccums buzzing away.  Hardly slept all night and it put plans out for what we  thought we would do on the sunday as just too tired to do anything.  Can fault the staff but the management need to do something about the noise - will ask if there is an event planned before I book again",2,2022,03,20
124,"Great hotel, wonderful staff","Wonderful stay. I keep coming back to the Kimpton Fitzroy on business travel and never regret it. This is not only the best hotel in the area, but their staff is truly exceptional. This time it was Marina from reservations and Fabiola at reception who dealt with both check in and check out of multiple bookings with great efficiency and friendliness. I’ll be back!",5,2022,03,18
124,Great atmosphere in a unique building,"I booked a double urban room for four days, which looked quite OK in the pictures and description from the web page. Once there I realized it was far too small for me and my wife. Despite being quite crowded, reception staff worked hard to offer us a larger room of same category. Then, when going to sleep, we simply couldn't due to the noise from a party at the hotel's ballroom. Once again, hotel staff found a solution for us making available a room on the 7th floor. So great staff with truly customer-oriented behaviour",4,2022,03,15
124,High standards in all areas,"Impressive building from the outside
Atmospheric and sophisticated inside
Staff were all efficient professional and friendly 
Room was small but that is expected in London
Food was lovely - good choice and fresh
We have stayed at 3 Kimpton Hotels and highly recommend",5,2022,03,13
124,Perfect stay and an even more perfect wedding day!,"We booked the Kimpton as our wedding reception venue, due to Covid we were not able to view the venue in advance given the lockdown so we were very reliant on the virtual tour on the website to view the spaces. Luckily the actual building and rooms are even more incredible in person. 
Our wedding event planner Andrea made the entire experience wonderful, every little detail was discussed with us and planned immaculately. Andrea was always on hand to answer our questions during both the lead up to the event and on the day.
We booked hotel rooms for ourselves and our families - safe to say they were some of the most outstanding rooms we have ever stayed in. The little touches made the stay even more special, from welcome messages to the complimentary mini bar. The rooms were spotless and modern but they also felt very grand and in-keeping with the buildings history. 
We ate in Gavin Bar and Grill during a pre-wedding meeting and enjoyed breakfasts in both Galvin and Burr and Co  during our stay- all meals were delicious with lots of choice.  We were extremely happy with our wedding breakfast which was served in the Keynes room - the level of service was outstanding and all guests thoroughly enjoyed their food.
The entire stay felt very personable, every member of staff knew we were getting married and went the extra mile to help us out and get us excited for the day. We had a large amount of luggage and wedding decor and the doormen were incredibly helpful running back and forth to the van with us to help us load and unload. By the end of our stay, the doormen felt like friends as they would go out of their way to have a quick conversation with us and see how we were getting on. 
From beginning to end our experience was 5* and we couldn't recommend the Kimpton more - both as a wedding venue and a hotel. Thank you to everyone who gave us the wedding of a lifetime!",5,2022,03,13
124,Beautiful decor - shame about the customer experience,"Fantastic stay - enjoyed the junior suite - bathroom exceptional - pure luxury. Big room with 2 TV’s and a separate seating area. The staff were all really friendly and the whole decor and ambience of the place is exceptional. 

Only reason I’ve not given this hotel 5* and potentially maybe even deserves a 3* rating on this occasion is for the following, which for me a hotel should deliver a good nights sleep which it wasn’t able to do for the following reasons.

Unfortunately I was on floor 2 and they had scaffolding erected around the hotel front which they were dismantling on the morning after the night of my stay. A consequence of this is, that at 7.30am we were woken by builders taking down scaffolding on Friday morning 11 March. The drilling used to take the scaffold down was really quite loud - and they were also dropping the scaffolding down from quite high heights. I get it. The hotel/building needs regular maintenance but if your guest is paying £500 for one night in a suite at least inform them of this before or warn them (maybe I’d ask to go on a different floor) for me this is unforgivable - the acoustics of the room weren’t the best (again as it’s. A Victorian building I can understand this) but not being warned of this on arrival is unforgivable. I logged this gripe at checkout but the lady didn’t seem very interested, I’d suggest again for one night stays for the price I’d expect a focus on the customers rest to be paramount.",3,2022,03,12
124,Nice stay,"Rooms not very big (comfort)
Clean nice comfy bed coffee machine etc
Very nice design of the hall lobby restaurants. Hotel has its charm. I liked the towels which are very high quality. Breakfast partly served and partly self service. Not a very high selection but tasteful",4,2022,03,10
124,Great hotel ,My family and I came here for my sister and my birthday  as we have stayed here a number of times and love it the staff are friendly and helpful I can't fault it. we love burr and co staff are amazing friendly  helpful   this is one of my favourite hotels in London ,5,2022,03,09
124,NOT Suitable for Business Travel,"This hotel is terrible for business travel - although they assured me that I’d have a room with a desk, they put me in a shoebox of a “double” with a table too tiny to accommodate a laptop and the Nespresso machine. Also, they don’t clean the rooms automatically - it has to be specifically requested, as I learned when I got back to my room at 8:45 PM and found that it had not been touched. Maybe this place is tolerable for a one-night stay, but for a week of business travel, I would not recommend it - having to squeeze in sideways to enter my room and also having to go to the front desk every morning to request that my room be cleaned is just too much of a hassle for a “luxury” hotel. The lobby is gorgeous but just doesn’t make up for the rooms.",2,2022,03,08
124,Highest levels of customer service!,"The Kimpton Fitzroy London team represents among the highest levels of customer service I have experienced. Information was accurate, responses to queries were turned around very fast. Answers were clear and where necessary detailed enough for us to make informed decisions quickly. Karina Bertolino da Silva, thank you so much for making my boss' travel life much easier! We appreciate you!",5,2022,03,03
124,Perfect stay for us!,"Booked two rooms to celebrate our daughters 25th birthday.  Had such a great time, both rooms were immaculate, one standard and one suite (which was an upgrade on check-in). Bathroom was so beautiful with an amazing free standing bath, totally fulfilled my expectations.  The staff were impeccable, we went down for the free drinks one evening but didn’t bother the other two as the wine was a little grim to be honest.  We did however spend a great couple of hours drinking cocktails in the bar (quite an expensive couple of hours), again this was was super!  We would all definitely stay here again when visiting London and it could be our new favourite (previously our favourites have been The Landmark and The Hilton Bankside)",5,2022,02,27
124,Misleading deceptive room images,"Following the review of many hotels I decided to book this hotel as the photo of the superior two double bed room had space with a sofa, table and chairs hence had enough space and furniture to ensure comfortable for a stay for 2 adults and one child.
As one of my party had walking difficulties a comfortable room with adaquate seating was important and this was my main reason for choosing this room in this hotel. 
The room that we were given had two small double beds no sofa and was much smaller than the image of the room displayed on their website and booking.com.
Had I viewed the image of the actual room we were given there is no way I would have booked.
It is also worth noting that our room had a considerable walk to access with stairs on route with no handrail, with an elderly disabled parent it was far from ideal and I have never stayed in a hotel where amenities have not been easily accessible.
Overall I feel deceived by this hotel, they clearly display images of a very attravice room to encourage bookings, then put you in a room bearing no resemblance on arrival. I find this is very misleading, deceptive and extremely bad unprofessional practice. 
You clearly will not always get what you think you are paying for here ......not good enough!",2,2022,02,27
124,Fabulous hotel in a great location and absolutely superb staff,"We stayed here as a surprise for my wife's 50th birthday and I don't think I could have picked a better place.

The hotel itself looks incredible, both inside and out and the location was ideal being just 10 minutes walk to Euston.

We ate in two of the restaurants, the service was first class and the food was amazing - we had the tartare for starters and it's by far the best we ever had.

Last but not least, the staff were fantastic - everyone was so pleasant and professional, and made sure we had everything we needed.

Close by is the underground and it all contributed to an amazing experience, and we will return as soon as possible.",5,2022,02,26
124,Elegant dinner and comfortable atmosphere in kimpton restaurant.,"Elegant and modern atmosphere, not demanding. Tasty british style dishes, explained and expertly raccommended by Francesco. We spent a very plesant evening thanks to an excellent and friendly service.",5,2022,02,25
124,very enjoyable,"stayed last week for three nights we had a very enjoyable stay loved the hotel , liked the fizt  bar and the burr coffee bar we would like to come back and have afternoon tea in palm court sadly didnt have time on this trip , tube station round the corner was also a bonus ,all the staff we spoke to were really friendly the guy on the front door (who i cannot remember his name sadly) was always there to greet us a credit to the hotel , looking forward to that afternoon tea !",5,2022,02,22
124,Impeccable. Hospitality redefined.,"What an experience... My partner and I stayed in the hotel for New Year's Eve and we were delighted with what we felt and saw. So much so, that I decided to spend my birthday at the hotel one month later. I will focus on the latter.

María checked us in.  Friendly, welcoming and professional!  We got an upgrade to a corner suite and had a bottle of prosecco sent to the room. There was an SMS following up on our arrival experience. 

Room was big, comfortable, well decorated and spotless. That bathtub... Wow!
The Spanish hostess at the bar (she was usually at Galvin in December), do not recall the name (sorry!) remembered us from our December visit and, again, provided a superb, warm, hospitable and professional service. Her colleague at Galvin (from Barcelona) and her other two co-workers were on the same page when it comes to service.

Isabel, Guest Experience, clearly runs a tight ship.  Felicitaciones. Impeccable service from all the Kimpton Fitzroy London members we came across during our stay.
 
If you are in London and are going for a 'staycation', this is the place. If you come to London and think of a IHG hotel: this is the one! Kimpton has conquered our hearts...Paris St. Honoré see you in April.",5,2022,02,21
124,Great hotel ,"Lovely hotel. Beautiful room and facilities. The staff were very attentive and nothing was too much trouble. The Galvin restaurant, the Fitz bar are fantastic and the Palm court is a beautiful place to relax. All in all a great hotel and we had a fantastic valentine stay. Would definitely return.",5,2022,02,17
124,Glamorous cocktails for middle aged ladies,"Popped in with a friend after an afternoon event - pair of frankly not glam middle aged ladies. Fitz bar was a bit crowded but was given option of ""going through to the other side"".  Lovely bar, much quieter, very lux - had a wander round the ground floor on the way out and absolutely loved the way the place has been restored/redecorated.  (Have memories of it at book fairs back in its old dingy doldrum days.) Anyway, back to the bar lounge.  Very comfortable. Excellent service. Best Negroni I've had for ages - served with its own mini iceberg so looked incredibly generous.  Every so often some charming young person would swoop past to check we weren't running short of nibbles or anything. Very relaxing and cosseted.  We'll be back!",5,2022,02,16
124,"Third visit, a special place for me and my partner","Stayed valentines night 2022. Was our 3rd visit to the hotel in the last couple of years (last stayed January & February 2020 and haven't had the chance to visit since due to COVID). Stayed in room 411 which was lovely - small room but large bathroom which makes up for the smaller room. Water, milk & snacks a lovely touch - along with the Magimix Nespresso machine. Staff friendly and attentive. Had pre-booked Fitz's bar in the evening for the cocktails & live singer. Was a really great evening & cocktails tasted great. This place is definitely a special place for us. 

Only reason I have knocked down one star is that the hotel made a mistake regarding the pre-auth deposit. I paid for the stay with my debit card and my partner paid for the £100 pre-auth deposit. We had around £59 in room charges & upon check out confirmed it would be my partners card that the £41 would need be released back onto his card. The hotel mistakenly refunded the £41 back onto my card and then also refunded £41 back onto my partners card. Neither of us have received the money yet as of course it takes a few days, however a couple of hours after leaving the hotel they attempted to take £41 from my account a total of 9 times without my permission. I had no idea what was going on until I returned their call. Thankfully I didn't have the money in my account as I put my money into separate accounts, otherwise I would be £41 down whilst waiting for the refunded monies to reach my account. 

I have no issue with the mistake taking place, I have previously worked in an IHG hotel and understand that mistakes happen, however I just wish it was dealt with a little better. Now I have to spend the next few days waiting for a refund so I can pay the hotel back for money I never wished to be taken from my account.

Other than this, everything was great and we still wish to visit the hotel again and look forward to any future stays :)",4,2022,02,16
124,Not quite on the mark,"Bit of a tricky review as some parts of the stay were excellent others not so good.

THE GOOD

Staff brilliant across the board.
Hotel is beautiful & in good location.
Bars / restaurants all nicely dine with great service
Milk & water in fridge nice touch

THE NOT SO GOOD
Room was tiny
Bathroom so small you had to sit on the loo at an angle
Shower leaked under shower door & soaked bathroom
2 teabags & 2 coffee pods only in the room!

It’s an expensive hotel & at these prices I’d expect a bit more around the room facilities etc.",3,2022,02,14
124,Terrific stay in London,Cannot say enough about the Kimpton Fitzroy's staff and excellent rooms.  I arrived on my birthday and they were kind enough to send a complimentary dessert and bottle of champagne.  Such attention to detail will have me stay there again!  A new favorite in London!,5,2022,02,13
124,Excellent visit again,"Excellent stay again , got a fantastic room, it had a bathroom  bigger than some rooms I stayed in . The staff are very friendly and helpful. One of the best hotels I have stayed in for service.  Will be back at Easter.",5,2022,02,05
124,Galvin Bar and Grill,"Has some gift cards for a special birthday and decided to use them at the Galvin Bar and Grill within this beautiful hotel.
The dining room is beautiful in itself.
Service was lovely and the food delicious.
Perfectly cooked Dover sole.
Look forward to returning at a future date.",5,2022,02,04
124,Excellent Customer Service,"This is now our favourite hotel in London. 

The staff provide a 5 star service, nothing is too much trouble.

The stars of the last stay were Lena, on Reception and Joseph from the Conceirge Service, both were excellent.

A special mention for Mick, from Maintenance, who spotted my husband struggling to walk from the back of the hotel, with his disability, and arranged for a side door to be opened for him. Mick even carried his bag for him.",5,2022,01,26
124,"Beautiful hotel, great staff","I have stayed in this hotel over my birthday weekend in January. Building architecture is stunning. Interior design is on point. Multiple places to hangout like Fitz bar, Palm Court, all beautifully designed. All staff was very polite, helpful and friendly. 
Room we have stayed in was again very nice and well equipped. I normally don't eat breakfasts at hotels I stay in as I tend to go to some smaller local cafes but the hotel breakfast was really well priced (not overpriced like in a lot of places) so I decided to give it a go. Was not disappointed. My husband had full english and I had smoked salmon and scrambled eggs on sourdough. It was very good.  I have stayed in many hotels in London and this one is definitely one of my favourite ones especially as it's good value for money,",5,2022,01,21
124,The best hotel hotel in London 🇬🇧,"The Kimpton  Fitzroy  is GORGEOUS! We stayed in a modern suite at the top of the hotel which gave us an amazing view of the park. This room had so much to enjoy: A huge bathtub; a spacious standing shower with glass doors; really appreciated the amenities, including Nespresso coffee, and a daily delivery of organic chocolate and popcorn. Such small details make a big impression. As beautiful as the setting was, it was the staff that really made it a worthwhile place to stay-especially ESTEFANIA the guest relations manager, who went far and above the normal service that you would expect from a hotel of such stature. Next time we are in the area, we will absolutely stay at The Kimpton Fitzroy Hotel and I recommend it to anyone visiting London. 🌸",5,2022,01,18
124,Just amazing!,We visited for my partner’s 40th birthday. This is an exceptional hotel. The junior suite was beautiful with the best bathroom. Staff were friendly and helpful. Stunning building. Delicious breakfast. Easily the nicest hotel I’ve stayed in. Thank you so so much for giving us such a wonderful and relaxing experience. We will definitely be back and would recommend to anyone.,5,2022,01,16
124,Our New London Go To,"After 2+ years of staying away from London, my wife and I decided it was time to eat and drink our way around the capital for 3 days. This was our first visit to The Fitzroy. Dont be misled by the Kimpton branding.  The building is stunning. The staff are all very pleasant and welcoming. Our superior room was well appointed if somewhat small. The bed was very comfortable and the bedding was of a high standard. The wet room shower was powerful and versatile. There was coffee facilities and a fridge in the room. The hotel is very solid and well sound proofed. 

There is a stunning cocktail bar (prices are on the high side) and fantastic cafe Burr and Co (very reasonable prices). The breakfast is well worth consideration. We ate there 2 out of our 3 days. 

We will definitely be returning.",5,2022,01,16
124,Fantastic,Absolutely fantastic hotel beautiful grade 2 listed building wonderfully restored the food and the service was fantastic all very clean and tidy would highly recommend to anyone had a great stay. Will be staying again in the future,5,2022,01,10
124,Great stay,Lovely stay here - bed was very comfy. Great room and decor. Shame about no swimming pool. Breakfast was nice and good service . Good selection of foods and drinks. The bar is also nice but closes quite early… overall would definitely come back and recommend.,5,2022,01,07
124,To be recommended,"Spent a week in this lovely hotel whilst attending a wedding. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff and the concierge service is to be congratulated on their keen attention.
So good was it only one minor thing could be improved. The main restaurant served frozen style chips with an otherwise tremendous meal from the a la carte menu. The meal was not cheap, but the chips were. We forgive you, some wouldn't.",5,2022,01,05
124,Beautiful Old English Hotel,"I just LOVED this hotel.  I liked that it wasn't busy:), the room was awesome, the bar areas wonderful.  so many different atmospheres!  

Even had a social hour which was nice.

It was very christmasy, so really nice to see it decorated during the holiday season.

Walkable from Euston station which was great trying to avoid public transport when possible with COVID.",5,2022,01,04
124,Christmas in style!,"An absolutely stunning building, we booked a suite for Christmas, and what a suite! One of the most stunning rooms I have ever stayed in. 

Fitz's Bar is also fantastic, a creative Christmas cocktail menu also covering all the classics.

A special shout out to Alex the duty manager, he was very charming and helpful throughout our stay, and to Lina on reception for being our saviour with our special surprise!

Brilliant stay, some great Christmas touches, for example a violinist in the lobby playing Christmas classics was especially enjoyable. we will be back!",5,2022,01,03
124,Lovely hotel - Horrific breakfast,"My husband and I stayed here for our 1 year wedding anniversary and we had a really lovely stay until breakfast the next day. The staff were fabulous and the hotel was stunning. When we arrived down to breakfast the next day I got so excited when I seen pancakes on the menu. So I ordered a portion of pancakes with bacon and maple syrup. As the Kipton Fitzroy is a 5 star hotel I was expecting that my taste buds where in for a treat. However what arrived was a different story! My pancakes were burnt and so over cooked you could crack them in half. How a 5star kitchen would let them leave and a wait staff would serve them, I just don’t know. This really spoilt the trip as we had expected higher standards which is why we choose to stay in a 5 star hotel!",3,2021,12,20
124,Amazing !!,"Gobsmacked at just how amazing and beautiful this hotel is. Myself My Mum and My Sister had a one night stay for my Sisters 30th birthday and we were treated like royalty. Felt so lucky to be there. Breakfast was included and it did not disappoint, lots and lots to choose from and staff could not of been any friendlier. Cannot wait until we are back here !! Didn’t want to come home 

Thank you Fitzroy ! X",5,2021,12,18
124,Excellent hotel ,"A lovely hotel with excellent facilities and staff who were always pleasant and attentive. 
The decor of the hotel is stunning with a great gym that I used every day of the 3 night stay.
Location is opposite the lovely Russell square with a location perfect for exploring London.

124,Outstanding stay,"Great stay! Super comfortable bed and all as expected from 5* hotel. Very accommodating staff and great facilities. Clean and pleasant room, on a smaller size, but very well laid out. Will stay again! Recommend to visit the FITZ Cocktail bar within the hotel. ",5,2021,12,14
124,weekend visit,"quick weekend trip 2 adults 1 child check in was super smooth room was very good very spacious room it was just a standard room. didnt have the breakfast so cant comment ,concierge staff very helpful i cant remember his name. most welcome was free drink in the bar between 5 and 6 only negatives being whilst waiting for the free drink was completely ignored by bar staff and had to wait some time till i stopped a member of staff in their tracks and asked ,tea and coffee in room only thing i didnt like was the milk for such was in a big carton in the fridge a bit silly really when most hotels provide the little sachet for tea and coffee but overall a good stay and would stay again",4,2021,12,13
124,Best fireside seats in London,"TOP TIP - If you want the nicest cup of tea experience in London ask the bar staff  if you can sit by the big Art Deco fire in reception. There are four super comfy velvet chairs where you can sip tea and chat  to guests passing through reception. The loveliest hour of our weekend. Thank you.

(And the tea was only £3.50 per person, bargain for such a post place!)",4,2021,12,12
124,Kimpton Fitzroy Midweek Couples Trip London,"The Kimpton Fitzroy is in a lovely and impressive building with some stunning original features where you are happy to spend time.

The location for central London is good it’s next door to the Russell Square tube and opposite Russell Square itself. Getting in and out of Covent Garden, Leicester Square etc is easy, 

The check in staff were very welcoming and efficient both at check in and check out.

The rooms are averagely decorated and appointed, the bed is comfortable, I’d say overall fine for a short stay. Check out is at 12 which is unusual nowadays and helps not to feel rushed in the mornings.

The reason we’ve scored 3 stars is that the coffee shop and bar (Fitz bar) were a real let down. The service was really short of what you would expect in a 5 star hotel, to be given 5 stars you theoretically competing with some of the best hotels in the world and the experience was way behind what we have experienced elsewhere.

We arrived at the hotel early so went for a coffee. The service was beyond slow, we repeatedly had the wrong food and drinks brought to our table by the same waitress. The coffee wasn’t particularly nice and the food was fairly average. There were quite a lot of staff working so it didn’t feel it was caused by staffing issues.

Likewise with the bar, the interior looks great. We’d booked a table there as part of a birthday celebration trip to London and were looking forward to it as one of the highlights of our trip. The organisation was really bad. Whenever we needed to order a drink we had to find a waiter or waitress to place an order. We ordered some bar food when we first arrived which arrived quite a while before our first drinks, later on again we had to ask for the table to cleared as we were left for some time with empty plates on our table. A bit later in the evening (9.30) we weren’t able to order any more bar food as were told the kitchen had been closed and were unable to then eat. The first 3 wines that we tried to order also weren’t in stock, these were fairly standard wines on the menu. Again there were quite a few staff members working and the bar wasn’t full so can only presume that this was due to lack of training etc. It did end up feeling a bit like a comedy of errors and felt a bit of let down.",3,2021,12,08
124,A beautiful hotel in the fabulous location,"I feel I have to review this hotel as some of the reviews I've read on here are truly bizarre. 

This was our first visit and we stayed here over first weekend of December and really enjoyed our stay. I've stayed in many hotels in London that fall in a similar and higher price range and the Kimpton Fitzroy has without doubt become one of my favourites. It has Russell Sq tube station just two minutes around the corner, which is one stop from Kings Cross and two stops from Covent Garden, it's a short walk across the square to The British Museum and then another 15 minute walk into Covent Garden and Theatre Land. 

We stayed in a superior double on the second floor and the room was more then large enough, spacious sleeping area with a comfortable bed and nice linens. The  good sized bathroom had both bath and shower.

The staff here are lovely and nothing seemed too much trouble, we enjoyed breakfast in Galvins on both mornings, which was good, not the best I've ever had, but by far not the worst, we had to wait less then 5 minutes on the Sunday morning as it was busy, but this was 10am the busy time, there was coffee, tea, orange juice and croissants for you to enjoy while you waited. Note to the rude people that were moaning, get out of bed if you want it pronto!!.

Fitz's Bar is a fabulous place to start your evening off and return to after an evening out. Great staff and great drinks. Burr & Co is also a lovely place with a buzzing atmosphere, attentive staff and lovely food and drinks. There was a wedding on, on the Saturday night during our stay but apart from making it busy, didn't impede on our stay or make the bar any busier then normal.

I think some people moan for the sake of it and need to get a grip, this is a fabulous hotel that I will return to sometime in the new year.",5,2021,12,06
124,Another weekend away,"Very busy hotel, check in ok, no upgrade, small room, lift system not ideal for covid . 
Breakfast in galvins was hard work, first where is it. Secondly music very loud and more like a disco , average service, food cold, check out was very busy but worked generally although a lovely building it’s just ok",3,2021,12,05
124,"Beautiful hotel, would return","Upon arrival we were greeted by a charming young lady who was polite, courteous and welcoming. All interaction with reception staff was superb. 

Our bar experience: initially we were served by we assume the bar manager/supervisor. He was, in our opinion dismissive of us until he realised we were hotel guests and then his attitude appeared to improve slightly. He was rude to the other staff and  brusque in his manner. The remaining bar staff were an absolute joy. Two young men were friendly and offered advise about which spirits to try. They were engaging and very pleasant to chat with. The bar atmosphere was just right, in ambience and decor. 

We had breakfast in the Galvin Bar & Grill, a little on the pricey side for what it was but didn’t spoil our stay. All the staff we encountered here were polite, friendly and welcoming. 

Our room. A standard double (with king size) was well appointed and comfortable if not a little small in size. Overall though it more than met our needs for the night and would not prevent us returning. 

Lovely hotel. Situated on Russell Square that provides excellent access to all that London has to offer. Avoid the barman and you’ll have an enjoyable comfortable stay.",5,2021,12,05
124,Not a London long weekend experience I would recommend.,"Beautiful hotel with really nice spacious and very clean rooms. Fairytale ended here.

Food below average. Very limited breakfast, room service food of a quality very average pub. Food greasy, tasteless and really simple.

Breakfast advertised as served until 11, cleaned at 10:30. Not what I’ve expected from this hotel, massive disappointment.",2,2021,12,04
124,One of my favorite hotels in the world,"The old-timers still call it ""the Russell,"" no doubt because it's located on Russell Square. Now it's the Kimpton Fitzroy and no less grand, a landmark Victorian building that has upgraded with style, from the high quality linens to the red telephones. The bar, The Fitz, is like a movie set and whoever the decorator is who conceived of it should have won multiple awards. We met London locals there as well as tourists, so evidently the natives have also discovered this little oasis. The real shining light, though, were the staff, who were an international mix, very knowledgeable and kind. They really went out of their way, and this in a time when the hospitality industry is in a crisis with labor shortages. 

Staying here I discovered that Bloomsbury is the most convenient location in the city for touring--within walking distance of Euston Station, the British Museum, Covent Garden, the City, the West End. I will definitely return here whenever I'm in London.",5,2021,11,30
124,Excellent Venue and Very Good Front Of House Staff,"The Kimpton Fitzroy is my hotel of preference in London and one that I recommend to people whom I help to plan London visits. The building has character, is excellently positioned, well maintained and luxurious. The staff is excellent and the inhouse service first class.

Disappointingly this time, and this is the reason for me awarding 4 stars and not 5, was the fact that the General Manager and Director of Operations both failed to respond to emails sent twice to them jointly to ask them to merge 3 consecutive nights bookings into 1  seamless one, This would ensure that I wouldn't need to change room in between. This was not done and at check in reception staff thought I was only staying for one night. The helpful receptionist could see the situation and made sure that I was able to run it as a 3 night stay. As a guest of Platinum Priority Club status I expected the management to respond given that I approached them several weeks in advance and again a few weeks before arriving.  A further disappointment was the changes that have taken place at the hotel since my first visit. The website clearly states that junior suites and higher benefit from a fully stocked complimentary mini bar.  Whilst I had no interest in the alcohol element I do appreciate a supply of soft  drinks. Only bottled water and a packet of popcorn was provided. When I queried this with reception I was simply told ""we no longer do that.""  The hotel website clearly states differantly.  Two other issues were that the receptionist I approached to delay my departure by 30 minutes became perilously close to being unhelpful and declining to acquiesce,  and also the Priority Club points for the first night (nights 2 & 3 were not eligible as they were award nights) have not been credited, with the stay showing as ""not eligible.""

The positives of the hotel and my experience there were many.  Customer facing staff were smart, professional and a credit to the brand.  Check in was swift and welcoming and created an excellent first impression.  All public areas were immaculate and bordering on regal. There are ample lifts to all floors and good Covid safety measures in place.

I booked a junior suite and was upgraded to a full suite due to my PC status. The suite was impressive, with a nice entrance into the wooden floored sitting room, an adequate and very comfortable bedroom and a large and tastefully presented bathroom with a marble shower room and a roll bath. Towels and robes were high quality and the toiletries were high class. The climate control worked to perfection and all areas had high quality bespoke furnishings and ornaments. The cleaning staff were discreet and very focussed.

The Burr & Co cafe was charismatic and very popular and the lounge bar was perfection.  Breakfast was taken in the main restaurant and the hot and cold buffets were extremely high quality.  All staff were welcoming and accommodating and special recognition must go to Tolhar who was incredibly attentive and helpful, even on the mornings when he wasn't my designated server.  Breakfast was a massive highlight of my stay and priced very reasonably.

Mention must also go to Dorine at reception, who went out of her way when I asked to view a standard room so that I could gain a personal impression  to help me guide clients. Dorine was warm and friendly and willing to work outside the box.

The hotel is a 15 minute walk from Euston mainline station and a 1 minute walk from Russell Square underground station. Russell Square is opposite the main entrance. Between 17:00 and 18:00 a musician plays in the lobby and there is a social hour for guests at that time, when wine, beer or soft drinks are served. On my last evening, the Christmas trees were put up, which served to make the ambiance of the entire premises completely magical.

This was a delightful visit. Were the management to knock on the head the glitches I highlighted at the beginning of my review,  the hotel would again be truly 5* and the envy of many of its peers.",4,2021,11,30
124,Modern luxury - Stunning interior and great service,"Absolutely a pleasurable stay - Great service from all members of staff and amazing breakfast from the restaurant. I am really impressed by the interior in the Palm Court which is really elegant and contemporary. I can tell the team of designers have paid a lot of attention to details for this re-furbishment project. 

Excellent room - it is clean and is equipped with a smart TV! Although the room is quite small, it is expected in London. 

The hotel is so close to Russel Square tube station and the British Museum (both 5-6 minute walk from the hotel).  It is very convenient. I also walked to the hotel from King's Cross train station which spent me 15-20 minutes. I recommend this route as the Russel Square tube station has 175 flight of stairs to climb to and from the platform, if the lift is not available. 

I will definitely come back to this hotel.",5,2021,11,30
124,Poor breakfast,"The hotel is beautiful with a stunning cocktail bar. The bedrooms are pretty small with a dangerously high step into the bathroom. The downside was the breakfast, service was incredibly slow, which we could have tolerated had the food been satisfactory. The coffee was tepid and the food was inedible-very disappointing",3,2021,11,29
124,Outstanding,"Just back from a weekend at this hidden gem of a hotel. We were fortunate to receive an upgrade to a one bed suite due to our IHG membership ( thank you)  and it was simply superb. Couldn’t fault a thing, one of the best hotels and rooms we have stayed at in London. A little out of the centre but right next door to the tube station and although our room faced the main road we barely heard any traffic noise. Loved the fireplace by the stairs in reception. Staff excellent, modern lifts that were fast and efficient -  I could go on. Unquestionably we will be back next time we stay in London.",5,2021,11,28
124,It ticks all the boxes! The Best IHG option in London!,"I can stay in this hotel forever!
This is a returned visit - post covid and I can say the hotel did not drop any of its high standards, at all!

It's cozy and refurbished!
Its luxurious!
Super friendly and helpful employees!
Amazing kitchen!
Magnificent building!
Spotlessly clean!
Perfectly located in central London, convenient with the public transport.
Excellent room and bathroom amenities!
Smart TVs!

Only a SPA is missing from this property or at least a sauna, but can't complain.. not many hotels in Central London offer this facility. On the downside, the Internet connection was quite slow.. As concerns the menu, I would suggest having Quorn items available for a vegetarian option of the English Breakfast so it doesn't get boring when staying for a long period and hosting more often live music at the Fitz! Also for the upcoming years, please consider putting the Christmas decorations earlier, as London Christmas lights are on, in early November!

Being an Elite IHG Member and having experienced many of the IHG properties in the city, I would suggest the KF as the best option for your London stay.",5,2021,11,27
124,Lovely hotel in a perfect location for our needs,"My colleagues and I stayed over WTM London 2021 and had a fantastic experience during our time at the Kimpton.

We had in past years stayed in the Aldwych area during this time, but wanted a change as my colleagues travel from the Middle East so it is nice for them to explore a different area during their time.

I was fortunate enough to have my booking arranged by the very customer service focused M&E coordinator Karina, who dealth with our needs efficiently pre, during and post stay dates.

Nothing was a problem and Karina was always available for any last minute changes or assistance.

The hotel itself has been lovingly restored to its full glory and the staff at every encounter were smiling and friendly.

The beds are super comfortable and the room has everything you could need, if you have forgotten anything the reception team will happily supply the necessary.

The hotel is perfectly situated in the proximity of Covent Garden, Aldwych and Oxford Street. Regents Park is a mile away, which is a great location for a morning morning run and if you're lucky,  you'll see zoo animals at London Zoo as you run through.

Overall a lovely hotel whether on business or leisure.

Thank Karina for ensuring my colleagues were well looked after and had a lovely experience of London.",5,2021,11,17
124,"Beautiful hotel, staff are lovely but........","We spent 2 nights as a family in the hotel in October 2021 attending a wedding. The hotel itself is in a brilliant central location, within easy distance of key tourist attractions and travel hubs. 

The hotel interior is stunning and the staff are brilliant. 

However, for £250 per night, the rooms are shoebox size. We booked for a family of three but my son had no bed. My husband had to take an emergency trip to the nearest Argos store to buy him a blow-up airbed. Not the experience you expect from such a hotel.",4,2021,11,15
124,"Beautiful hotel, great service, great food, great cocktails","This is the very best hotel I have stayed in whilst in London. The hotel itself is a beautiful building. The refurbishment work on it makes it a truly stunning place to be. The rooms are gorgeous and make for an incredibly comfortable stay. Isabel, the front desk manager, is one of the nicest people you can meet and she does everything to make your stay a special one. The location is also excellent with Russell Square outside and Oxford Street etc. only a short walk. The hotel also boasts a really good gym.",5,2021,11,15
124,Beautiful hotel with incredible hospitality,Hugely impressed with the level of service here - we stayed here in celebration of my mum's 60th birthday and the hotel went above and beyond to make her feel special and celebrate the milestone. The Fitz's was an exceptional bar as well - highly recommend for an evening cocktail!,5,2021,11,11
124,"Beautiful hotel with great staff, though rooms small unless you go for a suite","Check in was smooth and pleasant.  The lovely Alec even comped us breakfast either due to my smile or my Ambassador Spire Elite status.  I had booked a a superior double. Although stylish and beautifully appointed, these rooms are quite small for two, with not many surfaces for your stuff and no drawers for clothes.  However, due to a problem with our room the hotel moved our room and upgraded us to a corner suite.  Big thanks to Alec on front desk for sorting this out.  When I saw the room...Wow!  The difference was huge, literally.  The suite had a small dressing area leading into a large room with four poster bed.  The bathroom had both bath and shower, his and hers marble basins and a separate loo with door.
Last time I stayed the Galvin restaurant was closed for a refurb so breakfast was served in the more informal Burr & Co brasserie.  This time everything was open and breakfast was excellent.  Sunday was a bit chaotic due to the sheer numbers but the food was still good so long as you could afford the wait.  
The Palm Court has potential to be a nice space for afternoon tea, but the combination of occasionally jarring music and just okay service (tea served as a tea bag in a cup) meant it was just a comfortable place to read the papers (though coffee was excellent) but no more. 
Staff were all lovely and seemed especially proud of the Fitzroy's history.  Kudos to Abi (not sure of spelling) on concierge desk for showing me around the gym and pointing out a few features along the way.  Check out the brass dragon Lucky George on the second floor (his 'brother' was on the Titanic) and the beautiful mosaic flooring in reception.",5,2021,11,11
124,Lovely hotel with amazingly lovely staff,"Spent my 50th Birthday in London and had a great time. The hotel is well appointed, the rooms large for London and very comfortable. They staff couldn't be nicer or more helpful. Just exactly what you want in a hotel.

The Fitz Bar is also nice too if slightly eclectic in its music choices.",5,2021,11,08
124,Not as impressive as it looks,"Maybe I had set my expectations to high but I was not that impressed by the hotel. The design and architecture is great and the check-in process was really nice and smooth and the staff was very nice. However the room layout eg  with a small bathroom - water everywhere when having a shower was not thought through. Maybe bigger rooms are better…

The room was cleaned on the first night but not on the second. And I still wonder why hotels for sustainability reasons asks guest only to place towels which needs to be changed on the floor…and then still changes everything. That’s not very sustainable.

Another sustainable factor. You can leave the power on when leaving the room, the air on can be turned on event though a window is open. 

In the Burr&Co bar the breakfast staff seems rather inexperienced and running around for no reason at all. Even an Açai bowl took ages and had to ask twice for it. They where extremely slow in taking orders from other guests as well and some guest left for that reason. They where not understaffed. Service and price levels are not a match. 

The location of the hotel is however really nice and peaceful. Easy to go everywhere in the city from there.",3,2021,11,07
124,The best hotel stay we have ever experienced,"We decided to travel to London for our mini honeymoon as we did not want the hassle of travelling overseas. 

When approaching the hotel, you can see the craftsmanship and care that went into creating such a beautiful building. The lobby area is equally impressive with high ceilings and intricate tile work.

Upon arrival at reception we were greeted with congralutions on our marriage and upgraded to a one bedroom suite facing Russel Square Gardens.  The room was  beautifully decorated, the bed was very conformable and the shower was incredible. The Hotel Team later sent a complimentary bottle of champagne which was a lovely touch. The reception was quick to send a member of staff when we were having issues with the heating but this was quickly rectified.

Housekeeping were a delight and always asking if we would like anything additional.
Breakfast was provided as part of our room fare and we tried the bacon rolls, avocado on toast, egg benedict and the porridge. Each of these were tasty and always served in a timely manner.

We only visited the Fitz bar once but the service was snappy and the Moscow Mule I would definitely recommend.

Upon checkout the receptionist kept our bags for 6 hours before our train which was a great help.

I spent 20 minutes before reading this thinking of negatives to balance my review but our stay was truly flawless. 5/5.

Thank you to the Fitzroy team!",5,2021,11,06
124,"If you pay for a bigger room, check they give it to you!","Paid for a superior room (25m), given an urban room (19m).  When I challenged I was told that because the room had a nice view they deemed it superior.  They did eventually move me to a room in the category that I booked.  Felt very unfairly treated and had never been downgraded in an IHG hotel before.  Refused to offer me a discount for the time spent in a small room, they actually tried to charge me twice for the first night and it took 30 mins on check out to sort that out.  Lovely hotel, terrible customer service.",1,2021,11,04
124,Fantastic hotel,"We arrived at 11 am and left the luggage  and went out, we came back at 16 30 pm and was told our room was not ready ,they had serious problems  getting  the rooms cleaned.  I could not fault the receptionist for how they looked after us. They offered us another smaller room temporarily 
Until our room was ready . We said it was OK and we would wait ,so they took us to the bar and said the drinks were on us. I have read the reviews  on trip advisor  and can not understand  what the problem  is , everywhere is having staffing problems and we all have to learn to live with it.
When we got our room it was fantastic  and the service and staff are exceptional.  Will be back after Christmas. ",5,2021,11,04
124,"Avoid at all costs, unhygienic","After looking forward to visiting this hotel, myself and my partner are disgusted.  There was dry blood on the bathroom floor, the tv did not work we had to call 10 times to reception for them to answer the phone (where three staff were working) to resolve the matter an try to fix it after two visits they couldn't. 

We were moved to another room at 7.30pm at night after a long day of travelling. Which stank of cigerettes as non smokers we were then told its the fragrance of the room. But without a diffuser in sight? It seems a very bizarre scent if this should be the case who wants their belongings to smell of smoke?! 

When notifying the hotel on all our complaints we were basically called liars despite having picture evidence. The list went on, we went for drinks and sat for 25 minutes without being asked if we would like a drink to which we ended up walking out. The beds were uncomfortable so we hardly slept. And left at the first convenience avoiding breakfast altogether given the state of the rooms.

The laughable part is how they have the audacity to charge £329 for the most horrendous stay. The customer service is non existent and the conditions of both rooms we were placed in were not worth half the amount we were charged they were unhygienic. And run down. We would not return even if paid too. 

Avoid at all costs and please save your money!",1,2021,11,01
124,Great hotel with some operational issues,"Stayed 3 nights and was really good, apart from a few issues. 
Firstly, our room wasn’t available till 5:00pm which is definitely not 5star performance. However, Anna at reception was fantastic and dealt with this very professionally despite being very busy.
Our upgraded room was lovely, and well maintained, but for some reason our room keys stopped working every morning at 8:30…
The breakfast was also quite chaotic, while the food was good it came in batches and tea/coffee was cold, we are still waiting on our re-fills…..
Visually the hotel is stunning, the location great and reception staff really helpful. We will return, and hopefully problems with room availability and breakfast service have been fixed, as this doesn’t happen in other 5-star hotels",4,2021,10,27
124,Celebrating a birthday,"I’ve not written many hotel reviews, but Kimpton Fitzroy has utterly ‘wowed’ me with their service. 

We stayed here for one night to celebrate my partners birthday and they truly went out of their way to make this a special occasion for us. As we checked in, the lovely lady on reception wished him a happy birthday, before then telling us we’d had a complimentary room upgrade to a suite! 

Not only was the room absolutely gorgeous, when we arrived their was a little chocolate cake, bottle of Prosecco and handwritten note wishing us a happy birthday waiting for us! 

We arrived just before ‘social hour’ where we were told to head on to the bar where hotel guests receive complimentary drinks for that hour. 

Every member of staff we spoke to was lovely, polite and helpful. Another lady at reception helped us with restaurant recommendations and the bar staff at Fitz even recommended cocktails based on our drink preferences.

From start to finish it was a wonderful stay and we’ve definitely found ‘our hotel’ in London which we’ll come back to again and again.",5,2021,10,27
124,Overall a disappointment,"We stayed on Sunday night for a 1 night stay as a treat for my partners birthday. When we arrived there was a wedding on. We were told that the small restaurant burr & co was open but the main steak restaurant wasn’t due to the wedding. That restaurant was the reason we had booked so that was a disappointment. We looked at the burr and co menu which had a few bar type options such as a burger or a salad. Not really what we were after.
 
We headed to the room. It was freezing and we had to get into the bed while the room heated up! It was an internal room so no views, which was fine but we couldn’t even open the window. So the only form of air circulation was from the air com/heating system. Which seemed to do very cold and full on or boiling hot. 
We got a text from the reception that said if we needed anything at all just text. We ordered some cocktails. She replied 30 minuties later. By that time we had decided to go out to find some food so had to cancel them. 
When we got back to the hotel we were told that the steak restaurant had been infact open that eve, but the bar was now closed due to the wedding going on. We went to bed with the noise of the wedding going on- a fun sound to have to try and go to sleep to- luckily my partner sleeps through anything and I had ear plugs as they were very much needed. 
Next morning we got room service as we didn’t really want to go down to the breakfast room as the service had been all over the place. I explained to the receptionist the problems we had during the stay and although very polite the team overall just seemed clueless. The only positive we found was the building itself was beautiful and the man pressing the lift button for us was a nice guy :) 
I wouldn’t recommend and doubtful we would stay again, especially for the price. Last thing- we stayed at other places during the weekend and eat out at some lovely places- when I booked everything I popped in the notes we were visiting for my partners birthday. Everywhere we went they had read the notes and wished him a happy birthday, or when we ordered dessert they wrote it on the plate… this was the only place that doesn’t bother to read the notes. Not a normal 5 star experience at all.",2,2021,10,26
124,Spoiled by noise from weddings,Nice hotel. Staff excellent and both room and breakfast good. However room very noisy for all 3 nights of stay due to loud music from weddings below. Might have been better with a room on a higher level. Noise continuous from early evening until just after midnight.,2,2021,10,25
124,Can’t say anything positive,"We traveled to London for my mother’s birthday. Choose this hotel based on its stellar reviews. Bad, bad choice. There was a wedding both nights of our stay which meant the beautiful Palm Court restaurant was closed. The weddings both nights went on until the 1:00 am and cause a serious disturbance to our sleep. Try adjusting to an 8 hour time change while a DJ absolutely blasts your room for hours on end. The hotel was unable to find a room to relocate us to which I find hard to believe. On top of that our bathroom had a leak for 24 hours which soaked our belongings and made the tile floor slippery and wet. The hotel staff couldn’t have cared less that our room had a steady drip. Despite efforts from the manager to remedy our displeasure, it was unfortunately too little too late. Very disappointed at the price we paid to stay here and get zero sleep. 

Burr & Co was nice and played great music. Fritz was nice as well and has lovely ambiance. Room service staff was excellent as well. That’s about all I can say that was enjoyable about our stay.",2,2021,10,23
124,Don't waste your money here. ,"Don't waste your hard earned money staying in this overpriced B&B. 

Today my family and I returned from London after staying in this hotel. Being a Platinum Elite IHG member I booked a room here to stay overnight as part of a surprise trip for my 4 year old daughter to see Frozen, The Musical  and what a mistake I made choosing this hotel. 

As part of the IHG loyalty scheme, there is normally some recognition of one's status but arriving through the doors, a member of staff took my bags off me, carried them three stamps and dumped them on the ground . Then I find out my reservation had been changed from one room with two double beds to two double rooms.  Unless they expected my 4 year old daughter to be in a room all by herself I have no idea what they  were playing at. 

Got to our room and the massive Samsung TV on the wall looked great and that's about it. The thing itself didn't work so that was a chocolate teapot. The toilet didn't flush unless you pumped the button a good few times which was quite annoying. Tried to call reception or whatever quirky name they gave themselves but nobody answered. The shower was leaky and blocked with limescale so water flow was erratic. ( Holiday Inns are better cared for than this) . At this point I was seriously considering called the Intercontinental on Park Lane to switch hotels I was that peeved, they had a room and were considerably cheaper but my wife persuaded me to relax and stay where we were as things could get better.  

After we returned back to the hotel after the West end show, we decided on having breakfast served in our room the next morning . We filled out the menu card and hung it on our bedroom door. Next morning, breakfast arrives, coffee is cold, the American pancakes we ordered for my daughter with a berry compote were doused in syrup and a bowl of 'compote' to accompany it . Toast was missing and it was a bit rubbish. I call reception and explain the situation. I then get sent up another teapot full of Luke warm ( at best) coffee and a rack of bread that's had a brief encounter with the side of a toaster. 

We then pack up, go down to check out and it's all very apologetic, no engagement from the manager who heard all I had to say and was stood at reception.  No invoice printed out and no assistance with bags from anyone even though their gentlemen concierge could see my wife carrying a big bag trying to deal with a 4 year old child who was hungry after breakfast was inedible . 

Do yourself a favour and use your money to check into a proper hotel. Nearly £500 a night here, I think not, it's daylight robbery me thinks. IHG will also be notified. ",1,2021,10,23
124,Good stay but dining improvements required!,"As a fan of the Kimpton brand I was really looking forward to my stay at the Kimpton Fitzroy. Overall, it was a good stay, but not the highest standard I have come to expect from Kimpton.

Check in was smooth and efficient. The front office staff are exceptional. Professional and friendly and certainly give a very good first impression of the hotel.

On the day of my stay the hotel was fully booked, with a wedding taking place. The lobby was quite busy during check in but was managed well.

The hotel itself has very grand interiors, from classic marble to modern mirrors and interesting decor. As a setting, it is impressive.

My room on the fourth floor was spacious and clean. The double bed was comfortable and made for a good night’s sleep. The bathroom was a little tight with the toilet in the corner but the shower was very spacious. It was a little difficult trying to keep the shower mat in position and close the door but otherwise it was well equipped with complimentary Master Vetivert, Notes by Azzi amenities. Great to see reusable containers rather than single use mini plastic ones.

Along with a yoga mat there were also complimentary tea and coffee making facilities in the room. It was a nice touch to see a tea pot along with decent sized mugs.

My room also had floor to ceiling windows looking out on Guilford Street - a nice leafy view over the trees.

In the evening we had drinks at Fitz’s. A nice venue but it was extremely busy. Although the menu has a limited list of non alcoholic drinks I was offered the option of a mocktail off the menu. Although delicious, what was a tiny glass with a little bit of juice in it, was charged at £13 which was the same price as the alcoholic cocktails. I expect to pay a premium in a hotel bar but I did feel this was a little unreasonably steep.

Breakfast the following morning was the biggest let down at the hotel. It was absolutely chaotic. After we sat down and got given menus, we waited for about 15 minutes and when no one came to take our order we had to get someone’s attention.  Once we did order, there just seemed to be such lack of organisation in how service was executed. Our juices arrived but no the hot drinks (tea). Fruit and muesli then arrived; still no tea. At this point we could see plates accumulating under the heat lamp from the kitchen waiting to be distributed, some of which were sat there for well over 5 minutes. Tea finally arrived followed by the hot dishes but no toast. One of the orders, English breakfast, came with the sausage and bacon not as well cooked as requested so we asked if this could be rectified. The member of staff we spoke to misunderstood and thought we were complaining that they were overcooked. The same dish returned with added bacon and sausage (now even less cooked) which were taken from the buffet. Note that no one mentioned the buffet to us, we were just handed an a la carte menu. We clarified with the staff one more time so the dish went back, only for the same eggs and beans to return and to be told they’ll bring the sausages and bacon as soon as they were ready. By that point the eggs and beans were cold. We informed the staff that we no longer wished to have the dish. Five minutes later, a small plate of bacon and sausages arrived! One portion of toast had arrived but the gluten free toast we asked for had not arrived. Other tables were ordering items after us and getting them before us although by what we were hearing there were others complaining about both the speed of service and quality of the food. All this happened when we were asked to make advanced reservations for breakfast in order to manage numbers. 

We had to ask multiple times for tea to be refilled. The tea itself is brewed in large flasks and although hot, it was extremely stewed by the time it was served.

I understand that Covid has put a strain on the hospitality industry and I want to be as lenient and patient as possible. That said, breakfast wasn’t free and therefore I still expect a basic level of service which on this occasion did not happen.

Front office staff were very quick to respond to our feedback and were very empathetic, not just nodding for the sake of it. The front office manager was very good at service recovery.

Breakfast aside, it was an enjoyable stay and I would give it another chance once things pick up again as we recover from the pandemic!",4,2021,10,20
124,Fantastic refurb!,"Excellent 3 night stay at the refurbished Fitzroy. Beautiful renovation, sumptuous public and private spaces. Splendid breakfast in Galvan brasserie and tasty dinner in the bar. Staff all very pleasant, at times a little less attentive than usual for 5* but no complaints. Fantastic location for central London meetings. Recommended and will certainly be back.",5,2021,10,19
124,Excellent  Customer Service  by Shola,"We stayed here for the first time and we weren't disappointed.

We normally stay at another hotel, which hasn't reopened since COVID.

The room was larger that expected and very pleasantly decorated.

My husband had problems walking into the hotel, due to his disability and he was assisted by Shola, who was absolutely amazing, without him I am unsure how he would have made it.

We had Room Service, the food was wonderful and the service prompt.

We look forward to returning.",5,2021,10,12
124,Very Nice Hotel,"2 night stay here.

Very friendly and efficient reception staff.

The hotel is immaculate as you would come to expect.

We were in Room 344 which was equally clean and comfortable. 

Lovely, comfortable bed and all the facilities you could reasonably expect.

Breakfast was lovely..

On a personal note, the shower arrangement whilst aesthetically pleasing is a disappointment. Fiddly doesn’t quite cover it and flow rate of the main head is weak. There is no detachable element to it either.

Just an observation.",5,2021,10,09
124,"Nice hotel, very expensive, average experience","Lovely old school hotel, very friendly staff and a good location for Theatre land and Soho, it’s an easy 15 min walk if you like walking. However this is a very expensive hotel with the basic rooms around £300 and it’s a small room, I have stayed in Holiday Inn Expresses with bigger rooms. Also as an IHG Spire Elite member it was disappointing to be told no upgraded rooms were available, despite availability of such rooms on line. So a very nice hotel but I’m not sure why it’s so expensive and my personal experience was average, better value hotels in London within the IHG network, wouldn’t stay there again.",3,2021,10,06
124,Fantastic Hotel and Staff,"We stayed one night here as my daughter was running the London marathon.  We had booked in at the Crowne Plaza City but as this had decided not to open yet thye transferred us to the Kimpton.  We were a little unsure about what to expect but have to say we did REALLY well out of the change.  We had guaranteed a variety of special requests at the other hotel as we are regular guests there and the Kimpton were happy to honour them all.  The hotel is just beautiful both inside and out. Very comfortable rooms and a great cafe for quick drinks and a place to meet friends. The breakfast was amazing and well worth the package upgrade that reception told us about.  The rooms felt very luxurious and were so quiet.  The shower was huge and great water pressure.  We parked around the corner from the hotel and got a great rate from the hotel.  However, the best part of this hotel is its staff.  Every single person was so friendly, professional and accommodating.  The reception staff were just amazing and never said ""NO"".  We had various needs due to one person being heavily pregnant and the marathon runner taking a bit longer then anticipated (but still smashed it) and they just moved things around to accommodate us all.  They were absolutely fantastic.  The staff in the cafe were again flexible with requests and went out of their way to assist us in any way they could.  I would recommend this hotel to anyone who is looking for an idea yet quiet location, luxurious surroundings and incredible staff. Although this hotel is kore expensive then the one we normally stay at , I will be staying here again for sure.",5,2021,10,06
124,Affordable Luxury,"We checked in early before our room was ready, our bags were taken to a safe place and we were texted when our room was available, in the meantime we were able to use the business facilities. Despite reviews moaning about lack of doorman or any one to carry bags, our bags were delivered to our room and suitbags laid out neatly on the bed. The room was a decent size with all the amenities expected of a luxury hotel. Bathroom and shower a good size and the toiletries of great quality, Bed and bedding spotless. We made full use of Burr and Co and the Fitz Bar. Customer service was super. Icing on the cake was dinner at the newly opened Galvin Bar and Grill where we were lucky enough to chat to the owner/chef. I fully expect a michelin star to be on its way! I have booked again!",5,2021,10,05
124,Really Enjoyed a Very Nice and Stylish Hotel,"From the grand entrance to the super reception staff - a nice place to visit in a great and convenient location.

We wanted to have dinner there, but it was fully booked, so it looks like a 4 month return visit and book a dinner table at the same time.

Fitzs bar was great, as were the staff.

If I could have a moan, the shower was not that impressive, big head, but not enough water (have a better one's at home). 

So will I go back - yes and booking the restaurant next time as well.",5,2021,10,04
124,"Great hotel, cabt wait to visit again","Wonderful hotel.  Great staff.  Beautiful interior and lovely rooms.  Was served by a great chap, Adam, and also Scott, who made us welcome in the bar.  

Reception staff very friendly and welcoming.  Nothing was too much bother.   Would thoroughly recommend and cabt wait to visit again.",5,2021,10,02
124,Stunning property,"Stunning property with fantastic staff. Greeted warmly upon arrival by polite and welcoming porters who showed us to reception. Professional and friendly reception staff made check in a breeze. Reservation at Fitz's was again a winning experience with incredible cocktails in a relaxed and ambient setting, the giant disco ball being the cherry on the top of a fabulous hotel experience. 100% recommend and will be back. Thanks all for a wonderful stay.  ",5,2021,10,02
124,A perfect Wedding!,"Our daughter’s wedding was held here last Saturday after being postponed for a year. 
The team were supportive and helpful throughout that whole time.
Our wedding planner, Jennifer Irwin, and her team (especially Christina) made our whole weekend very special. 
With numerous guests staying, dinner the night before (thank you Adam for your great service) and guests departing at different times, all went to plan with the help of the Kimpton staff who couldn’t do enough for us all. 
The day itself was wonderful.  Jen had thought of everything, right down to delivering chairs to our daughters room for make up & hair for the bride & bridesmaids.  
The ballroom is impressive and, once bedecked with Rob Van Heldons beautiful flowers it was breathtaking. 
From the first glass of champagne to the late night canapés the catering was faultless.  The wedding breakfast for 135 guests was simply fantastic.  
Thank you Kimpton for a day none of us will ever forget.",5,2021,09,30
124,Stunning hotel at a great location,Stunning hotel with character to its architecture but modern rooms which offer you all you need. Everything in this hotel is gorgeous. The bars and restaurants look amazing and the staff were really helpful and considerate ( They allowed us to check out late at no extra charge). Breakfast was great as they offered al la carte and smaller continental options. Very central and right near the tube! Would definitely stay again.,4,2021,09,30
124,Visited the new team at the Galvin Bar and Grill,"This new venture took us out of Mayfair into the world of Bloomsbury.

Excellent greeting by the charming ladies on reception at the Galvin Bar and Grill.  Credit to them and to the gentleman who was cleaning the menu holder outside and directed us to reception.

We then entered the restaurant.  Well appointed, clean and tidy.  We were welcomed by Alex, who displayed his usual high standards of service and charm.  We were treated to champagne on arrival.  

The marmite sourdough to nibble on was a delight.  The 'yeasty' balance was just right.  We both selected the cod, which was an excellent piece of fish, nicely presented and delicious.

WIne list was very good, and service attentive.

Now, they are finding their feet against a background of pandemic recover, fuel shortages and broken supply chains.  There is considerable effort to deliver quality, service and attention to detail.  That all takes time.  We have followed many of these good people throughout their careers and we are confident they will deliver the high standards you associate with them.

A delicious meal, in a grand hotel.  We retired to the bar, which is excellent.  Great bar staff, good service and a great atmosphere.  

We look forward to visiting again soon and wish them all well.",5,2021,09,29
124,Stylish comfort but noisy,"Hotel is very stylish in an central london amazing location. Easy to get good food nearby. Room incredibly comfortable with beautiful bathroom. Loved all the design elements. 

But a noisy stay - people loudly arguing in next door room on night one, then loud bass thumping from hotel event night 2 (a monday). finished by 11.30pm but not great for a relaxing evening. 

Probably a better experience if you are in town to party, not a good fit for business travel. ",3,2021,09,27
124,"Luxury, peaceful, hard to say goodbye","We stayed for one night for my birthday and had a one bedroom suite (room 358). The lobby was so grand, it really is beautiful, but the entire hotel is stunning.

We arrived several hours early and our room was available when we arrived, so we were able to enjoy the stay for that little bit longer. Check in was effortless and the staff were so friendly and warm. I was even wished a happy birthday without mentioning anything to them. 

Our room was perfect. The decor was traditional but modern and felt so so cosy. The room was silent, an ideal temperature and so comfortable. This was our last day in London and once we were checked in we didn't leave the hotel until we checked out. There was plenty of room to relax and the sitting room was a really lovely space to spend the time. 

The bathroom was stunning, you could tell that all the fixtures were of a high quality. We both said it was one of the best showers we'd had. I had to make the most of the bath as well and it was so deep, I could have stayed there for hours.

We were able to contact the staff through text messaging, they responded within minutes and couldn't have been more helpful.

It was the little things that made this extra special. Staff came to our room to bring a beautiful dessert and a not for my birthday. And at about 5.30pm someone came to the room again and asked if we needed any extra water, etc.

Each area had a separate control panel for the lighting, here you could choose between different settings to change the lighting from bright to really cosy and dim. I really loved this touch.

The bed was so so comfortable. It was huge and the bedding felt so crisp and fresh, I slept the whole night through, something that never happens. Breakfast was lovely, it came really quickly and was really hot and tasty. 

The only downside was that we weren't staying longer, so we will 100% be back to the Kimpton Fitzroy. 

Thanks so much for making my birthday really special.",5,2021,09,14
124,Friendly staff and clean,"Brilliant staff lovely welcome when we arrived informed us of all the facilities and asked us if we needed any more information about anything.
Rooms very clean but small so would choose a bigger room next time.
Bar area lovely and relaxing once again super friendly staff.
Breakfast slightly disappointing staff once again polite but breakfast order came in different times and had to keep asking for things they had forgot . We asked 3 times for our cup of tea. Just things like that . But overall I would recommend this hotel",5,2021,09,13
124,Our new favourite London hotel,"My wife chose this hotel for my birthday weekend and it’s now our new favourite. Everything about our stay here has been special. 
Upon arrival we were greeted by the fantastic reception staff who made check in a breeze. Absolutely no queue whatsoever, straight to the desk and got our key within minutes. Just be aware that you have to hand over £200 as soon as you check in to protect against “incidentals” This isn’t such a problem if you have a credit card as nothing is actually taken but if you only have a debit card, expect to see £200 leave your account. I am told this is paid back a few days later.
The room was on the 7th floor and although the view was just roof tops (because it’s central London) it still felt romantic. The room itself was on the smaller side but with a large bathroom. It’s all beautifully appointed and the bed was super comfy. Shower a little on the weak side but I assume that’s because we were so high up. Not a problem though. Weird how we only got one bath towel and had to ask for more.
The bar is really pretty and a lovely evening atmosphere. Can get a little busy and service is rather on the slow side but all the staff are so friendly that you really don’t mind.
We only ate breakfast here so can’t comment on other meals. The selection is basic and you order to the table rather than a buffet. Food is good quality.
Despite being a luxury hotel, the atmosphere is relaxed. We really enjoyed our stay here and will 100% be coming back. We’ve decided this will be our regular go-to hotel from now on. 
Thanks Kimpton Fitzroy for making my birthday weekend really special!!",5,2021,09,12
124,Mr,Not a 5 star hotel.  Room not cleaned for two days with a four day stay.  Breakfast wait at Burr was 15 minutes to get a menu and then cold “hot” breakfast served. No doorman or bell staff to help with luggage. Ugh,1,2021,09,12
124,Five * Hotel but not 5* Service,"We had wanted to stay here for a long time & we were not disappointed when we walked in to the magnificent marble entrance. The hotel itself is absolutely stunning! The Fitz bar was fab & the staff very accommodating. The service outside of this was not 5*, no doorperson & no one to help with luggage once inside. The check in was a little disappointing along with the rooms. Once inside, the magnificence of the hotel disappears & you are left in a very basic room (although the bathroom was nice) which could be any low-cost hotel in London. For the cost per night, we would have expected a little more. Breakfast was in Burrs cafe which was another disappointment. You are no longer in the beautiful hotel, but a cafe that is not in keeping with the 5* price. The service was slow & the hot breakfast was cold. This may be a stunning hotel visually, but the service is sadly lacking. A hotel is only as good as it’s staff once you are through the doors & although they were all pleasant, the 5* training is just not there.",4,2021,09,09
124,"Great experience, beware the £100 additional charge!","Wonderful clean rooms, delicious food and stunning surroundings. We were annoyed when we checked in and were charged our room rate plus £100 for ‘incidentals’ (to be refunded on checkout). Breakfast was delicious but rather meagre portions. Chairs in the restaurant very uncomfortable.",4,2021,09,02
124,Good hotel but not 5 star standard,"If you are looking for a grand london hotel with nice rooms, friendly staff and good food then I would rate this hotel a 5 providing they sort their shambolic breakfast service.
If you were expecting a 5 star standard hotel, thenI would rate the hotel a 2 with missing service standards, facilities and lower levels of guest service that one would expect.
We stayed on the Sunday night of the BH Weekend on a Voyage Privee deal of dinner bed and breakfast.
The room was fine, not large with a small bathroom but was nicely furnished with all the right bits and bobs
We had a very pleasant dinner  served (as we were expecting) in the Burrs coffee shop where the service was friendly and relaxed and all the cooking was to a good standard, my other half rated the baked cheesecake as the best she has ever tasted, and she is an expert!
At breakfast we were greeted by a charming restaurant  manager, (the first and only management presence we saw during our stay) , however the breakfast service was just painful. The staff  again were friendly and did their best but the system they were working to was flawed and they needed more support as as with us we saw several tables being delivered the wrong dishes or had to wait ages for beverages. The cooking again was to a sound standard nicely presented.
At checkout, the Restaurant Manager asked how our breakfast was and after advising him of our disappointment and giving an example of a problem, he introduced himself and advised that it was his first day!
I am sure that Alex will address the issues and hope that when his main restaurant re-opens standards will be restored.
Hopefully the great team we met will have the support to make the most of this lovely building and achieve the 5 star standards it deserves.",3,2021,08,31
124,Unauthorised charges and poor service,"Beautiful hotel but poor service, a wedding was in place when we arrived, chaos at reception. Room not ready on arrival, hotel took our bags and then took an hour to find them.

Hotel takes £100 pre-authorised on arrival, however they took 3 x £100 and still have refunded.

Worth noting I'm an aspire member of the ihg group so I would expect great service, unfortunately that wasn't the case.

Beware of unauthorised amounts taken from you card, I won't be letting this go!",1,2021,08,30
124,Surprise Birthday present,My husband treated me to this weekend away and it was fantastic. The staff were really welcoming and nothing was too much trouble. Particular mention must be made of Mamoon who provided 1st class service and always with a smile. He is a real credit to the hotel. Ashley & I hope to go back.,5,2021,08,28
124,A beautiful hotel with excellent service,"My wife and I stayed at the Kimpton Fitzroy for six nights while we visited the UK. The service was excellent and friendly throughout. The hotel itself was magnificent and excellently maintained and clean. When we requested items from the front desk, we received them promptly. The breakfast at the hotel was of a very high standard as I enjoyed the Full English and Scotch Pancakes on a few occasions. The only issue we had was that our room was a bit too small for our needs, but the front desk moved us to a slightly larger room (in the same class) without any hassle. Overall I was very pleased by our stay.",5,2021,08,27
124,Disappointed,We stayed at this hotel for a couple of days wich we booked through a deal still expensive but it had some add ons  wich I thought would make it worth while ie evening meal included and breakfast and meet and greet drinks on the house for an hour with other guests we arrived and were very excited as it was everything we had thought it would be Checked  in and the staff at reception were very friendly took us to the meet and greet bit of a let down really we are not  big drinkers I had a larger shandy my partner dosent drink they had no blackcurrant juice I was very surprised anyway no get together with staff or guests just sitting on our own the room was supposed to be a better room than standard it was nice but not a wow factor wich I thought it would be we ate in there restaurant the food again was OK for me nothing special portion sizes small and disappointing only three option for starters wich I didn't like so had the cheese board when it was brought to me it was tiny I no it was a starter but I don't have a mouses stomach very disappointed  with the whole meal my partner is a vegatrian so her options are limited hence she didn't eat anything and I left the restaurant hungry we had already decided that we wouldn't eat our evening meal the following night there or go for the 1 hour drink the following night but what happened the following evening was terrible we had a very busy day in London and my partner who is younger than me (we've been together for 4 years)  my knees were playing up so we went straight up to our room to change  and shower before going out for our evening meal  and for a rest for me firstly we couldn't get into our room we had spent the best part of an hour in the morning dealing with reception re new key cards so to my dismay to find we couldn't get into our room I didn't want to go down two long corridors and a lift so I sent my partner down to deal with it she was gone for quite a while when she came back she said the lady at reception had taken another £100 off my card to cover any thing we had in the restaurant bar I checked my bank account and to my dismay they had taken from my account £413.16p  I could not belive it I had already paid the whole price for my deal so I had to go to reception to sort it out I hobbled down with my poor knees to sort it out after having firstly a heated decussion about having no arthority to take any. Money from my account with front of house manager the lady who took the money  from my account was no were to be seen  after telling my partner she was taking 100 pounds for a deposit but nearly £420 was taken I spoke to a  very apologetic lady but who could still only give me £100  back to my account that night but as it was the weekend it would hopefully. Be in on the Monday they would then. Put the rest of the money back in my account I was so disappointed and upset I neded a ciggarett so went and sat on there steps and left my partner to deal with it while sitting on the steps a well dressed man passed me went into the hotel restaurant then a few moments later approached me saying ooo this is a very expensive hotel are you staying here I just nodded he then declares to me that he has girls models for fun up the road if I fancy it if course I said no but thinking about it I just wonder if it was someone from the hotel as stated early Im in my early fifties but am with someone far younger and I just wonder did they think I was just some gruby old man so tried to set me up and if not if they read this maybe they should have there footman outside so if they were to hear or see a guest approached like  that they could help and step in whatever the whole experience of the kimpton was marred by people just thinking they no better I only received £313 16p  of my funds today hence writing my review hotel is beautiful but some of the hotel  staff  upto there jobs and could do with some retraining,3,2021,08,24
124,Nod to the Titanic,"Excellent Hotel fabulous service lovely rooms if you want to stay in a hotel with old world charm and opulence with even a nod to the Titanic this is the place for you absolutely brilliant well recommended
Only word of caution there is no parking at this hotel be wary of this we were caught out by it but besides that everything else is very good",5,2021,08,21
124,Fabulous hotel with wonderful staff,"Stunning hotel, made even better by the wonderful staff and their amazing attention to detail. 

This was our first trip after lockdown and it was a mix of business and pleasure. We loved the room, the linens, the guest drinks at 6, the gym and the glorious architecture and interior design. The bar and restaurant truly are something else. 

Most of all however, we loved the staff. They were attentive but unobtrusive, kind, approachable and genuinely caring. The Natural History Museum was all booked up during our stay, much to our dinosaur obsessed son’s disappointment. So Liaria, Audre & Isa send him box of cookies & left several toy dinos all around our room. That’s seriously 5 star service.

Thank you! We will be back.",5,2021,08,19
124,Lovely hotel,"Our only regret with staying here was that we didn’t have that much time to enjoy the hotel on our short trip to London! The whole hotel is lovely and beautifully furnished throughout. Our room felt spacious, and we loved the chocolate cake that was left for us in our room for when we arrived late in the evening. The only small niggle was that the toilet roll holder in the bathroom was mounted at an odd position, such that you couldn’t sit straight on the loo as it was in the way of your leg. Other than that, we had a wonderful stay and will surely return in the future.",5,2021,08,18
124,A mixed bag experience,"The hotel is pristine with new decor throughout and exceptionally clean. It’s in a good central location 5 mins walk from Euston station.
The reception team are friendly and helpful.
We enjoyed both the social complimentary drinks between 5 and 6 pm and our breakfast was great wit good service and plenty of choices.
We prepaid for a 3 course dinner package and it was nothing short of awful. We pre booked a table weeks in advance to be to be told on arrival that there was both a wedding being hosted in the restaurant plus issues over table bookings. We were seated in a corner next to another couple and students on their laptops. The rest of the room was full of wedding party guests. It was noisy and we could barely hear ourselves when talking. Full priority was given by the restaurant team to the wedding party with little attention to other diners. We waited a long time to get our food which was of mixed quality when it finally arrived. We should have never been seated in such an environment for what was hoped to be a quiet dinner for two. Our evening meal was ruined. I gave feedback to one of the restaurant managers who apologised and agreed that it was not an ok experience and left our feedback at reception. The next day I mentioned our feedback with the polite lady on reception. I asked for a call with a manager on my return home. To date no one has contacted me. Do be careful if you book dinner in this hotel as at present the other restaurant is closed so Burr and Co is the only option. Our experience at night if Burr and Co was chaos at best. We wish we had gone BB and eaten out. The next day we went to the Ivy Soho paying very similar to Burr and Co and it was exceptional all round. A lesson for future trips to London. We were not the only people to complain- the couple next to us summed it up well- if we had wanted a quick sandwich in a bustly environment we would have gone to a coffee shop! Not a 5 star experience.
Please do contact me to discuss further as requested on check out.",3,2021,08,16
124,Fantastic Kimpton!,"We loved our junior suite over looking the park. Beautiful decor - mix of commentary and traditional just right for the building. Reception staff were very welcoming. We really enjoyed our breakfast and the social hour, especially the breakfast staff were very attentive. I will defiantly be staying at the hotel again, normally stay at the intercontinental O2 but this hotel is worth the higher price.",5,2021,08,13
124,a huge dissappointment,"Me and my bf had stayed few days in the hotel because of his 40th birthday&trip back to Canada....he is an IHG member&therefore we have chosen this hotel&as well perfect location!
We had stayed few weeks before in Kimpton Manchester which was amazing btw and staff at the reception exceptional!
Wish I could say the same about our London trip:(
Welcome at the reception was basic and very dry maybe because everyone was too focused on a bride who was having photos taken in a gorgeous hall....anyway biggest dissappointment was when nothing had been mentioned on arrival about a special occasion?Therefore a day after check in I went alone to the reception and asked politely if they have could do anything cuz of 40th birthday occasion???card?small cake?a note wishing lovely stay?really didnt expect champagne or a suite....
NOTHING HAD BEEN DONE....even though i was assured by the receptionist it will....
I work myself in an Accor group and really never ever had an experience like that in this kind of hotels standard.....very shocked and quite sad as was 100% sure something wld be done

124,Utterly amazing in everyway,"Just back from a 2 night stay at this beautiful hotel. From arrival the exterior of this hotel is very grand, upon entering the hotel this continued.
A warm welcome begins in reception and continued throughout our stay.  The staff are all so very accommodating, friendly and helpful.
Breakfast, dinner and drinks in the wonderful Fitz bar was great.
We will be back with friends again in a couple of weeks for a further weekend stay.  What can I say we live in East London with lots of choice of hotels but this really has been one of the better ones!
Keep doing what you're doing and soon you'll be overbooked
Thank you so much",5,2021,08,09
124,Glitz and Glamour,"With friends we decided to have a posh weekend in London to include the theatre, dinning out, afternoon tea and various sightseeing while staying two nights at the Kimpton Fitzroy London which was in a great location for our plans.  On arrival the building itself is awesome, the architect is amazing and entering the hotel's grandeur was so special, the decor was tastefully designed with attention to detail.  The staff was very welcoming and attentive throughout the hotel, cleanliness was top priority everywhere in the hotel as spotlessly clean.  Our room was divine, big and comfortable nicely furnished as you would expect.  Drinking in the Fitz's cocktail bar was a glamorous setting which was very enjoyable.  We all thoroughly loved our time spent at the hotel and would definitely stay again.",5,2021,08,09
124,Excellent first class,"We booked through Voyage Privé for a one night stay but wish we had stayed longer !!! We checked in at 11.30 expecting just to leave our bags but in fact our room was ready which was great .
Gorgeous hotel and lovely rooms all the staff from reception to restaurant and bar staff were very polite friendly and attentive, we only had one small problem in the our breakfast order was messed up 3 times but they dealt with it as quick as possible and on check out apologised for the mix up and took 50% off our drinks bill , one thing I forgot to mention is they have complimentary drinks between 5-6pm which is a nice touch .
We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and will definitely be back , well done to all at the Kimpton Fitzroy for a great stay.

Kind Regards

124,Perfect in every single way,"I am not usually one for reviews but I couldn't NOT write a review for this hotel. I booked this hotel as part of a surprise birthday trip for my partner and we were both absolutely blown away by the impressive architecture, the service, the room, the amenities and just the overall experience so much so we are already looking at when we can return. We just couldn't fault anything at all even if we wanted to, the Kimpton Fitzroy made an already special trip completely perfect.",5,2021,07,21
124,Fantastic in every way!,"My wife and I arrived for a 5 night stay on our honeymoon and were thoroughly impressed from the moment we walked through the door. The building is stunning, both outside and in. It manages to create a relaxed feel with contemporary touches while always keeping one eye on its own, obviously glamorous history. We travelled from Belfast and were surprised to find a design connection to our own city by way of Titanic (keep an eye out for ‘Lucky George’). 

Really, the strength of the Kimpton Fitzroy lies not in its location (which was perfect for us), or the great room, cleanliness and attention to detail that we saw throughout our stay, or even in the fab menu and cocktails, but in its staff. Luis Cesar Rodrigues as concierge couldn’t have been more helpful. Fabiola Gonzalez was superb on our arrival, Lena Maria at breakfast and Conor and George who both gave us invaluable help and tips during our stay really meant that we experienced the 5 star treatment that so many other hotels claim but lack. 

Absolutely recommended to anyone looking for a personal touch in a fantastic location. For us on honeymoon, we can honestly say that we came away with an experience and memory that we can take with us for ever. We are already looking forward to returning on our anniversary

124,Thoroughly disappointed,"I usually use the IC O2 when I stay in London (20+ nights a year in normal times) but it is currently closed. So I thought I'd give the Kimpton Fitzroy a try.

Stayed on Friday night and was very disappointed.

Booked a superior room and as a Spire should have received an upgrade at checkin. I asked the receptionist whether an upgrade had been applied and was told there were no rooms of a higher category available. Accepted this at face value and went to my allocated room, which can only be described as a shoe box - smaller than even the smallest rooms at IC PL.

Checked the IHG app and there were plenty of higher category rooms available to book. Contacted reception to complain and they found me a (slightly) larger room in the same category that I had booked. I showed them the app, challenged them as to why couldn't have an upgrade when other room categories were available to book online - they couldn't offer me an explanation other than 'we have some celebrations tonight'.

The two main restaurants (Palm Court and The Dining Room) were also closed during my visit meaning the dining options in the hotel were very limited.

All in all I didn't feel valued, the staff did not go the extra mile, and I won't be rushing back.",2,2021,07,12
124,"An impressive hotel, perfect for a special occasion","We stayed one night at this gorgeous hotel. The building has an impressive exterior and interior architecture. The hotel is immaculately presented and felt really clean, which is particularly important to me at the moment.   

It was my husbands 40th and they left a lovely little cake and message in our room. Our room was a very spacious room, divided in to three different areas (I think we’d been upgraded).  The view wasn’t spectacular, although we could just see the top of the shard. There was no noise at all from outside.  The bathroom was spacious too with a lovely large walk in shower. I am usually so good at finding fault with bathrooms, but it was faultlessly clean. Clearly it had recently been renovated as all looked very new, but the tiles and grouting were spotless and there was not a single hint of dust lingering anywhere.  The toiletries smelled divine and the towels, bedding and bathrobes were luxurious and soft.  Our bed was spacious and very comfortable. 

Complementary snacks, water etc are a really nice touch.   And the hairdryer, iron, coffee machine, radio etc were all good quality.  They provide all the little things you might need, but which other hotels take the opportunity to charge for or don’t keep in the room. It was nice to not feel ripped off at all. The only negative about the room was the noise form the AC/heating unit was a bit loud at times. 

Staff were always so friendly and helpful. We had drinks in the bar at night, enjoying some very nice cocktails (I have high expectations in cocktails and they were met).  The ambience was intimate. The breakfast was lovely and again the waiting staff were great.

Location is good, we walked from and to Euston easily even with bags. Russel square brings a nice leafy feel to the surroundings.

This was our first experience of a Kimpton Hotel but we’ll be hoping to visit their other hotels in the future.",5,2021,07,11
124,A Night in Hotel Heaven,"I had a one-night stay in this stunning central London hotel, in a standard double room. The building is glorious and is well worth taking a wander through. Hotel check in (by Anna – who was a star!) was efficient, warm, friendly and gave me all the health and safety information I needed for my stay. The lifts have reduced occupancy and there is ample space to maintain social distancing. My hotel room was clean, airy and bright with good temperature control and was delightfully decorated (I especially liked the novel – a wonderful touch). The standard of refreshments and toiletries was superb. Robes and slippers are also provided. The shower was perfect! Despite being a large hotel near busy roads my sleep was undisturbed. I didn’t book breakfast but I enjoyed a wonderful nightcap in Fitz’s Bar and had a great coffee in Burr and Co, both attached to the hotel. The staff were uniformly attentive, helpful, friendly and kind – this is a grand hotel, but the level of service makes you feel like you are among friends. The hotel is ideally situated for transport links – mainline stations at Kings Cross and Euston, a tube station (Piccadilly Line) and several bus networks. There are numerous bars, cafes and restaurants in the area, along with convenience stores. There’s a lovely small park across the street from the hotel which was a pleasant haven for a morning walk. I cannot wait to return!",5,2021,07,06
124,Amazing!!,"We recently enjoyed a weekend at the Kimpton Fitroy Hotel, from check-in to check-out we had a faultless experience.

We were lucky enough to be upgraded to a Russell Square facing Suite which was perfect.
Breakfast was a fully served dining experience, highly recommended!

Drinks and snacks were available all day in Burrs, one of the best and most comfortable bars in Central London.

To be honest it's difficult to write a short review, however one of the most distinct aspects of this beautiful building was the smell! It was everywhere and so, so welcoming.

More importantly were the staff, everybody was so helpful, friendly and chatty. Nothing was too much trouble and everybody smiled in such a genuine manner, it really was a ""Home from Home"" experience, and will never be forgotten.

A special thanks to Fabiola, Guest Service Manger, you really made our short stay so 
special. We wish you and your team the very best for the future and really hope to see you again soon.",5,2021,07,01
124,And the schnauzer came too ……,"We stayed in a Corner Suite which was spacious, clean, well equipped and decorated in a fresh modern style yet with respect to the original building.  The public spaces were also spotlessly clean boasting magnificent architecture coupled with great decor.  Staff are excellent, and we greatly appreciated the gift sent up to us on arrival.  

The reason for Very Good” instead of “Excellent” is the confusion over dog friendly areas.  On booking I specifically asked if Fitz’s allowed dogs as after a days activities it’s always nice to sit and enjoy a cocktail or two before retiring to bed but the  yes, had turned into a no, by the time we arrived.  Our schnauzer was allowed to accompany us to breakfast in the restaurant and into Burr, which is great. 

Would we come again? Yes !",4,2021,06,30
124,"Lovely hotel with great, friendly staff.","We both really enjoyed our second stay at this lovely, much-modernised hotel that has kept its past in focus.  Friendly reception that provide a wonderful greeting.  Great breakfast with helpful and informative staff.  Lovely bar too.  Great for access around London.",5,2021,06,28
124,My New  Fav London hotel,"First visit to Kimpton Fitzroy . 
We enjoyed a wonderful, faultless 2 night stay. Initial welcome and Check in was friendly as professional. The hotel is luxurious and decadent. Our room tick all boxes. 
Drinks and lunch at Burr and co was faultless. Pre and post dinner drinks at Fitzs bar was most enjoyable. 
Outstanding customer service from friendly staff help make our stay fantastic. Special mention to Isobel at reception and concierge ( sajala) . Manager in Burr and co was also friendly and helpful. 
Overall an excellent hotel stay.",5,2021,06,26
124,Everything a hotel should be.,"Always such a pleasure staying here. First class staff, attentive service, excellent food, great gym, spacious and opulent communal areas, and clean modern bedrooms. Due to its fantastic location, it is one of my favourite places to stay when working in nearby Soho, which is a 10 minute walk away.",5,2021,06,23
124,Quality in every aspect,"Location
For the first time ever, we drove into Central London rather than taking the train in. This hotel worked really well for that purpose. NCP London Brunswick Square is only a 5 minute walk from the hotel and costs £15 per 24 hour period. It seemed safe and there was plenty of spaces. 
Russell Square underground station is only a 2 minute walk; there’s a small shopping centre with a Waitrose at a 5 minute walk and Oxford Street is a 15-20 minute walk. Everything considered, a great location. 

Check-in and out
Smooth, friendly and efficient. Help with luggage was offered on both occasions, but in a 5 star hotel, perhaps this should be carried out without questioning the requirement. My only slight niggle is that I didn’t receive a receipt for my final bill until I rang reception and asked for it to be emailed through to me – this was 3 days after checking out. (My first bill was subject to review upon checking out.)

Staff
This hotel has a young, vibrant staff. Every member of staff we encountered was friendly and polite and service orientated.

Public areas
This is a grand, ornate building that has been redesigned to a high standard. The public rooms are excellent.
Fitz bar
We went in late on a Friday evening and found it to have a great atmosphere with even better service. The background music is eclectic, but sets the scene beautifully for cocktails and a relaxing, but fun evening. We were disappointed it was closed on Sunday night as we had planned a second visit, after dinner.

Restaurants
Burr & Co.
We had two meals here and the quality of the food and service was excellent both times. The place has a great vibe, even if the background music mix is not to an ‘aging rocker’s’ taste at all times.

Breakfast
Lovely room and good quality food. Service on days 1 and 2 was pretty good, but slower on day 3. It’s good value at £15 a head and it’s a lovely, relaxing start to the day in bustling London. Everything is currently cooked and prepared to order.

Bedroom
Again, the bedrooms and bathrooms have quality written all over them. Beds, pillows and sheets are 5 star hotel standard. Showers and toiletries are also high quality. The glazing in the windows keeps out much of the road and pavement noise from the busy A4200.

To sum up, we enjoyed our stay at this hotel. We paid approximately £250 per night per room, B&B. For a 5 star hotel (even during covid restrictions), this was decent value for money. We would certainly return and would recommend to others.",5,2021,06,20
124,Beautiful refurbished hotel,Beautifully refurbished hotel with great staff. Requested and received a wheelchair accessable room which was spacious and well equipped. The only problem really was that the hotel has no direct wheelchair access. It does have a lift to take you from the pavement to the hotel entrance but unfortunately you cannot use this lift without staff assistance which is a bit frustrating! It also isn't obvious where the disabled access is as the lift very cleverly comes out from the steps and there is just a small plaque with a bell to ring for access. We only stayed one night but for a longer stay I think the access issue would have become more annoying. Must say the staff were great though and very helpful.,4,2021,06,15
124,Amazing stay in the Fitzroy Suite,"Amazing service, great interiors and ambience. I've stayed at Kimpton Fitzroy multiple times and they've never failed to impress with hospitality. Room service were wonderful, and the staff at the front desk were always enthusiastic about helping with things. This has quickly become one of my favourite hotels. 

The Fitzroy Suite in particular is almost like an apartment. Copious amounts of space and and layed out very nicely. There is a WC connected to the living room, and there is a large en suite. A TV in both the living room and the bedroom. Adjustable aircon in all main rooms and undefloor heating in the ensuite, with a dyson fan in the bedroom if needed. 

I highly recommend Kimpton Fitzroy London for anyone who enjoys the boutique lifestyle, and I recommend the Fitzroy Suite for anyone who wants to experience the pinnacle of what Kimpton Fitzroy has to offer",5,2021,06,14
124,Minimal extras,"Checked in for 3 nights first ever Kimpton stay as spire Elite. Heard many positives in terms of promotions so thought I would treat the kids. Nice room but not really upgraded. Very friendly reception and great location. Very clean room. Gave the secret password and 4 postcards (per person) as for a similar UK promotion. In total 1000 bonus points and a few sweets for the two kids. Not really what was implied on the Kimpton website especially regarding the postcard promotion. Was dreaming of a room upgrade or at least something like a free breakfast or even restaurant credit (like an appetiser or dessert), or anything out of the ordinary.  Have other Kimpton stays planned for the summer but as nothing out the ordinary will probably rebook.",3,2021,06,06
124,Amazing from start to finish!,"Wow! What a stay we had. We have stayed in the Hotel previously and we chose to come back and spend the night here for our wedding which was taking place locally to the hotel. From the moment we arrived we were met with smiling faces at the front of the hotel. The door staff were incredible they took my dress straight from my arms and everything was promptly sent up to our rooms.

At the front desk check in was dealt with quickly and efficiently all done again with a smile and genuine excitement for us as it was our wedding that evening. The names of the ladies who helped is were Dorine and Sara. Both so bubbly and were so happy whenever we saw them.

We then reached our room which was the Fitzroy Suite. AMAZING!! Plenty of space for us all to get ready and have photos taken. There was a beautiful lay out for our children (3 young children all aged 5 and under) of chocolates, popcorn and apple juice. Even personalised name tags for them. They loved it!

The room service was great. Everything came hot and there was a great selection. 

We also had our reception dinner later in the evening in the Woolf private dining room which was beautiful and all of the staff were so lovely. Food was perfect and every one really enjoyed the night. Iona, Lydia, Vanessa and Bex helped us all evening. Nothing was too much and always with a smile.

Breakfast the next day, which was my favourite meal at the Hotel! Was delicious!! Lots of options, juices and fruits. The children loved it. Highly recommend the omelette or pancakes!! George helped us a lot during our time at breakfast and ensured everything was perfect!

We will definitely be coming back. It was perfect for our special occasion. The door staff again when leaving,  were so kind and helpful. I didn't get their names but every single one working those days/nights (may 29th to 30th) could not have done more for us.

Thanks again for everything!",5,2021,06,01
124,Fabulous hotel,"Our first visit here and this did not disappoint- we had a junior suite which was a truly lovely room. Service at check in was smooth, friendly and efficient and again at checkout. Cannot fault this hotel and it’s in a great location.

We have been members of the IHG rewards for many years and will definitely come back here!",5,2021,05,31
124,Beautiful and welcoming,"This place was absolutely beautiful and breath taking on first entry to all parts of the hotel. It smelt absolutely lovely at reception every day and I couldn't figure out where it was coming from the whole time,  but each time we walked through we commented on how lovely it was. 
The staff were great, very helpful and friendly to all. 
 We stayed in a junior suite which was amazing. It was so clean and tidy with so much room for a real treat of a stay. The bed was very comfortable for our stay and we were able to order different pillows to the room to suit the guests. 
The shower was lovely, with the only downside being it leaked and blocked the first day and flooded the bathroom. However we called down and it was sorted very quickly with no bother and we were able to continue staying in the same room. The room has everything needed and offered a great place to stop and rest. 

I would recommend going down to the palm court for a break in the day with a drink. It's lovely and inviting there. 

I would love to stay there again",5,2021,05,31
124,Let down by chaotic breakfast service,"Wonderful greeting upon arrival followed by a surprise upgrade to a beautiful junior suite (quite possibly one of the finest five star rooms we have used in London.

Hotel is beautifully appointed in Principle Hotel style very much inline with the hotel in York.

Rooms and public areas are spotlessly clean and staff warm and friendly.

Unfortunately,  the chaotic show at breakfast took away two stars from my review, 25 minutes to get a coffee, toast arrived looking like dry bread and the main course took one hour from ordering, staff were wondering around unsure who had ordered what, my wife got the wrong breakfast as we left the people next this who had ordered prior to our arrival we’re still waiting for their breakfast.

This a real shame as prior to breakfast the hotel had move into a tied first place for our regular visits to London, however The Landmark stays at number one.

It’s a pity the restaurant management didn’t get a grip on the kitchen and serving staff to ensure this was settled down swiftly.",3,2021,05,30
124,Kimpton Kool,"My last review stands, this is one of London’s coolest hotels. Friendly, personable service with amazing interiors is a refreshing change from the stuffy other 5 star hotels.

This was my first visit, on the first weekend we were allowed leisure stays here in the UK. The hotel was full, but my room was still upgraded to a stunning junior suite. From the moment I arrived the they remembered me from my stay, were delighted to see us back and gave the pooch an even friendlier reception.

All day dining is currently in Burr & Co, and George has once again nailed the menu and the service. We went to social hour (free drinks for all residents from 5-6) and didn’t leave until 9. A great quality meal accompanied by some great beers/cocktails. 

We then popped into Fitz for some fresh new cocktails with a great vibe - even though it was all socially distanced and safe the atmosphere was buzzing. 

Another great nights sleep in a princess worthy four-poster and a shower in the beautiful marble bathroom it was time for breakfast in Neptune. It’s currently a la carte for everything but it’s a big menu and the service was great. No wait to sit down even though it was busy. 

See you all in July!",5,2021,05,25
124,"Excellent service, even after a blip","The hotel has an imposing presence and the buildings interior does not disappoint.
Stayed for 2 nights in a junior suite and the staff were extremely polite and friendly, service was excellent and nothing was too much trouble. 
We had a bit of an issue with shower but they had someone look into this straightaway and all rectified quickly.
We had dinner in Burrs on our first night and the food was very nice, partner had Keralan curry which was really good.
Room was well appointed and would definitely stay again. Thank you for such a welcoming and friendly stay!",5,2021,05,23
124,Staycation par Excellence in the Heart of London,"Londoners, one of the most exciting new luxury hotels has popped up magnificently on Russell Square, and if you find yourself requiring emergency home maintenance , this couldn't be a more elegant, self-caring, and total stress-free home away from home.  Had to arrive at short notice and the reservations process, and check-in from Fabiola, despite still on skeletal staff (due to lockdown) couldn't have been smoother. My bicycle was safely stored (and they have elegant guest bicycles too), and the property and rooms were well-appointed and stunningly refurbished.   Conor and his team at the front office made you feel well taken care of - no ""ask"" was too small to be satisfied with 5-star efficiency and an authentic friendly attitude, without the staff (front or back of house) being overbearing or indiscreet.   The gym is fantastic, with a full set of weights and top class cardio equipment , and the food and beverage, helmed by George and Adrian, is delicious and healthy.  The dining outlets, once opened (the bar is super well stocked) provide the necessary dramatic ambience for every occassion large or small, while not sacrificing modern and clean, unfussy renovations (modern lift and great bathrooms) tastefully done. I  can't wait to return.",5,2021,04,28
124,What a Fantastic Hotel,"From the first grand impression to the beautiful rooms this hotel is top class!! But what really makes this hotel special is the fantastic team that make sure it runs like clockwork. Friendly and helpful, you are left feeling nothing is too much trouble.
We had breakfast at the which was lovely but we went out for dinner, but we did treat ourselves to a dessert from room service when we returned and they were lovely. 
We have stayed at many hotels within the IHG group but this is by far the best so far.",5,2020,12,13
124,Charming Hotel,My husband and I Loved the Fitzroy and would stay again. The restaurants and bar located in the hotel are not only gorgeous but the food is delicious too. The hotel is located across the street from a park. The staff was very accommodating and helpful with suggestions. We can’t wait to return! ,5,2020,12,10
124,"Stunning Rooms, Friendly Service","There is a reason why this is Kimpton's flagship European property; the hard product is absolutely amazing. From the moment you enter the large brass doors into the beautifully scented lobby until you get to your room the attention to detail is incredible. The reception staff were so welcoming and eager to help.

We had a junior suite overlooking the park, which had a stunning marble filled bathroom (complete with roll top bath and huge walk in shower). The products are custom made for the hotel, and the scent is especially memorable. The four poster bed gave a perfect nights sleep on soft linen.

As the world is upside down at the moment there is only one F&B venue open, the Mediterranean feeling, Palm Court. We had great cocktails, dinner and breakfast here. The staff were great here, really warm and welcoming.

A perfect stay; I can't wait for you to open again!",5,2020,11,06
124,Honeymoon how Wonderful,"We recently spent 2 nights of our honeymoon at the Kimpton.  What can I say,  feels special every time we walk in,  it's like coming home.  The staff are always so friendly,  from the front desk to George and his team in the restaurants. Nothing seems to much trouble,  we had a slight issue with our room,  they could not do enough to help resolve it.  As I always say,  it's not issue,  but how an organisation reacts which is most important.  First class place and by far our favourite place to stay in London. ",5,2020,10,31
124,Fantastic stay!,"I have used this hotel before so knew what to expect and despite some Covid restrictions being in place we had a fantastic stay. the hotel itself is beautiful and the staff are superb. This hotels key asset for us is the location, it cannot be beaten! right beside a main road, an underground station and shops and within walking distance of Euston Station, Covent Garden etc.",5,2020,10,27
124,😍,"I had an amazing time!!!!!! The staff were really really friendly and helpful!!! The room service was faster than expected which was great as I was very hungry 😋. The beds were very comfortable and the duvet was soft and cuddly.
",5,2020,10,21
124,What a Wonderful way to celebrate our anniversary ,"Our son booked the hotel as a surprise treat for our wedding anniversary - and what a treat it was! From the moment we arrived at the front door we were made to feel very welcome - in spite of the need to wear masks - almost as if we were special guests and nothing was too much to ask for the fantastic staff. Everything about the hotel room was great - especially the comfortable bed and pillows - I am very fussy and often take my own when travelling, but there was no need for that here. 
We did not dine at the hotel but we did enjoy a few drinks in the bar - the cocktails were great - and glancing at the menu I thought the dishes on offer were very reasonably priced by London hotel standards.
The big highlight the next day was the breakfast - served in very comfortable surroundings and with a very good selection to choose from - but the best part was the service provided by George who looked after our every need. He handled all our requests in a polite and friendly manner. Nothing seemed to be too much trouble for him and I saw that he treated all his customers with the same professional and efficient service - a real star!
",5,2020,10,15
124,Superb,Just had a very enjoyable 3 days here. From the moment we arrived to the moment we left all the staff were superb. The decor and fittings are deffo 5 star. We were given a nice upgrade through our spire elite status and it was appreciated. The room was of good size very clean and huge bathroom. Covid measures throughout the hotel. The palm court is a lovely place for a drink and food and very reasonably priced for a 5 star hotel. Would deffo go again and thanks for a great stay,5,2020,10,15
124,Wowwww - would recommend this to anyone visiting London.,"We had a late check in and the staff were s friendly and welcoming. The hotel is beautiful both inside and out, our room was spacious, luxurious and just what we were looking for. We felt so at home and it made it a very special stay.

My favorite part was coming down to breakfast, the food was sensational, and the service from George and the team was perfect. He showed a real interest in us, and for a large hotel it had a very personal and intimate vibe.

Its a must stay. Thanks to the Kimpton Fitzroy team. We will be back!!",5,2020,10,13
124,"Beautiful building, excellent location and the most friendly and accommodating staff","Upon arrival we received a friendly welcome and showed round the hotel and to our bedroom. The hotel was immaculate and it had a great atmosphere.  Isa ensured that we had everything we needed throughout our stay. We had breakfast at the hotel which was delicious, in the most beautiful room. Our server George ensured that my allergies were catered for, and offered us many recommendations for things to do that day. The location is perfect  being in heart of London. We will be visiting again!",5,2020,10,13
124,Fantastic Weekend Stay,"Given the current pandemic and restrictions we were nervous about staying in a hotel but we couldn't have felt more at ease at the Kimpton Fitzroy. The staff were fantastic throughout the process from the check-in (special thanks to Isa who was absolutely lovely and nothing was too much trouble for her) and breakfast (again, thanks to George who ensured we had the best table and truly excellent service). 

The room was very clean and maintained to a high standard. Bathroom was also very clean and loved the shower! Water pressure was fantastic. 

Hotel is convenient located without being in a noisy area. Had the best night's sleep. 

Thanks for an amazing stay. We will definitely return!",5,2020,10,13
124,Great stay in central London with amazing staff!,"I booked a stay for my friends 30th birthday, given the current Covid restrictions to ensure we had a special night! The building is beautiful, great location looking over Russell Square. The staff were amazing, nothing was too much effort, Isa checked us in and showed us to the room - she was so lovely! I would come back to stay without hesitation. George served us for breakfast, big character and delicious full english to start the day.",5,2020,10,12
124,Highly recommend!,"I had a wonderful experience at the Kimpton Fitzroy, thank you all for making my stay so special. Big thanks to Walter who showed me around the hotel and to whomever is responsible for leaving a delicious birthday treat in my room 🎉 The staff are lovely and very helpful and the hotel is stunning!",5,2020,10,11
124,"Beautiful Building, Exceptional Staff","I was here for a one night “staycation” to visit a couple of galleries and museums.  The building is stunning, especially lit up at night. The hotel faces a park square, and the immediate area is mostly academic establishments and residential buildings although Covent Garden, Soho, and The West End are easy walking distance away, as is the British Museum. 

Inside the hotel, the lobby and ground floor public areas are very grand but unfortunately, this scale and grandeur didn’t translate to my standard room. The room was disappointingly small, and the tiny bathroom was cramped. For COVID-19 reasons the room amenities have been stripped back to basics which is a shame, but it is made clear that you can request robes, slippers, etc if required. 

On the plus side, the bed was comfortable and the décor was nice, even though there was only a small table and chairs (no desk). One aspect of my stay which deserves a special mention is the staff, who were all super friendly and helpful – the doormen and reception staff I dealt with are a credit to the hotel.

I didn’t eat in the restaurant but I did have a room service breakfast which was a big let-down.  I opted for a “hot breakfast to go” which described takeaway cups, so I thought it would be breakfast in a bag for people who had to leave the hotel to attend meetings etc. In fact, it turned out to be a standard hotel tray breakfast. Sadly, my smoked salmon bagel was rock-hard, wasn’t toasted, and the seasonal fruit pot was just a bowl of diced pear with a couple (literally) of berries on top. I was also overcharged, but it was quickly rectified.  

I suspect that the breakfast issues are down to new systems and options being put in place as the hotel has only just reopened after lockdown. The COVID-19 measures and the small room size meant that it didn’t really feel like a five-star experience, aside from the lovely hotel team.",4,2020,10,09
124,Fantastic 5* stay in central London,"I had a very special stay at the Kimpton Fitzroy London last week with friends. The hotel has such a welcoming ambience as soon as you walk in.

Thank you!",5,2020,10,08
124,A relaxing and luxurious stay,"Our night at the Kimpton Fitzroy London was one to remember. From welcome drinks in Palm Court to a fulfilling breakfast the following day, it was a wonderful 5-star experience. The bedrooms are also immaculate, with all the utilities you need for a restful stay. The hotel is located in the heart of it all, with fantastic restaurants, shops and cultural activities on its doorstep. A big thank you to Jen, Corin and all the hotel staff who made us feel so welcome!",5,2020,10,08
124,Luxurious in every way,"I had the most incredible stay here this weekend with some friends. We are so grateful to Jen and Corin for welcoming us to their beautiful Hotel. The rooms were so beautiful. Also and special mention to George, the Food and Beverage Manager at the Kimpton. He introduced himself when we popped down to enjoy the amazing breakfast and he really looked after us and made sure we had the best finish to an already great stay. I can't wait to come back!",5,2020,10,08
124,Brilliant 5* stay,"We couldn’t have asked for a better stay at The Kimpton Fitzroy on Russel Square. It truly lives up to its luxurious standards and nothing was too much trouble.

We were very well looked after by the staff, especially Corin and George. We had an amazing time! 
Thank you so much! Couldn't recommend enough.",5,2020,10,07
124,Amazing birthday stay!,"I cannot recommend the Kimpton Fitzroy enough! The best hotel I’ve ever stayed in. The staff go above and beyond to make your experience amazing! Would like to say a special thank you to Amrith, Dorien, Mollie, Walter & Isabel. We’re looking forward to staying with you again soon!",5,2020,10,04
124,Very special experience,"Beautiful hotel. We were given an upgrade for working for NHS. We felt very special. The Staff worked very hard to make the hotel covid safe even with the extra work this entailed. The staff at breakfast worked really hard to balance safety and service. Thank you all especially Annie on reception.

124,Top hotel with a first class service,"On arrival we were upgraded to a suite as guests of the day which was an unexpected surprise as it conincided with our first year wedding anniversary. Melanie, the receptionist was very welcoming and even sent us a message to see if the hotel could be of assistance throughout our stay; such a personal service which added to the enjoyment of the day. Fabiole, the guest services manager, brought us up a complimentary cake. We had such excellent and personal service. The manager in the Palm Court was absolutely fantastic too.  What can I say, the staff have perfect hospitality skills, room was superb and ambience of the hotel was definitely five star. Perfect location for Covent Garden, the British Museum and in fact to walk into Soho. It was definitely a relaxing experience.
The hotel reopened a week away and it felt very safe as all measures had been taken to safeguard the guests and staff.",5,2020,10,01
124,Stunning Hotel,"I had several meetings planned in London and decided to visit the hotel with my colleagues, what a beautiful hotel, the place was immaculate, the staff were amazing nothing was to much trouble for them. If you are visiting London I would highly recommend staying at the Kimpton Kitzroy, We will certainly be going back and recommending to all my colleagues.",5,2020,09,25
124,Anniversary,We ended up here after Ihg Park Lane decided to not re open until the 1st October. We had to stick to original dates before our daughter returns to the Middle East soon. We stayed 2 nights and had a lovely upgrade for our celebration and being spire ambassador. We had a little disruption which was dealt with as best as possible as just reopened there are bound to be some issues beyond management control. Everyone was exemplary in trying to make us comfortable and totally professional in the Covid prevention policies.  We want  to say thank you to everyone for a fabulous stay and would recommend anyone going to London do not hesitate in choosing this hotel. We will most definitely return ASAP and once the world is normal look forward to many more visits in all the years to come. Definitely one of London’s finest.,5,2020,09,24
124,first stay on day of reopening,As I had an early morning meeting at the University of London I wanted a hotel nearby & chose the Kimpton Fitzroy. I was staying with my wife & we were not disappointed. They could not have done more to make us welcome & their care in dealing with the issues arising from Covid 19 were exemplary. Sir Rodney,5,2020,09,23
124,Beautiful hotel,"From outside to inside this hotel is beautiful. Plus the range of restaurants and bars covers ever you could ever want. Just allow time in your itinerary to enjoy the hotel. The coffee shop set up is first class and full of people working or simply being on line. 
Breakfast is the most chilled meal we have ever had and not what you expect in a large hotel. Expect a warm welcome with fresh coffee and a plated breakfast of your choice. The cold selection is refreshed constantly. 
The evening bar with live music has the best of table service with nibbles and water frequently refreshed. Musicians are well chosen for the atmosphere. 
A lovely hotel with many lovely thoughtful touches. ",5,2020,05,24
124,"Rooms and hotel building 5*, restaurants 3*","We stayed here one night recently and had very mixed feelings about this hotel.  The actual hotel is beautiful throughout with lovely marble fireplaces.  However, on entry there is a lack of signage and we couldn't find reception, later we also struggled to find the bar and the toilets.  There definitely need to be signs put up!  In the evening they light lanterns, that looked lovely.  The lifts were very efficient but a table in the corridor leading to our bedroom was not cleared of dirty room service items over night, there was a plastic bag of rubbish and dirty plates all over it.

Our corner suite was lovely and spotlessly clean, with a bath in the window, good quality toiletries and a tuck box.  There were lots of high quality towels, including plenty next to the bath.  The bedding was of a very good quality too with huge pillows and the room was really quiet.

Staff were lovely, particularly in reception and in the bar.  Afternoon tea was rather disappointing.  Although I had specifically booked this stay before the date that the all-chocolate afternoon tea was meant to start, this is what we were served, so we found the sandwiches rather weird.  The maitre d' was in jeans, which did not project a professional appearance, and he did not seem to know what pink champagne was!  However, the Palm Court was a pretty room with fairy lights in the trees.  The bar was good with nice cocktails and friendly staff, when we returned on our second day for cocktails, they remembered what we had had the previous evening, they provided excellent service in the bar.

Breakfast, again, was a bit of a disappointment.  Waiters were in jeans and t-shirts so it was not always clear who was staff and who were guests, plus I did not think it appropriate for a 5* hotel.  There was a lack of attention to detail.  The buffet ran out of plates and milk, our table (which was very small) was not cleared so we quickly ran out of room and had to start putting our dirty plates on unused tables nearby.  I also found the tables too close together so we could hear the next table's entire conversation.  There was no nice bread on the buffet, only boring ready sliced.

We went to Burr & Co for tea and cake but the selection of cakes was so weird, we left the hotel and found somewhere nearby serving more normal stuff.

I probably wouldn't return here, which is a shame as the suite definitely had the wow factor but the restaurants and food let it down.",3,2020,05,02
124,Best hotel ever!,"My 14-year old son and I happened to run into this hotel ""by accident"" when we were planning our trip to London. It looked good when we booked it and the location seemed great, close to British Museum and Covent Garden. An Underground station a few steps away wasn't seen as a disadvantage by us either. There, all our expectations were exceeded! The location is great since it is only a few stations away from Piccadilly Circus with Piccadilly Line. A walk to Covent Garden takes only approximately 15 minutes. It's close to many of the theatres and many great restaurants. 
The hotel itself is just great! The room was great, the beds fantastic and the bathroom spotless. Although close to a heavy trafficked road we could not hear any noise. Best of all though is the staff! I could right so much about them but a few words sums it up - they are the best! Next time we will be back in London, this will be where we stay. ",5,2020,04,12
124,first every staycation,"The room was beautiful where the amenities were surprising to see in the room which was the corner suite. I was happy with the host called Amrith Khatwani where he made my stay at the hotel extremely special. He made sure that my experience from the stay to the end of checking out went smoothly, also due to me ask about nearby areas to visit, therefore, he was very helpful with the answers that I had received and he made my travel easier due to a  medical condition. I was happy with the service that was provided to me during the stay and i had no complaints as I was happy.",5,2020,03,17
124,"Excellent, relaxed, terrific fun.","Bloomsbury is a bit of a rundown, forgotten, 1970s part of London, so thank God for Burr & Co - a place that breaks these rules.  

A great, relaxed cafe and restaurant with excellent staff who care about service. Alex in particular was great - super helpful!!

In a cynical city that doesn't care much about people or service, Burr & Co is a refreshing, excellent oasis! ",5,2020,03,16
124,A Brilliant Gem,"A stunning renovation of an elegant old building, the Kimpton Fitzroy has gorgeous pubic rooms, chic guest rooms, a wonderfully hip bar, as well as a most hospitable and gracious staff highlighted by an excellent concierge service. We  chose this hotel because it was near our daughter's flat while she was studying in London but we loved our stay so much that it is now our official go-to hotel when we visit London. The concierge, Jason Grounds, was spectacular and made things happen quickly, efficiently, and with utter charm and grace. He even helped us out and offered excellent service between two scheduled visits to the hotel. I have rarely seen the level of service he provided in our many stays at 5 star hotels throughout the world. Ivars was also a complete delight to work with. In fact, there is a level of professionalism and a desire to please that  is unparalleled. I wish I could live here permanently!",5,2020,03,16
124,Weekend trip ,"Stayed here for a full weekend, this hotel is excellently situated in Russell Square in Bloomsbury and is within walking distance from most of the major landmarks and museums. The staff are very nice, Sarah at reception was particularly helpful and attentive. The rooms are clean and well-furnished, the beds are very comfortable and there are all sorts of amenities. The hotel has several restaurants and bars all of which offer a variety of delicious food and drinks. The hotel itself is very beautiful, inside and outside and is a Grade II listed building. Overall a very pleasant stay and would definitely recommend. 
",5,2020,03,16
124,Fantastic Hotel,We had a fantastic stay at the hotel. All of the staff were extremely friendly and helpful. We returned to our room on Saturday to find a complimentary bottle of champagne to help us celebrate our night which was a lovely touch. Thanks for a great visit.,5,2020,03,15
124,Memorable afternoon tea,"Amazing exterior and interior architecture. Palm court, a beautiful setting for afternoon tea. The food was excellent and potions were good.  Service was exceptional. 

Teas and champagne went down well.",5,2020,03,15
124,5/5,I am a kimpton employee and I must say the kimpton in London is incredible. I visited while staying in London and was treated like family. Adam and Travis went above and beyond to make me and friends feel at home.,5,2020,03,14
124,Amazing service,"Prior to our booking I was contacted and offered the opportunity of an upgrade, which I took and was so so impressed.  We were made extremely welcome on arrival, our room was superb, no detail was missed, from the bedding to the decor.  I have stayed in various hotels in London including some major names and I have never been looked after so well.  I can not recommend the whole experience more highly. I was contacted by Presley to help with anything I might like to add or have whilst we were there and he was the consummate professional and offered me a level of service that I haven't had before, excellent!!",5,2020,03,11
124,Like visiting family,"I say this about all of the Kimpton hotels I have stayed, they treat you like family and The Fitzroy has added to that experience.  Arriving early morning from overseas they provided a ""resting room"" so I could nap and wash up before my room was ready, I was then upgraded to a suite ( 1 bed, 1 +1/2 bath w/ living room) overlooking Russell square park. (Note: I'm an IHG member) The staff and service were outstanding, I was completely taken care of.  The location was perfect - quiet but withing walking distance to Soho, etc. I cannot wait to return. Thank you!",5,2020,03,10
124,5* ??,"I booked a single room in this hotel for a night in London. The check in process was smooth, the receptionist told me the hotel was quiet at the moment, he asked if i was part of the IHG membership, i am. so, instead of having a single room, he could offer me a double room... Then proceeded to tell me this would cost me an additional £50.00 this was disappointing after paying a lot for the single room. I was also offered cooked breakfast for another £30.00. The receptionist was very pleasant. I then went up to my room, there was no offer of help for my bag. The room, was VERY small, the carpet could do with replacing also. The bathroom  was very nice! clean and modern. 
On the evening, i had a drink in the bar, a small bottle of Peroni £7.50. I then had to walk around the place looking for someone to pay my bill. I then waited for a friend in reception, i asked the receptionist where the toilet was, and was greeted with a bit of a dirty look as if i wasn't meant to be there. Again another sour taste left. 
In the morning i didn't have breakfast in the morning. Upon check out the receptionist was very good, and offered to look after my bag, which i took advantage of. She was very helpful! 
Upon returning to the hotel to collect my bag, I went to the concierge and there was nobody there, then went back to reception and they then struggled to find them.

Overall, this hotel is nice, it has certain 5* things about it, however, I think it is a 4* hotel. A good 4* but there are plenty of other, better 5* hotels in London, that I will probably choose next time.",3,2020,03,08
124,An absolute MUST !,"At a recent experience at The Kimpton Fitzroy, Russell Square - London, I mentioned my willingness to volunteer to be a dog sitter (selfishly &) in support Kimptons unique pet policy “if it can fit in the lift, it’s at home”.

I returned later that evening to a beautiful message, “Russell the dog” and a made member of the Dog Sitting Club - picture attached! 

Kimpton pride themselves on being ridiculously personal, and it is!

From check in, through breakfast ( which is outstanding) to wine hour... a young dynamic team who really bring the brand values to life in all they do. 

With special thanks to @marti, @ryan, and the breakfast team!",5,2020,03,07
124,Luxurious hotel and friendly staff,"We’ve stayed at the Kimpton with family twice now and both times have loved the rooms we were given and the service received from reception, house keeping and restaurant staff! The fact it’s dog friendly is a big factor for us too. We should especially mention Umberto who was absolutely fantastic with our little boy, even entertaining him so that we could finish eating our meal- it’s rare to find service like that! Thank you Kimpton and team!",5,2020,03,07
124,Amazing hotel and staff,"If you want something special this is definitely the hotel to choose.  We were made to feel special from the moment we walked through the doors.  Staff were amazing and so friendly and genuinely interested in talking to you.  The building is breathtaking and I could of spent the day exploring it, it was lovely sitting in front of the fire drinking hot chocolate at the end of a busy day after sightseeing in London. Breakfast was lovely and so much to choose from, something for everyone and staff gave recommendations which were exceptional. The whole hotel was immaculate and the suite we stayed in was cleaned twice a day, it was lovely having our bed turned down for us and lights set dim and heating set just right.  water and glasses placed on your bedside table,  this definitely made it extra special,  housekeeping are definitely a credit to the hotel.  We had a cocktail trolley brought to our room and we were prepared cocktails by a very impressive gentleman from the cocktail lounge Fitz,  I can’t remember his name but he said he was originally from Denmark. He was really friendly and spent time telling us about different cocktails a true credit to the hotel and really easy to chat to,  and the cocktails were amazing too. It’s all the added little things that makes this hotel so special and nothing was to much trouble, and the staff were interested in what you had to say and excellent for recommending places.  Thank you so much for making our stay perfect,  hope to see you all again soon. Only downside was could’ve done with staying 7 nights instead of 3.",5,2020,03,04
124,Fab stay in January,"We were planning on staying here our last night in London, and ended up booking two additional nights due to a change in plans with local friends.  We checked in early evening.  The room was ready and check-in was a breeze.  We took our own luggage up as we were in a hurry to go meet some friends.  The room was very impressive regarding decoration, although we had to move some things to find a place to put our two suitcases.  We were lucky to be on the 6th floor in the front and had a great view over the park.  I had booked a superior 1 double bed, as the double urban looked a bit tight.  I also requested an upgrade and if they have it, then they charge you an extra amount.  Unfortunately we did not get an upgrade, but were not charged for it.  

We had drinks in the bar which was lovely and delish.  It had not been open the first night we were there so were happily surprised it was the second.  It was closed again on the last night.  

We had breakfast in the restaurant the last morning, and it was pretty disappointing.  Wouldn't spend that amount on breakfast there again.  The coffee shop in the building had a better breakfast and much more affordable. It's open all day and has food as well as drinks.  We went there a couple of times, they have an eclectic menu.  The down side was the big open room (palm room? ) always had a private do on so could not go hang out in there.  

The staff was always welcoming and helpful, and the building is incredible inside and out.  We will be back in town in Sept for a couple of nights and hope we stay there again.  My husband is planning a surprise trip so fingers crossed!",4,2020,03,04
124,Lovely hotel ,"We been over the weekend and you can't fault the hotel, the room was very clean, breakfast great with ala carte items and lovely buffet, before diner free drinks in the bar, dinner was very good too,overall a very well managed hotel ",5,2020,03,04
124,Awesome Experience,"Excellent staff, friendly and accommodating - clean and very nice rooms.  Stay was topped off by superb customer service by Morten Kjaerulff in the Lounge. I will definitely stay again and bring my husband.",5,2020,03,03
124,Comfortable but slow service,"Very pleasant bar in the former Russell Hotel, now modernised and renovated. I miss the Edwardian comfort of leather armchairs, but there is no doubt the modern decor attracts more customers: young women with children, groups working, and individiuals on their computers. I went in for a quick drink before a meeting, and found the service pleasant, but slow.",4,2020,03,01
124,Great base to explore the Bloomsbury Sets!,"Smart, clean friendly hotel with attentive staff and one of the most comfy beds we have ever slept in. Our meal in the Neptune restaurant there in first night was also a highlight, as it name suggests the seafood dishes in particular delicious. The other bar, Burr & Co, also welcoming, relaxed with a fine choice of drinks.As it was our anniversary they upgraded us to a room With a view of Russell Square which was nice, and they also gave us a complimentary dessert, which was a nice touch. One slight let-down was we didn't have a bath. But room was very pleasant so overall a very enjoyable stay.",4,2020,03,01
124,Great place and great stay. Really nice staff and really nice hotel!,very nice rooms. a bit on the small side though. I would recommend to go here on business trips if you're able and your company is willing. nice staff and beautiful hotel with a good amount of quality facilities.,5,2020,02,28
124,2 excellent stays,"Stayed here on two occasions around the week of my birthday (23rd January & 9th February) 2020. On both occasions I was made to feel like a princess!

On the second occasion I was made guest of the day and we could not have been treated better. We had a beautiful room upgrade and some added extras that we really did not expect but couldn't have been more grateful for. 

Rooms were lovely and clean with top amenities and food was of a great quality. 

I would like to give a special mention to Maria (from guest relations) and Adi (I believe these were their names. 

I will be staying again in March for my partners birthday and both of us are extremely looking forward to our stay.

Thank you again,
Katie. A",5,2020,02,27
124,Plush big characterful 4+ * hotel,"Lovingly restored big hotel lots of marble etc. Great London location next to Russell Square tube. The basic double is cosy in size but well furnished and equipped.
Staff friendly and efficient. Well equipped gym.
Late night bar was a highlight and atmospheric.
You pay quite a premium price for the plush environment for what is in effect a good 4 star hotel.
The breakfast service was a bit creaky - the place was busy when we stayed and they could really have done with more staff and tables.",4,2020,02,26
124,Very poor stay,"It’s a shame as the hotel building looks amazing! Smoke and mirrors? Don’t know if they cut corners? Bathroom smelt of drains. The floor noise from the room above was appalling and in the bathroom you could tell exactly what was happening above. 
The food was ok but you get the impression that wherever you look there are not enough staff and those that are there are stressed and surly. It should be one of London’s best but it isn’t. It falls short it is not 5 star just a very average 4 star 
The noise issue really does need addressing and at nearly £300 this was very poor stay. I will bring it up in the morning with management and hear their thoughts.",1,2020,02,25
124,"Lovely room, poor food and dreadful bar staff","It’s a beautiful hotel, nice check in staff, nice porters and lovely rooms.   The breakfast was atrocious and barely worth eating – a basic Holiday Inn breakfast far surpasses their offering.  The dinner provided by their conferencing was minimalistic and had strange flavours.  
The bar staff were downright rude to pretty much everyone attending the event and the bar shut at 12.    I have never stayed at a hotel where they shut the bar so early with so many eager drinkers left high and dry.  We found a nearby hotel to drink in and how they had the audacity to charge for service I don’t know.  The flagpole outside the window clanged all night but I slept well.  The bath filled exceptionally quickly and was very deep.  The cleaning staff let you sleep and didn’t prowl angrily outside your room.  
In summary, it’s a nice hotel that luckily has the benefit of a hotel nearby that has a 24-hour bar and casino and the benefit of pleasant bar staff.",3,2020,02,25
124,Lovely but not 5 star,"Had a wonderful stay here, but at £400 a night for two nights (a standard room) both myself and my partner expected a few details to be better. 

Cocktails were very mediocre - we tried nearly the entire menu over the weekend, looking on their Instagram they don’t represent what is shown. 
Same goes for food - eating in the restaurant was a disappointment for the location and price. Our waiter was lovely and looked after us thoroughly. 

Building is stunning, and a pleasure to walk around, it just for me didn’t hit the five star mark - my bf spent a small fortune over this weekend and tbh I’ve spent much less for similar standards. 

",4,2020,02,24
124,Not a really 5* hotel,"A mixture of good and bad details all around.
Not really the luxury and the quality you expect in a 5* hotels.
Even the breakfast was nothing special.
We stayed at a large suite with a really narrow saloon, with a minimum toilet cab and nothing of lux.
Location is not bad, but you'll need to walk a lot to get to the main locations in London.
Fortunately after complaining the hotel returned part of the extra price I paid.",3,2020,02,22
124,Valentine's weekend,"Excellent room, with a fantastic shower. Will be back just to have a wash! Delicious breakfast and we were very well looked after by the friendly staff. Great service from all the team, particularly Max. Social hour was a welcome introduction to the Kimpton Fitzroy. If I win the lottery, I'll definitely be back again.",5,2020,02,20
124,Short Stay,"This Hotel has a great location and Tube around the Corner. Lovely Charcter and has a laid back vibe along with its outstanding Staff starting from the front Door as you arrive .Rooms are spotless and sound proof and have a substantial Buffet breakfast catering for all requirements.There is something for everyone here and the staff will find it if you can't inside and out .Thank you all for a lovely stay.

124,A gem in the heart of London,"I booked this hotel last minute and it was so good that I actually extended my stay. It is excellent value for money: great service, amazing comfortable rooms and a lovely breakfast. Located 1 minute away from Russel Square tube station, it is the perfect spot and very close to the British Museum, Leicester Square and Covent Garden. Highly recommended! ",5,2020,02,18
124,Valentines delight,"I stayed here with my new fiancé for the Valentine’s package which included an evening meal with champagne and breakfast.  
We upgraded to a Superior King room for an extra 30.00.  This was a good choice as we had a very large room with an extremely comfortable bed.
Great customer service.  Very attentive staff and my fiancé found it funny how the staff were smartly dressed, but wearing trainers.  This reflects the cool, laid back vibe of the place.  But saying this, it doesn’t deflect from the wonderful classy hotel that it is.
Bikes were on loan but not for us this weekend as Storm Dennis was around but what a lovely idea.
Neptune, where our food was served had an hour between 5 and 6 where complimentary lager and wines were served.  Our evening meal wasn’t huge, but it was delicious and served with a glass of champagne.  Breakfast was delicious with continental buffet or an a la carte menu with a variety of choices, from the traditional English, right through to the Avocado with rye dough bread.  There is flexibility with the egg choice and add-ons.
Drinks are fairly expensive, but that is to be expected in London.  Lots of choice of spirits, many very very obscure ones but good quality and though I didn’t try a cocktail, they looked very good.
There’s a park opposite and the location serves you well with a variety of restaurants within walking distance.  It’s a good base if you want to go sightseeing.
Now the negatives, because I have to be balanced.  
We waited a long time for our room service and check- out was a bit of a pallava as there was confusion over what we had to pay.  That is why I’ve awarded 4, and not 5 stars.
But, this is a really cool and fun hotel and I would love to come again.",4,2020,02,15
124,Fabulous stay at the Kimpton Fitzroy,"My husband and I had two nights at this fabulous hotel.  From the moment we arrived at the hotel door we received brilliant service.  

We were checked in by Anna who was friendly and welcoming.  We stayed in junior suite,which was a beautiful appointed room.  Everything was of highest standard, with gorgeous bed linens, quality towels and fluffy dressing robes.  The bathroom was spacious and the shower must be the best monsoon one I have ever been in.  The complimentary toiletries and mini bar items were great.  

The hotel is a beautiful place and has been restored to the highest standard.  It is spotless and housekeeping should be congratulated for that. We ate in Neptunes and had drinks in Fitz and Palm Court.  Thanks also to Clare and Harry from guest relations  for their excellent service.  I would recommend this hotel and would love to return.",5,2020,02,15
124,Beautiful boutique style hotel in the heart of London ,"If you are looking for an amazing hotel, with fabulous service in the heart of London this is the place! We booked it for our annual conference and had over 120 people attending. It’s in a great location on Russell Square, next to the tube station and other local attractions. From check in to check out the service was outstanding, the food was consistently amazing and the bedrooms were very quirky. Love the lifts you just press your floor and they allocate you a lift! No waiting around, I stayed on the 8th floor which is the top floor, less rooms and very quiet. The highlight is the architecture of the building and the way it’s been sympathetically updated by the Kimpton group. I would highly recommend you give it a go! ",5,2020,02,14
124,Very pleasant stay,"The staff where very welcoming, our. room was lovely with a small balcony, although on a busy road there was no traffic noise.   Breakfast was great with a lovely selection cereals, fruit and breads as well as a great selection from the menu. The hotel decor was so beautiful, the entrance was breathtaking.  Will definitely stay there again when visiting London, great location.",5,2020,02,13
124,Incredible experience,"Absolutely gorgeous hotel! Meeting space very large and beautiful and the staff is really friendly!  The decor is made with taste and the food was very original and tasty.
The main entrance is really impressive",5,2020,02,13
124,Very good hotel,"We’ve stayed at the Kimpton a few weekends ago and it was a wonderful experience. We were celebrating our anniversary. The room, although on the small side, had all the essentials (to note the plug at the bottom of the mirror to plug my hairdryer!). Thanks to the Guest Relations team for the thoughtful note and the little cake. Delicious!",5,2020,02,10
124,Amazing,"From the moment you step in until you leave. I was impressed with the lobby, the bars, the restaurants, the room. I was lucky enough to be upgraded as a Spire member and the room was gorgeous. Very comfy bed. And the staff, everyone seemed happy to work there and they went the extra mile with my stay. I will be back soon.",5,2020,02,10
124,I would come back,"Good location, 15 minutes walk to Oxford Circus for shopping. The lobby is impressive. Depending on the category, the rooms are either too small or of very good size - I had a junior suite and had enough space. My friends who were also in the hotel had booked normal rooms and were accommodated partly in quite small rooms. The cleanliness of the room was excellent, I had nothing to complain about here. The breakfast as also the service was excellent.  The reception was always friendly and helpful. Many thanks also to Claire D., who took care of all of my concerns efficiently.",5,2020,02,10
124,Amazing hotel and stay ,"We absolutely loved the Kimpton Fitzroy, it’s such a beautiful hotel with multiple bars and staff are really friendly and helpful and made us feel very welcome. 

Happy hour 5-6pm was great as we had free drinks during this time which was a lovely perk! 

Our room was stunning, so spacious and lovely decor. They even put a lovely dessert in the room for my fiancé’s birthday. 

We’d love to stay here again, everything about this hotel oozes class and quality. ",5,2020,02,10
124," Best hotel in London","Absolutely amazing hotel! The building is phenomenal as is the service! Walter at the door is so helpful and charming. Travis and Pedro in Neptune and Joyce and Manice in Fitz's, just to mention a few, have worldclass service with smiles on their faces. Food and drinks are great wherever you go. Lots of options to choose from. Great stay, will be back!",5,2020,02,09
124,My Favorite Kimpton Hotel - 5 star luxury at 3 star prices.,"DISCLAIMER:  I'm at the top level of the IHG Hotels loyalty program, which will impact level of service.

SUMMARY:  Gorgeous hotel. The staff went out of their way to make us feel at home.  Changed our itinerary to stay with them on the way back.  Our stay here has improved my opinion of London overall as a travel destination.

My first trip to London was in 1986.  Hated it. Bad food, people were rude. The ""luxury"" hotels I stayed at were a bit long in the tooth.  The only reason why we were going to be in London was as a transit stop on our way to Scotland.  We booked the Kimpton as we've had almost exclusively wonderful experiences with the brand and the pictures of the hotel looked gorgeous.

The pictures do not do the hotel justice.  

We checked in early, and a room was not ready, so we waited in the Palm Court. We sat on a couch in front of the fireplace and had tea.  The Palm Court is gorgeous and the server was very attentive.

We were upgraded to a suite as a result of my membership in the IHG loyalty program.  The room did not disappoint. The beds at the Kimptons are uniformly the most comfortable of any of the hotels I stay in.  The staff was lovely: very helpful, very friendly.

We did not avail ourselves of any of the food there: we are vegan and had a list of restaurants to hit while we were there.  Room service breakfast was coffee and toast.  The coffee was good and strong. (As a side note, it struck my wife and I that, while the British are known for tea, they sure know how to make an excellent Americano).

Loved our stay here.  Helped change our thoughts about London.  Will be travelling through London more when going to Europe (sorry, Paris).

Final note: if you base your travel decisions purely on cost, not your hotel. If you want a truly luxurious experience at an affordable price without a lot of pretense, stay here.",5,2020,02,09
124,Wish we could of stayed longer!,"I stayed here recently with my partner as it was his birthday. We had tickets booked for the theatre so I chose a hotel which was not far from Covent Garden. I am so glad I booked here at Kimpton Fitzroy as it was superb. 
As soon as you arrive, you are greeted with doorman and bellboys who are eager to help you with bags. 
We were greeted by a lovely member of staff at reception who told us we had been upgraded which was a great. Our room was spacious and had everything we needed. The rainfall shower was just what I wanted after a night out. The hotel itself is beautiful and our room was spotless. We both slept well each night as we didn't want to get out of bed as it was super comfy.
We had breakfast buffet and the quality of the food was great. We could leave our bags with the concierge so we enjoyed a day in London before we had to catch the train home without dragging suitcases around.
Overall, the stay was amazing and I wish we could of stayed longer. The hotel had lovely bars and restaurants and I will return to try them next time.",5,2020,02,07
124,Best service in London! ,"We stayed at the hotel for a total of four nights in a suite at the Kimpton Fitzroy and could not fault a thing! 
From the arrival it was welcome with open arms from the doormen and bellboys. We were helped to our room by Harry and he told us if we want to go somewhere the concierge team will be able to sort it, and he wasn't wrong! Conor and his concierge team were so helpful everyday with getting us into places but not needed as the hotel is full of venues.. ! From the lovely coffee house burr and co with George and Jake to the elegant Fitz's with maneece always remembering us. We have never felt so important whilst staying at a hotel the staff really made us feel like we were part of their family and for that reason alone, we cannot wait to come back!!

124,Kimpton Fitzroy Hotel London,This hotel is stunning and in a good location. The outside architecture is beautiful as well as the inside lobby. My room was a single and somewhat small but I was very pleased with how current and modern the fixtures were. The bed and pillows were very comfortable.  I booked mine on hotels.com and got a great price.,5,2020,02,02
124,Beautiful Hotel,"A great stay in the center of London.  Close to Russell Square Tube Station.   The hotel is beautiful, the rooms are clean and comfortable... and also quiet.  A must stay.   I arrived super early from a flight from the US which had me at the hotel at 9am.   Check in is not until 3pm but reception gave me a small room to take a shower and a nap before I was able to check into my actual room for the week.    My clients were also staying at the hotel and the restaurant and bar were a great place to entertain them.   We also booked the hotel and their meeting space for a future meeting later in the year.",5,2020,02,01
124,Good but not great,"Stayed here for a romantic weekend. Overall I enjoyed it but for the price I expect to be super perfect and it wasn’t 

The good
The hotel looks great
Rooms are reasonably furnished 
Lovely interiors
Locations great
Staff very helpful

The bad
Shower was dire. Like a dribble once I’d worked out how to use it
The room looked like it needed a bit of TLC
Prices expensive
Breakfast offering feeble on buffet and hot food was average
Found some money handed it to a doorman and then he shut the door in our face later!

I liked this hotel but wasn’t overwhelmed. But worth a stay",4,2020,02,01
124,just WOW!,"We stayed here for our first time in London. The location is just near the metro station and the neighborhood is one of the best. The hotel itself is impressive. The staff was very kind and exceded all our needs. We had one bedroom suite that was amazing.
Kimpton Fitzroy will be our first choice ever in London!",5,2020,01,31
124,amazing hotel- great location,"I stayed here for the first time and it certainly wont be the last. 
It is right next to Russel square tube station, and a perfect location to get to everywhere. 
the Hotel itself is grand and the service was 5 star. 
the breakfast was amazing and the bars had a great atmosphere. 
in Summary just a great stay",5,2020,01,30
124,Fabulous caring hotel,"We stayed here for two nights at the end of Nov 2019 and I cannot praise this hotel highly enough. They were so kind and considerate and the hotel was glorious and perfectly located about 5-10 minutes walk through Russell Square to the British Museum. 

My husband is not well and I rang this hotel to ask if we could go to our room right away after arriving early morning at Heathrow from a hellish 27 hour flight from Australia. Not only did they accommodate us right away, the kind staff upgraded us from the cheapest, smallest room to a stunning suite! I cannot thank you enough for this. You made our brief stay in London beautiful and memorable. We met our friend and were able to have tea with him in our suite. The views over Russell Square were wonderful, the rooms exquisite, the bathroom with heated floors big enough to be an apartment.

The staff were incredibly helpful. I cannot say enough good things about this gorgeous unique hotel and would stay there again in a heartbeat. I hope we get the chance. Thanks for a memorable stay, Kimpton Fitzroy.",5,2020,01,29
124,Stunning hotel,"I recently spent 3 nights at this hotel in search of a place for hosting a corporate event this spring. I was so impressed by the gorgeous architecture, wonderful service and friendly atmosphere, I booked it over the four season. Quite honestly, the price is well worth it at this amazing venue. If you are looking for a ballroom that will really set your event apart...this is the one. My only complaint is the size of the rooms and lack of space for makeup etc in the bathroom. However, the bar, restaurants, and even the hallways make up for this short coming. Breakfast is great with a buffet plus ala carte...avocado toast is amazing. If you stay definitely have a drink in the bar one night and check out the palm court. Also, it is a 3 minute walk from Russell square station which is on a direct line to Heathrow. Does it get better? Yes it does, the Russell square station has massive elevators due to no escalators...perfect for hauling luggage. Cannot wait to be back this Spring and show off this place to our colleagues!",5,2020,01,27
124,A pleasure to stay,"Had big expectations and was not disappointed .
From the moment you step in it welcomes you. The ambiance, the staff, the room, the bar.... all great! 
Standard room is not really big but ok. Bed is comfortable. Shower pressure could be better .
Enjoyed our stay here.",5,2020,01,26
124,Bit too flash and not even beneath the surface,"Stayed for a week at a cost of a grand. Was offered to register for an e-upgrade at £36 a night which I registered for. Asked for an e-upgrade to a larger room at reception (having waited 8 minutes to be checked in because someone was buying something that was on display but not in stock) but was told there was nothing recorded on the system when I checked in. Same with the pillow request - asked for feather/down on the  booking confirmation where they invite requests but when I got there the room had foam pillows. Asked if they could change it and nothing happened. The room I had was a double but it was ridiculously small. The table was the size of £2 coin or it might well have been with the coffee maker and tuck box on it meaning you couldn’t really work on it. The mini bar - with free water and milk: wow! Continental breakfast in the room (coffee, weetabix and a piece of toast) was crazy priced at £25. 

Nice looking place on the outside and in the public areas but it is headed down market straight after opening from my experience and it needs a bit of a wake up and some customer focus. The front door is electric but the second internal door isn’t. There is a doorman there to open it but on three out of five days he was talking to guests in the lobby. I don’t normally need a hand opening the door but they are massive and very heavy and I have a shoulder injury which made the job harder. It’s all very well standing there smiling whilst guests struggle - try and focus on what they want. It’s either another electric door or someone to open it. I won’t be going back.",3,2020,01,22
124,Amazing place to stay in London!,"This is one of the best places to stay in London.  It is right at the Russel Square tube station, across from Russel Park.  The staff were the friendliest.  Service was impeccable and the the rooms beautifully decorated and clean.  Amazing!  I would stay here again in a heartbeat.",5,2020,01,22
124,Not sure,This hotel is certainly housed in a beautiful building but the hotel doesn’t live up to its surroundings! I think it is run on more of a business premier inn style rather than a more high end London hotel! The staff are all good however there is just a slight air of budget hotel! It is certainly good for business conferences and has loads of rooms! The menu at dinner in the Neptune restaurant is limited and the food isn’t great! Breakfast was buffet or a la carte! The buffet was unimpressive! Full English breakfast was ok apart from a hard over cooked sausage! Eggs Benedict came out cold on two occasions! All in all ok but expensive for a run of the mill hotel!,3,2020,01,22
124,So Expensive and So NOT WORTH IT,I have stayed here twice now. The rooms are no better than a Best Western in the US. Neither of my rooms looked anything like those found on the web. If you are the kind of person who likes a beautiful exterior and lobby you may like it. I like service and a nice room and there are way better options in London for 1/3 the price. This place is not a worthy splurge like I thought it would be.,1,2020,01,19
124,Weekend Away,"We stayed here for one night in a King Suite. Firstly the building is absolutely lovely, it is nice to stay in a hotel with character and charm, something the new builds lack. Our greeting on arrival was very non descript, very little. there was no skimmed available. When I went to breakfast, it was available. Would it have been that difficult to get a jug, pour some in and deliver it to the room.
A piece of English heritage. ",4,2020,01,19
124,Is this a hotel or a nightclub?,"Plusses:  room was very nice, bathroom great, bed very comfortable, staff friendly.
Negatives:  there was some type of conference going on and this included a party every night I was here with loud booming bass until 1am, making it difficult to sleep.  Not cool.",3,2020,01,18
124,If you appreciate Excellence.........,"This was our first time to stay at a Kimpton. We are fans! Our 2 week experience memorable for the courtesy and thoughtfulness of the staff. Anh-Viet in Neptune Restaurant and Jenny in Burr and Co always made our day. Amrith in Reservations also very helpful.The elegance of the hotel is one benefit as is the location. We would return each day, happy to be in the tranquil location of Russell Square. Brilliant...",5,2020,01,18
124,Stunning!,"We stayed at this beautiful hotel as it was very local to our work Christmas party and from the minute we arrived to when we left we couldn't fault it.  The decor is absolutely stunning, staff professional but friendly and just everything was perfect.  We particularly enjoyed the social hour in the bar with complimentary wine and the breakfast was excellent.  I am already hoping our Christmas party is in the same location next year so we can come again to stay in this fabulous hotel!",5,2020,01,18
124,WOW,"Amazing 1 night stay in a beautiful hotel. Great location and extremely helpful, friendly and accommodating staff all round. A special mention to Melanie and the front desk very bubbly, nice lady who made sure we had everything we needed for ourselves and our baby. Would highly recommend!!",5,2020,01,18
124,Worst experience ever,"I’m a senior executive in a global company... and this was one of the worst experiences I’ve ever had. The company hosting a conference was clearly more important than their guests... and I honestly thought I was staying above a nightclub. The music from below was so loud it was literally vibrating the pictures on the wall of my room... and when I complained I was told not to worry... it would stop by 1AM! 1AM?!?!?!!

Never returning and will discourage others. Back to the Rosrwood for me.",1,2020,01,17
124,"A special, beautifully restored hotel with real attention to detail and a great staff","This newly-restored 1898 hotel is a real jewel on so many levels. The terra-cotta exterior is lit by hundreds of small spotlights that highlight this beauty at night.The staff is very attentive, friendly and genuinely anxious to please. A staff member noticed us looking at the tile lobby staircase. She gladly offered up the history and details of the restoration of this grand room.
Our 4th floor junior suite was excellent on all counts. Credit the designers and architects for really understanding what a great luxury hotel room can provide. This room is a pleasure to wake up to and return to each afternoon. Everything is just right in this spacious beauty overlooking the park. The colors and textures are very soothing and the king 4 post bed soft and restful. Some additional highlights:  a. generous closet and dressers for ample winter travel storages.  b.  large vintage design soaking tub with plenty of hot water.  c.  heated tile bathroom floor and heated towel racks. d. obscure glass shower enclosure with amazing rainfall and classic fixtures with easy to understand water volume and temp controls. So, high marks, for attention to detail. 
There are several good restaurants very close by and the park gives plenty of breathing room for a short stroll. The underground station is no more than 2 minute walk from the front door! One train to the airport! We did not try the full-service restaurant or lounge, so have no comments on it. Yes, we hope to stay here again. Laurence.
",5,2020,01,16
124,Excellent Staff,"This is the second visit I have made to this hotel as I was made to feel so comfortable and welcome as a single traveller on my first trip. The staff are very friendly and professional at the same time. The rooms very cozy and comfortable. The public areas are spacious and my favourite is The Palm Court, an oasis in busy city providing comfort and tranquility. Ab Alraheem welcomed us and amazingly remembered me from my previous visit. The staff like George, Pedro and Jonathan make you feel like an important guest and all staff we engaged with were interested in our day and what museums and exhibitions we visited. This is a 5 star hotel but unstuffy. The food In Neptune Restaurant is recommended. We will return as it is now our go to hotel in London.",5,2020,01,15
124,A very nice hotel in a magnificent building,"I booked a very last minute interesting package on British airways for flight + 1 night in this hotel for a London week end dedicated to enjoy several major exhibitions. Perfectly located just behind the British Museum in a grandiose 19th century building, this hotel offers all the amenities of a luxury hotel. The room for one person is small but very well and beautifully arranged with a decent-size and nice bathroom.
Nothing to fault. Thanks to the package mentionned above, it was an excellent deal and experience",5,2020,01,15
124,3 Star trying to pretend to be 5 Star,"Just spent 10 days at this ""5 Star"" IHC hotel - usually stay at the Hyde Park location, but decided to try the Fitzroy.  I had just come from staying at a Four Seasons hotel so had a good baseline to compare.  Overall:  This is a 3 Star hotel trying to pretend to be a 5 Star Hotel - 
Property:  Beautiful building - great location
Customer Service:  Unfortunately, the emphasis seems to be on how the staff looks (appearance), rather than their actual ability to provide 5 Star service.  From room service, wait staff, front desk there were clear need for training.  I had several meals from room service - from the person who took the orders (wasn't aware of what they actually served), to the person who delivered it (never verified what was ordered was actually delivered - at one point, even my main entree was missing), to the housekeeping staff who left used utensils in the room for 2 days, and never bothered to replace coffee mugs until I asked - to the wait staff who left their shift without telling me, to the waiter who brought incorrect drinks - their lack of ability to provide exceptional service, much less even competent service indicates no awareness of what 5 Star service (and what you pay for) should provide.  Take your business elsewhere if you are looking for a 5 star hotel - there are many others in London",3,2020,01,14
124,Superb,"Stayed at the Kimpton over the weekend of 13th December. I used my IHG reward points to book a special birthday treat for my oh, we had a fabulous time and the hotel was just perfect. Staff are a credit and look to make the stay as perfect as possible. Would highly recommend if you are looking for a bit of luxury in London.",5,2020,01,12
124,Still waiting on Incidentals Deposit to be returned ,"Beautiful hotel and lovely staff and enjoyed our stay. 
However I am still waiting for the £100 incidentals deposit to be returned to be debit card. I called and was informed it was manually refunded 21 days ago ( they said it should have taken 3 days to reach my account)  - still no refund received. My bank has said the £100 was charged and claimed by Kimpton and no refund has been issued! ",1,2020,01,10
124,Neptune - excellent dining with attentive staff,"I visited the Neptune Restaurant at the Kimpton - following a very nice pint of Camden Ale in Burr's bar that has a lively atmosphere and a great selection of Spirits and Ales.  I was served by a very friendly barman - Jakey - who was a local Londoner and able to tell me lots about the area.
My meal of cured meats, followed by steak was served by Jon and Adam, both of whom were very informative about the food.  The sommelier, Sampi, gave me a selection of wines to complement each of the courses and and he was a delight to discuss wine with.  
The food itself was perfectly served, and the rib eye steak was cooked to perfection. 
I can wholeheartedly recommend Neptune, - great food, great location, beautiful building, but the staff absolutely make this hotel, they are wonderful and provide the best service.",5,2020,01,09
124,Post Christmas weekend away.,"We stayed in the hotel,post Christmas. From the moment we reached the hotel ( Russell Square tube station is around the corner) we were welcomed by the front door personnel. Check in was easy and our rooms although on the smaller side, they were beautifully furnished and had everything we needed. I loved the toiletries , proper sized bottles which were very luxurious. We did not eat in the hotel, but did use Palm Court, one of the bars and the cafe. The concierges were so helpful and recommended local restaurants. It is so convenient for getting around London and then coming back to the hotel which was very relaxing. Thank you to Rueben from guest relations who organising a delcious chocolate glazed birthday cake for my son whose birthday had been earlier in the week.",5,2020,01,08
124,For trip,Kimpton Fitzory have good services. Beautiful location to stay in London. Impressive interior design of room. Room service was very friendly by staff. Really enjoy to stay with them. Provide all facailities. Beautiful view and near to Museum. We did'nt feel any convineance there. ,5,2020,01,08
124,beautiful refurbished old hotel,"We stayed here 3 nights during our last London stay due to its proximity to the British Museum.  Service was friendly and attentive.  
Beautiful building and beautiful room (we stayed on 2nd floor facing front which had lovely large balconies overlooking Russell Square; we didn't ask specifically for such a room but felt lucky to have it).  Bed was very comfortable.  Complementary gormet popcorn and small chocolate bar.
They offered free wine with an evening ""social"" at the Neptune Restaurant.  We were able to combine the free wine with a good meal at the restaurant.
British Museum within walking distance across Russell Square, a lovely  place.",5,2020,01,03
124,London birthday celebration,"We were in London to celebrate my son's 15th birthday and used my husbands IHG points to boo k this hotel. This is a superbly located hotel close to Russell Square tube station and lots of interesting local restaurants. It is beautifully furnished  inside and although the standard rooms are not huge, they still feel opulant and have every item availble for an enjoyable stay. The fresh milk and water in the fridge are an added bonus for hot or cold drinks and the toiletries smell so nice. The social hour in Palm Court is a lovely touch, after a hectic day rushing around busy tourist sites we really appreicated the rest and relaxation. All of the staff from the door throughout the whole hotel are exceptional and really made us welcome. I would love to stay at this hotel again.",5,2020,01,03
124,excellent stay,"This review is long overdue.  We stayed at the Kimpton Fitzroy in September and the stay was fabulous.  The staff and service they provided was excellent.  I understand that the hotel recently was renovated and it shows well.  Our room was a bit small, but well appointed.  The hotel is centrally located.  The only downside was that our stay was too short and we had to leave.  I would definitely stay in this hotel the next time we're in London.",5,2020,01,02
124,Beautiful building. Not worth the value,"Spent 2 nights. Arrived after 1600 pm . No parking for cabs outside hotel . Had to walk around the hotel with luggage . No doorman (hadnt seen one the 2 days there) to help with luggage when reaching the entrance. 
Room Was still not avavilable (claimed i asked for high floor away from elevator and since ""that room"" was a late checkout I had to wait. - however, was treated to complimentary drinks in the garden lounge. 
Room is very small with not enough room for luggage for 2 people. The bathroom was small and nicely decorated however- was lacking place to hang clothes or put down personal  toiletries  and the water pressure was lacking in addition to water running out through shower door. 
Throughout the whole stay the previous occupants name appeared on TV, despite mentioning this to the front desk upon entering the room. 
Were woken up  at 8 am with knock on door by room service wondering when they can clean the room. The cleaning cart was left outside our room the entire stay. 
The plus- 
Great bar ""Fitz"" . 
Lily, the receptionist at arrival was very friendly. 
Minus- room size
No doorman
Overcharged price for breakfast
Lacking personal touch and attitude. 
My first 2 days in London I spent in 5 star hotel down the block, so I have perspective. Bottom line- not worth the price",3,2019,12,31
124,"Beautiful place, perfect location, poor service","This is a beautiful hotel with a lot of potential, but it has too many flaws in the level of their services: first of all, it took a lot of time to check in, even if we were the only guests at the reception upon arrival. When we arrived at our room, our key did not work...we lost 15 minutes again, because of the slow service of re-uploading the keys.
Service at breakfast ( cafe) was even worse: the 2 young women really did not have a clue in every way possible...normally, i am very tolerant but they really hit all my buttons of frustration. On top of it all, my cappuccino was not hot at all so breakfast was an overall disappointing and stressfull experience. We left very quick too find a hot coffee around the corner. 

I say this in the most friendly and helpful way: but please Kimpton Fitzroy London, reeducate your staff and manage your managers. Their friendliness is nice, but definitely not enough...

Ps: had some nice food & cocktails in the bar, with a great blues band. 

",3,2019,12,22
124,Terrible house keeping,"Stayed there for 7 night over my recent business trip to London. The location was quite convenient. They have a very nice gym and the staff in breakfast and dinner restaurant were very helpful and friendly

To me , the hardware of this hotel was about the 5-star level but the software is definitely not up for the 5-star level especially on the house keeping side. I stayed two rooms over my stay and found some very long hairs in both room while I am only having a very short haircut. The bedsheet in my 2nd room was not very clean as well and couple of black stains on it. I showed the pic to the reception staff as well. Over my 7-night stay, there were only two proper turn down service delivered. I requested the late check until 4pm and  put on the DND sign  however housekeeping staff just opened the door and come in saying that they did not realised that I have obtained the late check out.

So not sure whether I am going to stay there again.",3,2019,12,19
124,3 star breakfast in a 5 star Hotel,"We have enjoyed our stay in this magnificent Hotel. Wonderful staff, nice rooms, great location but breakfast was a great disappointment. We would have expected a more lavish breakfast buffet in such a majestic hotel. The variety was poor, many London luxury hotels provided better breakfast spread with much  better variety. Burr & Co was a rather strange coffee  shop,,twice we wanted to have breakfast there at 10.30 in the morning  because breakfast was over at their main restaurant and they were out of Danish or Croissants.They had blankets provided for  the customers on the chairs,It was freezing cold in there like an al fresco restaurant.
The bathroom was nice but they have a design problem concerning the shower, every time we had a shower the bathroom floor was flooding.
The hotel only has European plug sockets in the bathrooms,if you do not have an adaptor you will have to charge your phone or pc at the bathroom or ask for one at the reception..We looked around and could not find an adaptor in the room, strange for a luxury hotel.
The bed and the pillows were super comfortable.
The housekeeping did a terrific job, probably the best housekeeping 
service we have encountered at a London Hotel.
The tv was ok,no Netflix or Sky Channels,just regular free to air channels.
Location of the hotel is very convenient for Metro.There is Russell Square Underground staion just behind the hotel.",4,2019,12,19
124,Avoid Room 620,"We booked 2 rooms and were looking forward to our stay as we had heard good reviews. One couple (our relative) checked in earlier than us. The room we had was unbelievably small in comparison and we paid the same price and booked at the same time. The layout is so terrible with restrictive spaces and when you open the door to get into the room, you cannot even move inside without shutting the door first. There is no room at all to move around or to put luggage bags. We had to bring our luggage into the bathroom to unpack. This must be the worst 5 star hotel layout that i have ever ever seen. Our relative had a better room and therefore based on that, i believe that we had been shortchanged. We requested to be changed to another room but they said they had full occupancy. What a terrible disappointment especially when we had to endure 4 nights. Location is good though.",2,2019,12,19
124,Beautiful building and decor in great location,"This is a beautiful building which has been elegantly designed/restored to contrast old with new with great features throughout. Great location just round the corner from Russell Square tube station...lots of local shops/eateries. Breakfast and breakfast room good with best staff I experienced in the hotel ..super attentive and efficient. .....Concierge and staff were also good. Rooms are not particularly large and soundproofing not great ..I heard couple next door arguing for  half of night as if they were in my room, but still did not detract from an overall enjoyable stay. Would book again.",4,2019,12,18
124,Lovely hotel,"Great staff especially Ruben on check in.  Nice clean room with comfortable bed.  Bottles of water and snacks provided in room.  Disappointed when using Fitz's, having chosen the Colonnade cocktail at £17 I was presented with a champagne flute half full of liquid!  This does not seem to be a reasonable price for half a glass of cocktail meant to contain the following – East London Liquor Company Vodka – Hackney Wild – Becherovka – Golden Raisin – Champagne.  The hotel is worth a visit.",4,2019,12,18
124,A London hotel like no other!,"Magnificent building! My room was big enough with large bathroom and bathtub. I think  KFitzroy has the most comfortable pillows and beds i ever had  in a hotel! I loved the large Smart TV in the room and the high quality of bathroom amenities always provided  by Kimpton hotels. Also, there are plug sockets and usb charging ports available next to the bed which enables you work while in bed. A powerful Remington hairdryer available in room!

Gym was top and much needed. Nespresso in room with complimentary coffee capsules as well.
Had dinner at Neptune twice, which i found it exeptional, although you need to extend the vegetarian opions on the menu.. Chef was always happy to prepare vegetarian dishes, but it is much easier if more variety of vegetarian dishes already on the menu!
Didn't get the chance to visit Fitz Bar which i now regret!

I highly recommend Kimpton Fitzroy London and can't wait to be back!",5,2019,12,18
124,Recent visit,"Having to travel to London from Wales for various conferences can be dull but quite by chance I found this hotel and called in for coffee
I have spoken to the concierge team on more recent visits and have been so impressed with Nathan and Ryan
Their help and making sure I had everything I needed has encouraged me to recommend this hotel to friends, family and business contacts
Well done! 
Diolch yn fawr!

124,Beautiful hotel and helpful staff!!,"Visited London last week for some sightseeing and Christmas shopping. On recommendation, I popped in for a few cocktails at Fitz’s bar, which were lovely. The hotel looks stunning too. Mostly I just wanted to point out how impressed I was with the concierge service, in particular Ryan, who couldn’t have done enough for me. Once I told him why I was in London, he gave me tonnes of suggestions of places to visit and eat, and couldn’t have been happier to do so. It’s service like this that really makes a hotel stand out, and I’d heavily recommend visiting if you’re ever in London.",5,2019,12,16
124,Gorgeous hotel!,"Stunning hotel, as soon as you walk in its pure luxury and the Christmas decors are next level. Reception staff on check in were extremely friendly and very accommodating. All the staff we came into contact with were polite and helpful. We had drinks in the Fitz bar which was a lovely setting and also took advantage of the ""happy hour"" as we were ihg club members. 
The rooms are cosy yet a very high standard. Beds extremely comfy. Would 100% return to the hotel. We didn't eat breakfast as we were on room only rate.",5,2019,12,15
124,Gorgeous hotel! Comfy beds!,"We had a fabulous week-long stay at this newly refurbished, sparkling hotel. An amazing remodel...the colors, the tile work...wow! This hotel has excellent service, knowledgeable and accommodating staff. The included breakfast at Neptune is tasty and fresh.  The staff are courteous and know your usual breakfast by day two. This was a great location for restaurants, parks, sightseeing and business. The transportation options, both tube connections and grabbing a classic black cab, are very convenient here.  Highly recommend a stay at the Kimpton Fitzroy.  I do have IHG status and that was honored despite some previous reviews mentioning that they weren’t sufficiently recognized.  They are new to IHG, but are now on fully board. This was my first London stay here, instead of the Intercontinental Park Lane. Would definitely choose it again!",5,2019,12,14
124,Check In disaster,"Just arrived.  3 hours after we were allocated room 502 we still have no key.  Turns out it has a ‘plumbing’ problem.  Went to the cafe in the hotel to get a drink.  Really quiet, ordered drink......turned up 15 minutes later.....server forgot we ordered it!!  This is not going well....and we have another 24 hours here.  Shocked by the service, really, really poor",1,2019,12,14
124,Incredible hotel in London,"For our first trip to London, we could not be happier with our choice to stay at the Kimpton Fitzroy. From the moment you walk in, the lobby is grand and inviting while also being very warm and cozy, with all different nooks to discover. The concierge staff is exceptionally friendly and accommodating, specifically when we were displeased with our original room and they went out of their way to move us to a room that better suited our expectations. Both restaurants are absolutely delicious and the bar has an amazing vibe to end the night with. Plus, the location can't be beat. This will be our go to hotel whenever we find ourselves in London, and can't wait to get back.",5,2019,12,13
124,"3 days, 2 nights, too short a visit.","Epitome of English luxury hotel: Spectacular architecture, excellent location for walking to West End theatre, British Museum, etc., Young, intelligent, helpful staff (no stuffy English butlers) and perfectly appointed rooms. Good balance of traditional elegance and modern vibe, like London itself.",5,2019,12,09
124,Often stay at this hotel and love to frequent their cafe.,Hello my name is Dmitry Chuguevskiy and i often frequent the hotel. Very nice hotel with pleasant staff and good service. Notably want to mention Tony. Tony always serves me very well as one of their cafes in the hotel. Now he has been moved to be the doorman and is as pleasant as always when i come to the hotel.,5,2019,12,09
124,Exceptional Stay,"Top tier hotel standards and consistency are generally very high, but once in a while I have an experience that is beyond excellent. My recent stay at the Kimpton Fitzroy was just one of those stays. 
The service was routinely ideal from all areas of the hotel: front desk, concierge, restaurant, housekeeping, and phone operators.
The hotel, a beautiful historic building, occupies a full block of Bloomsbury, right on Russell Square, one easy block from the Russell Square Tube stop (Piccadilly Line). The hotel has beautiful rooms, renovated in 2018 to the highest of standards. The rooms range from tiny 120 sf single bed city rooms to 360 sf rooms with two beds. The hotel also offers spacious suites. The bathrooms have been updated with completely luxurious and functional fixtures. Getting to the rooms is a luxury in itself in the hotel's wide hallways decorated in understated greys.
The rooms' exterior windows are historically styled double hung windows, which I assume is required for historic preservation purposes. They are handsome, especially from the outside. Inside the traditional windows are a second set of sliding windows. The double windows insulate the rooms to such a degree that the rooms are extraordinarily quiet, and one would never think they were in central London.
The location is in a very vibrant part of London, close to many university and college campuses as well as only a few blocks from the must-visit British Museum.
The hotel offers a casual coffee shop filled with uni students, a solid restaurant in a lovely, double height dining room reputed to be patterned after the Titanic's dining room, and a wood-lined power bar with energy to spare.
I look forward to returning to the Kimpton Fitzroy. It is simply fabulous.",5,2019,12,07
124,Faultless!,"What an amazing place to stay. A beautiful grade 2 listed building with a completely elegant interior. The room by comparison was quite modern and spotlessly clean. Housekeeping was by far the best we have known. Our room was cleaned and bed made as soon as we went for breakfast! The staff are so friendly and happy to help with anything that you may need. Fitz’s bar is definitely worth a visit! A lovely intimate little place full of character and occasional  live music. Breakfast was delicious, hot and very efficiently served. Nothing here could be faulted and we have stayed in many Hotels! We will definitely return.",5,2019,12,07
124,Fabulous building and service,"Fascinating old architecture. The interior design completes it giving the comfort we like to have. Entrance of a rare beauty. Hotel with multiple social spaces to use as needed. Very efficient staff. Metro next to hotel (50 meters); which adds even more positive value to this hotel. The kindness and professionalism of the duty manager (Ruben Sosa) were essential for the immediate resolution of a special and complex request.
Not an hotel. Fitzroy is THE hotel.",4,2019,12,06
124,Memorable experience,"I originally chose the hotel for its closeness to the British Museum, but I learned that the hotel was a historic building when I arrived. 
Although built over a century ago, the inside seems completely renovated - and in a tasteful way with a touch of historic memory. The ambience of the hotel from the moment of entry was great. 

I stayed in the King Suite, which was very spacious considering the location of the property. The amenities were also very nice, and I especially loved the master bathroom, which had a beautiful, old-school tub, which is shielded by wooden blinds.

The staff at the front dest, Abd Alraheem was very helpful for meeting my requests. Polite and efficient.",5,2019,12,04
124,Outstanding hotel,"Great stay for four nights in October on business.  Across the street from Russell Square and the Underground.  Super quiet, clean and efficient room.  Front desk staff is outstanding even in the midst of early am flight check-ins/outs.  Multiple restaurants on premises varying from coffee to breakfast to the seafood option.  Short to no wait for taxi service.  125 pounds for car service transfer to/from LHR. Restaurants in the immediate (5 minute walk) are limited, however expanding the walk to 10-15 minutes minutes opens whole array of restaurants.  Rooms facing Russell Square have the best views.  Unless a siren, no discernible road noise as the rooms have double/triple pane glass.  Take the stairway - it is beautiful.  The elevators are set to the floor traffic so check which elevator you are on when it arrives.",5,2019,12,02
124,"Quiet, comfortable, great service & location ","I love this place and will certainly stay here again on our next London visit 😍
They have the service and amenities expected from a 5-star hotel.
There's a Picadilly line tube station just around the corner, so the theatre district is only a few stops away.
There's a large number of restaurants in the area offering anything you might be craving.
Our room was facing the inner area and not facing the street, so we slept without being awoken by city noise.
We'll definitely come back when we visit London again 👍",5,2019,12,02
124,Beautiful Hotel,"Stunning Hotel! excellent location.
Close to everything, Staff is wonderful.
Very clean, large and updated room.
My only suggestion is to put safety bars in the bath tub nothing to hold on to while getting in and out.
Louis in concierge is the best!
They have a coffee shop/ restaurant and two bars, prices not to bad.

124,A Special Trip Made Special,"My wife and I stayed here while visiting London for our anniversary. The hotel is absolutely stunning. The location was great, close to everything but not so close that you are overwhelmed by tourists. Ana at the front desk was amazing, she took such great care of us and really made an impact. The lobby, hallways and our room were spotless. The bellman were great and super friendly, always ready to jump in and help or grab a cab. The drinks in Fritz were really good and there's live music on the back half of the week. This place is posh and an absolute must visit.",5,2019,11,26
124,Pretty hard to fault this place,"Well they mucked up my room  number when I arrived but after that everything was top class. The coffee place and restaurants were fine and service was always available. Bed comfortable, room large and bathroom clean. No problems at all. Boy, do you pay for this level of service however!",5,2019,11,25
124,"Stunning hotel, great location, not quite 5* service","We stayed here for one night over a weekend and had a great time. There is a coffee shop which is lovely within the hotel, a beautiful bar and tea room with trees, a roaring fire and lots of twinkling lights. We had breakfast in the Neptune which is a remake of the Titanic's restaurant, we also had complementary drinks there on Saturday evening before going out which was a nice touch. The stairwell is just beautiful and make sure to give Lucky George, the brass dragon (on the second floor I think it was) - a lucky rub.. Our room was lovely, overlooking the park, on the smaller side but decor was nice. Full length mirror in the wardrobe. The bed was very comfortable and had a great sleep. Tube station just over the road, coffee shops also. Breakfast was ok, it had most of the normal buffet options. My husband had a full breakfast from the menu which was very underwhelming. Very small portion for a cooked breakfast and the price. They have a bike or 2 to use in reception which was a good touch. The door staff were the worst we’ve had in a 5* unfortunately, no one opening doors for you or carrying luggage up the entrance stairs. Despite that, I would stay here again as it was beautiful. ",4,2019,11,25
124,Maybe not the best for travelers with many stuffs,"My second stay at the hotel.
The hotel is beautiful and the location great but there were a couple of things that I found to be lacking compared to the previous stay.
As soon as I checked into the room, I needed to request a luggage rack (the room does not have enough storage space) and request a fix for the bathroom sink as it wasn't draining well.
As also just noted above, the room does not have enough space to store clothes etc. I travel with just one carry-on luggage but still found the room to have not enough space.
The closet inside the room also holds fridge, etc., which makes it impossible to hang longer jackets and coats inside it. 
",4,2019,11,24
124,What a wonderful experience,"So. I stay in a little t of hotels across the world and rarely do I find one that makes me feel truly at home. But this one did
For a start it’s a beautiful hotel.. old yet modernised - it’s a perfect mix of new with the old fashioned values of yesteryear. 
The room was small, but not basic. Everything was plush and beautiful. I was on my own, so it didn’t worry me, yet if I was sharing with hubby the bed would be cramped ( after all, I’m used to a super king ) but. The bed was so comfy, and the linen so soft. A great nights sleep was in store. It’s so quiet. Even though they have live music - you know it won’t go on past 12, so no banging on doors at 4 in the morning!  ( yes I’ve had that!) 
The bathroom was also small, but, having said that it was beautiful. Great shower, great products ( which were in refillable bottles), and an offer that if you need anything it would appear. 
In the room was a pod type coffee machine- I didn’t get a coffee as there was no directions- who knew you had to hold both buttons then pick one button- someone who owned the same type of coffee machine- that’s who!  I don’t so didn’t get a coffee. 
Free water in fridge. Free popcorn and chocolate ( and if you want more it’s£1 for each. Amazing and refreshing- all other hotels want to rip you off! 
The bars are great. Food is great. Breakfast is fab. And the coconut coffee is to die for. 
Thank you kimpton- Fitzroy. I love you!",5,2019,11,24
124,Nice hotel ,The building itself is pretty stunning and looks great from the street. The architecture is pretty stunning and it’s enjoyable to walk around. The hotel looks very old and you can imagine the people that have there.  It’s very classy.  ,4,2019,11,16
124,Excellent hotel,"My husband and I stayed at the Kimpton Fitzroy last Saturday and throughly enjoyed our stay. Our room on the fifth floor was fabulous (539 I think) , large bathroom, comfortable bed with a small sitting area. It was great for our overnight stay, my husband did notice there was no desk if we were visiting for work purposes. We parked nearby and were given a discount code from the hotel for the car park when we prebooked  our space. It was a lovely touch having fresh milk in the fridge , plus 2 bottles of mineral water.
We enjoyed the social hour, then moved into Fitz’s for a couple of cocktails having met our son and his girlfriend. We ate out that evening but breakfast the following morning was great, plenty of choice and friendly service, although we did have to wait a short while to be seated. Next time we stay we will definitely try the restaurant.
Thanks to all the staff, so polite and friendly, it was a pleasure to stay in such a lovely hotel.",5,2019,11,15
124,wonderful location AMAZING PEOPLE!,"This review is a long time coming:
My first stay was happenstance in Feb 2019.  I met the lovely Claire Daly while I checked in - she ensured I was comfortable and accounted for and tried to get me into a room ASAP as I was quite early.  She hit it out of the park with the loveliest room with windows I could open.. it was perfect.  The lovely, DJ/ Jallow was kind enough to take me to my room and was a gem throughout my stay.  
Here's the amazing part:I ended up staying at another hotel on my next stay and (thankfully) back at the Kimpton the same time as Wimbledon, July 2019.  When I checked in.. Claire was there.. She immediately recognized me (!? how is that possible) and literally picked up where we left off... she gave me the most beautiful room and continued to check in on me through my stay.Claire is wonderful.  Hands down one of the best people I have come across in these settings.  Wonder of wonders:Jallow helped me with something at one point and also totally recognized me - such a lovely man, so warm and friendly.I wonder if he recognized me - or he is just this lovely to everyone. I imagine this is true for Claire too:They immediately made me feel AT HOME... in this large and beautiful hotel, they made it cozy, and made it feel like I mattered. I will never ever stay anywhere else other than the Kimpton on my travels to London - because I wouldnt risk staying anywhere that I couldn't see Claire or Jallow.Thank you!! Looking forward to seeing you in a couple of weeks :)

124,Wonderful Historic Property,"I had a wonderful stay at this historic property. I visited it for the first time. The team and outlets are outstanding. Cocktails at Fitz are delicious and the bartender knows his cocktails and history. I also had the pleasure of dinning at Neptune for two nights and the food was wonderful, also Omar over at the Palm Court restaurant was amazing. He gave us the full rundown on all of the hotels food options when we arrived. Room service was splendid and i had a lovely coffee from Burr & Co that came highly recommended by the locals. The location was my other favorite part. Just a short walk from the British museum, and the Piccadilly line. The rooms were very well appointed the decor and style is stunning. Not to mention the exterior of the building. It's majestic!",5,2019,11,11
124,Amazing hotel... Highly recommend,"Only good things to say about this beautiful hotel. Warm and friendly smile/welcome on arrival from Doni made us feel immediately at home. Our room was very clean, quiet and comfy.Fitz bar had good atmosphere and breakfast was excellent.  Catered for  my coeliac allergy with no problem ... With attentive, friendly service.  Domi checked us out.... Again met with a lovely smile.  Will definitely return.",5,2019,11,11
124,"A good hotel, should have been a great hotel.","There is a lot to like about the hotel. Great architecture, nice rooms, free mini bar in the higher level rooms, turn down service, great coffee bar, many restaurants. But it just lets itself down. Service is never quite right or great one day, out to lunch the next.
Right next door to Russell Square tube station (which has to be said is a pretty average station with lifts from train to street or a lot of steps), close the British Museum, one stop or a 15-20 min walk from Kings Cross, close enough to walk to Charing Cross etc. Would happily stay here again but would look at other places first.",4,2019,11,11
124,Beautiful hotel but very poor service for a 5*,"We spent 4 nights to celebrate my partners birthday at the Kimpton. The hotel is architecturally beautiful and an absolute gem in London. Our superior room was average and offered the usual amenities. What it lacked in my opinion is the five star service it should offer considering the price and being a five star hotel. 

We ordered room service one morning which was absolutely disappointing (cold bacon, tasteless avocado toast, a lukewarm coffee).
In one of the bathrobes we found a key-card of a previous guest (I guess they did not replace them with fresh ones).
When I asked for a newspaper they only could offer me a digital version (i don't see the fun and benefit of reading 4.7"" Screen).
The receptionist where all cold as ice (when I mentioned the bathrobe issue they only replied with ""strange"").
I asked for a small birthday cupcake or something from the hotel patisserie but what i got was Tesco cake slice from the supermarket across the street. 

So over all, yes it is a nice Hotel from an architectural point of view and fine if you just stay there for two nights. But every thing else is absolutely unprofessional and not worth the five stars or money.",4,2019,11,08
124,Weekend Break,"We arrived by taxi from Kings Cross, about £8 in a taxi.  On arrival the front door staff took our luggage and offered to take it up to the room once we had checked in. The reception staff were extremely efficient and so helpful. My daughter had her newborn baby and asked if they had a sterilising unit for the bottles they did not have one available however the next day a brand new one was brought to the room honestly they could not do enough for us. We had a meal and a drinks the nice.  Hotel prices are what you would expect. The rooms were super clean, bedding, bed all of a good standard. Tea and coffee facilities with a kettle replenished every day with milk. Overall we stayed for 2 nights would recommend really quite central and near the tube.  Good experience for families and friends. ",5,2019,11,07
124,"Gorgeous, comfortable, and just darn cool!","We stayed only one night in London and we spent it here. Based on our experience, the comfort, and the service, it seems to me that Kimpton Fitzroy London should be the GOLD STANDARD to which all other hotels strive to achieve.
The room was quiet and roomy. The bed was just heaven. The bathroom was very nice. Everything was sparkling clean. 
We were celebrating our 25th anniversary in Europe and this was our first sleep in Europe. They sent up a sweet treat for our anniversary! So nice!
And I can't forget the story of 'George'. A statue of a dragon commissioned by the owner of the hotel back in the 1920's. He had 2 of them made. One of them is on the bottom of the sea in the Titanic. And the other one is on the premises of the hotel! You can rub his lil dragon head and get all the luck you can!
Amazing hotel. Amazing stay. Top notch!",5,2019,11,06
124,Perfect Hotel,I  came to London and I have to say that I'm very impressed with this luxury hotel. My room was amazing. Hotel is amazing. We had nice quick dinner and greatest oysters ever in Neptune. Really like to say thanks to Georgia and Adam for there best service. Regarding my visit I also like to say that Fitzz bar is one of the most beautiful bars ever. Alex give as best old fashioned I ever try. Thanks Alex. Thst was great start of Saturday evening. Really great hotel and we loved social hour.,5,2019,11,05
124,Bar and restaurant of dreams,"My partner and I are local to London, and we decided to come into the Kimpton Fitzroy last month to celebrate our anniversary. We were immediately struck by the splendor of the hotel: the view from the street is matched by the incredible entryway, with surfaces covered in marble, lush sofas, and cheerful staff.

We started with tea in the Palm Court, which was chocolate themed (and wildly delicious). Part of the reason we chose to come to the Fitzroy was to try Thibault's tea--we watched him win on Bake Off The Professionals, and we were beyond thrilled with this tea. Delicious sandwiches, scones with passionfruit curd, and chocolate desserts that blew us away! Melee greeted us warmly at the door and took care of us throughout our meal. We were seated right by the fireplace, which was the perfect way to relax into the afternoon. Both Umberto and Sasha came over to our table to speak with us and share their joy and spirit. The Fitzroy tea is such an incredible experience from start to finish, and we will undoubtedly be back.

We then moved to Fitz's for a few drinks, and we had another spectacular experience. It's tucked away near the staircase and we couldn't find it at first, but the helpful staff directed us there. Alex was an incredible host and made sure that we were well taken care of, and Imie makes a mean drink (or two, as it were). We spent a few hours enjoying the atmosphere: lush, sumptuous fabrics, excellent music, and a lively crowd. We don't normally go to hotel bars, but we were so happy we did. We will surely be back for both tea and another drink soon.",5,2019,11,05
124,Bad experience with third party Guest Reservations Service - not with the hotel,"I was deceived into using website that I believed to be that of the hotel as the URL comprised the hotel name followed by ""guest reservations""  I completed my booking for 2 nights at £274 a night but then found that I had paid £271 tax and services. I do not understand how this was slipped past me as I am very vigilant on line. Clearly the charge is extortionate. I have complained to the booking agent that the website led to. This did not strike me as odd as plant of hotels use agencies to handle their reservations. I do not expect any action however. 
I am posting this review prior to travel as I believe hotels should be alert to sites that use their name prominently and then rip off travellers. The Kimpton Fitzroy is currently not that easy to find online, I knew it as The Russell and spent some time tracking it down. This is what delivered me into the hands of scammers. This would be less of a risk if the hotel had web pages that indicated that the Fitzroy was the former Russell. Inevitably traveller experiences of being scammed by third parties in the apparent name of reputable businesses should be a cause of concern to them.
An additional warning is that the confirmation email has a cancellation box. If I had clicked this I would have got no refund of my £800 plus £600 cancellation fee! The response from Guest Reservations has been that the greater part of the payment is local tax - which of course is nonsense.",5,2019,11,04
124,Beautiful hotel and great service!,"I came to London to visit with my daughter who is studying abroad, and this was the perfect hotel. It was a 5 minute walk to her campus, and it turns out that every place I wanted to be this trip was on the Piccadilly line, just a block away. Staff was amazing, making sure every need was met. The rooms are both beautiful and comfortable. It was a luxurious stay without spending a ton of money. Plus, the mini bar is free (and replenished daily), and they have additional items that you can purchase at a very fair price.",5,2019,11,03
124,Beautiful looking hotel..with a few rough service edges,"First, let me stress what a good-looking property this is. The renovations have brought one tired old grand dame of the London hotel scene back to life.  It is now a very attractive hotel.This is without a doubt the best choice in the area now.  We don't usually stay in Bloomsbury, but as we regularly use Kimptons when in the US, and had two events to attend nearby,  it made sense to try it out.We had two rooms, one of which was upgraded as there was delay getting into our booked rooms. So points for that. Both were of a very high standard, stylish, quiet, comfortable, and with excellent amenities.  We'd come and stay again from that point of view. 

But...the food and service were not nearly as stylish as the rooms. Hotel service can be a bit of a lottery, but we absolutely did not experience the kind of personalised service noted by some other reviewers.  We were in and out of the hotel, but rarely saw a doorman and were never offered cab, umbrellas etc. We did not eat at Neptunes...but we did eat at Burr Brothers and the Palm Court.  Palm Court - less said the better. Limited menu - like a 24 hour room service menu - and very average food. We ate there because we had a gig to get to,(and this part of town is not overburdened with great options, although plenty of fast food chains around) but wait staff were erratic. My burger was basic to say the least. Burr Brothers was better but again suffered from erratic and offhand service. After watching the world cup final on Saturday morning, (eventually...the TV was not working - it required two phone calls to the front desk to get someone to come and reset it ) we were late for breakfast, not arriving till just before 11. We were firmly told hot  breakfast would not be available, but we could choose counter food which included one sad looking pastry and a few plastic pots of muesli, or wait ten minutes till they changed to a lunch menu. Having learnt our lesson we were on time on Sunday, for some watery scrambled eggs served with a side of bruised avocado. Had to hunt down someone to pay the bill.

So that's why this is just a four star review. We appreciated the service recovery... a room upgrade, free coffee when it was cold etc... but we'd really prefer that it was all right in the first place. And perhaps sort out one all day dining restaurant.Of course breakfast can't go on forever, but wild horses wouldn't have dragged us back to the Palm court, (although the  plastic muesli pot was not a lot better.) Having just stayed at an impeccably run hotel in Oxford, the style over substance here was noticeable.",4,2019,11,03
124,Still favourite hotel,"We’ve been fortunate to stay at the Kimpton Fitzroy several times since the soft opening when it was a Principal Hotel. This recent trip was lovely with a really spacious room on the 7th floor with great views towards the Eye, British Museum and the beautiful Russell Sq. Valter the Portuguese guy on the door recognises returning guests and as ever greeted us as old friends. He is an absolute asset to the team and full of genuine interest and information. We ended up with lots of hints and tips about visiting the Algarve!  The concierge organised us a fantastic seat at The Friend at Hand pub to watch the Rugby. This is such a lovely hotel we continue to find something better each time. It’s luxurious but not pretentious- and Valter is a star they need to hang onto! ",5,2019,11,03
124,Neptuns is outstanding!,"We enjoyed a wonderful birthday celebration at Neptuns. Terrific food and outstanding service! Special thanks to Adam, Samperio and Guilia for going the extra miles and more to make it a special evening! Thank you!",5,2019,11,02
124,Simply outstanding,"Fabulous hotel. The staff is so helpful. Five stars all the way. super location. Try the restaurant Neptune with Adam, Travis and Andrew taking care of you. Lovely people! Marvellous food and wine.
The Fitz's bar? Stayed there for hours. With Joyce and Stephanie taking care of you it's very easy to forget about the queue outside Madame Tussauds. 
This hotel is actually so good that I don't I will be leaving the premises next time around.
God save Fitzroy Kimpton (and the Queen)!",5,2019,11,02

124,Wonderful and elegant,"A true masterpiece in the heart of London. We stayed for 5 nights and every time we walked through the doors, the wow factor was there! Decorated in a way that compliments the past and heritage of the building in a unique way.

Check in was easy. The room was ready when I arrived at midday.
The room was on the first floor, which has a grand staircase and an area overlooking the lobby and features stained glass that feels original to the building. If it isn't, it is an excellent reproduction.

The room was comfortable, bigger than I expected in London and the bathroom was very nice. Great shower.

All in, I really enjoyed it.",5,2019,10,26

124,What every Kimpton should strive to be......,"Years ago when Kimpton first started out, it was known to be a great ""luxury-lite"" hotel with that ""funky"" vibe.  Over the years and even before the IHG acquisition, things started getting more corporate, less luxurious and more motel-like (see some of the ""Kimptons"" in California for example).  So it was great to see that this Kimpton (while still new), lived up to the old Kimpton ideals.

As almost everyone has stated, the building it is housed in is fantastic and the owners have done a terrific job with the renovations.  

Upon entering the building, I did have some confusion as where to go to check-in.  There appeared to be a doorman when I was going up the stairs but he neither opened the door for me no was around to tell me where to check-in as there were no signs as you enter (I initially thought you had to go upstairs but found that reception was to the left when you enter).  There are only 2 agents at reception so it can get busy/crowded at times.  However, once there the service was exceptional both at check-in and check-out.  The agent (Danielle?) was professional, friendly and immediately recognized my status and stay preferences.  She also walked me to the elevators and showed me that they have an on-demand system whereby you select your floor beforehand to be directed to the appropriate elevator (helps speed things up).

I was upgraded to a slightly larger King room and found it to be quite nicely done and a very good size (especially for London).  I'm not really fond of older buildings or hotels but the renovations done here were great with modern touches (such as the bathroom) that worked well with the historical factor.  You do get water and coffee in your room as well as a couple of snacks (popcorn in this case) all complimentary.  The room was clean and well kept and I even saw housekeeping cleaning a room late at night so you know they are hard at work.

The daily Happy Hour had (at least for me) a great selection of wines and beer (2 types of wine, 1 beer) and was held in the back restaurant area.  It felt a bit uncomfortable having it there though, since people were still at tables eating or ordering food and would have been nicer if there was a lounge or lobby area as in other Kimpton properties.  I did not eat at the hotel as I already had plans for the one night I was staying there, however, the Palm restaurant did look a great space to eat in.

For me, the highlight was the bar Fitz's.  It is quite dark inside and while busy, it never felt loud or busy.  The bar had plenty of seating when I visited (around 9 pm) and the inside has some eclectic decorations.  The best part was the bartender, a lovely woman with short-cropped blonde-dyed hair who provided friendly service and did wonders with not only making the drinks but asking the right questions to guide you into what drink she could make (and they were spectacular).  I rarely like hotel bars since they seem so corporate but this one was terrific and ranks up there with the Artisan at Langham as one of the best.",4,2019,10,24
124,Pleasant stay at Kimpton Fitzroy,"We were in London for a midweek break and stayed at the Kimpton Fitzroy. All the staff were very friendly and eager to help. The accommodation was generously proportioned with two double beds in the room and a large en-suite bathroom.
The hotel is in a great location on Russel Square with plenty of restaurants, bars, etc. nearby as well as places of interest (British Museum, Charles Dickens Museum) and is only a few minutes from Kings Cross Station by tube (Russell Square).
The only slight niggles with the hotel were that the shower taps were a bit fiddly and if you ordered poached egg on toast for breakfast you just got the poached egg on a plate and had to toast a slice of bread in the toaster on the breakfast bar!",4,2019,10,24
124,Kimpton Style in London,"My daughter and I had a fabulous stay at the Kimpton Fitzroy in London.  We stayed for three nights and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves.  The hotel is conveniently located a block away from the Tube station on the Picadilly line and across from Russell Square.  Were able to walk to the British Museum and the Tube took us directly to Heathrow.  The Fitzroy is a gorgeous 19th century building.  It is historic and imposing but also warm and welcoming with the typical cool Kimpton vibe.  We expected our room to be small and it was but somehow the clean decor and high ceilings made it feel more spacious than it was.  The bathroom had little shelf space but was beautiful, clean and had a wonderful waterfall shower.

The staff at the Fitzroy was friendly and helpful in navigating the city.  We enjoyed the nightly hosted social hour and had tea at the Palm Court one day.  Palm Court has many tables situated throughout a couple of large rooms and while the tea was traditional they played contemporary music and had just enough of a modern vibe to make it not stuffy or boring.  

I look forward to bringing my husband to London next time and staying at the Kimpton Fitzroy!",5,2019,10,24
124,Fine.  You won me back.,"Almost four years since I had stayed at a Kimpton.  My penultimate experience at the Surfcomber Hotel in Miami Beach had completely soured me on the Kimpton brand (despite the last-ditch efforts of the Epic in Miami).  But, after my break from Kimpton, the Fitzroy London  (which I refer to as the “Russell Square” - sorry) has won me back.

Great, refurbished property which embraces its heritage - no “brass and glass” here - it’s a step back to gentility and grace.  When one looked forward to travel and staying in fine hotels and when travel was not just an “obligation” to be endured.

Eight nights in one their corner suites.  A great design and terrific layout (photos attached).  Delightful sitting room with faux fireplace and small nook for eating (or working).  A delightful bedroom with a large tub in the corner (not used but intriguing regardless). A large ensuite bathroom with separate toilet and shower (the shower enclosure was very large).  Two sinks.  Proper drawer.  Heated towel rack. Delightful.  Plus a proper powder room off the sitting room so guests did not have to traipse through the bedroom to use the facilities.

The bar (Fitz’) was a little dark, a little busy and noisy and opened a little late for my tastes, but so what.  The service was good.  The drinks were cold.  And there was no putty-beige walls or brass and glass to be found.  Very, very good.

The Palm Court restaurant for lunch was “just OK” with a comparatively limited menu, but for me on my own it was fine.

Looking for gripes - perhaps food services could ramp it up a notch - I found the room service menu limited and the delivery service to be spartan (the room service staff seemed to be extraordinarily rushed and that suggests under-staffing).  I would suggest upping the very reasonable prices a little, expanding the menu just a little and hiring a few more staff - instructed to take their time and to look for anything they might do to make the guest happier.  I had a bucket of champagne in the room and unless I specifically requested it, the ice was not replenished (ice and a little effort from the room service staff is free but the resulting goodwill from guests is remarkable).

Oh, and one more gripe - the ensuite bathroom needs a hook to hand one’s robe or coat on.  Just one.  That would do it.  But these small gripes only reflect how hard it is to pick this hotel apart.

As I checked out, I had a brief word with hotel manager, Daniel Healey, and guest relations manager, Isabel Vega.  I am completely confident (even after our short chat) that these two are completely switched on, have matters well in hand and bear significant responsibility for the premier state of the hotel - not small praise in my book.

Lastly, head concierge Conor McDowell was excellent throughout my stay.  The concierge desk is immediately opposite the lifts and in my comings and goings he always remembered me and had a kind word and inquired to ensure that my stay was going well.  A delightful gentleman and a real asset to the hotel (and, after all, it is the people who make a great hotel).  Clone him.

No, the Russell Square does not have the footmen of The Goring (before they renovated and wrecked the beautiful bar), the Butlers of the Lanesborough (the Library Bar still the best in London, in my opinion) or the Club Lounge of The Langham (the Russell Square should look into the latter - a great idea worthy of emulation), but then again it has its own developing character and is not as high priced as the aforementioned properties.  They should expand the hours of Fitz’ (a 5pm opening is too late).  But I would definitely stay again and have added it to my list of hotels I will rotate among on my trips to London.

A delightful and happy find.  Well done, Kimpton - you’ve (finally) won me back.  Thanks to this fine property and its excellent staff.  Cheers to happy, new discoveries.",5,2019,10,21
124,Lovely,"Stayed here for 1 night, wish we could have stayed longer to truly enjoy this stunning hotel. Being in London we purely used it as a base and we were out all day and night, but the short time we did spend in the hotel was great. We had lunch in the cafe on arrival, delicious. Comfy beds, great shower and the coffee machine is a nice touch with fresh milk in the morning. 
Staff all very friendly and welcoming. We will definitely be back!",5,2019,10,20
124,Friendly Casual Chic Hotel,"Friendly hotel with a beautiful lobby and the most excellent staff. We booked a superior twin double bedroom. The best thing about the room was the amazingly comfortable beds. The bathroom had a tub and a shower and was a good size.
 The bottled water was replenished daily free of charge. It was even nice to have a fresh carton of milk to touch up your morning coffee. There was also a nespresso machine a kettle and some teabags and coffee pods. Mid stay during our holiday the staff sent us a lovely plate of fruits. 
The downside is the room was on the small side. We were 2 adults and we were staying in London for a week of shopping. It was hard to keep even one suitcase open... and since space in the closet was limited and crowded with and ironing board, a lot of my clothes ended up on top of each other on one of the chairs. The other chair had extra towels on them provided by housekeeping. It would have been nice if they had a stool or extra rails in the bathroom for those extra towels. 
The rooms were cleaned once a day. There was no turn down service provided as I would expect from a 5 star hotel but perhaps that would be part of the hotel's casual approach. Im sure if I asked they would have done it.
 They also can provide you with anything you might have forgotten be it a nail file to keep or curling iron to borrow. 
On the last night before we left there was a celebrity gala. It went on till past midnight. We were on the second floor and it was quite noisy with music and announcements so it was hard to get a good nights sleep before our early flight the next morning. Make sure you get a higher floor if you book to avoid any noise if there are any events going on at the hotel during your stay. 
All in all it was a pleasant experience staying at the Kimpton Fitzroy. Thank you for taking care of us.",4,2019,10,19
124,Weekend in London,"I came from Edinburgh for a nice weekend with friends. The whole journey was just awful. Started with 4,5 hours of plane delay.. imagine my mood after 18h of working and travelling.. went to the restaurant to have a meal. I was prepared for the disaster since everything was going wrong but... My God it was amazing! The food was really good and tasty and the service was outstanding.  Thank you Adam and Travis who made my evening and the whole experience very nice. Definitely will come back. That's what Kimpton all about!",5,2019,10,19
124,Stunning hotel with 5 star service *****,"The location of this hotel is the icing on the cake.  Situated opposite Russell Square and with easy access to other areas of London via tube (3 minutes).
We stayed here as a family for my daughter's wedding, which was at a venue nearby.
First impressions of this hotel are amazing and the entrance lobby is manned by the friendliest and most helpful staff I have encountered. Nothing was too much trouble.  We had a lot of luggage and it needed to be distributed to various rooms.  Even when there was a slight mix up with rooms we had booked, we were instantly up-graded and apologies were forthcoming.
This was an important occasion and the staff rose to the challenge - not blinking an eye when my daughter requested a plate of cucumber slices to be delivered to her room!
The rooms were quiet and the bridal suite in particular is large and luxurious.

In our opinion, the only thing that let the hotel down was the 'Neptune' restaurant where we had lunch on the Sunday.  We had booked a table and there were only a few other people in there.  The service was slow, some of the food arrived cold and the waiting staff were not that friendly. We felt this was not value for money and not up to the standard we would have expected from a hotel in the Kimpton group.
However, we hope to return!",5,2019,10,18
124,A perfectly appointed London beauty,"I almost always like Kimpton hotels and the Fitzroy was one of the best I've stayed in.  it has been lovingly refurbished.  The lobby with its tall ornate ceilings, is immediately welcoming.  We sat by the fireplace waiting for our room to be ready and my partner promptly drifted off to sleep.    The bedroom was large which does not seem possible in europe.  In fact, it was a little too large for the furniture.  Another couch or seating area would have made the room perfect.  the bathroom was modern. Everything was clean and lovely.  The hotel is on a road across the street from Russell park.  It is not a quiet road.  however our room faced into the courtyard.  We were on the 7th floor and gladly sacrified a view for the total peace and quiet.  Plus being in London meant we were never in the hotel during daylight hours.  location was next to the tube and a mile from the train station where i later caught the train to paris.",5,2019,10,17
124,Great staff and hotel!,"Andree always so warm and welcoming! And Anna too! Lovely rooms and property! Quiet rooms and great location, Russell Square. Thanks for all you guys do to make my stay so comfortable.  Burr & Co perfect for breakfast and great coffee. Nice room amenities.",5,2019,10,16
124,Amazing placs,"Stayed here for 3 nights, the location is great like walking to the tube station within 3 minutes. Lots of cafes and Tesco just across the street, you can get around easily. 
All the staff were very friendly and nice, especially the person who checked me in and all the staff from concierge are wonderful on helping with luggage and taxi. 
I need a quiet room and it was amazing, but a bit noisy in the lobby cos obviously there were groups in house and they talk loud.... ",5,2019,10,15
124,Old but nice,"The hotel is located on a busy street opposite to Russell Square. Easy to access the tube. Ethnic restaurants close by. There is a coffee shop inside the hotel. The price to value is lower. I guess you pay for the ambience of the hotel, however the rooms are a bit outdated and definitely smaller in comparison. The staff and service is excellent.",3,2019,10,13
124,Very Good Quick stay at the heart of Central London,"Upon arrival outside the hotel, I was received by the extremely friendly and helpful bell service/valet staff. He got my heavy luggage and showed me to the reception. The Portuguese speaking reception agent missed to greet me as an IHG Platinum Elite member and had difficulty doing the check in for me since I had separate back to back bookings. She asked another female colleague to help out since she didn’t know how to fix it in the computer system.

Later, she was finding it hard to enter my passport details on the system. Luckily, another reception staff Ramir was very quick and helpful to assist. Generally, the check in took a bit of time than expected. Even if they knew my room preferences, the hotel wasn’t able to give me a room on a higher floor and closer to the lift. They said they were running full. This is also why they weren’t able to provide me with the complimentary room upgrade upon arrival. 

They asked me to choose between 5,000 points or complimentary breakfast. I chose the former but til now haven’t received the points they promised. :-( 

The bell service helped me bring my luggage to the room and do a rooming process - it was a very warm welcome and excellent way to make the guest appreciate the room. 

Even if the room I got was in a low floor and very far from the lift, it’s generally in a quiet area. It was facing the side street and had a view of a Pret store. I liked everything in the room except a few items in the toilet:

a) the shower door was opening outwards and would displace any floor mat that you put to keep the floor dry after showering
b) the towel rack is behind the toilet bowl and super far from the shower so you’ll walk and wet the floor to reach it before you can dry up
c) space is so limited that you can’t sit down properly on the toilet without your knees hitting the bathroom tissue roll hanged from the wall. They should have placed this higher or somewhere else. 

The upsides of the room and bathroom are:
1. Excellent toilet amenities 
2. Nice cabinet with a minibar that contains semi skimmed milk to use for English breakfast tea or coffee
3. Like the complimentary “Poshcorn” and chocolate.
4. The bed is amazing

Housekeeping service was really fast and efficient when you need extra pillows, towels, or toothbrush.

The concierge were helpful and fast in helping arrange dinner reservations. At one time, I was in a hurry to head out but still wanted to leave a message for Housekeeping. The concierge was preoccupied, reception queue was long, I stepped out and asked the doorman to tell Housekeeping what I needed. It was executed very well. There was no gap in communication. 

I ordered late night in-room dining. The selection was quite limited and the Nasi Goreng I ordered could be better. The dessert was really good. Room service was quick. 

A few things I had in mind to make the stay better were: 

1. Reception to tell the guest which facilities or restaurant/bar/lounge were available in the hotel. I stayed for 2 nights but didn’t know if the hotel had a fitness center, business centre, sauna, etc. I didn’t know what cuisine was offered in the restaurant and how many restaurants it had. I just knew there was a bar since it was pretty packed and noisy along the hallway for a Sunday when I arrived. 

2. Add more staff& computers at Reception for check in and check out. During peak check in and check out times, the queue can be quite long and would take 5-10 minutes per guest. 

Other than those items, the stay was very good and higher than average. The highlight was excellent service of staff from rooms division though some items can be improved to change from very good to excellent. ",4,2019,10,12
124,Fantastic,Stayed just one night with my husband and our daughter and son in law who had stayed before. We were not disappointed it was fantastic. We cant wait to return. Just a mention for the guys on the door who were lovely and one did a funny magic trick to open the door. The receptionist who check us in I'm sorry I dont know her name was so lovely and helpful. This is how a hotel should be run. Thank you.,5,2019,10,11
124,Wonderful Place,"Kimpton Fitzroy is a wonderful place! It is located in a very nice area of London on the border between Camden and Bloomsbury, across from Russell Square. It is a perfect place to stay. The ""Tube"" is located around the corner from the entrance to the hotel so it is very easy to get around London and see all the sites. Russell Square is a park lined with beautiful trees and a pleasant walkway to enjoy an nice, easy stroll. There are also a number of places to enjoy a meal within a short walking distance from the hotel. 

The hotel itself is located in a historical building. The hotel is beautiful. Concierge service is exceptional. From greeting you at the front door to carrying your bags, the concierge staff was always available. Our favorite concierge was Luis, Assistance Head Concierge. He gave us all the attention and direction that we needed in our first trip to London. Very friendly person whom we'll always remember. The front desk personnel were also very cordial in greeting us. 

Our room was small but very clean and well-decorated. It was the perfect place to rest after a long day. And do not forget the happy hour, where guests can receive complimentary drinks and o'dourves. Very nice service to wind down from a long day of site-seeing. 

I would return to this place in a heartbeat, without any question. It provided us with a lifetime of memories.",5,2019,10,10
124,Loved this hotel!,"We visited with another couple recently and all really loved this hotel. It is in an amazing old building with high ceilings and panelling. Whilst it structurally has the feel of an old Bank, it has been decorated sympathetically to suit its purpose as a hotel. Through the entrance way is a lovely airy dining room with an outdoor patio which was lovely to sit and relax in. The bedrooms were lovely, with old fashioned red telephones by the bed and other British memorabilia. Very comfortable bed and large bathroom. We would definitely stay here again on an overnight we to London. Just next to Russell Square tube.",5,2019,10,09
124,Excellent hotel,"Incredible building from outside to the room, got upgraded to suite which is enormous and well decorated, especially the elegant bathtub! Great location as well, the British museum within 10 mins walking, lots of great bars around. Nice gym. Four stars due to the unbelievable slow service at the breakfast restaurant.",4,2019,10,09
124,Wedding Anniversary ,"My wife and I stayed over for our wedding anniversary. The hotel is superb. Fantastic front of house team, really looked after us on arrival. The design and decor excellent. Room was lovely. It’s also in a great location for walking to the theatres, Covent Garden, Oxford Street etc. Would highly recommend. ",5,2019,10,05
124,A more than pleasant surprise,We came upon The Kiimpton Fitzroy quite by accident as our rental house in London turned out to be a poor fit for our stay.  Every aspect of dealing with the Kimpton Fitzroy was exceptional.  They were completely service oriented to the client and they did whatever they could to make our stay comfortable and enjoyable.  I cannot say enough about the professionalism of the staff and their attention to detail. Thank you for making our stay a great experience.  We will be back!!,5,2019,09,30
124,Wonderful place!,"This is a beautiful place, I enjoyed my stay a lot. From the very entrance, Valter gave me the warmest welcome and throughout the stay, I was met with top quality service! All the spaces are gorgeous and I will definitely come back!!",5,2019,09,28
124,One word GREAT !!!,Very nice and beautiful hotel. Nice furniture !! Great service. What a staff. Stayed for 2 nights. Best hotel in the center of London. We certainly come back. Special thanks to the staff and to Max. Super friendly !!,5,2019,09,27
124,Such a beautiful place,"If you ever have a chance to stay at the Kimpton Fitroy London you will not be disappointed! It's lovely, like literally perfect. From the customer service, to the rooms and the food it's a beautiful place and I feel super fortunate to have stayed there!",5,2019,09,26
124,Loved it,"I stayed here right before the name was changed from the Principal London. I had dinner in the restaurant, Neptune, and it was delicious. The bed was supremely comfortable, and I had a small sitting area. Excellent wifi, and the service at the hotel was marvelous. They went out of their way to accommodate me, and room service was worth the money. Very close to the British Museum, and the nearest tube station is less than half a block away. I would love to return.",5,2019,09,25
124,My wife’s 40th Birthday 🎂 ,"Just has an excellent stay at the Kimpton Fitzroy London!

We had to wait about 15 mins to check in but was provided couple of free glasses of wine so no Problem 😃! Then we found we had been upgraded to a corner suite room due to IHG status and fact it was my wife’s 40th birthday 🎁- was a very pleasant surprise the room was AMAZING! 

We was also provided some champagne in the room from the hotel to help us celebrate 🎉  🥂 

Everything about the hotel and staff was of the highest quality and would like to say a big thank you to the hotel for making my wife’s birthday a very special one 😃

Hopefully will be back soon ",5,2019,09,25
124,A pleasant enough London hotel but has a lot to improve upon,"The building from the outside is very impressive.  The front desk staff were excellent at check-in and out.  As a top level IHG member, this was a rewards stay, but I was disappointed that they couldn't find a single room upgrade opportunity out of the 334 rooms.  Anyway, the room itself was smart, if very small, with the bed almost at the door when opened (the corridor is really smart).  There was a good size bathroom and decent shower.  The room has the common hotel issue of air conditioning not being able to go below 19 deg C to save money, which means we had to open the windows and didn't get a great night's sleep with the road noise from traffic.  Breakfast was a bit of a scrum, with a queue to get in, and then people running everywhere, chaotic, 10-15 mins for a coffee to be served and over 20 mins for the main breakfast course to arrive.  This hotel probably feels grander than it really is, and overall this was a regular stay with an average night's sleep in a small double bed for a top level IHG member.",3,2019,09,23
124,IHG Members - you dont get the same service,"I am a Royal Ambassador Spire Elite  - top membership in Intercontinental Group (over 83 nights in one of their hotels this year).  I thought I would try the Kimpton Fitzroy London Hotel instead of the Intercontinental Park Lane.  I had probably my worst IHG check in today.  My membership number had not been put in the profile, even though it had been emailed to the reservations people (Kieren).  I handed over my card at reception, the lady looked at it, gave it back and then asked me to fill our a reservations form.  I asked about my double upgrade and she had no idea.  She asked for the Manager.  I handed back my membership card and this time it was inputed.  I asked about the upgrade and all the benefits you get at IHG.  He said, no it doesn't work here at the Kimpton Fitzroy.  They have their own programme.  Frankly, he made it very clear that he could not care about any sort of hotel loyalty and certainly not about me.  I got the feeling that I was lucky to be a guest.  Also there is no 4pm checkout around here - probably the best part of the Ambassador programme.  So, when considering your choices, I would go straight to the Intercontinental Park Lane!",1,2019,09,23
124,Love the refurb!,"Had a really lovely stay here last month. Just one night but will definitely return for a longer stay. I stayed here when it was The Russell Hotel which was nice but the refurbishment to Fitzroy Kimpton is lovely. It’s a cross between The Rosewood and The Savoy, two of my favourite hotels, so its perfect!

We were lucky enough to be upgraded which was a nice bonus. Burr & Co is a lovely place to chill and enjoy a coffee/glass of wine. Always love somewhere that provides complimentary drinks so social hour was particularly welcomed!

Would also recommend Fitz’s Bar for a cocktail or two.",5,2019,09,20
124,First visit to London,"This is an amazing hotel, our visit was amazing a must see when in London...
We went into the palm court hotel, this was so relaxing after a long day of walking the sights of London, enjoying a relaxing drink of proseco, a seat in the throne of roses which was won by the pastry chef for professional bake of 2019. 
We then followed on to the resturant the ambience of the resturant was amazing a very releaxed atsompher, the actual meal was well worth the money, recomdatioms from the waiter was spot on and the vegetarian choices were lovely. After our meal we went to the Fitz's Bar, where we enjoyed after dinner drinks & cocktails... again the bar attendant was helpful, listened to what we liked and produced amazing cocktails for us. 

We tried out the coffee bar the next morning, which produced lovely Latte & Mocha coffees... When you in London make it a must to visit even if it's just a coffee.... 

Not only do they accomdate pets, the have excellent access for disabled people...

124,Great experience,"The Kimpton London exceeded our expectations. Ivars was extremely helpful and pleasant from the moment we arrived to the moment we left. The entire staff was very attentive and the hotel was beautiful. The gym was much better than most hotel gyms and the complimentary happy hour was icing on the cake. Lastly, the bed was extremely comfortable!",5,2019,09,16
124,Gorgeous hotel and lovely staff! ,"I used to live in London and was always an admirer of the building that is now the Kimpton Fitzroy. When I was coming back to town with my family, the opportunity to stay here presented itself so I immediately jumped on it.

What an absolutely gorgeous place! I’ve been an IHG member and am continually impressed by the Kimpton brand and their service. The Fitzroy is no exception. Everyone from the front desk to the concierge were all exceptionally helpful. My father fell ill with a cold during our trip and I know he appreciated the wonderful room service! 

The decor is modern and lovely. The hotel’s location is conveniently next to the Russel Square tube station. Bloomsbury is a fantastic area that is quiet and close to many things. 

Regarding the amenities, I adored the coffee shop, Burr & Co, as did I enjoy Fitz’s Bar. They were great to have on site. 

I would 100% recommend this hotel and look forward to returning in the near future. ",5,2019,09,14
124,Best hotel in London,Nathan was an unbelievable pleasure to be around and meet! He was so helpful and has now made this my mean spot to come too while I’m in London! Can’t wait to come back here on my next trip. The hidden gem of London!!,5,2019,09,13
124,"Great, imposing hotel","This is a beautiful hotel with friendly and helpful staff.  Close to underground/buses, so easy to use as a base.  Room was well-equipped, but small.  Amazing decor too, very different from the Hotel Russell it was previously.",5,2019,09,10
124,Good stay,"I stayed,at the kimpton hotel for a couple of nights ,nice friendly staff , comfortable clean rooms ,very central .I enjoyed my stay and would stay there again.one of the new,hotels to join the ihg chain of hotels",4,2019,09,10
124,Terrible,I stayed at the hotel for a business trip and arrived too late to the hotel in the evening. The hotel is beautiful on the outside and the rooms were very stylish. But the hotel lacks and service. My room was next to the service elevator and in the middle of the night I started hearing the elevator being ran. I had to switch to a second room. When I move to the second room the air conditioning didn't work in the room because of the high ceilings so the room was very warm. The hotel staff offered to bring a fan so in a five-star hotel I had to sleep with a fan. I ordered room service the first night and my food was carried through the hotel with no covers. I didn't have proper utensils to eat my food or open my drinks so I had to call and ask staff to come open the drinks and bring proper utensils. By the time they came the food was cold and not very tasty. The food was about 70 lb and the only offer that the hotel gave was a 20% discount. The breakfast has a very long wait and terrible service. I had to repeatedly eyes just for a glass of water and the food at the buffet kept running out so there was never any food and I didn't really eat the breakfast at any of the four days that I stayed.,2,2019,09,08
124,Do not think twice,"I wanted to stay in London for my graduation. We came over this hotel when we were looking at hotels and can I just say OMG. From the first sight to the last goodbye I have absolutely felt in love with this hotel. I have always been interested in architecture and interior design (my bachelor degree) and this is just a candy for my eyes. The staff where lovely, the hotel is a museum in itself, the rooms are cozy and homely. for everyone that is wondering about staying here, I would say don`t think twice.",5,2019,09,08
124,Fantastic hotel and location,"Had a great three night stay here in August, located less than 200m from Russell Square tube station which is on the Piccadilly line so couldn't be more convenient to all attractions and Heathrow. The staff were all super lovely and couldn't do enough for us, and we had a small but luxurious room with an especially beautifully designed and finished bathroom that I intend to replicate in an upcoming bathroom reno at home! The included goodies in the room were appreciated as was the nightly wine hour from 5-6. Breakfast was fantastic and they include barista made coffee which is awesome. The entire building had been beautifully restored and preserved and I'd highly recommend it for anyone visiting London. We walked to the British Museum first thing in the morning (it's 5 minutes away) and beat the crowds so that was an added bonus!",5,2019,09,08
124,Everything you Want,"Great Hotel in a Great City in a Great Location. But like all Top Shelf establishments, it is the people that make it Great, the service, the attention to details and going way above & beyond expectations. We visited in July, and were already loving the amazing architecture, decor and sense of history, everyone we met was mega helpful. 

However, at 6am on my last morning at the Hotel, I received an email that informed me that a local supermarket would not be delivering the 15 packets of a local brand of sweets which was the only thing my Children asked me to bring home from my business trip. I went down to the Concierge's Desk just before breakfast, where the lovely Chief Concierge Conor McDowell listened to my tale of woe, I asked if he could please call around a few of the local shops to see if any of them carried what I was looking for - I explained that I would be in a meeting all morning, but I should have time to go to one or two stores if they had what I was looking for, before heading off to catch my plane. Leave it with me, he said.

Fast forward 5 hours and I get a message - ""Hi after some quick detective work, we have some good news ..."", I popped round, and there was Conor, holding a bag filled with 12 packets of sweet ! Conor and his colleague Nathan efforts were the finishing touches that make an already great trip just fabulous.. Thank you",5,2019,09,08
124,Great hotel ,"Had a very nice experience staying here with my husband this week. Rooms are beautiful, staff was friendly and consistent. I really need to give a shout out to John Church and the dining room staff in the Neptune restaurant. Not only was his service, and theirs, exemplary, we witnessed firsthand their ability to adapt and overcome some insurmountable customer service issues whilst still maintaining inexplicably superb service for the rest of the guests. Like watching a ballet. Only the slightly panicked look in their eyes and the sweat on their upper lip would clue you in. Good show:) Stay here. ",4,2019,09,07
124,My second home in London,"This is a truly magnificent hotel. The rooms are beautifully decorated; the restaurants are excellent and the bar is just brilliant. Staff are helpful and friendly. The location is also very convenient, around the corner from a tube station and a fairly short walk from Kings Cross rail station. As an IHG member I frequently get room upgrades, adding a nice touch that makes me come back quite frequently. This great hotel is quickly becoming my hotel of choice for business trips to London. Highly recommended!",5,2019,09,05
124,ASK FOR THE ADORIBLE HARRY!  AT THE  KIMPTON FITZROY LONDON,"Nothing short of MAGNIFICENT!!  Undoubtedly the best place I have ever stayed at! Kimpton Fitzroy, yes the beds are comfortable, yes, the place is like walking in a palace, yes the food is fantastic, however, it is the staff which made my visit stand out!  Everyone knows the fascinating history and love to share in every room.  Kimpton Fitzroy, has a staff which really listens to you and surprises could end up in your lap!  This hotel is there for you as if  you are the only one staying there.  Ask for adorable Harry!  Harry will add an extra special touch to your visit.  I will only stay at Kimpton Fizroy every time I stay in London!  An experience I will NEVER FORGET!",5,2019,09,04
124,Excellent front desk and Fitz’s bar ,"Having stayed at the grand Kimpton a few times now, I always look forward to the cheerful front desk service. Covi, Romyr and Bemnet have always treated us well whenever we have stayed. Thank you for smiles and genuine care. Not forgetting Max at the door, again always smiling willing to help. 

The bartenders in Fitz’s bar make some excellent cocktails. Another favourite feature of this hotel is the complimentary wine and beer between 5-6pm for the Kimpton social hour. Love it, such a great way to meet and chat with fellow Kimpton guests. ",4,2019,09,02
124,"Amazing hotel, amazing staff, amazing place for champain","My partner and I and my German friends recently stayed at the Kimpton Fitzroy Hotel on Russell Square after it's recent renovation. The experience was outstanding. From the friendly and knowledgeable front of house staff to the beautiful glitzy entrance hall, the hotel exudes glamour and class.

After checking in and getting comfortable, we went to the  bar for some cocktails and glass of champain. They were truly exquisite. The bar staff are very knowledgeable and passionate about the drinks on offer and helped us decide what to try.

We stayed in a deluxe room and it was very classic in style. A huge extremely comfortable bed led to a great nights sleep. 

I would definitely stay again, highly recommended.",5,2019,09,01
124,Just superb in every way,"We used this hotel as a base for our customer excellence training. The whole experience was superb. Cathrine, Bri and the team did everything to make our course a success, modelling everything we were teaching our course participants. This course has been seriously refurbished over recent years and the owners have built a team to match the wonderful environment. Highly recommended. ",5,2019,09,01
124,Fantastic!!!,"We decided to go on a little adventure with our adorable Cockapoo, Dolly. Our first stop off was the Kimpton and hand on my heart, I cannot fault this hotel at all. The staff were beyond lovely, they made all of us - myself, my husband and Dolly - feel extremely welcome. I almost wished we’d just stayed there for the entire trip! We’ll definitely, without doubt, return, whenever we need to stop over in London. Whoever you are, do not hesitate to book a room here, you’d have to be insane to find fault with anything at the Kimpton. Feel free to follow more of Dolly’s adventures on instagram - dolly_bear_greaves ... :-) x",5,2019,09,01
124,Stunning building and excellent service!,"The building is world class, the service and the public spaces are also stunning. Social hour is a beautiful touch. 

The room is comfortable however the shower was poorly designed, the bathroom would be completely drenched by the end of a shower. 

The neighbourhood is also a bit dull (especially at night), not a far walk from Soho but it does seem like an odd neighbourhood to stay in; it is well connected by underground.",4,2019,08,31
124,The hunt for good hotel in London continues,"I stayed at this hotel with my family for about a week. The hotel is newly refurbished, so everything looks brand new. The staff are friendly. The location is also good, Russell Square tube station is just around the corner, and very close to the British Museum.

I saw a card in the hotel saying that the stuff in the fridge are complimentary and will be replenished every day. I noticed that there was a can of coca cola in the fridge. Being a Coke addict, the thought of having the fridge replenished with Coke every day made me very happy.

To my great disappointment , we stayed at the hotel from Tuesday to Friday, the fridge was never replenished.

Please do not make promises if you cannot keep them.

My second complaint is that on the last day of our staying, we noticed that the face towels left by the housekeeper actually have stains on them. That was the most horrible thing in a hotel I have ever come across.

So, looks like I have to continue my search for a good hotel in London.",3,2019,08,31
124,Best Hotel London without a doubt,"We were so impressed with this hotel.
We have stayed in Kimpton hotels before but this is most certainly their Jewel in their crown.
The building is fabulous and has been so wonderfully refurbished to such a high standard.
From the minute we arrived to smell the Kimpton scent
( yes it is a thing) we felt at home.
The location is fabulous.
Molly on the front desk is an absolute delight so friendly and happy in her job.
Meg, in the dining room of Neptune’s just a delight.
Joyce in Fritz’s the bar which is one of the nicest bars we have ever been in and we have been to thousands.
All of the staff were without a doubt the most friendly accommodating and so happy in their jobs I was talking to them and they all love working for Kimpton.
Our room was not the biggest room but perfectly appointed and beautifully done.
My new place to stay whilst in London.
Please stay the way you are and don’t change.",5,2019,08,30
124,2nd Home while in London,"My wife and I are confirmed Kimpton Hotel travelers. But even this doesn't explain the extraordinary treatment we received on our recent three week trip to England.There are so many highlights it is impossible to cover them all in this short review. But i can say is that when we left (finally & reluctantly), after numerous returns thru out the 3 weeks, we felt as if we were leaving our family. Just to name a few, David in reservation made the stays and rooms possible, Covi at the front desk welcomed us like long lost friends, Conor and Luis (Concierges extraordinaire) made sure we got to interesting places to eat and play, Isabel in Guest Relations made certain ANY questions we had were always patiently and fully answered (not to mention the nice treats she arranged!). This is a wonderful facility with Kimptons famous ""Social Hour"" consistently warm and accepting, two top notch restaurants and a central London location that makes it easy to love this Hotel. Warm, friendly and welcoming without being intrusive would hold true of all of the staff of this newly minted London Kimpton. Thank you all for a fabulous time.  ",5,2019,08,30
124,Exquisite,"My husband and I adored every moment of our stay at Kimpton Fitzroy. The service, the food and the interesting history of the building made everything magical, and we were extremely sad to leave. Special thanks to Reuben at the front desk and Andrew at Neptune for going above and beyond. We can't WAIT to come back!",5,2019,08,29
124,Amazing hotel for a special occasion! ,"I can’t praise the hotel enough, I booked for a birthday treat and the service was great from start to finish. The staff at reception were lovely and friendly from the get go. I had booked a king room, but on arrival we were upgraded to a suite which was amazing and just made the trip even more special. The hotel itself is immaculate and the room was lovely. The staff put a cake with a little birthday message in the room for when we arrived which again just made it extra special. Most importantly, the bed was enormous and was amazing if you like to be so far away from your other half that you need to use smoke signals to locate them, I had the best sleep of my life! I could go on, but in summary, the hotel is amazing and I can’t wait to come back! ",5,2019,08,28
124,Afternoon tea - charming!,"I joined friends staying at the hotel for tea, a lavishly presented and delicious spread worth the Bloomsbury price tag. The hotel was elegantly refurbished a few years back and the setting is charming, with the option of sitting outdoors in good weather for a few guests.",4,2019,08,27
124,World class,"I spend 100+ nights a year in hotels (mainly Marriotts), and am new to the Kimpton group of hotels, but I can't praise the Kimpton Fitzroy highly enough. From the warm and friendly check-in, to the service in the coffee shop, at breakfast and the cocktail bar, to the level of detail from the housekeeping, the standards in every area of this hotel are outstanding. Prices are reasonable for London, and the recent refurbishment has been beautifully done. Off the back of this first visit, this will be my go-to London hotel going forward, and I'll make a point of seeking out other Kimpton hotels to see if they're equally good! Kudos to the manager, Daniel Healey and his team - this is the best run hotel I've been to in years, and a real gem.",5,2019,08,25
124,Last night of vacation in London,"Our family spent the last night of our vacation celebrating our 20th wedding anniversary at the Kimpton Fitzroy. Everything was wonderful- beautiful hotel, recently renovated. We were checked in and out by Coby who was absolutely delightful and especially welcoming to our two children. Max, Simon, Nathan and Harry were also particularly lovely to us- helping with bags, taking our kids to see the “Lucky George” dragon statue and being so attentive. The room was outstanding-lovely bathroom, plenty of space for our family. The hotel even sent up two pretty bags of sweets with lemonade! We would definitely stay here again. Wonderful location in the heart of Bloomsbury, around the corner from the Russell Square tube and facing the lovely Russell Square gardens-also 5 minutes from the British Museum. Thank you to Coby, Simon and everyone who made us feel so special and welcomed.",5,2019,08,25
124,AMAZING EXPERIENCE,"I stayed two nights in a corner suite with my friend and it was unbelievable!
The facilities are impressive and modern but the classy style remains, what it is a perfect combination.

The service could not be better. The first night we had dinner at the restaurant Neptune, the food was really tasty and the service was quick! I have to highlight the amazing, good and attentive service from Adam in the restaurant. He explained us the different options that we had in the menu and gave us some advice!

Also, we needed to contact the reception during the night as we did not know how to modify the temperature of the air conditioner and even though it was really late, Richard and Roberto from the night helped us immediately. Such nice people and service!

Finally, on the last day we went to Burr and Co to have a drink during the ""Social Hour"" and it could not be a better ending of an amazing stay in the hotel, with the service that Jayke provided to us. He was very attentive, helpful and he had very professional and friendly manners.

In summary, I would definitely stay again at this hotel. Nothing negative to say about it, just that it was very hard (as we had such a great time) to leave the hotel on Sunday!!

thank you for the service",5,2019,08,25
124,Excellent Hotel and wonderful staff,"I stayed at the Kimpton Fitzroy ON May 13th when visiting London on business. I was greeted at the door by a friendly chap who directed me to reception. The receptionist was a lovely Spanish girl called Covi, who was very professional and courteous, and was able to have a relaxed conversation whilst maintaining her professional approach. I was taken to my room, a palatial corner room that was well appointed and the facilities were excellent with a really powerful shower and quality tea and coffee. 
I visited the bar in late evening where the stock of malt whiskey is very commendable. The bar was very popular and there were a large number of our American cousins in the room who were their usual quiet and peaceful folks (NOT).
The breakfast area was busy the following day - however the service remained top notch! All in all a very beautiful hotel that has been tastefully renovated with staff who understand the concept of service.",5,2019,08,25
124,Worth It: a lovely stay in the heart of London,"I’m going to try to keep this short. If you have a chance to stay here, DO. I used my IHG anniversary night (which I’m so sad they no longer do for this higher tier property) in May 2019. My stay was above and beyond expectation - the rooms with their gourmet popcorns and chocolate, the amazing toiletries (The Perfumer’s Story, for anyone scouring the internet to find it), the cocktail hour, the accommodating doormen and concierge service... I did experience one problem which was that the heating in the room didn’t work. When someone came by to check it out and couldn’t fix, they brought me an extra duvet which was fine. Also the Palm Court was closed during the two days I was there which was disappointing. Otherwise, it was a dreamy stay. Don’t miss the grand staircase or Burr & Co.- both gorgeous. Ask for a lower floor room if you can as I read reviews that the lower rooms have higher ceilings, which turned out to be the case for my room. I’m heading back in May so that my husband can experience it too.",5,2019,08,24
124,Afternoon Tea,"What a stunning building, inside and out.  Afternoon tea in the Rose Garden was fabulous.  The whole experience was all the more enjoyable for having fantastic service from Fedro, who looked after us exceptionally well and gave us a bit of history about the hotel, which was fascinating.  Thank you, Fedro!  Will definitely go again.",5,2019,08,23
124,Fabulous afternoon tea!,"We had a most enjoyable afternoon tea in this stunning setting, with attentive, friendly service by our waiter,Fedro, who was also very knowledgeable about the history of the hotel. Nothing was too much trouble for him and he made our experience extra special.
The food was excellent and sandwiches and cakes were replenished on request, as were the hot beverages.
I would highly recommend this venue for a delicious and memorable afternoon tea!",5,2019,08,22
124,Gorgeous hotel with wonderful service,We had a wonderful stay. We were well looked after and the decor was elegant while also comfortable. Visit Alex at the Fritz bar who was so personable. Social hour was lively and fun and the hotel is so well located that we were able to see the sights easily.,5,2019,08,21
124,Outstanding ! Stunning!! great service,"Beautiful Hotel - very well maintained, Comfortable, luxurious and great service. Ivars the lobby portal was very helpful and courteous. Will stay here again. Wish i had stayed here longer. It was an absolutely amazing experience.",5,2019,08,19
124,Outstanding!,"My husband and I stayed here for 1 night after a 24 hour flight from Sydney.  We paid on points and were given an upgrade to an outstanding suite - the room was enormous and beautifully decorated - a real treat!  The whole hotel has undergone a renovation and it’s simply stunning - the staff were also excellent and a pleasure to deal with!  

I am a Spire Royal Ambassador with IHG and sometimes hotels look after you and sometimes they don’t - these guys definitely did - so thank you! ",5,2019,08,19
124,Stunning Hotel & Great Experience ,Beautiful historic building and great bedroom design. Stayed in a Junior Suite which was absolutely amazing! Room was spacious bed was really comfortable one of the best I had in a hotel and the best part is  minibar is complimentary. They have all kind of amenities if you have forgotten something at least home which is great (see picture). Staff is also one of the main things making the stay so amazing so thank you all for making our stay memorable and we will definitely love to come back. ,5,2019,08,18
124,Beautiful hotel with great details!,"Chose this hotel mainly for the location but didn't expect much and now this is one of my favorite hotels in London.
The bed is tiny and so is the room but they are making the most out of it. First of all, it checks my list with master switch and electrical outlets  near bed.
The room, while small, has high ceilings so it doesn't feel so small. The bathroom feels more spacious and is completed with a tub, handheld shower as well as the overhead shower. Bath amenities smell nice.
The room gets replenished with complimentary snacks (popcorns and chocolates) and drinks (water 
and milk) in addition to the usual coffee and tea.
I also found a book of a poetry and travel adapter in the drawers of the side table next to the bed.
Will definitely come back.",5,2019,08,18
124,Fabulous Hotel,"I stayed here earlier this year for our 30th wedding anniversary and would come back. Its fabulous and the staff are so good. Very attentive. I thoroughly enjoyed my upgrade as well to a junior suite. Excellent food, service and location.",5,2019,08,17
124,Amazingly beautiful,"We had such a dreamy one night stay at the Kimpton Fitzroy. It felt like being transported to another world. A magical place all together! 

And thank you Adam for being a master of the bloody Mary’s ! X",5,2019,08,16
124,"Clean, central, good staff, bit too cramped for my liking","Nice hotel claiming to be Luxe top end. Very clean, quite, good service, rooms are up to date but at the same time very basic. Location is great aroudn the corner from the tube and a bunch of grocery stores. The single room was very small, no proper desk for a laptop where one can work which was annoying. When checking for upgrade options the next level up was over 100 GBP.",4,2019,08,16
124,Amazing experience and amazing doorman!,"I stayed here fore some few nights and the experience was amazing ! Loved the restaurant (Neptune) and the food experience. My room was really big and cosy, and has the best doorman that I’ve met so far, Mr. Valter, who was super receptive and attentive to all the details, super professional and super nice! 5 stars to all the team!",5,2019,08,15
124,"Beautiful hotel, great location, some issues ","Let me say up front the hotel is stunning. The renovation and design is incredible. It was my first stay at a Kimpton and as an IHG Platinum ambassador I had high hopes.
At checkin my hopes of an upgrade (as per my IHG ambassador status)  were dashed but as compensation daily breakfast was offered - a money saver for me. 
They also gave me a “raid the bar” voucher as part of my ambassador status (though it should be noted this is for 15 pounds - the exact price of a Cocktail in their bar) plus another voucher for two drinks because I knew their secret password (a kimpton thing). You won’t want for a glass of wine in this hotel!
On arrival to the room I discovered something akin to a shoebox. I literally couldn’t open my bag. Plus, despite my clear requests on my file it was VERY far from an elevator and WiFi was spotty.
I proactively approached the front desk and while I had a free wine (their daily social hour is a great thing) a new room was found. Apparently same size but much better designed. 
A word of warning - walls are thin and I would often hear banging and moving around above and below. Also many rooms look into the “courtyard” - the rooms are so close you can literally see into each others windows.
Daily breakfast was on Neptune. The buffet was very basic but the a la carte offer better (although after a week I was ready for a change). Service is charming and engaged.
Social hour drinks are in Burr and co - it’s nice but again depends which staff member is assigned. Some would rather gossip with other team members but on my last night had a fantastic female staffer who proactively topped up glasses and offered the free snacks. 
Inside the room there are free snacks ( popcorn and chocolate) and an espresso machine which is brilliant. The closet space was good for one person and the bathtub was deep and the water pressure great. 
Housekeeping was similarly hit and miss- I noticed a coaster from the bedside table had dropped on day two of my stay. It stayed on the floor for two days straight - it because a bit of a game for me. But again on the final night housekeeping was great. 
This is in direct contrast to the reception team who never once asked how I was (I was in for five nights). I never received the complimentary mineral water as per my status and not even a letter or a note from any manager. Invisible woman it seems. 
When i checked out it was suggested that I should have booked a bigger room because if my long stay. Helpful. 
Again location is perfect - close to some cafes and eateries and a cab ride from soho and other places. Concierge and front door staff were also great. 
It’s a beautiful hotel. And it was one of the busiest weeks of the year. Would I go back? Probably but I would shell out for a bigger room ",4,2019,08,14
124,Excellent,"This was a trip to see a show in London. We wanted it to be special and for a couple of reasons chose the Kimpton Fitzroy.
Hotel is very plush and ornate, so much marble. The room we had was typical hotel size and layout but nicely appointed. Love the Nespresso machine and the snacks. 
They have a free drink hour in the adjoining bar/bistro between 5 and 6 whic was nice.
If you go by car suggest you park and go park in the underground car park alongside the holiday in the adjacent street. £25 for 24 hours isn't too bad for central London.
Staff where helpful and attentive although the concierge struggled with my enquiry about where to park.
All in all a great stay.",5,2019,08,14
124,"Fantastic hotel, lovely interiors",My wife and I stayed here for a night away from the kids for our anniversary. What a treat. The hotel was wonderfully decorated and we had a lovely room on the 7th floor. They have a fantastic café and bar area and the room for breakfast was amazing. We both said we would go back again. The staff were very attentive and made you feel special.,5,2019,08,13
124,Beautiful Stay,"Stayed one night to celebrate our Pearl Wedding and hotel is absolutely stunning!. Easy check-in and given our room early which was such a bonus as had plans booked. Room beautiful and spotless. Bed comfy and everything you need or want catered for. Air-con broke but staff immediately brought fan and then we were offered £50 bar credit!., we chose complimentary breakfast instead which was gorgeous and we were looked after so well by John in breakfast room. Perfect central location close to tube with buses passing frequently to. One of the nicest hotels we have stayed at, it is huge but does not lose its appeal as decor is stunning - bar and restaurants beautiful. All staff totally professional and can’t do enough to help. Can not wait to rebook. Also lovely dessert with message for our anniversary!., nice touch ....5 star all the way x",5,2019,08,11
124,Wow what a fabulous hotel,"we were stranded in London overnight due the the trains all being cancelled and found this beautiful hotel online and so pleased we did, what a stunning building, exquisite inside. The room was a little small but the quality made up for it. We had stayed two night in another hotel in Mayfair and it was not a patch on the Kimpton. The staff were amazing, looked after us so well after a traumatic ordeal at kings cross, made is feel welcome and safe. Thank you, a very lucky fine, we will be back.,",5,2019,08,10
124,"Beautiful hotel, delightful staff","I stayed for just a night during the stopover  in London. The staff was very helpful and courteous. The hotel is beautiful and immaculate inside and out. The indoor Sun Terrace was perfect for a late afternoon drink.
Adam was our host in the restaurant for morning brunch. His enthusiasm and courtesy was truly remarkable! The English breakfast was delicious.",5,2019,08,10
124,Nice hotel,"Very nice hotel with good amenities. Gabriela at the bar mixes great drinks and had great suggestions for London! 
Stayed four nights for work and the hotel is well located and central which is great for getting around. The interior of the hotel is as cool at the exterior.",5,2019,08,10
124,Details missing,"Disappointed in our room which even though it was a deluxe room was very small. There was only just enough room to ‘swing a cat’ and if you were more than 5’ 7” tall, there was no way you could stand up and wash your hair under the shower. There was only one bathrobe provided (was there with my husband), one small bar of chocolate between us and two Nespresso coffee pods, stingy to stay the least. 

There never seemed to be enough reception staff on duty as every time we needed reception, we had to queue. 

We ate breakfast in Neptune and it was disgusting. We were originally taken to a table shoehorned in next to another couple which was ridiculous as the room wasn’t full. In addition the banquette was dirty and laden with the debris of the previous occupants.

The buffet breakfast was the worst I have ever encountered with limited choice and poor quality and cold. 

The second day of our stay we had breakfast at Burrs which was very nice. 

I will not be staying here again.",3,2019,08,09
124,Birthday treat,We stayed at this beautiful hotel whilst we were on a theatre break which my daughter bought me for my special birthday. From the moment we arrived we were treated really special! We were lucky enough to be “ guest of the day” so up- grades to a suite! The suite was exquisite. There was everything in there that you could possibly need including a birthday chocolate treat! Food was excellent and yet another birthday treat arrived at dinner! Staff were all very friendly and efficient. I was made to feel so special. I would stay here again in a heartbeat!,5,2019,08,08
124,Disastrously small  room,"220 Pounds per night single room is definitely not a cheap option among global big city 5* hotels. I was there from 13th to 19th July to attend a conference and I find that room 401 allowed to me is the smallest room I availed till date in my near 69 years of age. I made my reservation through one Mamoon Rehman  in May and was expecting to be placed in a better room.  Unfortunately it was disastrous. Yes tiny bed and little over space left and toilet were clean. Restaurants and other basic amenities were ok. But one surprise thing I experienced while checking in. I was attended by the receptionist called ISABEL while checking in and she WANTED ME TO AUTHORIZE HER(hotel) to keep 600 Pounds for extra costs. I asked why you want me to allow you to charge such a bid amount for jus5 tidbits? She said in a very clear tone that THIS IS HOTEL POLICY TO keep 100 Pounds per day for any eventualities. I must admit that I am a very frequent traveler but neve cama across such COMPULSORY Hotel Policy. However, I protested and refused to bend to UNWRITTEN policy and finally she settled for 200 pounds. Curiously I spent  around 157 pounds and yet to receive the balance to my account till date. This is not a fair policy practiced by this hotel. 
I strongly condemn it. Request others to be more careful on choosing room or depositing in advance by credit card for local expenses.",3,2019,08,06
124,Amazing stay,"Just wow. My partner booked this as a surprise birthday trip and we had the most amazing time. Service was impeccable, stunning decor and an amazing suite. We now don’t feel we could stay anywhere else whilst in London.",5,2019,08,06
124,Really great place to stay.,"Second time here, really wonderful. All the staff, and there are enough, are keen to make you comfortable and welcome. They are interested in what you are doing. A home from home plus. A good position, overlooks Russell Square, close to British Museum, good options to eat in the hotel and close by. Walking distance to Trafalgar square and Embankment. Perfect place to stay.",5,2019,08,06
124,Amazing Service,"I travel a lot with work and occasional get some down time.. to spend more time in hotels. This one is special. From the check in experience where your IHG status is fully rewarded to the fantastic decor, style and feel of the hotel. We were checked in by Andrea who had the perfect mix of professionalism and friendliness, our room wasn't ready as it was 11am so she took my mobile number and contacted when it was - the room was lovely (standard room), not huge but spotlessly clean and nice french windows to the outside world. As an IHG Ambassador on a points stay I still was offered 15 pounds per room (we had two) to spend anywhere in the hotel and invited to a 5-6pm drinks evening. In short a great hotel in a fantastic location and go for the breakfast it's worth it! My first Kimpton but it wont be my last.",5,2019,08,06
124,"Good Hotel, A little removed from city life","We stayed as a family in this hotel for a one night layover.  With two children, we had to book two nights in order to ensure room availability upon our arrival early in the day.  The checkin was speedy.  With two children, we reserved a deluxe room.  The room was a good size with comfortable king beds.  

The drawback of this hotel (which perhaps maybe a draw for those who like quieter neighborhoods) is its location.  It is somewhat distant from some of the major hubs of london life such as Kensington, Chelsea area.",4,2019,08,05
124,"Amazing live music, cocktails and vibes! ","We walking to Russell Sq Station and saw £5 cocktails on an A-board outside a bar called Burr - of course, we thought why not. We popped in and were welcomed by an amazing live singer who really blew us away - she really fits the space and the atmosphere was amazing. It really sums up London having one of these gems on a corner somewhere. I saw that it was connected to a hotel too, but we didn’t have chance to see. Cocktails were great ",5,2019,08,04
124,Amazing! The best hotel in London!!!,"I travel extensively globally and this is one of the best hotels I have ever stayed at. The rooms and bars and restaurants are beautiful. The best part of the hotel is the friendliness and helpfulness of the staff. The bellmen, concierge, housekeeping, and check in staff were the kindest people I’ve ever encountered while traveling. They all deserve the highest ratings possible. Claire and Walter were fabulous along with all of the other staff members. I will always stay at this hotel in my future travels to London and I highly recommend this hotel. 
The location is also fabulous, safe and so close to the tube.",5,2019,08,04
124,The best hotel I never stayed at.,"Yep. I'm reviewing a hotel where I didn't actually stay. Here's why- I was staying in a lovely flat in Bloomsbury and I stopped in the Fitzroy's excellent Coffee Shoppe, Burr. The coffee was truly excellent and the atmosphere was lively and fun (caught a 1940's style singer one afternoon who was just fantastic) and I told myself I'd review the spot when I got home! BUT then on my way out I asked the concierge, Connor, a few questions about the neighborhood and he treated me like a valued guest even though I wasn't stating there. Next night I brought my niece and her husband the the Fitz bar for cocktails. They were divine. The staff was friendly and fun and the live music was top notch. I didn't see any of the rooms, but the property itself is flat out gorgeous (along with the whole staff). The location is a dream- the property overlooks Russell Square- and I will absolutely stay there the next time I am in London- and you should too. ;)",5,2019,08,04
124,Maria at Burr bar,"Maria, David and Jonathan gave me an excellent service it was mine and my husbands wedding anniversary and they made us feel special they gave us complimentary champagne and nibbles to celebrate our special day I highly recommend this bar and the live music also",5,2019,08,01
124,Fabulous and FRIENDLY SERVICE,"I had a brief business trip to London and stayed here. The rooms are perfect. More importantly the staff  was awesome!  Two great brothers worked the front door (one in the morning and the other in the evening). And Walter was delightful my last day. The bar there is amazing and Morton makes incredible cocktails and if you ask, will show a magic trick or two. My only regret was that I was only here 48 hours. A great hotel that makes business travel feel like a holiday!
",5,2019,07,31
124,Amazing from check in to check out,"As we arrived we walked in to the foyer and were instantly hit with the wow factor, it was spotlessly clean, had a nice smell and simply looked amazing, every person we walked past from the front steps to the reception desk acknowledged us with at least a smile.
We were slightly early and our room wasn’t quite ready but our bags were stored and taken up to our room as soon as it was, meanwhile we headed to Burr&Co (A coffee shop/restaurant/bar) for a quick drink and it had a very friendly, relaxed atmosphere and was also very clean.
Once we had our room keys we went to the lifts (4 separate lifts so no waiting for ages trying to get one) and went up to our floor and the wow factor continued in the corridor and then in to our bedroom, it was all bang up to date with a contemporary feel (we had a double room with an outside view), a very well stocked room with amazing toiletries (which I purchased some of to take home), chocolate, poshcorn (fancy pop corn), water and the usual teas and coffee.
Breakfast the following morning was in Neptune restaurant and were greeted by Andrew who was very friendly and spoke to us on a personal level and made us feel more than just guests in a hotel, we had the Eggs Benedict (which was amazing) but there’s also option for a continental breakfast and other hot choices.
On our way out we spoke to Andrew again about an evening in the hotel and he arranged for us to have drinks in Fitz’s Bar then a meal back in Neptune.
Later that day we went in to Fitz’s Bar and were greeted by yet more friendly staff who brought us over some drink menus, table snacks and water.
We were offered advice about different cocktails and beers and even offered cocktails that weren’t necessarily on the menu, overall we had a great time in there. Back in Neptune for our evening meal we were served by Meg who was super friendly and advised us on certain must haves with the steaks we ordered, food was all amazing and beautifully cooked and to top it off, (as a treat for my birthday, arranged by Meg herself) a small piece of a chocolate cake with a candle was brought out, made the evening complete, thank you.
Upon returning to our room we were greeted with a sweet treat and a hand written letter from Isabel (guest relations) hoping we were enjoying our stay and to wish me a happy birthday.
The staff here are nothing but helpful and so polite and nothing seems to be too much trouble.
The hotel is amazing, everywhere looks great and the cleanliness is second to none
I’m sad we only had two nights here and I cannot wait for our return trip.

I would strongly recommend staying here if you’re in London, it’s in a prime location and will make everywhere else you’ve stayed previously seem sub standard.

Thank you all for an amazing few days",5,2019,07,30
124,"Super hotel, well situated, great staff","We've used this hotel chain in the USA so took the opportunity to stay in the London Fitzroy.  This is a great hotel and the first thing I noticed was the warm welcome from every member of staff.  They are helpful, efficient and welcoming - a real asset.  Check in and check out were quick and easy and the room was spotlessly clean and very well equipped with a whole range of things available if you need then or have forgotten things.  I borrowed some hair straighteners which arrived quickly and were good quality. I didn't use the restaurants but look forward to that in the future.",5,2019,07,30
124,Bubbles and Brunch,"We popped in to the Kimpton Fitzroy Hotel, next door to Russell Square station, for a drink but the brunch looked so inviting that we decided to stay and eat. Front of house Georgia and Adam were so welcoming and made us feel very special. Included in the price of £29 is a glass of Tattinger Champagne (which was chilled to perfection), buffet style starter, main cooked to order and dessert from the buffet bar. The new range of summer salads includes a deliciously light and refreshing salad of pear, avocado, blackberries and rocket - the flavour combinations really do work.  The beetroot hummus was divine served with fresh crunchy crudités - we loved the elegantly fine carrots, so crunchy and full of flavour. Adam was very attentive throughout and made sure that the chef was informed when we were ready for our main dishes to be cooked. The burger was really juicy and delicious. The chicken and waffle dish came with a fried egg and duo of tasty sauces. 
Dessert selection was good - we chose peanut macaroons, peach slice, Eton mess, lemon meringue tart (best pastry I have tasted for some time). Cheese, brownies, creme brûlée and gold tipped strawberry tarts were also available. We had a lovely relaxing afternoon in the enchanting Neptune restaurant. Great value - three courses with champagne in a central London 4 star hotel. We will be back!",5,2019,07,28
124,Disappointment!,"I stayed in this hotel back in April.  It was a very pleasant experience and therefore I came back for six nights this trip and unfortunately the experience was a very disappointing one!  I noticed ants in the bathroom and had to remind the hotel staff twice until they finally did something about it. After they finally treated it, you would expect that they would leave you a note and advised the customer they took care of this terrible problem.  Instead, I needed to ask the front desk myself and they eventually responded and left me with gummies in a cheesy brown bag as their gesture for the issue.  After they treated the ants issue, the next day I had a fly in my bathroom and I honestly was tired of notifying the hotel.  The bathroom also has a weird smell to it, especially in the morning after an entire night of closing the bathroom door.  My trip was quite hectic this time and therefore I made tea on my first nigh of stay and did not make tea again until towards the end of my trip.  Guess what? The leftover tea was still in the teapot (by the time I noticed it, it would have been Day 5or Day 6?!) and they never cleaned or replaced it!!  After this stay, I am so done with this property.  It was a shame as it is a beautiful hotel.  However, the the quality of the property in terms of cleanliness and comfort and the staff service was simply not there. I would never want to stay in this hotel again as I really had a very unpleasant stay this time.",2,2019,07,28
124,Neptune restaurant ,"Last night of our short visit. Felt I had to say what a excellent hotel this is in the heart of London. Had one of the best sea food meals ever, the staff were brilliant they service was very good. Thanks for everything. We will be back. ",5,2019,07,25
124,Afternoon tea at the hotel,Had a lovely afternoon tea with the family here. Waiter was really friendly and gave just the right level of attention and top ups. Even gave us a sneaky peak at the wedding room beautifully set up for that day's wedding and Thibault came out to say hi (I was a little starstruck so didn't ask any of the questions i could have) but he had made all the delightful bakes we had just demolished.,5,2019,07,25
124,I never wanted to leave,"I have 26 and was traveling with my mom. We love nice things and this hotel was beyond! They upgraded us to the suite for our 3 night stay and it was so magical. It was incredible and I never wanted to leave. This hotel was also super accommodating and set up a tea for us on one of the days. 
They go above and beyond. I would stay here again!",5,2019,07,22
124,"Ambience, glamorous bar, service","This is a beautiful hotel in a great location - across the road from a lovely park and around the corner from the tube. It has great restaurants and a glam bar. All staff we encountered were excellent. Covi, on the front desk was a standout - friendly, professional and incredibly helpful. She was excellent - having a great attention for details, she followed up/actioned on our late checkout request - important given our long haul flight later that day. More than that - Covi had a fantastic sense of humour and excellent engagement with us as guests. Kimpton Fitzroy, you should be proud to have such excellent staff. See you next time!",5,2019,07,21
124,If  you want impeccable customer service and exquisite environment...,"...this hotel should be your first choice in London! 
Lovely room with comfortable bed and big bathroom - mine was facing the inside courtyard and it was so quiet, one would think we were in the countryside instead of the heart of a busy metropolis! The breakfast was amazing: great variety for the continental options, eggs Benedict with fresh hollandaise and fluffy waffles done both sweet and savoury - no better way to start a day! Neptune is an excellent choice for dinner: the fish of the day was fresh and prepared flawlessly, while the steak was simply seasoned and grilled to a perfect medium rare! Afterwards, pop in to Fitz for a fancy cocktail or some of their premium whisky and a chance to see the world walk by Russell square...
One can find plenty of five star hotels in London and they all offer great rooms and food; what sets the Kimpton Fitzroy apart from the bulk is their people. Juliana at the reception was professional without being impersonal, caring without being overwhelming and polite without artifice. The entire concierge team helped with advice on food and bars, directions and tickets to the theatre. The breakfast crew was amazing - i don't know how they can be so nice to hungry, uncaffeinated guests, especially as early as we went to eat! The Neptune crew was knowledgeable and offered some great suggestions - trust them because they definitely know what they are talking about!
All in all, this was a truly memorable stay in a magnificent building with all the luxuries one could want - and the added bonus of professional yet friendly staff, who transformed the memorable to unforgettable!!!

P.S.: If you like chocolate, do try their Valrhona bar: it's a religious experience! If you do not like chocolate, do try their Valrhona bar: it will convert you!!!",5,2019,07,21
124,Comfortable new hotel,"This beautiful and wholly renovated property is in a great location for food, underground, park, not far from Covent garden and major museums.  The design of the rooms is clever and attractive.  Has good bed, excellent bathroom, and is very quiet (i had an inside room - which I often prefer.  I travel solo. Because of the shoebox-sized rooms usually referred to as standard shown as the lowest price, I now am careful to reserve at least the nest highest size/cost room.  But despite that, despite the clever design, this is yet one more property that does NOT have any place to place luggage - except on the bed, or in front of the door at night.  If two persons were using the so-called 'double' room, it would be really tight.  I went down the street to L'Oscar and got the most beautiful room ever, anywhere with a huge room & an alcove for luggage. But over all, the Fitzroy is a nice hotel.",4,2019,07,20
124,Brunch,"The brunch was absolutely amazing,the staff were so kind,courteous and attentive,giorgia and Adam went over and beyond!and the food was divine,they had a wide range of starters and delicious desserts😁overall wonderful experience.....",5,2019,07,20
124,Beautiful Property,"Love this property! To the beautiful decor, friendly staff, and spacious rooms (for U.K.) I don’t have one bad thing to say. Of course Kimpton properties always have amazing amenities and had quick and strong wifi. 
It’s in a great location in the city.... lots to do in walking distance. ",5,2019,07,20
124,We love Walter (the doorman)!,"We had a great stay in London and at the Kimpton, but the star of the Kimpton was by far the wonderful Walter! Who was always there with a warm smile and helpful advice. 
Although it is a beautiful hotel, there is some room for improvement in relation to housekeeping for visitors that stay for more than one night. 
Beds were very comfortable, and we will definitely stay there again!",4,2019,07,19
124,WOW!,"This is every inch a five-star hotel.  We had one of the most beautiful rooms we've ever had.  The entire staff were nice, very friendly and wonderfully helpful.  The hotel has some top notch security features.  The area of London where it is located feels very safe and is extremely quiet.  We didn't eat in the hotel so cannot comment on that aspect.  There are some nice little cafes nearby. ",5,2019,07,18
124,Superb hotel,"The attention to detail in this hotel is amazing. The room I was in for 2 nights was spotless and immaculate. Room service was good and the gym well appointed with bottles of water to hand.
I highly recommend this place for both the hotel and it’s location, I’ll definitely be staying again!",5,2019,07,17
124,A grande old dame rejuvenated,"I had stayed twice before at the what used to be the Principal London but was not able to do so in my 2017 visit as it was under major rehabilitation. With the renovations now fully complete I was not sure what to expect as I rather liked the old world, slightly decayed feel of the hotel on my previous stays. Thankfully, the elegance of the grande old dame has been beautifully preserved and polished in what is now the Kimpton Fitzroy.  The place looked wonderful and I was very satisfied with my room which, as a small single without a view of Russell Square Park, was actually quite reasonably priced for central London in a hotel of this standard. The staff provided excellent, personalised service and were extremely accommodating and knowledgeable. At first glace I wasn't so sure about the new very fancy looking restaurant as I really liked the previous breakfast set up of a more simple dining hall with a traditional full English-style buffet. But the à la carte breakfast items were so sumptuous, the service so prompt and the waiters so friendly and solicitous that I wouldn't have thought of going anywhere else.  The dinner menu and service were equally good and I was pleased to invite a local friend for cocktails and an evening meal. Best of all for me was that that while it has been upgraded the hotel has been able to provide such great services without becoming pretentious or grossly over-priced.  Looking forward to my next visit to London. ",5,2019,07,15
124,Stunning Facility,"This is a beautiful facility in a great location. Staff is superb. Eating/drinking options at the hotel are first rate. Only complaint was the size of my bathroom. It was so small, that all moves have to be thought out and choreographed. I was on a business trip traveling alone so I take things as they come. If I were traveling with my spouse, it would have been a different story.",4,2019,07,14
124,Brilliant Stay at a beautiful Hotel,Had a short break in London and what a great hotel to stay at. Beautiful rooms and helpful staff made the stay a treat. It is also brilliantly situated to explore central London. Don’t for get to say hello to Lucky George the Dragon. Will definitely be back.,5,2019,07,13
124,Fantastic Fitzroy is Fabulous!!! ,"Wow! 

What a stunning architectural building that has just recently been entirely refurbished from top to toe, restoring it to its former glory; it’s spectacular both inside & out & the attention to detail is highly impressive. 

The Public areas are gorgeous & beautifully appointed throughout but equally very different, creating very unique & alternative vibes & ambiences; whether it’s Fitz Bar for the best cocktails & pre-dinner drinks or Palm Court for a stunning afternoon tea, but everywhere has been beautifully refurbished & it still has that super-fresh, brand-spank feel about it & there’s definitely something to suit every taste & age group all under one roof! 

The bedrooms are generally small, compact & bijoux; the upgraded deluxe are slightly bigger, but not much; but they are all gorgeously appointed, crisp linens, big fluffy towels & just really stylish & indulgent. 

Overall the customer service is generally very very good, very attentive & there’s a really great Team, with some very sincere Members of the Team, for whom nothing is too much trouble. 

I have been especially impressed with Concierge, Sean whom upon my most recent visit, I’ve sadly learned has since jumped ship to Knightsbridge’s Mandarin Oriental; but thank you Sean for all your help & service, you were amazing & you will be missed. 

Particular thanks & recognition Sean for the stunning recommendations to nearby Italian gems, Caffe Tropea, located in the park opposite & Maceallaio in Fitzrovia, a short walk through the University; highly recommend both establishments if staying at the Kimpton Fitzroy, they are both exceptional but very different in style. 

Please see separate reviews for each. 

Jeffrey at the Fitzroy is an equally impressive Concierge contact; the service Jeffrey extends to Customers is consistently excellent & his knowledge & advice for local-finds is second to none. 

Thank you Jeffrey, your assistance & interaction was greatly appreciated & your command of the English language is faultless & we will be sure to undertake your recommendations within your native-land, The Netherlands. 

Finally, other notable Staff Superstars, have to be Stephanie Harrison, event planner Extraordinaire, whom is the most personable, professional, proficient & charming Lady; full of ideas & very easy to do business with & whom we highly recommend for all your event needs. 

Equally, Bogda & Natalie from the hospitality Teams provided consistently outstanding customer service & both are also so very personable & professional & couldn’t have been kinder or more caring. 

We highly recommend the Hotel for food, drinks, afternoon teas, luncheons, dinners, stays & events; essentially the Kimpton Fitzroy really is knocking the ball out the park in every respect.

124,Beautiful hotel- tiny rooms,"Recently spent two nights at the KImpton. The hotel is stunning.  Completely redone, everything is beautiful. The building is huge with two restaurants. The staff was very helpful and accommodating. The only complaint is that the rooms were tiny. Honestly, the bathroom while really nice, was next to the side of the bed, like 2 feet from  my pillow. You could barely stand in the bathroom and close the door. The standard room is simply not big enough for 2 ppl. If we were staying more than 2 nights, I prob would have asked for a room change.
Area is great, lots to do around it. Metro is right there. Easy to wall to many different areas in London. 
Would def stay again but only in an upgraded room. (We stayed on points and have elite status, the hotel was fully booked and no upgrades were available, but they did company’s breakfast, which was very nice).",4,2019,07,09
124,Classy and posh!,This is a wonderful hotel to visit in London.  It is a historic building that has been maintained very well.  Our family of four (including two teenagers) stayed in the Deluxe Room with 2 queen beds and it was plenty spacious with windows that opened slightly for ventilation.  Service attitude of staff is great and they go out of their way to make you feel welcome.  They even brought us some goodies in the afternoon for a nice snack and refilled our in-room supplies as part of the turn-down service.,5,2019,07,07
124,Gorgeous Hotel,"Stayed here over night. The hotel is gorgeous and spectacular to look at. Waking. Distance from the British Museum, and in the middle of theater district in London, great location. Staff is very friendly. The restaurant was good, cafe was ok and over priced. There is a Cafe Nero across the stress which is better for coffee. Overall, amazing hotel!",5,2019,07,07
124,"Missing ""service"" characteristics of a 5* hotel","We arrived to the hotel yesterday at 2.15 PM. After 15 minutes at check-in, while we were informed that the room will be ready at 3 PM max, we decided to wait. Yet room wasn't ready at 3.15. When I asked about the delay, Anne the manager came in person to apologise and informed me that room still needs another 20-30 minutes, and no other room is available as hotel is fully booked. When I complained that this is unacceptable, and that I was sick with fever and very tired, a room at the end of the hotel was ready by magic (without any upgrade of course)! 
And tonight, we had another mishap with the concierge.
Just to say that sometimes, being worthy of 5* needs much more than amenities, pool, decoration.... It's the service and professional attention to customers' wellbeing that makes people visit again..",3,2019,07,05
124,Lovely hotel in need of better concierge services,"We recently checked out of the Fitzroy after a 7-night stay. The hotel is well-situated in Russell Square and convenient to the Underground. The hotel lobby is beautifully decorated and the building itself is impressive. Our room was clean and comfortable although a bit small for two. The hotel was quiet at night making for a good night’s sleep. The front desk staff were excellent, however we were regularly disappointed by the concierge services. Often there was no one at the desk and while a bellman would valiantly try to fill in, they did not have the expertise to do so.  When a concierge was present, they were not able to provide much assistance. Would I stay again?  Yes, but I’d need to do more of my own advance planning for reservations and recommendations. ",4,2019,07,04
124,What an amazing Hotel,"The hotel is aesthetically beautiful inside and out. The architecture is amazing and is steeped in history linked to the Titanic. The staff made us feel like royalty and were very polite without being over the top. Fitz bar is a good setting for an evening drink. Palm court is a beautiful setting for afternoon tea and the food is amazing, I would definitely recommend it. Burr&Co is a lovely coffee shop too. I would definitely stay in the hotel again.",5,2019,07,03
124,World class hotel ,"I visited your lovely hotel for a family wedding and have to say a massive thank you the hotel is lovely, great location easy to get around and see what London has to offer . Francesca from restaurant was amazing great service with a smile I couldn’t of asked for better, Umberto is a real living legend his customer service is truly outstanding so incredibly warm and friendly and the reception and concierge team are real superheroes very welcoming warm and friendly, massive thank you to Covi and Imma and finally thank you to Mollie from Guest Relations your welcome note and treat was very much appropriated . I will definitely be staying again and would recommend this lovely hotel to anyone it’s is lovely. Richard xx",5,2019,07,03
124,"Not a 5 Star, Small rooms, Great restaurant - Neptune. A smile goes a long way.","Walking into the reception, everything was OK with the check in experience. I think i got the smallest room in the world and considering it was a corporate booking it seemed strange. 

Amenities were reasonable in the hotel, nothing out of the ordinary but still lovely. 

The Fitz bar seemed very unapproachable as I had asked about the "" Kimpton happy hour"" and they seemed to palm me off and find my own way to the restaurants despite telling them i could not find it. Although when I got to Neptune, the staff were delightful, its hard to think that these staff had been working at the hotel.  

Overall, not a 5 star, still need some work on the staff and amenities (no coffee in the cafe before 0730 in a central London hotel) and a smile goes a long way. 

PS. I had the most lovely receptionist when I was checking out in the afternoon. I do not remember her name but her happiness was infectious. Please send on her my regards.",3,2019,06,30
124,A good hotel,"The building is amazing and is very impressive on arrival. The staff were all very friendly and helpful with the exception of the breakfast staff who were friendly but completely unhelpful. It took forever to be served, the food took forever By the last day we didn’t order anything as it just worth the hassle. Strange in an otherwise excellent hotel. The rooms were small but comfortable with excellent showers.",4,2019,06,26
124,"Not 5 star, but reasonable value","We recently stayed at the Kimpton Fitzroy which is conveniently located close to the hussle and bustle of London. 

The facade and many of the internal features are possibly more than 100 years old. Thankfully, if you are like me, I like a modern bedroom and restaurant and this is exactly what the owners have provided. Modern facilities in an iconic building situated opposite a park in the middle of the city.

The foyers and passages are wide and tastefully decorated. The bedroom was indeed modern, a reasonable size and the bathroom was excellent.

The food in the restaurants (breakfast and dinner) was average even though the settings were attractive. It is possible that the hotel was on a cost saving exercise, as the some (standard) items at the buffet breakfast continually ran out. When asked for replacement, the waiters stated that there was no stock. Either this is bad stock management or mean in terms of cost saving.

The employees right throughout the hotel were very friendly - possibly the most friendly I have experienced in Europe. Apparently most of the employees are not English and that may be the key. That said, not one person offered to assist with luggage.

Therefore, overall a 4 rating. Not at a 5 rating until the offer matches with reality - especially in the food department.

",4,2019,06,26
124,"Good, but expensive..","I stayed at this hotel several times in the last couple of months. Overall this is a very good option: good location, excellent service, comfortable rooms, impressive building and amenities. However, it’s quite expensive and the rooms are small. I may stay here again for business, but will probably look for better value when just visiting London.",4,2019,06,26
124,"Great staffs, Great Food, Great Ambiance!","My partner and I celebrated our anniversary over at Kimpton and was surprised by how detailed the staffs were. They had us a special seat with flowers all decorated. We were warmly welcomed. Most importantly the food was great! The sweets were very nice and tasty. In all, we totally enjoyed our time there and we will come back again when we come to London!",5,2019,06,25
124,Regulars extremely disappointed,"Stay here on a regular basis and enjoy the whole experience, however the last few months I have noticed a real change in behaviour from the hotel management.
The palm court area is now closed most evenings unless there’s a private function which is such a shame as this is a lovely area and allows guests who want a little space and comfort away from the cocktail bar to enjoy, has now being taken away.
To add to this myself and my colleague arrived at the hotel at 11.05pm and pleasantly walked in to the cocktail bar to be told that the bar now closes at 10.30pm on a Sunday and Monday! Bearing in mind this is supposed to be a 5 star IHG in the centre of London I am speechless! 
Having sought the duty managers attention, to which we raised our disappointment, it has to be said that an attitude of not really caring springs to mind. We were basically told that this is a F&B decision and that he could provide us with the contact details of the F&B manger should we wish. Even more laughable we were told we could always get room service in our rooms !
I can’t help but feel let down and disappointed by such a reputable brand of which I am a regular user.
I am left wondering if the price I pay is really worth it !
If you’re wanting a Monday night beer post 10.30pm I strongly advise you to book elsewhere.",1,2019,06,24
124,Pretty good though not 5 stars.,"This is a beautiful building and it has been nicely restored, it is noticeable that the staff are very polite and friendly. It’s an old building so rooms can be odd shapes, this tends to add to the character. Our room was good, 538, but we reorganised the chairs a bit as they are a little large for the space. Good sleep was had and everything worked. Bathroom was a little odd, the sink does not sit square under the wall lights, so if you stand at the sink there is a light right in your face, I doubt is was designed like that. Nightmare shower, too many knobs, no instructions, and not at all logical. Got several soakings. No fan or if so it was not working. Electric towel rail, no way to switch on seemed odd, I like warm towels even in the summer. Breakfast pretty much ok, service can be a bit haphazard but hot items very good. Please put some loose sugar next to the cereals on the buffet, it’s quite normal to want sugar on cereal and I got fed up asking every morning. WiFi worked well everywhere, what a refreshing change. Would I go back? Definitely.",4,2019,06,24
124,Beutiful  hotel,The architecture is amazing. The service is excellent and location is perfect. The ballroom was designed by same person who designed the ballroom on the titanic! (According to the lady I spoke with on the frount desk) the concierge was faultless and more than helpful with directions or anything you needed. I would stay here again,5,2019,06,23
124,First Class On Every Level,"I travel extensively and use hotels all over the world in excess of 100 nights a year. This has been my first experience of the Kimpton brand and it certainly brings a distinct touch of class to the IHG brand. 

The Fitzroy is a 10 minute walk from Euston or Kings Cross mainline stations and is just around the corner from the Russell Square underground station. Russell Square Park is directly opposite. The building itself is a grand dame and it oozes character and quality. The interior is a superb combination of traditional and modern and there are intriguing and charismatic nooks and corners that are styled and furnished with the finest quality materials. Whilst the website suggested that the hotel was fully occupied it never felt busy and it was possible to find a private space at all times. As a Priority Club elite Member I received the customary upgrade and was also able to defer my check out by an hour. The room was ready for the published check in time however, as I was 15 minutes early I was escorted into the Burr and Co Coffee Shop and offered a hot drink. I felt that was a nice touch.

Check in was very professional and interactions with staff felt very natural and spontaneous on all occasions. The public areas of the hotel were extremely attractive and comfortable and the whole ambiance very atmospheric, especially the small sitting room close to the Palm Court. Every area of the hotel was spotlessly clean. Rueben was my receptionist and he was warm, efficient and professional.

Security at the hotel is very high and the lifts are operated from ground level by swiping your room key.  Guests are then directed to a specific lift and it automatically takes you to the correct floor.

I was staying in a junior suite and this was a delight.  There was ample space which consisted of a small entrance lobby which opened in to the main room. There was a fireplace area, a sitting area fitted perfectly into an angular window alcove, a writing desk and a large four poster bed.  Double doors opened into a spacious marble bathroom with twin sinks, a free standing bath tub and a separate rain shower. There were a large number of quality towels and two bathrobes and the toiletries were plentiful and of very high quality.  The bed was incredible comfortable with high quality linens. The lighting had four settings and an appropriate mood could be set.  The air conditioning system was more of a climate control and was soundless.  As the windows had very wide double glazing there was absolutely no noise from outside the hotel.

I sampled the Burr and Co coffee shop, Palm Court Restaurant and Fitz’s Bar.  All were very atmospheric in their own way and music was provided in the evening in Fitz’s.  Prices were very reasonable for such a high quality establishment.

Breakfast was taken in the Neptune restaurant and this was a choice between continental buffet and full table service a la carte.  The food was of the very highest quality and individually prepared.  My server, Eva, was extremely friendly and nothing was too much trouble. She went so far as to prepare my toast.  Fruit juices were available and the orange juice was freshly squeezed.

The Kimpton Fitzroy is an upper 5* hotel offering a 5* service, catering for the more discerning guest.  My visit was immensely enjoyable.",5,2019,06,22
124,Beautiful Hotel. Great location!,"This hotel is stunning. All of the common areas are well kept, clean and beautiful. Front desk staff, bellman and concierge were all so friendly and helpful! Location was great!  Close to the underground and walking distance from good restaurants and pubs. Also, easy taxi and Uber rides from a lot of the attractions. Our family of 4 stayed in a superior room with 2 double beds.  It was spacious and nice, but lacked storage so we weren't able to really unpack for our 5 nights there.  With 2 teenage girls, myself and husband, that was a little hard to deal with.  I felt like there could have been enough room to include a dresser of some sort. I was also disappointed with the restaurants in the hotel.  Breakfast was mediocre at best and pretty expensive for what you get. The service was very slow.  The only place that we could really get pre-dinner drinks and appetizers was in the Fitz bar, which was lovely, but our teenagers couldn't come in with us.  The coffee shop was good for sweets, but didn't really have a very robust breakfast menu.   I would give the Kimpton Fitzroy 5 stars if they had a little more storage in the rooms and better restaurants.  ",4,2019,06,21
124,Hit expectations ,"We took a last minute deal and we’re not disappointed but it depends on your expectations.

What’s to like:
The hotel is well positioned next to Russel square tube which if you use the tube is perfect.

It’s very grand and has a good feel to it, the finishings are nice and feel quality.

The staff are very helpful I really could not fault anyone we encountered.

The bed was very comfortable and the bedding was again quality.

The room was exceptional well equipped, also if you forgot something they would generally help out.

The shoe shine was a nice touch.

Nespresso machine and pods.

What’s not to like,

The room was small, but we were aware of this and for the deal we had I felt like it represented outstanding value.

Inward facing rooms if it’s not what you like, but again I’m fairly hard to please and it wasn’t a problem.

Overall I would definitely go back, I might pay for the bigger room if I was actually going to be in it longer.

",5,2019,06,21
124,Hotel is nice but administration is terrible,"The hotel was nice and the staff there were friendly. 
I had booked the stay using IHG points to try the hotel out. I paid for the full night with points and I find out after I leave that they have also charged my credit card for the stay. Numerous calls, emails and escalation through IHG my issue is still not resolved. In fact the accounts team were pretty rude! Every time they tell me someone will call me back but it never happens. 
I would not stay here again purely because of these experience.",1,2019,06,20
124,"Has seen better times, but","I went there for 1 night and was left, nit sure I be back. The service was excellent, romms good and the location is just very convenient. Easy to get there and you are well looked after. Still not sure",4,2019,06,20
124,One night for leisure,"Stayed at the Kimpton on a Thursday night on the way up to Leeds to see family, taking in a show during the afternoon.

On arrival the check in was very friendly and quick, everything was explained perfectly.

Given a very nice quiet room at the back of the hotel, a good size room for a One Double Bed Urban. There was no upgrade available but was offered 500points as compensation, which unfortunately did not appear on my account.

Ate in the Neptune in the evening and had one of the best steaks I have ever had.

Breakfast in Burr & Co, very good

Highly recommended hotel in a great location.",5,2019,06,19
124,Beautiful building and great service.,"I really love this place. The marble is incredible, the attention to detail exceptional! The building is one of the best in the area. 

I really love the vibe of this place the restaurants and cafe are superb, the bar is beautiful.

5/5",5,2019,06,18
124,Fabulous hotel!,"Stayed here recently on a Friday evening. The hotel is absolutely beautiful and staff were friendly and helpful. My room was gorgeous, very clean and with an extremely comfy bed. Had some cocktails in Fitz’s bar in the evening which was buzzing. This hotel is excellent value for money and better than many more expensive places I have stayed in. I will definitely return and would highly recommend!",5,2019,06,16
124,Stunning hotel ,What a fabulous hotel this place is stunning and has the best beds I have ever slept in.  Its location is just a 10 minute walk from Euston train station and your just another 10 minute walk into the centre of London I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone.  The food is also good aswell ,5,2019,06,16
124,"Beautiful hotel, great location ","We spent a week here on vacation and greatly enjoyed the experience.  The building itself is impressive, from the ornate terra-cotta exterior to the grand marble lobby, and feels historic.  The location is great—just around the corner from the Russell Square tube station, and within walking distance of numerous restaurants and the British Museum.  Staff are friendly and welcoming.  The daily Social Hour (5:00-6:00pm) was a nice touch as well.",5,2019,06,16
124,WOW ! Loved our stay,"Impressive hotel with the warmest of welcomes from Walter - what an absolute star ! He was friendly and funny and he set the tone of our stay. All hotels should have a Walter 
The decor and furnishings in this hotel give it the WOW factor...it has a lot of authentic features. 
The room with twin double beds was spacious with a small lounge to the side and a balcony. The beds were luscious ...super comfy with soft linen and wonderful pillows. I had the best nights sleep for a long time.
Room was well equipped with tea, coffee machine, bathrobes, lovely soft slippers, iron etc Plus 2 large TVs.  Furnishings were very elegant. 
There are 4 drink/eatery places and the only drawback we found with the hotel was each have their own role and times when you can use them.
Burr and Co is a coffee shop but does lunches and seems open all the time 
Palm Court looked absolutely beautiful and we really wanted to go and relax there and have a coffee but it wasn’t ‘allowed’....we never quite worked out when you were allowed in...Shame. 
Neptune is the restaurant and does the most amazing Brunch with a buffet of starters, then main from the menu and then buffet of desserts plus champagne. All of it including the attentive service was fabulous ! 
The Cocktail bar looked lovely. 
This is an amazing hotel which I will definitely visit again. It’s not cheap but is very reasonable when you look at what you are getting and for special occasions it’s spot on. 
Great location 1min walk from Russell Sq tube and a good part of London to explore",5,2019,06,16
124,Exceptional,"From A to Z exceptional stay! The most valuable asset of this hotel is definitely the concierges. But let me start with Presley at reservations so responsive and helpful online making you feel at home even before arriving to the front desk team, young and efficient. Then of course the concierges a really exceptional, professional, smiling and efficient team. Knowledgeable and helpful during tough times like Connor (got robbed and he advised me) smiling and resourceful like Luis Cesar (speaks like 10 languages by the way) and active like Abi a great team!
The Fitz’s and Burr & Co are very good options for drinks and dinner. The location would have been great if it hadn’t proven to be unsafe for me (phone robbed by pickpocket on bike) but the proximity of the russell square station is very convenient especially that it is a Piccadilly line.
The room I had was quite small but bathroom convenient. It has all you need for a business trip.
The only thing to improve is the speed of wifi or providing an option for upgrade for faster upload/download.
Coming back for sure, if police improves the security around. All in all great stay despite all the problems!

124,#1 Kimpton,"As Kimpton superfans, my wife and I have now stayed at 33 of their hotels and the Fitzroy now sits atop that list.  Combine Kimpton flair and British hospitality and you have the Fitzroy.  Every detail of our stay was absolutely superb.  We were upgraded to a luxurious one bedroom suite, which had a spectacular spa bathroom.  The hotel is located in the tony Russell Square section of London which is within walking distance of tons of great restaurants, museums and other local attractions.  Service was unsurprisingly superb and the dining options at the hotel were top notch.  We will definitely be returning during our next trip to London.",5,2019,06,12
124,A beautiful hotel,"We were blown away by the beauty and style of the hotel. It is positively gleaming after it's refurbishment. A lovely surprise to be upgraded to a junior suite, and we wished we had had more time to make use of the room, rather than being out and about all day! There were so many little touches such as the tuck box, handy umbrellas, beautiful ornaments which added to the already luxurious surroundings. The bathroom had so much space - and actual daylight -so rare in a hotel. We liked that the toiletries were larger sized (and obviously meant to stay in the room) because it made it seem more like home than fiddly wee bottles. We were mighty impressed by the fact there was no noise at all from the AC and extractor fans. This is a big plus for us. Another room detail that is important to us is proper duvet covers, rather than triple sheeting and I was delighted to find this here. The bed was so comfortable! 

The real jewels in the crown were the hotel staff. What a lovely bunch of smiley people, obviously enjoying their work. Nothing was too much trouble, including dealing with the contents of a case which and been left out in the rain at the airport (discovered at 10pm and suit required at 8am the next day). 

We enjoyed interesting cocktails and mini bites in Fitz's bar, and breakfast was tasty in Neptunes where it was lovely that the staff had a minute to chat.

All in all a superb stay and we will definitely be back.",5,2019,06,11
124,Amazing overnight stay,"My wife and I stayed at Kimpton Fitzroy on 8/6/19, from the moment we arrived it was faultless the aroma of infused Green Tea as you walk in is amazing. Every single member of staff was so charming and helpful from the front desk, bar staff waiting staff to the cleaning staff who all greet you with a smile and a hello. We opted for a Junior Suite which was large and beautifully furnished, the bed was so comfortable and the linen was very high quality. Walk in shower with a huge rainfall head was wonderful. We had a few lovely G&T's in the Palm Court bar prior to dinner then dined on Oysters and Bubbles in the Neptune restaurant. All in all a wonderful stay, breakfast was superb, the only negative was that we only had one night and two or three would of been so relaxing. We stay in hotels regularly and this for me is how they should all try to be......WONDERFUL",5,2019,06,10
124,Great stay,"Superb hotel, great welcome very friendly and accommodating staff. Room was lovely, clean, comfortable and beautifully decorated, the gin, macarons, popcorn and chocolate were a very lovely and unexpected bonus! 
Breakfast was delicious. So handy for Euston station and literally just around the corner from a tube station so very convenient. 
We had a brilliant time and would definitely stay again.",5,2019,06,07
124,Beautiful and conveniently located,"I regularly stayed at Kimpton properties in NY and DC, but haven't for some time.  When a co-worker recommended this property, I jumped at the chance to stay again.  I was not disappointed.  I highly recommend you get a room on 1 or 2 (2 or 3 in the States) so that you can enjoy taking the AMAZING staircase back and forth to your room.  (Of course if you're up higher, take the stairs up a flight or two then switch to the lift.)
My king room was ample with everything you'd need except work space.  The table is a bit small if you need to spread out.  The bathroom was nice, but I had to study the shower controls a bit.
I did not eat at the main restaurant, but did enjoy breakfast at Burr & Co. café, which is part of the hotel.  It's more laid-back with street views and an airy feel.  (I will say I'm not sure they know how to make eggs ""over easy,"" but they were fresh and nicely presented.)
The Fitzroy is about a half hour walk to the financial district, Baker Street Station (shorter to Regent's Park), or the Embankment where you'll find Big Ben, Parliament, etc.  After the walk down, and winding through Westminster, I took a cab back for less than 10 pounds (about $13).",5,2019,06,06
124,Very good but.........,"We stayed at the hotel recently, the suite was fantastic and overlooking the square, really faultless. The staff were ALL 100% cheery, happy and could not be more helpful and were all a credit to the hotel. However, in all the public areas was loud piped awful music, so bad that we had to either keep to our suite or go out of the hotel. It was such a pity as the hotel was truly superb in every other way. I did raise the matter but was told the music was something to do with their Brand somethingorother. Such a pity as otherwise it would have become a regular London hotel for me.",4,2019,06,04
124,Beautiful hotel!,"I come to London every month or two for business and this is by far the most beautiful hotel I’ve stayed in! I checked in today and am here for the next 5 nights and am actually looking forward to my stay! Front desk staff were very friendly and helpful, lobby + bar + eating areas are so well decorated creating a lovely ambiance, and the rooms are semi small but have everything you need (a desk, fridge, big bathroom, outlets by the bed, etc). Really impressed and will definitely be staying here from now on when visiting London. I’ll report back after my 5 nights this week but, so far, it’s a wonderful value in the heart of London. ",5,2019,06,02
124,Fantastic Find!,"Absolutely loved our stay here. I did a lot of research on London hotels with rooms to accommodate a family of three (there aren’t many)! I came across the newly renovated Kimpton Fitzroy. We had a great room with two double beds, plenty of space and a huge bathroom with a shower. 

It was perfect for our family. Very clean and spacious. The building and lobby were beautiful. The staff was very accommodating and asked how they could help us every time we entered the building. 

The elevators are very efficient as you input your floor number and it assigns you to an elevator with minimal or no stops. 

The area is very convenient only a few steps to the Russell Square tube stop on the picadilly line and walking distance to both St Pancras and Euston stations with access to many more lines as well as the Eurostar. Cafe Nero was just across the street and was our go-to for breakfast. 

Lovely place. Can’t go wrong here. ",5,2019,06,02
124,Excellent hotel for a city break,"What a beautiful hotel! I stayed here for a solo long weekend, and couldn't have had a better fit for my trip. The recently renovated hotel is absolutely stunning and everyone I interacted with was warm, kind, and wonderful to speak with.

I reached the hotel after a transatlantic flight, and was immediately greeted by reception when I arrived. My flight was quite early, reaching the hotel around 0900, and while my room was not ready, the lovely reception staff arranged for me to use the private bathroom in the exercise facilities, which allowed me to shower and change out of my travel gear. This really made all the difference!

The hotel put me on the list for the next available room and alerted me that one other guest was ahead of me. When I arrived back at the hotel my room was ready (reception tried to call me to alert me when it was ready, my phone had issues preventing me from getting the call). I ended up settled in my room a couple hours prior to the standard check-in time.

I stayed in a single room, which while tiny, was perfect for my stay. It featured a single/twin bed and small table and chair. The room was clean and good lighting in the bathroom. There was no sense of prior smoke in the room or property, which is always key for me, and outside of one evening event in the bar and lobby, I didn't experience any noise issues from either inside or outside of the hotel. The room featured a bathrobe, slippers, and a complimentary assortment of snacks (popcorn, chocolate, water).

I made a couple stops down to the gorgeous lobby bar, Fitz, for some excellently-crafted cocktails from Carey and the other members of the team. They were welcoming and shared their recommendations for favorite restaurants and pubs in the area. I also experienced room service, which was prompt and delicious.

The hotel is right around the corner from the Russel Square tube stop and a quick walk to several restaurants and shops including a nearby Boots and Waitrose. This was a great location and would happily stay in the area again.

I couldn't have picked a better hotel for my getaway - from the decor to the staff to the experience at Fitz, I would stay at the Kimpton Fitzroy any time!",5,2019,06,01
124,"Great location, nice hotel","This hotel is in a fabulous location, it is well maintained and has nice amenities. There's also some great history, the dining room was designed by the same gentleman that designed the Titanic's dining room and they're said to look quite similar. Service was excellent. Be sure to check out the wine cocktail hour in the dining room. The hotel rooms are a bit small but that's to be expected in a city hotel. Overall, this is a great hotel with luxurious touches in a prime location.",5,2019,06,01
124,"A simply amazing hotel!! Many thanks to all the fantastic staff, especially Julianna and Isabel!!!","We recently enjoyed three astounding nights in a corner suite--thanks to Julianna and Isabel (and Melissa for making us ""guests of the day"")!!! What a wonderful way to close a wonderful stay in London--the Fitzroys' suites are everything you could ever dream about!! We HIGHLY recommend the hotel for anyone who wants to experience the finest in luxury and customer service!!!",5,2019,05,27
124,Like home from home each time we visit,"We first stayed here a year ago for the soft opening of what was then the Principal. It has been a place we have returned to several times since and never fails to be a firm favourite. It would be so easy for the staff to rely on the stunning building and location to sell their product, but they don’t. We recently headed down for a catch up with our son and daughter who live a couple of stops up the Piccadilly line in Highbury, making it very handy for us all. From the moment we arrived being greeted like old friends by Valter, hey even if he pretends to remember us he does a great job of it and it’s a nice touch, to the fact the room was ready for us at 9.30am, they just seem to care about the guests. We have stayed in rooms all over the hotel and whilst the upgrades to a suite etc are great the simple doubles with a neat bathroom totally fit the bill for one night. The public spaces are what set this place apart. You don’t need a fancy room as there are so many areas around the hotel to sit and read or work etc. We were recently at the Principal Manchester - yes I realise the Kimpton is no longer part of that group - but there was just no real space outside of a very noisy bar to relax after a day out. Palm Court at the Kimpton is a really welcoming space and the staff again are friendly. It’s great to see a full year on that the place is fully open, Neptune’s and Fitz's are a must visit...so hard to find anything negative to say, so I won’t. We do breakfast out of the hotel across the road in Russell Square gardens as Tropea is such a gem and as a family business it a great find in the world of corporate chains. Again the staff remember you and whilst that isn’t so important it’s a nice touch lost in the busy world we all live in. If you are looking at the Bloomsbury area do consider the Kimpton- it’s not a million miles in terms of cost from its neighbours the Holiday Inn just around the corner - it is however a million miles away in the style stakes. Fabulous location, fabulous hotel and fabulous staff. Can’t wait for our next stay.",5,2019,05,27
124,Best Service in London!,"I am not sure how Long this hotel has been open I think it used to be called the Russell Square Hotel. But it’s been recently refurbished and is amazing fantastic tasteful decor we had a lovelysuite overlooking the square and there was no noise from The busy road down below. has a lovely bar and the breakfast was fantastic as well as a buffet and was also plated service which came quickly. I have to say one of the best things of the hotel was great staff because from start to They were friendly and helpful this is hard to find in London. Special thanks goes to Andras, my wife went to the wrong breakfast room And he took us both to the amazing restaurant the waiting staff were helpful but not obtrusive. We will be back! ",5,2019,05,27
124,Luxury Classic Historical Hotel,"This is lovely hotel and now is part of Branded Intercontinental Hotel Chain. Checked in on 6.5 and checked out 10.5.2019. Checked in staff  were very friendly and polite especially the front door staff were very helpful to carry the luggage as there was no lobby area for taxi to stop like other hotel. Room is clean and just renovated and still can smell it..Bedding is perfect and good to sleep. However, the room cleaners were not performing the job well as 2 continuously day when I came back at 3.45pm, the room was not cleaned yet!!! OMG, i need to call them and need to go out again.

Everything look good until I checked out on 10.5 morning at 7am. The reception girl asked me whether need a taxi to airport and I said YES. She asked the conceirge college to arrange for me a taxi. When the taxi came, to my surprise, the cab was not using meter all the way to airport and charge me 90 pound, almost double the price if using meter. I checked with the driver and being informed that this is the agreed fee with the conceirge!! This is according to my friend is ""Black Taxi Car"" in London and unfortunately this happen to me by arranging from a 5 star luxury hotel in London. So, be careful as I thought this shouldn't be happen in London but is not. A good lesson to learn. Next time just stop the taxi in front of the hotel will do.

Other than the cleaner and the taxi issues, this hotel is worth to stay.",4,2019,05,27
124,"Amazing, Elegant, Beautiful, Gracious, Perfection in London","I stayed here recently for a special occasion. When I say that they couldn't have been nicer or more generous, kinder and welcoming, that is an understatement. I travel a lot and have stayed at many hotels but the splendor, warmth and elegance are unparalleled. The location is also perfect. The manager made sure that my special weekend would be just that and this is a memory that I will return to when I want to think of one of the best places I have ever been. It's a perfect place for a special occasion! Honestly, I really can't imagine better hospitality at such a world class hotel. ",5,2019,05,25
124,Stayed for three nights and it was wonderful except for one thing,"We stayed here for three nights in May 2019 and the room was fabulous, but we could not get enough air conditioning to keep us comfortable under the duvet.  The thermostat said it was 19 Celsius, but we had to open our windows for enough cool air.  I cannot understand how Brits and Europeans sleep under a duvet without a sheet– – it is so darn hot.

However, the best part of our stay was because of Darius, the doorman that helped us throughout with our luggage and  directions, and Luis, the wonderful concierge, who helped us plan things to do and was so kind and patient!",4,2019,05,21
124,Amazing! ,"A stunning hotel with the best service given at reception and concierge. The rooms are beautifully finished. An amazing location, you can walk everywhere or the tube is very close by. Definitely recommend to stay here! ",5,2019,05,20
124,Lovely hotel,"The Kimpton Fitzroy is a lovely hotel in a great location. The hotel is located across the street from a park & there’s lots of coffee shops close by. The hotel is beautiful & they have lots of nice personal touches. The rooms are small but well appointed. Bathrooms are fabulous with a nice walk-in shower. They provide coffee, tea, bottled water & snacks in the room. The staff are incredibly friendly & very helpful. We would love to return to this wonderful hotel.",5,2019,05,20

124,Beautiful Building,"Stayed here for two nights, staff very attentive. Beautiful marble building with lovely Palm room for afternoon tea or lunch or dinner, very nice atmosphere. Bedroom a bit small television fabulous, bathroom also small but had a bath and you could part open the window which we like. Breakfast very nice with charming staff .",4,2019,05,20
124,Excellent Hotel ,"I booked this hotel very last minute for a work event and was so pleased.  My choices were limited as I wanted a hotel with a gym and in this area so ended up at this hotel.  While the room is small, it's comfortable and the bathroom is decent sized.  The staff are all wonderful and the hotel offers a lot of nice touches like fruit at the reception, water in the gym and coffee / tea / fresh croissants at the reception.  I wasn't expecting this in the UK although it's common in 5 star hotels in Asia.  The gym is also surprisingly modern and spacious.  The only slight disappointment was that the hotel coffee shop only opens at 730am, which is a little disappointing for a jet lagged hotel guest but with the complimentary drinks and croissants starting at 530am at the reception, it was fine!  I will definitely return.
",5,2019,05,19
124,Excellent but breakfast left something to be desired! ,"This could easily be five stars, the staff are the best thing about this hotel, super friendly in a warm disarming manner and that went for everyone. Liked the personalised  lifts, great ambiance, loved the bar, room beautifully appointed, absolutely no noise disturbance. But what really let the stay down was the poor quality of the breakfast. 

We were seated in the soft seats rather than at a table, coffee arrived but there was no milk on the table, or any of the tables, so had to take the mug to the counter to get milk. It’s a very limited a la carte menu, no eggs royale, no interesting avocado based dishes, nothing imaginative at all! 

Asked for smoked salmon and scrambled eggs, took an age to get some salmon on a plate from the kitchen and then got my own scrambled eggs from the casserole dish on the counter, these scrambled eggs were dry and lumpy with burnt bits on the bottom, really grim for a four star hotel. The hotel management and chefs need to get themselves round to ‘Coffee Blooms’ round the corner in Lamb’s Conduit Street’ to see how delicious a simple plate of avocado, scrambled eggs and smoked salmon can be.",3,2019,05,16
124,"VERY GOOD LOCATION, WONDERFUL BUILDING, BUT NOT ENOUGH FOR THE FIVE STARS","Nothing of negative to say about this nice hotel located in a high residential area of London. Perfect location, you've Russel Square station very close, a mall, British Museum, restaurant, and every thing you need. Furthermore it's not a only tourist location, so you can live the real London atmosphere. Hotel is located in a beautiful   building of 18th centuries. I lived in a Superior Room: nice room, big enough. So I have no complains about anything but to get 5 Stars, in my opinion, you should provoke the ""WoW effect"" and I didn't feel, perhaps because customer service is to improve: before having my rooms I had to wait half hour more than communicated timing, things that can happen.. but they could offer me a drink.... or something similar..",4,2019,05,15
124,Breakfast,"The Hotel has a beautiful interior, lots of marble, the lobby is not very large, and the front desk employees are very efficient. The room is not too large, but enough for a few days stay. The shower door unfortunately is not tight enough, which results in a water float on the bathroom floor. Happen in both rooms that we had booked. The staff is very friendly and efficient – congrats.
The only negative comment is the rather simple breakfast buffet. Missing are fresh vegetables, large choice of cheese, bread. Not quite understandable is the lack of unsalted butter. Only salted butter is available, unless Andrew the head manager of the Neptune breakfast Restaurants takes care of you and organizes from the pastry shop some sweet butter. Thanks Andrew, well done! We will be back.",4,2019,05,13
124,A New Bar for Kimpton,"This. Hotel. Is. Stunning. Friendly doormen, helpful front desk, prompt service line. Beautifully designed room, clean gym.

I am admittedly a bit of a Kimpton Devotee, and this hotel is the most beautiful of them. (Other greats include the DeWit in Amsterdam, Monaco Philly, Everly). My room was upgraded to a one bedroom suite, which I'd recommend without reservation. The Tuck kit is great, refilled daily, and includes coffee, tea, water, beer, and a few snacks. The social hour offered prosecco, white and red wine, and beer served in lovely 

I'll warn that the service is a little mixed both at Burr & Co and Fitz's, which probably only stands out due to the impeccable service I usually received. The food/drinks at each were good.

Can't wait to come back!",5,2019,05,13
124,Second stay - and still recommended,"This was the second time I stayed in a Superior Double room at the Kimpton Fitzroy London which already tells you that I generally hold a favorable opinion on the hotel. This review only includes a few points that I would like to highlight. For a full lowdown, please check out the review that I posted in early January this year.

The pros of this hotel are the stunning building, the convenient location, the comfortable bed and quality bedding, and the F&B outlets. I particularly enjoyed the complimentary social hour for hotel guests (held daily from 5-6pm with free sparkling/white/red wine and beer) and the option to have a light breakfast at Burr & Co, the hotel's lovely neighborhood-type café. Generally, once the front desk was contacted, any requests were promptly met. 
The cons are the small room size (not just of the entry level rooms), an odd high step from the room to the bathroom (just this time around, the last room didn't have this), issues with the AC heating function, provision of only two small bottles of water (additional bottles can be requested, but it's rather cumbersome to call for water every day) and a few minor service hiccups. A housekeeping request included in the reservation was continuously forgotten, one time the small and large towels were simply left on the bed and not hung up in the bathroom, and the bill featured an incorrect large expense (upon check-out the receptionist said they would charge my card and send me the bill later via email as they couldn't print it out due to system failure, but I insisted to at least verbally confirm the total amount - luckily I did so). 

I give this hotel between three and four TripAdvisor ""stars"". It's a solid, upper mid-range option in London. Recommended.",3,2019,05,12
124,Beautiful property,"Congratulations to IHG/KImpton on an excellent renovation job on this old hotel, incorporating all the modern conveniences but keeping the charm in the public areas.  We were upgraded to a one bedroom suite as Inner Circle members and given a bottle of champagne.  Despite some systems glitches with the reservation, which made us nervous, we were welcomed and all was in order on our arrival.

The location is very convenient to Kings Cross, St. Pancras station, Regents Park, Oxford St. etc.  The surrounding neighborhood is great, with Russell Square across the street and a lot of small restaurants in nearby Fitzrovia.  

The rooms of our suite were on the small side but nicely furnished, and the bathroom was large.  Service was good, especially at the social hour.",5,2019,05,11
124,Wonderful ,"This was our second visit to the Kimpton Fitzroy London and we were staying in London as part of our 30th wedding anniversary celebrations. We arrived quite early and therefore our room wasn’t ready. We said this wasn’t a problem as we were off to the Royal Opera House to see Romeo and Juliet and would be back after 4.30pm. When we arrived back later, our bags had been taken to the room.  How lovely when we arrived at the room - they had upgraded us to a one bedroomed suite and left us a bottle of champagne and a copy of Romeo and Juliet.  How very thoughtful, it really made our weekend.  What attention to detail - this is now our new favourite hotel in London. ",5,2019,05,10
124,Anniversary stay,"Wonderful hotel! Brilliant service especially from the Front of House staff!
The bedroom overlooking the park and gardens was wonderful, and the bedroom was very clean, very quiet and comfortable!
Would return in a heartbeat! ",5,2019,05,08
124,Best stay ever!!!,"This is hotel is stunning and the service matches up too. Your door man Valter from start to finish on our stay was always warm and welcoming. No matter how busy always made time for a chat and was super knowledgable of the surrounding area. Umberto your palm court manager is fantastic he always had presence and was so good at what he does. He really is amazing and always smiling and friendly. Can’t fault the service in this hotel it really is 5* class. Cant wait till our next stay, will definitely be staying again.",5,2019,05,07
124,The best hotel stay!,"Me and my husband went there for my birthday at the beggining of May 2019 and it was amazing. The hotel’s interior grandeur and the arhitecture are stunning, you feel like staying in a museum; the staff are super helpful and easy going, just as you’d expect in a Kimpton, they even gave me an upgrade and a little cake in my room because it was my birthday ! 
Fitz’s bar has an atmosphere of 20’s - 30’s dark luxury and the staff there are great as well, but be warned, the cocktail are VERY boozy! Will definitely come back to the bar even without staying in the hotel.
Restaurant was great also with lovely staff and food.
Overall I would definitely recommend for any ocassion!",5,2019,05,06
124,WOW -IHG Spire elite fabulous welcome,"We are Spire elite members and we love this hotel, first stay and we will be returning.
The hotel has been restored staying true to its character and honoring its past yet being modernize and comfortable.
Hmm, ticked all the boxes for us!

",5,2019,05,05
124,Amazing!,"Recently refurbished, this hotel is beautiful but also full of history. Great service and exactly what I needed in the room.
We were hosting an event in the ballroom so had time to experience breakfast, lunch and dinner as well as drinks in the bar. The bar is exceptional with great staff.
Only quibble is the lack of wholesome vegetarian food which left me feeling hungry most of the time.",5,2019,05,05
124,"Great location, great hotel",This hotel is very near to the British Museum. It’s only a block away from the underground Piccadilly Line. This line connects you to Heathrow and the main train station without having to switch lines making it very convenient for a quick stop in London. Beds and rooms were comfortable and well appointed.,5,2019,05,02
124,Amazing Hotel ,"I organized a stay here for my in-laws as part of a 10-day Eurotrip and I could not be more glad that they stayed at this hotel. The staff went above and beyond to make sure that they had the most comfortable stay including an amazingly sweet surprise for my mother in law’s 50th birthday. We traveled to Barcelona and Paris as well and after the trip was over, they said London was their favorite city and I truly believe that’s largely in part because of this hotel. The location is perfect - just steps from Russel Square underground station and overlooking the gorgeous Russell Square. It is a very short walk to Soho and The British Museum. Really a perfect hotel. Thank you so much to all the staff for making it a perfect stay. They said it was their favorite hotel EVER and didn’t want to leave! ",5,2019,05,01
124,"Excellent hotel ! Wonderful staff . Lovely Room, exceptional service . The “ ONLY “  place to stay in London .Trust me","I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to London.

Huge shout out to Connor- McDowell who I miss:) He knows London and is Very helpful . Sean makes is that much more fun ! Roberto at night will serve you on a silver platter . Finally , the best for last . Bemnet - The Director of the front of the desk. She is top notch . In my experience, it all stems from the top . She is By far extraordinary and makes you feel at home . In a nutshell , this hotel has delicious food ( their fish and chips is not to be missed ) , wonderful drinks 🍸, comfortable beds  and a staff you are excited to go “ home to ! What more does one need ? Give it 6 stars ⭐️ please !",5,2019,04,29
124,Can I give it 6 stars?,Amazing from the moment we arrived. The staff were super helpful and nothing was too much trouble. Lots of nice touches including a little breakfast in the room - I was running the marathon. Coffee shop/bar very nice. And the rooms are simply stunning!!,5,2019,04,28
124,Beautiful bar,"We dropped in to the bar here last night whilst out with friends, what a find! It was like stepping back in time to the most luxurious, intimate bar - great atmosphere, attentive staff, beautiful surroundings. The hotel is gorgeous.",5,2019,04,28
124,Wonderful hotel in London - Bloomsbury Russell Square area,"We recently visited London and had the best hotel experience.  We stayed at the Kimpton Fitzroy in Bloomsbury.  The hotel is gorgeous.. exquisite inside and out.  The building resembles a castle and is just grand.  It is also right around the corner from the Russell Square tube spot which we used often. 
The staff were really wonderful.  So welcoming and helpful.  We looked forward to seeing them daily - they truly treated us like family and we were hugging them when we left.  
They have a terrific coffee/casual restaurant and bar called Burr & Co. that we loved so much.  We went daily despite the large number of inviting breakfast places around our area.  Great vibe, great food, and great coffee drinks.  
The hotel bar, Fitz’s, is a hotspot in the area and is fun and lively.  They also have 2 beautiful restaurants.  
There are lots of cozy nooks to relax in around the hotel as you admire the unbelievable architecture and decor.  The rooms aren’t huge but the bathrooms are big and very nice.  We love Kimptons and stay in them often.  They gave us an upgrade and our room was simply beautiful.  
We feel so lucky to have discovered this hotel and can’t wait to return.  It was very special and really made our trip so wonderful.",5,2019,04,28
124,Elegant Luxury for a 30th Birthday,"We booked this stay in London for my younger daughter’s 30th Birthday.We were not disappointed! The staff are truly attentive and went out of their way to ensure that every minute detail was in fact 5 star. From the initial welcome and check in to the cocktail bar and Neptune restaurant, everything was perfect. Having been newly refurbished, the venue itself is perfect yet retains the charm of a bygone era.We were given a stunning suite overlooking Russell Square. The only downside is that we had so little time as we were heading off to Paris the following morning.",5,2019,04,28
124,"Amazing hotel, oozing with charm!","Everything about this historic, five-star hotel on Russell Square, is to love.  The building is beautiful and the staff was incredibly helpful. The room was stunning, with incredibly comfortable beds and modern, tasteful decor.  Our room featured a spacious bathroom.  Loved the breakfast at Burr & Co. as well as the bar at Fitz's.  Service at both was perfect, though we were underwhelmed by the dinner menu and service at Palm Court.  Overall, five stars.",5,2019,04,27
124,"Wow, what a hotel!",We arrived a bit early and was well greeted by the concierge at the door and  also helped us with luggage. At reception Andrea welcomed us with smile and went through the required procedures. The room was lovely and very cleaned. Food was good too. Overall it was an excellent break as my wife and son enjoyed the trip. Thanks everyone.,5,2019,04,26
124,Wonderful quirky character,"Had a thoroughly enjoyable stay at The Kimpton Fitzroy for a full day business function, great food, drinks reception, dinner and overnight. 

Loved the decor, very unique and different from the run of the mill London hotel.",4,2019,04,25
124,Very nice hotel,"It was wonderful stay. Everything was at the point. Smiling nice people. Our room was ready at 12.00 (check-in time at 15.00), so it was 3 hours earlier.
Room itself was big and light, with nice stylish furniture. So beautifully designed. Very nice big bathroom.  We had amazing time here.",5,2019,04,24
124,Beautiful Hotel with great service,"We stayed here for last leg of our trip and from check in to checkout the service was wonderful. Rooms were beautiful, clean and spacious. Near underground station and with ample bus routes around. Great location too!",5,2019,04,23
124,Kimpton - amazing,"We had a lovely stay at the Kimpton Fitzroy! The staff were lovely and could not have been more helpful, friendly and accommodating. The hotel itself is beautiful and is in a fantastic location (short walk from Euston / right next to Russell Square tube station). The rooms are tastefully finished and include lots of cute quirky touches (e.g. red telephone / statement cushions). We'll definitely be back!",5,2019,04,23
124,Great atmosphere,"If the cost isn’t matter to you, when you reach London you should stay here. 
It’s very beautiful both visibility and it’s history. Staffs all very polite. Great bed and facilities. 

And dont forget to find Lucky George the Dragon. ",5,2019,04,23
124,Business trip,"Service and staff are amazing - I have stayed at many hotels in London and this is the best .

Location - close to great restaurants, fashion shops and near Oxford Street .

Great areas to have a drink and then have dinner - really nice atmosphere to relax.",5,2019,04,22
124,Kimpton + Europe = perfection,"This is one amazing property.  Lobby is absolutely beautiful.  We were upgraded to a corner suite which was unbelievable.  Four poster bed, oval tub in the small turret in the corner, so spacious especially for London.  We visit London often, and this is my favorite place we have stayed by far. Would completely recommend",5,2019,04,20
124,"Excellent high quality, great atmosphere","Excellent weekend stay a couple of months ago.  The hotel is in a great location and oozes atmosphere.  Staff were friendly and helpful.  The rooms were large, clean and well equipped.  The bar serves some great cocktails and the bar staff were really great.

Highly recommended.",5,2019,04,19
124,Fine Stay,"Well staffed, very clean, very comfortable bed and well located. Took the Tube from Heathrow to Russell Square - the hotel entrance is around the corner. Very near the British National Museum and the John Soane House. We walked to sites and the theater. Daily turndown service and clean towels were appreciated. Breakfast was well presented. Recommended. ",5,2019,04,17
124,A wonderful experience ,"Recently stayed 4 nights to celebrate my birthday and to have a few more nights in this beautiful city.

Everything from checkin to checkout was faultless. The hotel is like a palace- beautifully restored in an elegant style- maintaining the best of the old. As we were celebrating my birthday we were upgraded to a junior suite - with all the trimmings- and a special treat on the big day.

The staff were superb- so attentive but never intrusive. Walter, at the front door, made us feel so welcome- like old friends- and the staff at Burr and co. were ready to meet our every need. The chef at the egg station needs special mention as he was only too willing to oblige any request. Everyone we encountered was so friendly and efficient- they appeared to really enjoy their job and were extremely well trained.

The hotel is very centrally located and should be on everybody’s bucket list! 

Go ahead and treat yourself!",5,2019,04,17
124,Doorman Walter went above and beyond,"Stayed at the Kimpton Fitzroy London earlier this month and the staff was helpful and friendly. In particular, Walter at the door was very supportive in getting us cab rides, providing recommendations and directions. For people traveling from out of the country, he made our stay relaxed.",5,2019,04,16
124,Mediocre hotel with fancy decor,I felt this hotel was way overpriced for what it is. The lobby is beautiful and the location is great so I feel that you are really paying for those features more than anything. The room we had was teeny tiny. Once my husband and I were in the room with our luggage there was barely any room to move. There was a lamp that was awkwardly in front of the door as we entered into the room but there was no other place to put a lamp but it made entering and exiting the room with luggage difficult. The rain shower didn’t work well and just sprayed everywhere so we had to use the handheld shower head which made showering a bit awkward as well. The staff was fine but lacked a certain degree of professionalism I would expect from a 5 star hotel at this price. Overall it was fine but I was not super impressed.,4,2019,04,16
124,5 Star Service at Kimpton Fitzroy,"It is very hard to write a review and not use words like ""perfection"" ""amazing"" ""stupendous"", because you want to find better words to describe your stay! We stayed here for my 50th birthday getaway and I am so glad we did. I believe it is the people who work at the hotel that give the hotel that special something. From our check in to our check out, the Kimpton went above and beyond to make our stay wonderful but to make MY stay memorable and a birthday I will not forget. I wish I could thank everybody by name but especially Juliana in Guest Relations and Sean in Concierge. 
Juliana worked with my husband to have amazing balloons delivered to my room with roses and a little cake. She was on top of everything. And Sean (!!!), well his recommendations were home runs every time. Upon our arrival we had questions about using the close Underground and he took us there and walked us to the ticket machines and showed us what to do and made sure we were ok. 
Oh and Alex who works in Fitz's who was great in helping my husband pick out that perfect martini and was delightful to chat with. 
Stunning room with luxurious bed linens and the bathroom was perfection with all white marble and a soaking tub.
Thank you all so very much!",5,2019,04,15
124,Fantastic,"Recently stay for weekend break and had a great stay. The staff were very friendly , rooms were good but a bit on the small size, great location right next to tube, breakfast good and a very nice touch to get free drinks between 5 and 6 pm",5,2019,04,14
124,Hotel lovely/rooms very small,"The hotel itself is very beautiful and every member of staff we encountered were lovely. 
Pros: It is a given that hotel staff should be nice to their guests, after all, they work in hospitality so it should be a basic requirement but we felt they were all very warm and welcoming. A beautiful looking hotel and the Palm Court is gorgeous and has a lovely feel to sit and have a drink. Location Wasn’t bad. Very close to Kings Cross station but it really depends which area of London you plan to spend most time in. 
Cons: Rooms are very, very small. There is no dressing table with a mirror. Just a tall mirror with a socket next to it so you have the choice of standing to do your hair (and make up if required) or sitting on the floor. (Which lady wants to do either to do hair/apply make up?). Also the toiletries are in large sizes rather than individual so I’m guessing they just get topped up. The result of this was the hand and body lotion just fell into bits when applying on my skin rather than like an actual cream. Like it had been festering for a long tine. 
 Another con whilst we were there is the breakfast room. It did not feel luxurious like a 5* hotel should feel. It felt like being squeezed into a cafe (it may be that this was purely because the restaurant is currently being renovated - let’s hope) and the selection wasn’t the best either. Quite basic and the standard of a 3 or 4 star eg the baked beans look congealed and one morning they had onions in them!!! Not nice. The coffee however was lovely.
All in all we enjoyed our stay there and the cons may just be things that can be ironed out (except the size of the rooms obviously).",4,2019,04,13
124,"‘Affordable’ 5 star, just don’t expect perfection","Having been clearly revamped very recently (I believe to go from 4 to 5 star) this hotel’s first impressions are excellent. Just having been included in IHG, it is a rarity to have this standard of hotel available on their rewards scheme in my experience. 
Very grand and most of the service lives up to expectations. I would say this is a 5 star hotel but as the relatively competitive prices show, this is not a 5 star hotel resigned to the very upper echelons of clientele. This was also shown by the size of rooms (I.e. small- 25sqm approx), we had a room just below the smallest suite size and it was lovely but cosy, with no view apart from the industrial inner courtyard of the hotel. I confess we don’t stay in London hotels often so perhaps even at £300 for a Saturday night we should not forget the excellent central location of the establishment. Having said that we did feel it was a treat and enjoyed our short stay very much with a few birthday treats they threw in. The only small complaint was in the bar where service was painfully slow, topped off by a slightly indignant waitress when we politely requested the automatic service charge be removed from the bill after waiting 5mins to be seated then a further 10mins for an order that then arrived with errors.
(Pretty much) 5 star luxury in excellent location at not ridiculous prices.",5,2019,04,13
124,Great New Hotel,"I’ve recently begun staying at The Kimpton Fitzroy.  I regularly stay in London and this has become one of my favourites.  The value, service and renovation of the hotel is done beautifully.

The bar is lovely and anywhere that serves Twiglets as bar snacks is alright by me!

The staff are lovely, I’m regularly greeted warmly by Walter the Head Doorman.  All in all I highly recommend.  I even bought a Doorman’s cap this time that I’ve been admiring after I left my hat on the train!
",5,2019,04,12
124,Just a dream of elegance and kindness!,"I am totally in love with this hotel and can recommend it a 100%. We felt welcomed from the second we ""entered"" the first step of the hotels stairs (Including Walter and his very open and friendly appearance).
The hotel (building) itself is very impressive and magnificent!The rooms are just a dream and very quiet.It's also located perfectly because small restaurants,supermarkets and the underground station are just a 2min walk away.
The team is helpful with everything and very polite,no matter who you are.They don't make a difference between guests of ""Expedia"" or if you have booked directly. In other hotels one felt like a 2nd class but here it isn't the case. The hotel is decorated with so much love.Will definitely come back- with friends and family!Our stay was absolutely outstanding and we miss it already!Thank you so much for those fantastic days!",5,2019,04,11
124,What a beautiful place!,Wish I knew about this hotel before I booked the one we finally stayed at. Will definitely stay here next time!! Came across this beautiful place and decided we could at least enjoy some tea. It's massive and gorgeous! Comfortable sofa with a fireplace and delicious English tea. It was the perfect ending to our trip.,5,2019,04,10
124,All-around best!,"This hotel is absolutely gorgeous! The location is perfect, everything is walkable. 

The staff are so thoughtful and fun that you'll feel like you're staying either at the Ritz (because they are so lovely at jumping in to help in any way possible) or with good friends (because they are so personable and enjoyable)! Connor McDowell, the Head Concierge is just an absolute delight and Valter on his team is jovial and warm. 

They have a nightly cocktail hour for guests that allows you to relax and connetct with eachother or with new friends that you meet along the way. 

I cannot say enough good things about this property and the team. Can't wait to go back! Thank you for a lovely and effortless stay.",5,2019,04,10
124,A Beautiful New Hotel in London,"The Kimpton Fitzroy London is a stunning new hotel. From the time we entered through the doors, we were greeted by serveral of the welcoming staff and helped with our luggage. Check in was seemless and we were shown to our room. 
The room was spacious by London standards and well appointed as well. The room was comfortable, but my one complain was that there was only one window in the room and it was opaque because it faced the alley, which made the room feel quite claustrophobic. I think this one feature really kept the hotel from having a perfect score for me. 
The hotel is right on Russel Square and around the corner from the Russel Square tube stop. Being in Bloomsbury has its advantages in London. you are close the British museum and within a short walk or Tube ride to other great attractions. 
As for dining, we had several great options just in the hotel. The breakfast at the hotel was exceptional, with a great buffet of treats and a chef (who was so friendly) who would make ready to order eggs of any style. They also offered some fresh squeezed juices and a juice shots that they made in house. A nice touch I thought.
Ultimately I would recommend this as a fine hotel in London, but I would recommend getting a room on a higher floor.",4,2019,04,09
124,"Not quite a first-class hotel, but well on its way to that status","There's a great deal to like at this hotel, a beautiful renovation of the old Russell Hotel. The staff is welcoming and professional, and clearly proud to show off the building, which has preserved many lovely architectural details.

My room, which the hotel calls an Urban Double, was on the tight side for one person, and I think two guests would want to book in a different category. The room was nicely appointed, though like many small city hotel rooms, it had a bit too much furniture crammed in. Linens were of good quality. Nice touches included bottled water and a few snacks (popcorn and a chocolate bar) and a small refrigerator with a carton of milk for in-room coffee making.

The casual restaurant, Burr & Co., seemed to be popular with people who work in the area as well as with hotel guests, and I could see why. The food was very good. I didn't have a meal at Neptune, the seafood restaurant, but it was the attractive site of a nightly wine hour for guests.

My only surprise was that a hotel with so many positives lacked attention to some important details. One of those was small. When I looked out the window in my room, I saw that its rimmed ledge contained an empty plastic bottle and other debris -- nothing you had to look at all the time, but something I'd have thought would be cleaned up after the remodel. 

The bigger surprise was that anywhere from four to six large carts, containing linens (clean and used) and trash were left in the hallways throughout my stay.. I assumed the first day that they were there because room servicing was in progress, but they were still there at dinner time, after my return from the theatre that night, and very early the next morning, before room servicing began. As far as I could see, they remained there all day until late into the night. Not a huge deal, but not attractive, either, and something I've never seen even in hotels at lower price points. For this reason, I don't think I'd choose this hotel for a special-occasion stay, though I might do so for a general one.",4,2019,04,08
124,Amazing hotel,"First time in Kimpton in London and I loved the fact it’s pet friendly, it helps a lot when travelling with my little buddy, you can really tell the hotel’s been renewed. The best thing in there was the staff really. From reception to concierge but specially the DOORMAN VALTER! That besides being funny and very respecting, he was very friendly with my little dog too. The room was extremely clean and big and spacious with an lovely view to the park. Next day after spending the night there we went for breakfast inside the hotel and the food was amazing and delicious too. Definitely coming back soon. Thank you for the amazing experience Kimpton team!",5,2019,04,08
124,Wonderful Hotel on Russel Square near the British Museum,"As always a wonderful stay at a Kimpton hotel. My husband I stayed for four night the last weekend in March. Enjoyed the warm and luxurious room. Feels like the hotel has been recently completely remodeled. The exterior of the building is wonderfully lite up at night, highlighting all of the details.

Location: Great location near the British Museum and walking distance from Covent Garden and Oxford Street. The tube station a block away and buses run right out side the hotel. If you need a quick bite or coffee, there are two Pret's and Cafe Nero within steps of the hotel.

Rooms: 402 was a lovely one bedroom suite that over looks the square. Room is comfortable with luxurious touches. Love the huge bathroom with towel warmer, electric hot water kettle, Nespresso machine(with pods) and complimentary mini bar. Only design flaw is the lack of outlet for the hairdryer in the bathroom. There is an outlet for shavers but not a standard outlet.

Service: Warm welcoming staff throughout the hotel. A little surprised the hotel did not inform hotel guests of the time change that occurred during our stay.

Amenities:
Complimentary breakfast was included in our rate. You could have the buffet in Burr & Co or order items off the menu in Neptune. Buffet had nice options. You could order eggs any way you would like or an omelette by the buffet. Ala crate in Neptune had very similar options as the buffet. So we opted for the buffet the majority of our trip.
Wine hour! Great as always and held in the Neptune bar.

Would definitely stay again!",5,2019,04,07
124,Mother and Daughter Getaway,What a wonderful trip to London this past week.  We did so many fun things but one of the highlights was our stay at the Kimpton  The room was very clean and generous in size.  The Hotel staff went above and beyond their jobs.  Thank you Walter for making our stay so much fun . We loved seeing your smiling face as we left i the morning.  The concierge staff was great Sean had so many great suggestions.  We will be back !!!,5,2019,04,07
124,Fabulous,"This hotel is faultless. We stayed in a corner suite which was immaculate and spacious and superbly designed.The staff are amazing and cannot do enough to help at any given time.The whole building looks and feels exquisite. 
Would definitely return (tomorrow if I could)",5,2019,04,05
124,Fantastic hotel,"This is a fantastic hotel in a very central location. The hotel building has a beautiful Victorian facade and the interiors are new, except the ground floor entrance, where they have kept the original charm with the original marble layout. The staff is very attentive to all details and always at your service. As an anecdote, the doorman, Walter, requested me to wait inside the hotel while he hailed a can for me. He didn't want to get wet in the very light drizzle outside. Amazing!",5,2019,04,04
124,All The Great History You Could Ask For With An Eye On The Future,The history of this building and neighborhood is as authentic as you can get.  Kimpton has updated this historic building in all the right places and left the details of yesteryear for the guests to enjoy.  This was my first stop on a long business trip and first time at this hotel.  I have stayed in Kimpton hotels in different cities but this London branch stands tall amount the others.  Top notch staff both helpful and knowledgeable and I could not have been happier with the room and the peace and quiet.  Truly a great experience top to bottom and I will spread the word on what a great place to stay in the heart of London.  I am a history buff and to see the complete renovation of a historic building leaving all the best of history and updating not just to modern standards but literally setting the standard for hotels in the future.  Great Place.,5,2019,04,03
124,"Beautiful hotel, warm and friendly welcome","We loved this hotel! Stayed for one evening only, a treat whilst our son was out of the country on a school trip. We arrived very early (pre-9am) ready for a day of exploring. We received a very warm welcome at reception and were assured that our bags would be taken up to our room ready for our return later in the day. Returned after lunch and our room was ready (a lovely upgrade, thank you). Very comfortable, with a side view over the park. We visited the bar for the social hour shortly after 5pm, was clearly very popular with fellow guests as it was packed! Was a nice start to our evening before we headed off for the theatre and dinner.

We used the drinks credit received as Spire Elite members towards breakfast in Burr&Co the following morning, which was lovely. Really nice choices for breakfast and great coffee.  Further exploring and then returned for cocktails in Fitz’s before we had to head for our train home - cocktails were fab, really good, and help choosing was very much appreciated.

All in all a really special place and one that we have already booked to return to with our son this summer. We have always regarded The Serras in Barcelona as our gold standard for service but the Kimpton Fitzroy really runs it close. Can’t wait to visit again.",5,2019,04,02
124,Birthday getaway,"From beginning to end this trip was wonderful. This hotel is a real gem. The staff were extremely helpful, friendly and professional. They made us feel so special and went the extra mile. We also had some drinks in Fitzs bar and again the service was impeccable. All the staff seemed genuine and like nothing was too much. We will definitely be staying again in the near future, I can’t say enough how much we enjoyed our stay. A big thank you to all the staff at the Kimpton Fitzroy.",5,2019,04,02
124,Great hotel in quiet area,"Beautiful hotel opposite Russell Square.  Staff were impeccably friendly, welcoming and helpful.  Apparently the hotel has spent a fortune on renovations and it shows.  Only downsides - our room was tiny altough the bathroom was bigger and the bar was full when we returned at 10:30 on a Friday evening.  Some tables set aside for hotel guests would have been welcome.",5,2019,04,01
124,An Amazing Experience!,"Such an incredibly unique hotel, Kimpton Fitzroy definitely took us by surprise! From the beautiful architecture and interior design invested in every single corner of the hotel, to the amazing service and cleanliness. We would come back to the hotel at least 3 times during the day and every single time the room was cleaned. The location was convenient but still away from all the busy streets which was perfect.

Would like to thank the lovely staff & Vaulter for making us smile every time we walked through the hotel doors :) 

Kind Regards,
Alia & Chad",5,2019,04,01
124,Numb bum!,"Had a lovely stay at the Kimpton Fitzroy.  The building is fabulous.
The staff were helpful and had a lovely large room.

My only concern was confusion at breakfast.  We were ushered to the cafe and advised that this was where they served the buffet breakfast. The staff were lovely and attentive but the cafe was very uncomfortable and a very noisy space.  The chairs are very hard and upright and certainly not a place to relax over breakfast.  On second night we went to the restaurant and discovered that they served a wonderful buffet also, in a much more comfortable and quiet environment.",4,2019,04,01
124,Watch out St Pancras Hotel!,"Could not fault this wonderful hotel, from the staff to the luxury of the decor. Fabulous architecture and the spirit of the original hotel has been kept and beautifully added to. Room was excellent, beds so comfortable and the freshness of the the breakfast elements second to none. 15 minutes walk away from Kings Cross Station and not much further to Oxford Street - I cannot recommend this hotel enough for convenience, ambiance and value, and will be choosing the Fitzroy for my next stay in London.",5,2019,03,31
124,Stunning hotel,"Beautiful hotel, rooms small but very clean and one can get a wonderful nights sleep here. Interior is simply stunning. Service is very polite. The breakfast is a bit of a hit and miss. Chaotic at times. Short distance to Russel Square underground. Convenient location. ",4,2019,03,31
124,Super Hotel,"First class welcome upon arrival. Rooms are superbly appointed and beautifully decorated. 

Unfortunately on my second stay there was a party in the room next door which resulted in little sleep for me. 2 calls to reception and 3 visits to the room by hotel staff had no impact. When I checked out i was advised the person in the neighbouring room was a ""VIP"" so the reception staff  ""hoped I understood"". This is a pity as I would have hoped that all guests were VIPs at this hotel.

Not staying again for a while.",4,2019,03,31
124,Phenomenal One Night Stay!,"Had a purposeful one night stopover in London enroute to Brussels and am ecstatic I chose this amazing Kimpton property for my Mom and me!

I am a huge affectionado of the Kimpton brand stateside and besides having already visited its Grand Cayman and Amsterdam locales, wished to visit the Kimpton’s UK Edition.

It did not disappoint. With our limited amount of time in London (less than 24 hours), Ro (concierge extraordinaire) arranged a great deal for us: explicit directions on getting to the hotel via the London Express Train and taxi from Heathrow, High Tea at Palm Court, fab five minute walking directions to the British Museum, and Fast Track tickets for London Eye.

Check in at the front desk with Andrea was a breeze as was her fantastic warm welcome along with the fab one we received from Valter (the humorous doorman from Portugal).

Quite a regal impression was made! The hotel’s interior as well as exterior architecture and aesthetic are stunning! Exemplary service was provided by everyone we encountered throughout the hotel as well. 

Special thanks in particular to Melanie!!! We share the same first name and she left an a kind note and cool British Museum momento for me. I am very touched by her gesture. 

As an Inner Circle/Spire Elite Member, I had hoped for a room upgrade but no luck. (Maybe next time)? I booked and we stayed in a deluxe room with 2 beds.

Our room had everything we needed, was spotlessly clean, and quite luxurious.

I plan on returning to this stellar hotel and wish to thank everyone for making my Mom’s Mother’s Day in the UK quite memorable!!! (We has no idea it was going to be Mother’s Day Weekend -what luck)!

Fondly,

Melanie Hart ",5,2019,03,31
124,Wonderful stay,"This is our first Kimpton hotel experience and our very pleased!  Everyone is very nice and accommodating. The hotel is well maintained, beautiful and immaculate! We’ve stayed at a Mandarin Oriental and preferred our Kimpton experience.  The location is a quick walk to everything. A must stay hotel in London. ",5,2019,03,30
124,Elegant London hotel & architectural jewel !,"As you arrive at Russel Square in London, Bloomsbury, this architectural jewel captivates your attention. Hotel entrance, lobby and reception area are beautiful. Stayed here for 6 nights and thoroughly enjoyed my stay. Had a minor administrative glitch with my reservation but was eventually resolved so did not let that overshadow the class and beauty of this hotel. The bar is also elegant and sophisticated and cocktails most interesting. The rooms, although a little small my North American standards, were extremely comfortable and overall service is very good.",5,2019,03,28
124,Recent Addition to Kimpton - A Stunner,"A historic and beautiful building in a great location on Russell Square about 12 steps from the Russell Square Underground (Piccadilly line so direct from LHR) that is only 1 stop from Pancras/Euston and in the immediate proximity of the British Museum and Univ of London. So the area is a beehive of energy and places (restaurants galore) but still just enough off-center to avoid the less appealing trappings of a very visitor-centric city. In other words, perfect. 

The KF is a luxe-service property. Smiles greet me everywhere. Key touchpoints are exemplary - Reception, Concierge, Bar, Coffee.  Did not try restaurants because, well, it’s London and wandering beckons. 

I have my choice of hotels in London and I am here several times a year so will absolutely return to this reasonably priced property that treats its residents like royalty. ",5,2019,03,28
124,Last Minute Family City Trip,"We booked this hotel as part of a vacation package. It FAR exceeded my expectations. Truly 5 star service and rooms. Quite unexpected space in the 2 queen family room for Europe. We had a small but appreciated separate sitting area. Amazing to have am coffee and daily refills on water, snacks, beverages. Of course, when traveling with family the twice daily cleaning services is so amazing. Bathrooms are adequate in size and nicely decorated. Location is incredible you take the tube just a block from the hotel and can get to British museum easy on foot. Many reasonable and tasty food options around. Staff is all incredibly helpful and courteous. It was our first time to London and only a short 4 nights but we will be back and we will definitely stay here again.",5,2019,03,27
124,Warm Service + Sophisticated Design = A Transformative Stay,"With its personable and attentive staff, distinctive modern British decor,  and a central Bloomsbury location, the Fitzroy sizzles in a city where travelers are spoiled for choice  upscale accommodations.

Located across from Russell Square in the heart of ""classic"" Bloomsbury — the Fitzroy will reinvent your relationship with London in the most subtle and unimaginable ways.

From the moment you enter the space, you're graciously greeted by staff and engaged by inviting spaces at every turn.

I arrived in Bloomsbury at 9:30 am, the front desk offered access to a wonderful private shower room in gym to freshen up.  When I popped back up 30 minutes later to thank them they immediately whisked me up to my room which was ready and amazing.

The space was beautifully designed and appointed. From the artwork to the molding details, to the furnishing, there were ""low-key"" luxe appointments at every step. The spa-like bathroom — from the marble and tile design, toiletries, the amazing rain shower head and bath linens — it felt like an oasis, within an oasis.

With an array of dining and drinks options at the hotel — you can cover breakfast, lunch, dinner, and drinks in four separate beautiful spaces that offer wonderful spaces, experiences as well as cuisine. I tried them all and they were wonderful.  They also were great options for meeting London friends.

I stay exclusively in Kimpton properties in the US where I'm based.  The Fitzroy has quickly set a new standard is at the top of the list.  Special thanks to reservations manager, Mamoon Rahman who made the Fitzroy a home away from home for me, personally find space when I extended my stay and placed me in a lovely room beyond my expectations!   And thanks to assistant head concierge, Ro Kaplia who kept me connected to the pulse of the city from the latest on Harold Pinter one act plays, to the hottest Mediterranean/Modern Israeli restaurant, or the hippest new shopping area in nearby Kings Cross.

I've already planned a return trip 8 weeks later because the stay was just that incredible.",5,2019,03,26
124,Fantastic Hotel,"Stayed during family trip to London. Beautifully renovated, classic hotel. Service, friendliness and attentiveness of the staff was incredible.  Rooms were well-decorated, very clean and comfortable. Great visit! ",5,2019,03,24
124,What a lovely birthday surprise- thank you !,"When you go away to celebrate a special event, in this case hubby's big birthday you just hope everything goes to plan and most importantly that the hotel meets your expectations. Well, I have to say, this was one of the best hotels we have ever stayed in, and we've travelled a fair bit. Not only in the way the hotel looks and feels (it has been very creatively styled ) but the staff, who couldn't be more attentive and polite.

We were lucky enough to be upgraded to a wonderful suite, and upon entering we found a delicious chocolate mousse cake waiting for us, along with a handwritten birthday message. 

A huge thank you  to all the hotel staff for making our weekend so special 
From the Hunts

We will definitely choose this hotel next time we visit London.",5,2019,03,24
124,Excellent Staff,"The hotel was of course full of character, beautifully restored and decorated.  The bathrooms were fantastic.  What was a very pleasant surprise was the staff.  From the doorman upon arrival through the concierge at departure the staff was just the right amount of friendliness and professionalism.  Even room service at 7am was so polite and nice about all my specific requests.  

If you want a place to stay in London that you look forward to going back to after a long day this is the place.",5,2019,03,24
124,Great hotel within a period building ,"We had three rooms booked for a family stay in London - Two rooms were standard ones, which were on the small size but nicely decorated with comfortable beds. The other room was a suite which was great. The hotel itself has quite a few facilities with main restaurant, cafe, cocktail bar and a space for afternoon tea. All the facilities were nice and it’s ideal if you’ll have some time to spend in the hotel. If you want to visit the cocktail bar then recommend you reserve a table as it was quite busy. 

We had particularly great service when we checked in, from Mollie, she was attentive and friendly and made a real effort to make the stay special for my parents who were celebrating an anniversary. 

Would definitely stay again. ",5,2019,03,23
124,Lovely stay,"The Kimpton is just a beautiful place. The moment you walk in, is just breathtaking. I loved the design and architecture. Room was small, but cosy. We had some drinks at the bar as well, really nice speak easy concept. Andrea at reception was really lovely. ",4,2019,03,22
124,Great Experience Staying Here,"I left a note when booking this hotel asking for an early check-in. Upon arrival, every crew member welcomed me warmly. Front desk associate Molly (not sure how to spell her name) kindly solved my booking issue. She is the best hotel associate I have worked with over the years in that she does not lose smile or patience when the booking issue lasted a while because of IHG team. I was also showed my room by Nicholas. For those who are interested in booking here, please do. As customers, we are not just surprised by clean room and window view. However, how Kimpton treats customers is not something we usually see elsewhere. Overall, this is the best experience of staying. A special thanks to Molly and Nicholas!",5,2019,03,22
124,THIS HOTEL ROCKS,"This hotel is sooo awesome, the atmosphere the people, everything is 100% perfect. they have a few people that i would like to give an extra two thumbs up, one is the concierge Luis Cesar, he helped us with anything we needed and every suggestion he gave us was 100% on point ! he was the best ever!!! then i have to mention Abdi, he was at the front desk and he helped soo much when i was in need of some very important information. if i ever go back to London this will be the hotel i stay in and i would highly recommend the Kimpton Fitzroy London.",5,2019,03,20
124,Amazing hotel and service ,"My partner and I stayed here and we had a great time! From beginning to end the staff were incredibly polite, friendly and helpful. We stayed in an incredible suite which the staff has decorated and had given us a bottle of champagne and cake. We went to two of the bars which both had a lovely atmosphere. The breakfast in the morning was lovely and the chef made our eggs as we asked them. A very big thank you to Connor and all the staff for an amazing stay! ",5,2019,03,20
124,Beautiful hotel,"Loved this hotel, the room was spotlessly clean and very comfortable and the breakfast was outstanding. The staff are very friendly and helpful. We travel a great deal for work and holidays which means we have seen the inside of many, many hotels, some of which I would never stay in again but I would definitely stay at the Kimpton Fitzroy again.",5,2019,03,20
124,Russell Sq.,"Lovely property. Clearly lovingly restored!

Stayed for a long weekend. Room was very nice and spacious with an amazing freestanding bath and poster bed. 

Breakfast in the restaurant was cooked to order and great quality. ",5,2019,03,19
124,Perfect for weekend trip,"Was there with my brother for the weekend. 
Room with two king beds is very nice. 
Staff very friendly and accommodating.
As it is near the Underground station (Russel Square, Picadilly Line) it is easy to reach via public transport as well.

124,An Amazing Place to Stay,"This was our first time at this fabulous hotel and unfortunately we were only staying at the Fitzroy for one night. We were greeted at the entrance by the most courteous friendly staff we have every come across in a hotel who took us to reception where the standard of service continued. It is impossible to enter this hotel and not be taken aback by the wonderful decor and history of the building.  We could find nothing to complain about at all , our room was lovely although compact it had everything you could have wished for even down to the umbrella for our personal use. The bathroom was amazing and supplied with a wonderful selection of toiletries and ample of towels.
We  arranged to meet our 2 sons and their girlfriends in Fitz's Cocktail bar at 6 pm  before going out for dinner, after which we had arranged to go to a piano bar elsewhere but having previously had such wonderful cocktails in Fitz's along with the excellent friendly service in yet another wonderful atmosphere inside this hotel we all decided to return there. Then of course there was Burr's where the whole experience continues, the coffee here is the best I have tasted outside of Italy and even better than some, a great place to relax after having walked around London as well as for breakfast. Well done to all of the staff the management should be very proud of you all. We can't wait to come back.",5,2019,03,19
124,Absolutely stunning hotel,"Stayed here on Saturday night with 7 other friends.  We had a suite which was just out of this world.  Heated floor in the bathroom, roll top bath, HUGE rainfall shower.  Other nice little touches were the complimentary bar and snacks, mugs for our tea (rather than teeny little cups), fresh milk and not carton - bathrobes, slippers, two televisions, two toilets!  Wow, pure luxury.  Even the toiletries were luxurious and smelt wonderful.

The exterior of the building is breath taking and to be honest so is the interior.  It's definitely one of the grandest hotels I have ever stayed in and would love to return.  Staff on reception can't do enough for you, a quick check-in and noon checkout, what's not to love.  Oh and a lovely view over Russell Square.

We didn't have the breakfast as it seemed a little pricey, but that was fine as we wandered over the road and went to a little café there.",5,2019,03,18
124,One of the best flawless,"From the moment you walk in, you are greeted by a pleasant young man opening  the door for you and directing you to reception.
Reception supervisor (Romea) was so helpful, manage to find us a room as we arrived super early.
The room OMG very spacious, great space in longe, bathroom with roll top bath and shower room over looking the park has got to be the best in the world ( no lie, being a world traveller).
Managers hour at 1700hrs was ok with free drinks but was expecting management team to come around and introduce themselves.
Palms bar, the decor was amazing, drinks price reasonable about £15 cocktails.
Don’t take the lift why not walk the magnificent stairs, similar to St Pancaras same feeling of grandeur, just like the rest of the hotel.
Breakfast at Burr & Co, was ok, loved the Kimpton shot to revitalise you, and of course the Prosecco.
Well done to guest services manager young lady, she made us feel special by coming over to us whilst we were waiting to check out, had a nice chat and she arranged our check out so we could go and venture and come back later nice touch.
Once again, Romea made so much effort taking care of us, would definitely return when in the area, see you soon.",5,2019,03,17
124,"Charming, attentive, educated staff in elegant surrondings","A surprise 50th Birthday treat was enjoyed over a two night stay in this gorgeous hotel earlier this month.
This impressive hotel (both inside and out) is perfectly positioned on Russell Square overlooking the park and a very short walk to both Euston and St Pancreas stations.
The greeting by the reception staff set the tone for our weekend; relaxed, efficient, smooth and so very welcoming it immediately felt like we were returning guests.
My lovely partner had booked a suite overlooking the park. The décor, size, ambiance and lay out of the suite was perfect. The bathroom was enormous and the 'stand alone' roll top bath and the huge shower were glorious. 
Following theatre pre-drinks (fine recommendation by the knowledgeable young concierge) and the show at the Savoy we couldn't wait to get back to the hotel's cocktail bar Fitz's. The bar nor the staff disappointed. A perfect blend ( just like the cocktails) of dimmed lights, sumptuous interiors, attentive and fun waiter staff made for a great evening.
Lunch the next day was booked at the hotel's Neptune restaurant. We were beautifully guided through a journey of delicious oysters, champagne, divine hake and the most delicious cheesecake we have ever eaten. The staff in the restaurant were amazing and in particular the Corsican sommelier (Sam) was a joy to meet. We returned later that evening for further oysters and champagne!
This hotel is a breathe of fresh air. It is a grand hotel and the interiors reflect its history but are elegantly contemporary. However, what is lacking (thankfully) is any air of grandeur about the staff. The youthful but intelligent, humorous but respectful, attentive but relaxed staff seemed to have been hand picked for their obvious love for hospitality and hotelier work.  We will of course be back. We plan to spend further celebrations at the hotel this year. We have found our favourite London 'go to'.",5,2019,03,17
124,A truly sumptuous hotel,"We stayed here for one night to celebrate our 23rd wedding anniversary. Upon arrival we were told we had been upgraded to a Junior Suite, which was a lovely surprise (first time ever!). The room was beautiful with a view over the park - the bathroom was gorgeous with separate roll top bath and heated flooring. To top it off we had a bottle of champagne chilling, a chocolate dessert and welcome message.  The Hotel is stunning, with beautiful architecture and the quality fittings and attention to detail is second to none. This created a relaxing stay in such a beautiful setting. The staff are all attentive but unintrusive. The hotel is well placed with the tube close by and near British Museum and theatres. Our anniversary was made extra special and we hope to stay here again. Highly recommended.",5,2019,03,17
124,Amazing Staff,"I stayed here for 2 nights as part of the celebration for my partner's 40th birthday. The staff were exceptional. The hotel itself is magnificent. I had arrived at the hotel with balloons in hand to decorate the room before my partner arrived. From the door man and porter who helped me with my luggage and balloons to the check in lady who upgraded our room to a suite - Andrea (I hope I got the name right). They made our stay so welcoming and personal. The room was amazing. Beautifully decorated. I had a room with a park view and it was incredible, overlooking the square. We had a 4-poster bed, which was very comfortable and an amazing bathroom with separate bath tub and waterfall shower and 2 sinks (one for each of us). Andrea had then sent us up a tray of complementary desserts with a note wishing my partner a happy birthday. The mini bar was full. The suite to our room had a fireplace in it. They have a turn down service and if you are in need of anything the staff will do their best  to make it happen. We went to their cafe Burr and Co after checking out and the staff there were lovely too. We had a meal, which was tasty and coffee and drinks, which were also good. Very comfortable place with plug sockets everywhere (if you're techies like us and need to work on your laptop this is good to know).I want to try their afternoon tea at The Palm Court next time. The restaurant looks great. A wonderful stay. The hotel itself is a grand building and beautifully done. The staff make it wonderful though. So welcoming and helpful.",5,2019,03,17
124,Exceptional customer service,"My wife, young son and I stayed at this beautifully appointed and well run hotel last night. I had reached out in advance of our stay to enquire about room availability for accommodating a small bed for our son and my enquiries were handled by Guest relations executive Juliana Vicente. Juliana  responded quickly, helpfully and professionally. We were left in no doubt that Juliana would do the best she could for us during our stay, and so it transpired (more so than we could ever have hoped). Juliana arranged a wonderful room with a great view which more than suited our space requirements and also arranged some wonderfully generous and thoughtful touches which greeted us in our room upon arrival. I had mentioned to Juliana that our visit to the hotel was part of a trip to visit London zoo with our son and that it was something he was very much looking forward to. In addition to some more conventional complementary items in the room there was also a hand written note from Juliana, an iced biscuit with an elephant on it and two small toys (a frog for the bath and a cuddly fox toy which has yet to leave my son’s side - he even slept with it). We were really touched by this kindness. 

All of the staff we encountered at the Fitzroy London were good but Juliana’s impact on our stay was truly unforgettable. We would love to come back one day and hope the next stay comes close to the special experience this one was.",5,2019,03,16
124,Truly fabulous hotel.,"Great staff, well located, stunning public areas, very comfortable, immaculate, well appointed rooms. 
A few more little complimentary ""treats"" in the rooms wouldn't go amiss - but that's the only negative point for me.
So overall this hotel does not disappoint. 
One of my go to hotels when I come to London.",5,2019,03,13
124,Weekend away,"Stayed here to celebrate my wife's 60th. The hotel and staff were outstanding. Great architecture, great service and great food.
Tube station just around the corner, all very convenient. Will definitely go again.",5,2019,03,13
124,Sadly-it is a 3 Star hotel that could be a 4 Star,"Great location for a hotel if you need to be near the schools in Bloomsbury.  Kimpton has taken it over, but it needs improvements despite all the money they put in to the renovation:

1) The shower leaks from the bottom of the shower door into the bathroom and we had to use 2 towels to stop the water flow.  

2) Room came without a bar of soap and instead provided just ONE pump jar of something called face and hand wash.  We had to carry it from the sink to the shower, but finally asked for a bar of soap.  Was given a small bar.  We wondered how many people had touched the pump before we did-not good.

3) We had the deluxe room but unfortunately it came without any dresser or chest of drawers.  There is plenty of room for the hotel to add one.  We were traveling in London for 5 days and had nowhere to put out our clothes.  I have a picture if anyone is interested to see all the space that could easily hold the dresser.  This is a must if it wants to be a 4 Star hotel.

4) There is a nice bar for an after dinner drink but you might not get in to use it.  They allow non guests of the hotel to book a seat at the bar or a table and one night we were left to sitting outside the bar in order to have a cocktail.  Huh?  The bar has two sides and it appears the one in the back was not used.  WHY??  NOTE TO HOTEL--you have the nicest bartenders.  They are FANTASTIC and make wonderful drinks and conversation.

Overall the staff was extremely friendly and helpful.  We thank them for making our stay a wonderful time.  The hotel itself needs some work in order to ancheive a higher rating.",3,2019,03,13
124,Fabulous Hotel in a less than fabulous area,"Firstly. this hotel is great
The architecture in the public areas is amazing, the staff are fabulous, the food at breakfast (included in tariff) was excellent at the buffet.

The room itself, while quite small was beautifully decorated and quiet, and everything in the bathroom worked well

The late afternoon drinks in the bar were a nice touch and added to the special atmosphere of the hotel.

And the outlook onto Russell Square is divine - a large public square in the heart of Bustling London

And having the Russell Square tube stop (Piccadilly Line) just around the corner is an excellent and welcome feature

But the hotel itself is a bit of an oasis in a Bloomsbury desert as far as eating and drinking attractions

There is a cinema complex around the corner with the usual Pret / eat / Starbucks offerings, and a couple of pubs dotted around the university buildings

It isn't really that close to the west end theatres and dining, so its tube or bus to get over there - nothing to really pop out the front door and get choices.

So bring your Oyster Card

But maybe I'm being really picky - it really is a nice hotel",5,2019,03,11
124,Excellent stay,"Wow, this hotel is certainly full of splendour. It's as impressive outside as it is inside, with a very classy bar which feels more like a private members' club! I only stayed for one night but was very impressed with everything, especially the staff. In particular Andrea on the front desk was very polite and helpful. This hotel is in a great location, just a short walk from London Euston and is also close to the theatres. Highly recommended.",5,2019,03,10
124,Excellent hotel...,Really enjoyed staying here and nice and central for theatres. Provided us with a late checkout no extra charge and enjoyed two nights in the lively bar each night. Some great cafes just round the corner too.,5,2019,03,10
124,Wonderful Experience,"From the moment you step through the doors into the stunning foyer of this amazing hotel you are greeted with such warmth, friendliness and professionalism. This hotel offers everything from a great location, luxury, a wonderful variety of restaurants and bars , beautiful rooms... cannot wait to stay again!!!",5,2019,03,10
124,Fantastic hotel. Luxurious and beautifully kept.,"This hotel is an up and coming luxury hotel. Grab the chance to go before the prices match the highest end hotels in the city. 
Palm court and the cocktail bar are simply beautiful, and the restaurant duplicating the titanic restaraunt. 
Umberto in palm court makes the experience even more pleasant, very friendly, attentive and hospitality  second to none.

Cant recommend highly enough.",5,2019,03,09
124,Classy luxury in stunning setting,"This hotel oozes class and history. It is close to the central part of the West End. But due to it’s location in the midst of very busy roads, a taxi- or Uber ride can take quite long.

Once inside you are welcomed by a very friendly staff and great concierges.
The standard rooms are not spacy but very comfortable and tastefully decorated.
The modern Victorian style bathrooms are excellent in all rooms.

The hotel also has the greatest hotel bar in all of London: Fitz’s. In boudoir style, very cosy and worth a visit.",5,2019,03,09
124,Very stylish Hotel at Russell Squre,"In the past I stayed at the Intercontinental Park Lane. As the Kimpton hotel family joint IHG group I gave it a try and stayed at the new Kimpton Fitzroy London.

I was most impressed by the stylish renovated rooms. A real 5 star hotel with a relaxed athmosphere.

124,Just a little bit of British storybook magic here ...,"Our family felt like we had experienced a bit of the British magic of Peter Pan, Nanny McPhee and Mary Poppins here! Meet the friendly doorman and Ruben the fix-it manager and Maria the housekeeper (who really is as lovely as Poppin’s)!",5,2019,03,09
124,Super helpful and handsome doorman Walter,"Very friendly and helpful whenever I leave or go back to the hotel. Especially helpful at getting a cab. 
A friendly smile goes a long way and leaves a very nice first impression of this hotel. 

The bar ambience was also nice. Room is cozy. Bed is comfortable. Services overall was satisfactory. Location is also good.",5,2019,03,07
124,Valter made our stay a delight.," We visit London frequently and decided to give this hotel a try. Hotel is quite beautiful and our 4 rooms were lovely but it's the friendly staff that really set this hotel apart from other 5 star properties.
The face of this hotel, the doorman Valter, truly made our stay a delight! He is the first person you see when you walk both in and out and honestly he alone is reason enough to return. ",4,2019,03,05
124,"Lovely People, perfect stay","The refurbished building is indeed grand and comfortable but the staff made our unexpected detour to London spectacular.  So notwithstanding my 60 years and extensive international travel I didn’t know that your USA passport  actually becomes worthless 3-6 months before its actual expiry.  When BA wouldn’t let me board to my intended distraction of Amsterdam I redirected to London because it hadn’t signed the treaty (the only good thing about Brexit).  That was on Friday night and so we had the weekend in London until the appointment I made on-line at the American embassy for Monday at 7:45 a.m.  The hotel staff so softened our landing.  Sean the concierge was a magician who produced tickets on a Saturday night to the sold out “Tina” — a once-in-a-lifetime theatre performance.  Alice at the front desk could solve any problem and leave you wishing she were part of your family.  Jallo In the lobby staff remembered us from day-to-day and gracefully followed up on whether his suggestions worked out as billed — they always did.  Others at the front desk and door were grand as well, I just can’t remember their names. In sum, my recommendation is without qualification.  ",5,2019,03,04
124,Best hotel!,"Absolutely stunning hotel but what made it even more better was the staff. So polite, enthusiastic and gave me and my partner such a warm welcome. Will 100% be coming back here next trip to London. Thank you",5,2019,03,03
124,Good value for a London 5 star hotel,"We stayed here on a last minute overnight visit to London. The staff were friendly and nicely informal. The room was well appointed if a little small. It was also well insulated for sound, which is a massive plus for a hotel in London.

The best thing though was the price. A 5 star hotel at last minute for the same price as a 3 star hotel along the road. A pleasant surprise.",4,2019,03,03
124,"Excellent location, facility and service","Very new and beautiful hotel, facility is excellent - loved shower and bed. stayed for four nights, enjoyed every night I spent there. Service was excellent , and the staffs are just lovely!

The only down side would be the room is a bit small for two people - but given London is an expensive city I’d give a pass to that one.

Definitely will stay again.",5,2019,03,03
124,My favorite. And that is saying something.,"I have been a Kimpton person for the past 15 years. I’ve stayed in around 20 of their properties, and had read that the Fitzroy hadn’t gotten the hang of it yet - not true. Now, I stayed in the off-season, and I hit Spire status upon arrival... so my super suite upgrade surely affected how deeply I fell in love, and the stellar value I got for the money (not something you can usually say about London.) But, yes... the most beautiful park-front suite ever. Fabulous bath, fabulous bed, glorious attention to detail. Breakfast was prompt and delicious. Lots of lovely extras. Perfect historic restoration of a stunning building. Staff - including bellmen, front desk, housekeeping, and managers - all incredibly kind and helpful. I LOVE this place.

...with one imperfection: the bar. The staff there were far less welcoming; I felt like an inconvenience, rather than a guest. I adored the whiskey bar space in the back - much prettier than the disco ball room - but they wouldn’t offer service there to me or my friend. Not on Tuesday, Thursday, or Saturday. Not early, not late. When is it open?! And the front desk tried to argue the Kimpton “raid the bar” credit could only be used for alcohol... contrary to what’s written on the card, and essentially denying that amenity to anyone who’s in recovery, or pregnant, or religious, or on antibiotics. Not a good policy.

Regardless, though, still madly in love. Fix the bar dynamic, and it might beat out the Dwell in Chattanooga for my #1 favorite on earth.",5,2019,03,02
124,Will be back great hotel lovely staff,"Arrived at the hotel late around 01:00 after misfortune at the airport with delays I was astonished to see smiling faces at the hotel at this early hour in the morning, Ana the receptionist was very friendly and answered all our questions. My husband who is always hungry was particularly interested in the mentioned 24/7 room service food unexpectedly Ana was able to take our order at the check in desk that was very efficient. 

Paul ( I think Paul need name badges) the bell boy at night helped with the bags to the room after the delays at the airport this was a great help for our exhausted body’s, Small room but everything we needed for a quick stay. One thing I would like to say is the room service needs to be faster I fell asleep while waiting for my husband’s food.

Overall will be back!!",5,2019,03,02
124,Exactly what a 5* hotel should be,"Visiting London to see a show for my boyfriend's birthday, and this hotel was perfect from start to finish. The door staff greeted us like old friends and the lobby was absolutely stunning. No expense has been spared here and it shows.

We were checked in by Emma on reception and made our way up to the suite - cake in the room on arrival and a handwritten birthday card were a lovely touch. It was spotlessly clean, modern and a very attractive room. The Palm Court bar and Neptune restaurant were lovely.

I could not recommend this hotel enough, and will definitely return next time I am in London.",5,2019,03,02
124,Fantastic hotel for Business or Pleasure,"Met by Walter,maybe doorman instantly made us feel welcome, great guy who takes great pictures! #payriseforwalter Hotel itself was perfect. Would highly recommend! Rooms are beautiful, spacious and luxury. Staff are great",5,2019,03,02
124,Love everything about this hotel,"It was a love affair the moment I arrived at this gorgeous hotel directly on russel square. $100 M renovation restored her to her glory days w a modern touch. There’s even a brass dragon statue whose sister form didn’t survive the titanic! 

Anyway, the standard rooms are small but well appointed. Great shower, towel warmer, robe, yummy cotton duvet... umbrella in the room in case it rains! After an exhausting day the room is a haven. 

The staff are all lovely. One doorman took me on a tour. You must see the ballroom and atrium. The Fitz Bar  staff will introduce you to Ogilvie potato Vodka, a must if your having a martini. I will special order this vodka when I get back to the states! Thx Jennifer. 

On this trip our amazing doorman ran around the block to get us a cab. I think his name is Paul (hair in a ponytail). 

The neighborhood is ok. But since my office is on Grays Inn Road, I can walk to the office. It’s close enough to Marlybone to walk in 20 minutes. 

For my needs, this is the best place in the area!",5,2019,03,01
124,A Lovely Surprise !,"I really din't know what to expect as I've not stayed at a Kimpton before, but this Hotel ticks all the boxes, lovely rooms; great staff; nice selection of bars and eateries and all set in an authentically restored environment. Particularly liked the rooms decor, the bar is excellent and the breakfast very good. A few tiny comments, front desk team seem more serious and regimented than the rest of the Hotel and the warmth of welcome and  service quality at breakfast not the same as the rest of the day. Just small comments, overall a great stay !",5,2019,02,28
124,5 stars all around,"One of the best hotel experiences I have ever received. I had the weekend in London before a work conference, so I was flying solo. The room was absolutely perfect, loved the ambiance of the bathroom and the most comfortable bed. The customer service was outstanding from check in to check out- I will definitely be back.",5,2019,02,28
124,"Great Staff, and cool atmosphere","Thank you Paul Walters, 

Perfect stay at the Kimpton Hotel. What i really always think make the biggest difference in many hotels is the staff. From the door man through to the reception and the breakfast this place was exceptional. 
Rooms are modern and well equipped, location was perfect and the bar is cool.

I will be back again.",5,2019,02,28
124,Memorable stay,"We had a great stay, the hotel itself is beautiful, inside and out! The staff were all welcoming and genuine which was very nice. We were staying for a special occasion and got a free upgrade to a corner suite. The corner suite was beautiful and spacious. It was definitely the highlight of our stay,  the champagne, cake, and handwritten note from Juliana in the room was also a pleasant surprise and a very thoughtful gesture.

We loved the rooms and the attention to detail, from the artwork to the books dotted around the room everything was well thought out. There were some items in the room like the phone and tea mugs which were available to purchase in the lobby, it's a great idea and I took a tea mug home to remember our stay by :) 

The tuck box in the mini bar with complimentary snacks and drinks was lovely to have, our room was ""turned down"" in the afternoon and housekeeping left us bottles of water by the bed as well as little chocolates. I am not sure if this is a feature of every room or if it was special treatment for the corner suite. I'd say because of our upgrade we actually returned to the hotel in the afternoon to spend more time in the room and unwind before going out again.

Have we not been upgraded perhaps our experience would have been different, but it is a beautiful property and that cannot be denied. The location is fantastic for getting around, Russel Square station is around the corner, British Museum is a 5 minute walk. 

One morning we stopped for a coffee at Burr & Co but sadly weren't impressed, it was overpriced and not particularly good, but again the interior of it was beautiful.

The social or ""wine"" hour that takes place every day from 5-6 is a lovely feature as well, we went down to have a drink and chatted to the restaurant manager who was very pleasant.

Like I said before everyone at the hotel was very friendly. I would particularly like to mention Juliana who gave us a little tour and showed us the Lucky George and the bellman whose name I, unfortunately, didn't catch.

Overall we couldn't have had a better stay and are looking forward to returning again!",5,2019,02,28
124,This is a GRAND hotel!,"The location is very central and it is in easy ten minute  walking distance of Euston Station.
From the outside the building is magnificent, ornate  to the point of breathtaking  There is a blue plaque saying that Emmeline Pankhurst and her daughter lived in a house that was located where the hotel now stands. The interior does not disappoint, enormous marble columns ,shiny mosaic floors and crystal chandeliers  There has been a recent refurbishment so the the decor throughout the hotel is  immaculate, clean and fresh. Everything in the room is top notch and stylish, with nice quirky touches such as the old  style red telephone, giving a nod to the old red phone boxes  in the square outside . The mattress and quilt were so luxurious I wanted to find out the brand. In the evening hundreds of tea lights were dotted around the vast staircase making for a very cosy ambiance.The staff were without exception  courteous and welcoming. There is a social hour with free drinks from 5-6 pm in The Neptune Bar. A special mention for Peter and Caroline who were both extremely welcoming, charming and a mine of information about the hotel""s history and surrounding area. Apparently there are some more Kimpton hotels about to open in the UK and if this one is anything to go by I would not hesitate to recommend. Thank you for a wonderful stay!
",5,2019,02,28
124,Fabulous,"This is an amazing hotel. 

Staff were very polite at check in. 

I had a nice room with views on the park. Request a high level room if possible as the  street noise can be a little loud. 

The building is very impressive. 

Bar staff were very knowledgeable in relation to local attractions and also made very nice cocktails. 

Breakfast(s) was amazing !! 

Concierge were also very helpful during my stay. I would recommend and will return to this hotel. 

",5,2019,02,27
124,Impressive First stay,"Perfect first experience at the Kimpton Fitzroy.  Friendly staff welcomed me and check in was handled quickly and efficiently.  My room was very well appointed.  I particularly liked the lattice effect tiling in the bathroom, the old fashioned phone and the complementary snacks.  After a good night’s rest I took breakfast at Neptune restaurant.  Rarely have I enjoyed a breakfast so much in a hotel.  Everything freshly cooked using good quality ingredients.  Can’t wait for my next opportunity to stay here.",5,2019,02,26
124,Superb weekend break!,"My wife and I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights recently and we couldn't fault it. From the friendly welcome of the doorman and the early check-in from Claire on reception (who let us into our room at noon after an early flight down from Aberdeen - thanks Claire) to all the staff who served us food and drinks, their friendliness and professionalism could not be faulted. Thank you all for giving us a wonderful stay!
We booked our room through Secret Escapes which meant that we got a good deal and it made our city break more luxurious than it would normally be 😊",5,2019,02,25
124,Well placed,From the welcome when we arrived to the farewell on departure we felt at home with a friendly staff. A problem with printing room keys on arrival was quickly sorted. Try afternoon tea in the Palm Court. The welcome drinks in the Neptune restaurant was a nice touch. The colours will not be too everyone's taste. My wife thought there was just too much grey! The standard rooms are on the small size with the bathroom a bit of a squeeze. That said the shower is great. Breakfast in the Neptune restaurant was great that in the Burr & Co coffee shop a bit less so. Only sour dough bread was available. However we had a great stay and would come back for more.,5,2019,02,25
124,A pleasant surprise,"Had booked a junior suite for a week's stay. Probably one of the most spacious and comfortable rooms we ever stayed in London and at a reasonable cost/quality ratio (for London high end hotels). Excellent location with easy access to underground, rail, theatre district, museums and restaurants. Beautifully renovated building. Overall very friendly, efficient and knowledgeable staff with a particular mention for Paul at breakfast and Sean at the concierge desk. A few minor inconsistencies with housekeeping, other than that a great stay. Will be back.",5,2019,02,25
124,Disability review,"We came with a wheelchair and were generally very impressed. The website could be clearer as when we arrived I thought how on earth am I going to get up those steep steps (IE I was assuming they would put down a ramp but it was going to be very steep...) But Walter  - who was very helpful throughout our stay - pressed a button and half the stairs retracted and turned into a wheelchair lift! So impressed. Definitely would say put this on your website as it would have reassured me, but also it should be celebrated. We found the accessible room very good, and loved the retractable rails in the bathroom - so nice to think through accessible design and make it attractive. One negative - no better rooms are available for disabled guests; just standard ones. This is a shame as disabled people like a nice view etc too! All the staff during our stay were very good, especially Louise the Concierge. The one problem we had was that people were not up to date on Blue Badge parking, and we were taken to a space which actually no longer existed! Louise managed to find a space the next day (although it was already taken) - so I've emailed the hotel to ask them to update their staff on where disabled people can park. I also suggest disabled people are told to pull into the side road to disembark - trying to get the wheelchair out on the busy road just with double yellow lines at the front didn't feel very safe. This is easily solved as I suggest and I've emailed the hotel again about this. All the food options were very good, and again good staff who seemed relaxed and well trained. There is only one thing which really needs changing and that's the toilet paper! Whether someone had accidentally ordered the wrong sort I don't know, but it was thin. But that's one small thing within a wealth of loveliness. Thank you for a lovely stay. I really enjoyed the luxury and yet relaxed atmosphere.",5,2019,02,24
124,Large hotel that still feels cozy,"Everything about the hotel says old school grandeur, but still with a welcoming club feel.
From the mosaic tiles on the floor to the impressive staircases the recent revamp to a Kimpton has been well done.
Friendly knowledgeable staff are happy to answer questions and the bars and restaurants (and there are a few!) are comfortable and stylish.
The rooms are a bit on the small side if you are used to a modern hotel, but average for a hotel of this age, and certainly big enough to sleep, shower and change before going out central London for the day/evening.",5,2019,02,24
124,A real treat,"Was lucky enough to secure a free nights stay at the hotel through my rewards programme. As a result we will definitely be back on our next trip to London!

The architecture of the building matches the service we received from The entrance through Check Out, Kimpton definitely look after the finer details!

From Popcorn to in room toiletries and bottles of water at check out, everything was first class.

We used the Kimpton brand in London to gauge how we liked it ahead of an upcoming stay at the Kimpton Vero Beach! If this stay was anything to go buy, we can’t wait!!

The room was spotless with well presented decor and high quality amenities throughout.

Well done Kimpton! 👍",5,2019,02,24
124,Fabulous hotel ,"We have just got back from this  beautiful hotel that has been modernly refurbished and was a really comfortable stay BUT reception wasn't very good as when we checked in I wasn't greeted as an IHG member or offered points or a drink, hich is brand standard and I wasn't told where the facilities were or anything about breakfast which I found all disappointing but then we came across Walter who was a lovely helpful man who told us all about breakfast and where things were, he is an asset to the hotel and would probably be great on reception as check out was just as bad as the receptionist had no smiles or charisma at all, shame as it's a beautiful hotel.",4,2019,02,24
124,Quaint boutique hotel,"Absolutely enjoyed my stay at Kimpton. All the staff are extremely.helpful, the receptionists always smile, what a pleasure to have a smile and greeting when i am passing by. Breakfast took a bit too long on some days but despite that it was delicious. Definitely suggest trying the waffles. What a pleasure it was to be hosted by a sister IHG property. ",5,2019,02,23
124,Extraordinary hotel,"This is a real legendary hotel in the heart of London 
The rooms are cozy and give a real home sensation. 
The service is great.
The public spaces are astonishing. 
Check the lobby and the palm court.
Do not think twice, this is the real deal 
",5,2019,02,23
124,OLD BUT MODERN,"This hotel is for you if you want something old but modern. It might look like an old run down hotel but it is really modern. It is really convenient when it comes to location.

PS: Try the cafe. It is really good. Order the tea.",5,2019,02,22
124,Charming experience with excellent serevice!,"We spent four nights in this architectural gem. The room was spacious and immaculate and the location perfect for walking this beautiful city. Of special note was the impeccable customer service. All staff were incredibly attentive, helpful and cheerful, but we particularly enjoyed our daily chats with doorman Walter whose love for the city and his job was inspirational! We would definitely stay here again.",5,2019,02,21
124,Just such a lovely place to stay,Another very quick visit to this area of Bloomsbury to combine a catch up with our son and daughter plus a cookery course at the Good Housekeeping Institute. The Kimpton was formerly the Principal and has retained the same amazing selling point - the staff. Valter the door man is an absolute credit to the Kimpton. He remembers guests and his approach is friendly but not overbearing or pretentious with an element of humour that Is rare in many hotels of this standard. We were very fortunate to be upgraded and room 606 will not disappoint. It is spacious and allows you to get a real feel for a London apartment.....our daughters 2 bedroom London home is considerably smaller than the whole of 606! The hotel is beautiful and stylishy decorated but not stuffy at all. The bar staff in Fitzs bar are young and enthusiastic with a real knack for making you feel very comfortable.We are back again in mid March - testament to how lovely this place is. Whilst they do offer a super breakfast facility a trip to Tropea in the Russell Square Gardens is a must. If you don’t make breakfast then once spring is upon us just sit outside and watch the world go by.,5,2019,02,20
124,Great hotel!,"I really love this place, the staff, service and very comfy beds. Even the smallest rooms feel cosy. Staff are so helpful and kind. The free little treats in the room are lovely. The place is very beautiful and the bar is amazing with friendly staff and costly (for this non-londoner) but very delicious drinks! The perk of a voucher on checking in is very lovely but sadly only to be used at fitz's on a Sunday....perhaps allowing use on other nights before 5.30/6.30 would be a good option?
Free drinks reception and gym and such a great location too. Concierge extremely helpful.

There's a few things to improve: 

Consistency of housekeeping.

a wider selection of non caffeine tea bags in rooms

the lamp in my room was very difficult to turn off as the switch is on the floor but you have to move a chair and table to get to it (city single). I just never turned it on again once I'd eventually managed to turn it off. Best to not have it on when you check in?

Palm court food is very variable in quality. Room service staff are very helpful but food was sometimes delicious and sometimes overcooked and dry.

As check out is at 12 it would be nice to get brunch at burr and co a bit later, after check out but sadly this is when breakfast is over and lunch not yet started. Food at the counter here is ready made and can't be altered to accommodate people.

Finally,I am used to thinking about accessibility for work and I'm wondering if more could be done to help with this. The option to click a wheelchair button when booking direct is wonderful to quickly see if accessible rooms are available and what they offer.  

A clearly marked step free access to the building, higher contrast lift numbers/floor labels and walk in showers in smaller rooms would be helpful.

It's great they specify that service dogs are welcome. Would be good to know if there are rooms that have been kept pet free for those with allergies though.",4,2019,02,20
124,Superb,"Not a bad word to say. Booked to stay a night here with my girlfriend, upon arrival we were greeted by a lovely Spanish receptionist who was very friendly and professional, she told us that we could upgrade our room for free to one of the corner suites if we waited a few minutes. We went for a drink at the bar which had some great cocktails whilst we waited. The room was absolutely fantastic, amazing views, huge lounge and a massive bedroom with a large bath in the corner overlooking the square through the windows. The bathroom and shower were lovely and spacious too. All the finishing touches were excellent. Can't wait to go back!",5,2019,02,20
124,We loved it!,"Gorgeous hotel.... The staff was courteous, helpful, and friendly. They even went above and beyond and surprised my son with a birthday cake for his sixteenth bday. Spacious rooms and clean. Location was awesome. Great walking neighborhood near Soho/Covent Garden. Can’t say enough great things...we will be back for sure! Thank you for a wonderful stay!",5,2019,02,18
124,Absolutely beautiful hotel ,This is a top class hotel in a good location walking distance inti soho. Very nice bar for  hanging out and a coffee shop offering lunch which was delicious.  Staff very friendly and check in was quick. Rooms are a nice size and beautifully decorated.  Would recommend this hotel when staying in London.  ,5,2019,02,18
124,Nice hotel,"Very nice hotel room with excellent housekeeping service, concierge are very helpful.
However breakfast need a big improvement, I will rate breakfast as average for quality & service.
Nice old building with amazing antiques around.",4,2019,02,18
124,Good dog friendly hotel in central London,"Chose this hotel for the main reason that they were dog friendly. As many other IHG hotels aren’t.

As requested we had emailed the hotel prior to the stay to advise them we were bringing our dog.  The staff were really good with her and she even had her own bed and dog bowls in the room!

The hotel itself is situated right next to Russell Square tube station or about a 10-15 min walk away from Euston or Kings Cross station.

We booked a room only standard urban room, which was fine for one night. The room was small but well appointed and had all the amenities you needed.  Was really pleased with the designers attention to detail.  Even to where to place plug sockets i.e. next to the bed to charge phones and next to the mirror for the hairdryer.  The plug sockets even had usb charging points! Bathroom was also wonderful and had a great rainfall shower and the toiletries were also lovely. Bed was comfy and had a really good nights sleep.

The two things that let the hotel down was their membership benefits.  When we checked in we were told as platinum members we received £15 credit towards drinks. I asked if we could use this towards breakfast instead and was told it was up to us. However that night we were told it could only be used against drinks in the bar or drinks at breakfast.  So I then decided to use it towards evening drinks.  I went to the bar and was told I could you the voucher against ONE drink only?? When I questioned it was £15 credit and could I use it against more than one drink I was told no! I then asked about this at reception the next day and was told it was incorrect and I could have used it against as many drinks as I wanted!  They then kindly issued another voucher.  However as it was a Sunday it was only valid at Fitz bar which opened at 4pm! Pointless as our check out was way before this!

The other niggle was the night before I asked for a late check out but was told to ask in the morning. Most hotels are able to tell you this as they know how many people are checking in etc. Also it helps customers to plan their next day better!  When I did phone receptionist in the morning, they were kind enough to extend check out to 2pm complimentary with the Platinum membership.

Overall yes I would stay here again, it is one of the better hotels I’ve stayed at in London! All the staff from reception to Walter the doorman were polite and welcoming; and made you feel at home. The hotel common areas were well decorated and had a luxury feel to them. Definite hats off to the designers.
",4,2019,02,17
124,"A wonderful, chic, character hotel in an ideal location ","We had a standard room that was a very acceptable size and beautifully decorated, the building is lovely and felt like a larger boutique hotel, very chic. We stayed for my birthday and when we went down for a drink in the very nice Palm Restaurant, we came back and there was a little cake in the room with a little note wishing me a happy birthday, such a sweet gesture. The staff were informal, extremely friendly and accommodating. For breakfast you can choose between a la Carte in one of the restaurants or a buffet in the other restaurant for a bit of variety. One of my favourite things was a more relaxed check out time at 12 and breakfast finished at a later time of 11:30 which means a less rushed morning.

If I was to offer one piece of small constructive criticism ;) the shower makes the whole bathroom a little wet as a result of the design. 

We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would absolutely stay again for a special occasion.

Thank you! ",5,2019,02,16
124,I regret staying here,"I was here last many years ago when it was a battered old relic, but somehow charming.  Now it’s all renovated in a clearly Trumpian style, except the rooms which are spartan and indeed almost military-barracks style, and with staff that is not really helpful.  

When I arrived with a taxi, there was no place to pull up, so it let me out diagonally across the street.  I had to move my luggage there and then up the stairs to reception, as there are no other options and no doorman was in sight.  Inside, the reception lady apologized, gave me a bar voucher as compensation, and sent me my way.  Since elevators are modern (you select the floor before you go) and unintuitive and doors not easy to find, that was not nice, and again I had to lug my stuff.  So I’d say arrival category maybe IBIS.

The hotel has only one category of single rooms, and these clearly are former drivers’ and maids’ rooms.  To offer these may be okay, but if you charge €240 a night, I expect a room with minimum facilities for a business traveler (isn’t that 90% of the clientele for singles?), which is not the case.  Believe it or not, there is no place to hang your shirts, let alone jackets or pants! (Cupboard is too small; no drawers either and no suitcase rack of course.)  So I ask the reception lady about it and she says, “Oh, we hear that all the time!”  She then offers to send a clothes rack up, which I agree to, although there is no space (looks like a Hong Kong dorm now).  In a Laurel & Hardy way, this very cheap plastic rack breaks down four times when I try to get it work, as it was not put together properly by the staff.   Seriously?

The room itself is really bad – tiny, constant rumbling noise from the air chutes in the courtyard which it faces, bad lighting coordination, one small round table for everything, just one outlet for normal electricity.  The “tuck box” people have been raving on about is two small bags of popcorn and a mini industrial chocolate bar.  And no coffee making facilities or coffee – just tea.  When I ask at reception, I am given three coffee vouchers for the café at the corner because “We do have Nespresso machines in the rooms, but not in the singles.” What the… business travelers don’t drink coffee?! Any Japanese tiny single I ever stayed in at least had dripfilter packages.  So I go to the coffee bar to get a flat white (they seem to try to voucher things out), but the three bar staff are so busy sorting out someone’s order/bill that I finally give up and go to my room and have a tea.

The bathroom is really nice, if under-toweled, and with condiments in large plastic containers – again, the IBIS touch.  Still, this is the best part of the room, plus the empty minibar (with one small UHT milk and sparkling and still water for free).  But altogether… 

The hotel interior was partially designed by the guy who also did the Titanic.  The somewhat stretched metaphor for me is that this hotel is sunk as well, because it is refurbished and run without the guest in mind, or at least as a priority.  (For status couples from Dubuque or Chengdu having a luxury weekend here, the kind that write the glowing reviews, that might be different somehow.)  The place was recommended to me by our host institution; I will tell them they made a mistake, and overall I regret staying here.  

Breakfast starts at 7am (!); let’s see how that is, but my hopes are not high.",2,2019,02,14
124,Amazing Valentine's Experience ,"The building is absolutely stunning and all the staff members we have encountered were charming and professional. Valentine's dinner at Neptune was great and the restaurant staff were all very welcoming and friendly. 
Special thanks to Daniel for his hospitality, we will definitely return soon. 

Best wishes,
Vlad",5,2019,02,14
124,Excellent new hotel in Central London ,"Stayed here for the first time in January for a long weekend. The location is excellent - right on Russell Square - and having stayed at other Kimptons in the US, my expectations for the interior design was high. What can I say? Stylish, well thought out, quirky without being kitsch, elegant... my expectations were more than exceeded.

About the room: by London standards the room is well sized. I took the cheapest option as I was literally only there to sleep, however I would have happily spent more time in the room. Beautiful design touches and details. The amenities are also excellent, especially the “goody box.” 

The bathroom is on the cosy side, although the shower is surprisingly large. For one person it was fine. May be a bit of a squeeze for two.

Service was excellent. Staff were smiley, friendly and above all, efficient. Above all, it was well priced. 

The coffee shop on the side is a great plus. Good size, friendly staff, well designed. My coffee cake loaf was undercooked however, a little disappointing. 

Overall, I was very happy with my stay and have already booked to come back again. A great addition to the London hotel landscape! ",5,2019,02,14
124,An excellent choice,"I decided to make the Kimpton Fitzroy my base of operations for a week while catching up with friends and for a few business meetings.  It was a great choice.  The main floor has a very nice coffee shop/cafe, a very large (and visually appealing) tea room, an attractive bar and a more formal restaurant that is open in the evenings.  It was convenient to be able to invite people to the hotel and be able to entertain without having to roam too far afield.  Even so, the location is a good one for getting around.  The hotel sits right on Russell Square and it is a quick walk to the Russell Square tube stop (Piccadilly Line).  If you take the Paddington Express in from Heathrow, it is relatively quick and easy to get to the hotel using the tube.  Of course, you can catch a cab right at the front door.  It’s a short walk to the British Museum and short tube rides to most of central London and the City.  There are also cafes, coffee shops and a shopping mall within a five minute walk. 

The staff were amazing.  They were helpful, cheerful, professional and quick with a smile.  Special acknowledgement is due to housekeeping.  Thanks to jet lag and my schedule I was in my room at odd hours, e.g., sleeping in to catch up on a sleepless night or coming back from a meeting in the middle of the afternoon.  Somehow housekeeping managed to clean up the room when I needed it to be done, i.e., no knocks on the door to hurry things along or someone under foot when you come back from a meeting.  In addition, the room always looked great after they cleaned it up!

My room was small but well appointed.  It was actually fine for one person.  WiFi was free and fast, there was a big flat screen tv with lots of channels, a fridge with milk and water, a pot for boiling water and some free snacks (popcorn and chocolate).  No coffee pot but, as I said, the coffee shop is a nice one and right downstairs.  The food items were replaced if you ate something which was a nice touch.  The bathroom was also very nice and spotlessly clean.  I was struck by how quiet my room was, day and night.  When I was able to sleep the silence really helped.

The gym was one of the best I’ve seen in a hotel and there is a small, but not very private, business center downstairs as well.  As other reviewers have pointed out they will check you in if you arrive early and take your bag until your room is ready.  I checked in at around 9 a.m. but my room didn’t become available until 3 p.m.  They tell you that rooms won’t be available until 3 p.m. on their site and it appears that they mean it.  Definitely not a complaint but don’t live in false hope and be prepared to go find something to do with your day until the room is ready.

Anyway, I very much liked the Fitzroy.  If offered a good location, a terrific staff, nice amenities, a comfortable room and pleasant surroundings.,",5,2019,02,12
124,Brilliant all around,"This really is one of the best Kimptons I've stayed at. It's beautiful both inside and out, the location is fantastic with easy walks to shopping on Oxford Street and SoHo, other attractions in central London, and the British Museum and a tube stop right around the corner.  The staff were very friendly and helpful, and the room we had was quite large by London standards. The Fitz, the bar downstairs, is beautiful and features an extensive list of fantastic cocktails - and again, the staff here was great. My only gripe is that the hotel claims the restaurant serves breakfast until 11:00 am, but we showed up at 10:35 am and were told it was too late. That's ridiculous.",5,2019,02,12
124,Most amazing hotel stay I’ve ever had!,"This hotel... WOW! So elegantly executed, all marble everything, colors, design, furniture and the stuff flawless. Congrats to the general manager and architect. They will make sure that you don’t miss anything during your stay. Concierge can get the best tables in the city even on the weekends. Champagne for breakfast, you got it! Spotlessly clean centimeter to centimeter. Very well equipped gym. Good location, just a few meters away from subway and a Supermarkt, bakeries, restaurants and bars. During my stay I had to book another date to stay with and I’m not even sure I can get off the work. Lol that’s how amazing they are! ",5,2019,02,12
124,Brilliant new find!,"Booked this hotel as I’m an IHG member and having walked past this hotel for years wanted to try it after its refurb!
I’m speechless - I’ve been to many hotels in my time but the level of service here was amazing! From the moment we walked in we were made to feel welcome- the room was incredible - comfortable, stylish and functional! I truly cannot wait to go back! The manager has done an amazing job!
Thank you! ",5,2019,02,10
124,Prestige at a Price,"My husband and I have stayed at several Kimpton hotels in the USA and have always been extremely impressed so we were thrilled when Kimpton finally arrived in London. This used to be the Principal hotel and was refurbished and relaunched as a Kimpton last year. It certainly has the wow factor. The lobby is wonderfully impressive.  They have also retained the ‘wine hour’ where guests can get together for complimentary wine (and beer too here!). Rooms are luxurious - though I felt that if you opt for a standard room (like us) they are all rather snug. We enjoyed a drink in the bar at the end of the evening- cosy, smart, efficient and friendly staff. The thing that actually disappointed was breakfast, if you opt for the full English at the main restaurant it’s a whopping £32 per person, in the less formal restaurant area it was still £25. Also, to end service at 10:30 on a Sunday seems early. Felt like they were urging us to leave. The only other option is a cafe / bar area which served pastries and coffee. The location is excellent, facilities were excellent but prices were steep. ",4,2019,02,10
124,A luxurious stay ,"Booked this as a birthday treat to enjoy a nice meal drinks and rest. On arrival the grade 2 listed building was stunning! The bellboys were polite and welcoming with a huge smile. Reception was airy and checking was smooth with great engagement. The young man on reception. Was very polite and friendly. Provided all the relevant hotel information we required. The rooms were of a good size and enjoyed the complimentary snacks and drinks as a little treat. This is the type of shower I want in my house with their offered toiletries. A bright rainfall shower. They think of everything from umbrella to fresh milk for a proper coffee. The cocktails were very tasty in the fitz! The deco was beautiful and really enjoyed the atmosphere. We stayed about an hour to enjoy a birthday cocktail, enjoyed the atmosphere and watching the staff make cocktails. We later went to enjoy another drink opposite the entrance it was more quiet and sat next to the fireplace was chilled and romantic. Prices all around were very reasonable for London and being in a luxury hotel! Will honestly say this one one of my best birthday stays in some time! Will book here or another Kimpton for sure. Also the drink perk for gold elite was much appreciated! Never had breakfast as we wanted a little rest and walk around London and experience the city vibes. Recommend the vodka Ricky cocktail and the pina colada. Nice Sauvignon Blanca in the other bar was lush! Thanks to all staff we came in contact with even housekeeping saying good morning in passing!",5,2019,02,10
124,"Small rooms, but well executed","Recently, we had reason to stay overnight in London.  We decided to book in the Kimpton as I understood it had been renovated in the past year.
This is clearly a grand old building that has been renovated, and one gets the impression that no expense was spared to bring back the former shine of the interior.  The public areas are luxurious, and the rooms are very well appointed.  That said, I did find our room quite small.
The bars and eating areas are a welcome change from the normal London options.",4,2019,02,10
124,Lovely staff and comfortable surroundings.,"Booked a twin double with a  sitting room area. The room was a delight to arrive to after the bitterly cold weather. Fresh clean beautifully finished, I love the little quirky things that the Kimpton always provides. Their range of books and good coffee maker in your room. Two large screen TVs one beautifully mounted on an easel. 
The Neptune restaurant was very good. The staff excellent and the relaxed atmosphere heaven after a day of delays. 
Fast becoming my favourite hotel group Kimpton has pleased me totally again.",5,2019,02,10
124,Splendid,"Oh if only other hotels in the group had the same attitude as the Fitzroy.
It was like a breath of fresh air staying here.
Recognised and upgraded as a Spire Elite without the usual ""all our executive rooms are booked"" excuse.
Fantastic room, clean, superbly comfortable bed and the most friendly staff who don't see every customer enquiry as an albatross round the neck!
looking forward to our return.",5,2019,02,06
124,"Good location, poor value for money","The Fitzroy is nicely located on Russell Square, just off the British Museum and the tube. Recently opened, it is beautifully refurbished and modern. The rooms are small and a little claustrophobic. At 1.91m, I was not able to stand in the shower. Breakfast is utterly disappointing and starts late (from 07:00, too late for many business travellers). If this were a mid-range priced hotel, I guess I would be perfectly happy. But considering their top-of-range pricing I am pretty underwhelmed. ",3,2019,02,06
124,Good service and food,"Visited the Neptune Restaurant for a meal. Service was welcoming, served at the pace that suits us and food was first class - nice evening. The seafood platter was well prepared and presented, bottle of good quality Sancerre at £50 reasonable for a 5 star hotel. Cocktails in the bar properly mixed, in the right glasses and fairly priced - a big improvement on the old Russell!",5,2019,02,05
124,Another amazing stay,"Returned to my home away from home...Once again my family and I had a most enjoyable stay.
Our suite was ready prior to regular check in time. Inma and Ruben in front office always go the extra mile to ensure we are looked after. I met Louis in concierge for the first time, he was very sweet and friendly whilst entertaining my son. 
Once again, housekeeping department has outdone themselves. The little things they do for my family and I always warms my heart. Thank you to Jolita and Anita for always working extra hard. Your contributions are not unoticed.",5,2019,02,04
124,Dinner on our last night in London,"We went for our last night dinner at Kimpton Fitzroy last Saturday 2nd February. We were impressed by the beauty of this hotel and one immediately feels at home. We were attended to as soon as we entered the restaurant and all was excellent, food, atmosphere and most of all the service. We would like to thank Adam for serving us so well and in a professional way. He was so caring and friendly. Thank you Adam and keep up the wonderful service. We will come again for sure if we happen to be in London. Well done.",5,2019,02,04
124,Lovely building good staff and comfortable ,"I just completed a long stay and overall it was very comfortable in a wonderful building and good location. Hotel and Bar Staff were very friendly and welcoming.
My criticism surround the cafe Burr and Co where it’s stand and get served which is slow except meal times and some of the staff lack charm.
I do not understand why you try and serve a large dining space with one counter person.
The bedrooms are small and I had difficulty finding space to work even though I made it clear checking in I would be staying a long time.
The gym is ok but there is no pool.
Overall very good but not perfect.",4,2019,02,02
124,Fantastic Stay - Excellent  Service,"Fantasic stay at the Kimpton Fitzroy. The rooms are beautiful and the service was second to none.

The concierge team are one of the best, they went above and beyond to make sure our stay was comfortable, nothing was to much trouble for them.

Will definitely be revisiting.",5,2019,01,31
124,Excellent single room,"Excellent stay and single room much bigger than expected and at very good rate. Staff very polite and helpful. 

Very Clean, great location, great food in restaurant and good facilities etc. 

Free drinks hour and free snacks in room. Great view. Cannot fault it. Lovely hotel.",5,2019,01,31
124,Disappointing,"They certainly bragged about this hotel on check-in but nothing met up to expectations. The café menu for lunch was very limited, the dinner menu in the Neptune was likewise limited and when we entered the half empty bar at 9:30pm we were asked if we had a reservation ! Pretentious or what !  On check-in we were told we had a ""lovely"" room which, to me, as a regular IHG user, means it will be lovely but was, in reality, tiny - even by London standards and for the money they charge, very expensive.  The staff were all nice, polite and friendly but, it appears, prone to exaggeration.",2,2019,01,31
124,Fantastic Stay-wonderful hotel,My husband and I visited in November 2018.  He is a IHG spire member. The hotel is beautiful. We had a suite which was well equiped and very clean.  The added extras like the tuck box were nice touches.  The staff were all wonderful and attentive.  We mentioned that we were staying for my daughters graduation ceremony and a bouquet of stunning lillies and a congratuations card were delivered to the room by the hotel on the actual day.  What a special and thoughtful touch! We hope to stay again very soon and recommend this hotel to everyone.,5,2019,01,31
124,Beautiful property ,"Stunning property and newly renovated. Great F&B outlets especially one in the main lobby with a charming courtyard setting where you can have afternoon tea with Champaign. The bar is tucked away in the corner and is a nice place to have a drink in the evening. Rooms are very well equipped and maintained and the fittings are superb. The only challenge is the standard rooms are too small and when I asked about streaming my own content from my device, I was told that only the suites have Apple TV and the standard rooms don’t. Otherwise, all in all great property with very friendly and professional staff. Location is excellent! ",4,2019,01,30
124,The best Concierge team!,"We visited as part of AICR Congress 2019- although we did not stay over in the hotel we were blown away by the kind and courteous concierge/door team. 
A warm welcome every time and nothing was too much trouble, there was one member of concierge particularly outstanding who we met a few times and lovely positive energy which was infectious. The Congress was seamless and the Kimpton left a fantastic impression on all attending.",5,2019,01,28
124,What a place!!!,"
As a frequent travellers and a longtime IHG Spire Elite member, it gives me the upmost pleasure to feedback our recent stay at the Fitzroy.

   The welcome we received from Molly at check-in felt like the start of something special, and it was.

Suite 454 was spotless and so beautifully finished, bath salt were a great touch!

  Once again the welcome from the charming young lady we received in the Fitz bar was lovely, we sat at the bar and had a young man wow us,  not only with his knowledge of the drinks but the passion of his craft... the live jazz trio were superb! A great vibe for a bar.

We moved on to Neptune’s which is a magnificent room, serving fantastic seafood!! Again the welcome was sincere. We had Dorine (I hope that’s correct) look after us, she was funny, effervescent and throughly attentive, the food could not have been better, I’d also like to mention the young man who also took great care of us, his ability to preempt our requirements was first class! Absolute perfection and utterly charming which topped off one of the best nights hospitality we have received from any top London hotel.

On checking out once again we were warmly greeted by ‘Corby’ I believe she was Spanish, another genuinely happy young lady who rounded off our wonderful experience.

May I thank you and all your staff for such a memorable stay and congratulate you on poaching us from the Intercontinental Park Lane, we can’t wait to return!! 

",5,2019,01,27
124,"Nicely refurbished hotel, good addition to IHG. ","This is a nicely refurbished hotel and a very good addition to Kimpton and indeed the IHG Family.

I booked a ‘One Double Bed Urban’ room and it was nice. It has a ‘tuck box’ with popcorn and chocolate which is a nice touch. There’s also the usual things you expect in an upmarket London Hotel; Nespresso Machine, Bathrobes, Fresh Milk, Fridge, Safe and the bathroom amenities were good especially The Perfumer’s Story toiletries. 

Overall the room was great, however, on the IHG website under the room type I booked the bathroom shows a bath in the pictures so you would expect to find a bath in the bathroom but there wasn’t just a shower - and I had requested a room with a bath but obvious had no luck with that. Some rooms face Russell Square, mine didn’t - it faced the roof of the downstairs restaurant.

I have no hesitation in recommending this hotel to Business and Leisure travellers. I hope to be back soon myself, and possibly just ring ahead to ensure I have a room with a bath. It would also have nice to see if there were upgraded available on the day and the price, as i would have been interested in that. 

Thank you. ",4,2019,01,24
124,Stunning hotel in University & British Museum district,"Gorgeous opulent and recently refurbished hotel, now Kimpton's UK flagship. The welcome by a young Scottish receptionist was outstanding. She acknowledged my Spire IHG status and upgraded me to a lovely 3rd floor room with a view of Russell Square. The lifts were good. The free beer, coke, milk and bottled water in the fridge, the coffee maker as well as the ""Tuck Box"" were appreciated. Wifi was excellent. The drinks hour (complimentary prosecco, red/white wines) was held in a rather cold room adjacent to the informal ground floor brasserie. The beautiful Fitz bar had a lovely atmosphere, the bar staff were not particularly friendly but the drinks and snacks they served were good quality. Overnight the traffic and clanking ducting related to the a/c system kept me awake, although the bed was very comfortable. The a la carte breakfast in Neptune was disappointing - I had a flat white coffee which tasted unpleasant, a bowl of tepid porridge and I asked for some fruit (as it wasn't on the menu) which was watery & tasteless. They may have been telepathic because at check-out I wasn't charged for it! The receptionists at check-out were also very charming and gave me a couple of hand-made chocolates to take home. I would stay at the Fitzroy again but ask for a quiet room and avoid the breakfast.",5,2019,01,23
124,A  Touch Of Class indeed,"This is a super place. 
As soon as you walk up the steps and into the amazing hallway you know immediately that you are into somewhere very special.The whole building, internally & externally is a masterpiece.
All of the staff we encountered were charming and wonderful and each of them made us feel very welcome. 
What a great assett to have staff like this for any business .
The drinks are a bit in the pricy side but we felt our time there was an occasion so we enjoyed.
The atmosphere was carefree and partylike and was most enjoyable.
Visit this wonderful place.You will be enchanted.",5,2019,01,23
124,What a Find,"From the minute you walk into this Hotel you are spoilt the reception staff are amazing making you feel you are the only guest checking in , we upgraded to a Park view well worth it bright airy room with an air of grandeur , the cafe bar has busy buzz and the deli food exceptional again the staff very welcoming we have stayed in many London Hotels but this is now top of the list highly recommend so much that we’ve booked the Kimpton in Chicago .",5,2019,01,22
124,Amazing 30th Birthday !!,"I Previously stayed in this hotel with my husband in 2015 before the refurbishment , it was great then but amazing now!  Right from arriving at the hotels steps you are greeted by friendly warm smiles and staff that cannot do enough for you.  On checking in we were assisted by a lovely Scottish girl I didn't catch her name but she was lovely a really credit to your hotel (when she spotted us across the foyer the next day she took time to ask if we enjoyed our night and if our room was satisfactory.).  On hearing it was my 30th birthday me and my friend were upgraded to a 1 bedroom suite which was out of this world, we were completely blown away that the hotel would make such a nice gesture , topped off by a complimentary chocolate cake in our room.  Every member a staff we encountered were friendly generally interested in how your day had been/ what plans you had  for the evening etc the concierge had a lovely chat to us whilst waiting for our friend to meet us not trying to push certain venues on us just a nice sincere chat which you rarely find.  room was spotless, bathroom was huge.  We ordered room service after a few cocktails at the bar and arrived within 20 minutes and of such a high standard.
Already looking at dates to come back with my husband and son cannot wait.... 

Thanks again for a great stay and memorable 30th birthday :-) xx",5,2019,01,22
124,"Beautiful Interior, Brilliant Location.","I opted to spend a night in London at the end of my trip to the UK. I like Bloomsbury and always stay in the area when I am in the city. This time I decided to try the Kimpton and splash out on a rather fancy room. The hotel is extremely well located opposite the Russell Square Park and Tube Station. There are so many amazing things to see nearby I didn't have to go far when exploring and was spoiled for choice of things to see (the Pollock Toy Museum is a hidden gem and a must!) and places to eat (Bloomsbury Coffee House is a favourite).
The finish in the hotel is stylish and of very high quality. The foyer, with its ornate and beautiful staircase, is wonderful, reflecting the grand history of the building and its ties to early 20th century luxury travel. I was particularly taken with the profusion of armchairs in nooks and crannies everywhere in which guests could sit and relax (or warm up by a fire). The bathrooms in public areas are very clean and designed down to the smallest detail with care and style.
The staff were very helpful, friendly and efficient. The hotel nicely mixes a young modern vibe with the grander traditions that the original hotel was known for. 
I stayed in a superior king and it was a spacious room on one of the upper floors that looked into the hotel courtyard so was quiet as I had requested. The finish in the room was of high quality (as it was in the rest of the hotel) but a bit bare (which made me question the higher price compared to other rooms) despite containing all the essentials and quite a few extras (Retro phone was fun touch). It was, however, well thought out and organized.
The bed was one of the best I have ever slept in! Having back issues, I am always anxious about sleeping on new beds but the mattress was firm with a comfortable topper and the sheets were lovely and crisp. The room also had both AC and heating which will make all the difference come summer time.
The pièce de résistance was the bathroom. Beautifully designed and furnished in what I would call ""modernized classic"", it had a large spacious bathtub that was amazing after a long, cold day out. I am now obsessed with heated mirrors which was also present. As mentioned in other posts, the bathroom floor isn't heated which would have been the final flourish. 
The Palm Court is a nice place to sit and enjoy tea. It feels inviting and comfortable. The staff there were attentive and very friendly.
Breakfast in the Neptune was lovely. Good selection with plenty of options for vegetarians. The food was excellent, tea was delicious, staff were friendly and the setting was breathtaking with full height windows that bathe the room in soft light. There are fresh plants and greenery everywhere you look, giving the room a fresh and pleasant feel.
Overall, beautifully refurbished, efficient, attentive staff, nice food options, excellent location.",4,2019,01,21
124,"Stunning refurb, can't wait to come back","The old Russell Hotel had become notorious as a place tour groups were dumped because it was cheap. Principal Hotels have done an amazing job refurbishing, and IHG have been very astute bringing the hotel under the Kimpton banner. 

We stayed here using an IHG Free Night certificate from the UK credit card. It was a nightmare to book, the hotel kept refusing, but Kimpton's social media team made it possible. 

On arrival I was greeted as a Spire Elite member and offered an upgrade. The upgraded room wasn't quite ready, so we were offered a drink for the 10 minute wait.

The room was stunning, a 1-bed suite. The cosy little living room was decorated with lovely Christmas lights. The bathroom was huge with roll-top bath, large shower and twin basins, and the bedroom was both spacious and cosy. 

The bed was incredibly comfortable, as were the pillows. The room was on the front of the hotel but the only traffic noise was from the odd emergency siren. The Kimpton free minibar/snack box was very welcome. We visited for my birthday and had a lovely dessert left with birthday greeting. 

We attended the nightly wine reception and had a lovely chat with the Food/Bev manager - it was great to hear someone so passionate about his work and place of work. 

Drinks in Fitz's bar were excellent - the acoustics were surprisingly amazing compared to the modern trend for industrial style, to the extent we commented to each other, and we had a lovely evening. 

We skipped breakfast.

The only feedback point I can make is that the toiletries didn't seem to be the best quality, for Kimpton I'd expect quality and kind-to-skin brands, which the provided ones weren't.

We can't wait to come back!",5,2019,01,20
124,Excellent business or leisure hotel with excellent rooms and very nice restaurant and bar,"My wife and I stayed at this hotel when I had a conference in London. It's clear the refurbishment has gone well and it's located directly on Russel Square in a fairly quiet location. The hotel itself is really nice on the inside, and the rooms themselves are very well appointed. We have stayed in many ""5 star"" business hotels in London and rarely are they as classically appointed as this one.
We thoroughly enjoyed the excellent breakfast buffet. Simple with not too many choices but everything was very high quality. I prefer to have a few of each rather than dozens of mediocre choices and the breakfast there was superb.
Lastly, the bar in the hotel has a great feel to it, as I've seen in Kimpton Group hotels in San Francisco. Very nice cocktail selection, and friendly service.
All in all, a great break for us and a very elegant but modern feel to it. Some have said the rooms are a bit small but ours was fine, the shower for example was very roomy and had classic plumbing, very pretty; if you're staying in London and spending too much time in your room you might be doing something wrong.
Highly recommended.",5,2019,01,20
124,Fantastic refurb,"Reopened 9 months ago after an extensive refurb.  Absolutely stunning   Rooms very nice ( needed a little more furniture and no underfloor heating In the bathroom) common area are amazing palm court , bar etc. Very good value for a world class hotel so highly recommended ",5,2019,01,19
124,Perfect !,"Great hotel ! My preferred work accommodation. The most comfortable, spacious and clean room & beds while working away. Menu is interesting and delicious food. Staff friendly and attentive. Location is wonderful for shopping after work.",5,2019,01,19
124,Better than before but still glitchy,"I stayed in this hotel a few years ago when it was still Hotel Russell. It was a shambolic mess then and I gave it a very bad review. The update that the Kimpton group brings us well done. Check in was flawless - I had asked for and was assigned a single room with a bath. The reception person was friendly and very capable. The hotel public spaces were nice and the cafe attached to the hotel was ok. As far as the rooms go, done are no doubt grand and wonderful with views over Russell Square. But I was in a dormer that felt a lot like the small single rooms in the Hotel Russell. The bed was very comfortable, the bathtub was great but there was so little space that when not bathing or sleeping, one must either stay vertical or squeeze into a little chair. 

Here would be my suggestion for this 19th Century architectural wonder - fewer rooms, more space. With so many rooms at their disposal, why not take down a few walls and make more regular size rooms to supplement their grand suites. No amount of interior design can make up for the suffocation of a tiny box like room. 

That said, I would have felt ok about the small room as I was only there for one night, had it not cost close to $250!!!

My punchline - more for less. Give us a bit more space at a slightly lower price. Then I will give it 5 stars. The location is great, the ambience is fine. The architecture is amazing. 

Oh, and breakfast was definitely NOT worthwhile. Step out into the London morning and find yourself some great coffee and a feast. ",4,2019,01,16
124,Great attention to detail,"From check-in to check-out the hotel staff looked after us very well - the room was fabulous but on the small side however this is normal for London - bathroom and products were amazing. Overall the hotel is stunning, you won't be disappointed!",5,2019,01,15
124,Fantastic London Hotel,"Stayed here over the new year for a couple of days, was welcomed by friendly concierge l and helped with luggage. 

We arrived early due to our flight and was checked in very quickly and efficiently. Our room was not ready which was fine, they stored our luggage and we started to explore London. 

The location is perfect located on Russell Square, 15 minute walk to Oxford Street and 2 minutes walk to Russel Square tube station. 

The hotel called us to say our room was ready which was fantastic. 

We arrived back to our luggage securely placed in our room and a lovely new year card and gift. 

The hotel has a lovely relaxed professional atmosphere, so warm and welcoming. 

The restaurant and bar facilities are excellent ranging from the palm court lounge area for drinks and light lunch/ dinner. The burrs bar and restaurant for club food. The Neptune’s restaurant for seafood and finally the Fitzs cocktail bar for some retro decor and a range of varied spirits and cocktails. 

The accommodation is immaculate and luxury accommodating all needs. 

All the staff are very friendly and helpful helping you with directions and knowledge of the hotel and area. 

A special thanks to “ Anna” who excelled in customer service and was always there to help. A special member of the team. 

Actually all staff from the doorman, concierge, reception, cocktail bar, palm court and housekeeping were all fantastic. 

We even met the hotel manager walking about and welcoming guests which lovely to see. 

Kimpton Fitzroy London - you have added two more regular guests to your fan club and we are going to tell everyone about you all. 

Again thank you for a special stay. 

Regards Euan & David

124,Luxury in London,"We stayed in the Kimpton for a quick stop off in London. We arrived greeted by the amazing Portuguese doorman. We checked in and felt right at home, the reception guys were great, relaxed and courteous. We booked a suite and it was exceptional views of the city and a bath with the same view to boot. The Suite was perfectly laid out, inclusive in the rate was a free minibar which included beers and snacks. Breakfast the next morning was in Neptune it was played but the quality was so exceptional and service was fast. This hotel is pure luxury and this hotel team is one of the most customer centric hotels I have ever stayed in. HIGHLY RECOMMEND,",5,2019,01,13
124,A truly grand hotel experience,"Visually, this hotel is spectacular. The recent refurbishment has made it into a very classy place with several dining/bar choices. I believe the architect is the same chap who designed the first-class areas on the Titanic, and the Neptune restaurant is apparently very similar to the Titanic's restaurant. On that note, do visit ""Lucky George"" a small bronze dragon sitting on the second-floor banister of the staircase. An identical one went down with the Titanic - hence this one's name.

Our bed was comfortable and the room was blissfully quiet. The complimentary tuck box (with 2 bags of popcorn and a small block of chocolate) was very welcome. My only disappointment was the a la carte breakfast, which meant the choices were very limited compared with a buffet, and a bowl of porridge attracted an extra charge.",4,2019,01,12
124,"Exceeded all expectations, hotel, room and service all exceptional.","Completely fantastic stay. Staff were, without exception, friendly, welcoming, attentive and helpful. The building itself is spectacular both inside and out and worth the visit in its own right there are so many different rooms to explore. The room was spectacular and had everything you could imagine either there already or available with a quick call to reception. Great view over the square and British Museum, really comfortable bed and a wonderful bathroom. Social hour is a really nice touch too.",5,2019,01,11

124,Exceptional,"I visited this hotel when it reopened as the Principal last year. It was a great stay back then but some works and tweaking were still being done. On this stay everything was perfection. The room was stunning and extremely high quality. The little perks, such as welcome hour with complimentary drinks and the tuck box in the room were nice little touches. 
The staff were very friendly and welcoming. The hotel now deserves its 5 star rating. ",5,2019,01,08

124,AMAZING HOTEL – EXEMPLARY SERVICE!!!,"We could not have asked for a better stay during our recent eight-day New Year’s / 15th Wedding Anniversary trip to the Kimpton Fitzroy London.   Let us just say that this hotel is amazing!!!  The location of the hotel is perfect, it has awesome food and beverage options, the entire hotel was recently renovated top-to-bottom, our suite was extremely clean and very spacious, but what really sets the Kimpton Fitzroy London apart is the exemplary service at every level – and we mean every level.   

We can honestly say that we found each and every staff member at the Kimpton Fitzroy London to be extremely friendly, attentive, and helpful.  Whether it was Umberto in the Palm Court helping us try some new champagne options, Diana warmly welcoming us upon our arrival with some delectable pastries for our anniversary, or Sean in concierge helping us with some jet-lag remedies - the wonderful team at the Kimpton Fitzroy London truly exceeded all of our expectations.  We feel bad because there were so many staff members that helped us each and every day, but unfortunately, we can’t remember all of their names.   

We cannot wait to return to the Kimpton Fitzroy London and would highly recommend this hotel and the spectacular service to anyone looking for a truly exceptional stay in London.",5,2019,01,07
124,Recommended,"Kimpton Fitzroy opened mid-2018, after a refurbishment and renaming. Hotel remains with classical charm. It is well located and within walking distance of e.g Oxford street and almost neighbor to British museum.

Double Rooms are quite small but has the amenities you will expect and staff and service is impeccable. Check in and -out is relatively smooth.

Check also out the park opposite the hotel and remember to bring a few (unsalted) nuts for the ever-fun-to-watch squirrels.

Enjoy and do not forget to check out Bea cafe next door.

124,Great location and friendly staff,"It’s our first time staying at London. Even thought the room is not the same as what the picture shown. (I was thinking more day light but we don’t get any nice view. However, it’s still a very valueable deal with breakfast included. 

I hv booked the 2nd tier room

👍🏻Nearby the underground which is just around the corner!  
👍🏻very helpful and friendly staff, I was feeling unwell and need to go to hospital in early morning, staff there was professional
👍🏻hardware of the hotel is very new: very advanced lift system, super modern toilet 
👍🏻everywhere is photogenic (the one who taking care social media is very responsive)
👍🏻The 2nd day housekeeping was gorgeous, but 1st day is just ok 

😑Couldn’t face the mirror when I am blow drying the hair as there is no plug in the toilet 
😑No more buffet breakfast from now on, only a la carte is available, it will be a bit boring to hv 4 days breakfast 
😑very low ceiling

124,Good choice given the peculiar London hotel scene,"This review is based on a two night stay in a Superior Double room (one room category above the standard Urban Double room).

The hotel is conveniently located at Russell Square in walking distance to a tube station, a number of restaurants and stores, and the British Museum.

The building is imposing and grand, and the lobby is cavernous and reminiscent of a fairly lavish cathedral. The rather dark and traditional style is balanced nicely with contemporary furniture and lighting, resulting in a comfortable and cosy space. The rooms are traditionally British (think thick carpets, heavy curtains, flowery pillows or faux victorian bathroom fittings) with a few quirky touches such as the red telephone.

Service at the reception and the F&B outlets was prompt, friendly and professional. While none of the staff stood out negatively, there was neither anyone surprising me positively. Requests for extra towels and Champagne flutes were met promptly. On New Year's eve, staff placed a card along with two high energy fruit juices in the room which was a nice touch.
 
It is to note that the layouts and sizes vary greatly even within the same room category. The room and especially the bathroom we got was smaller than I expected, but nevertheless comfortable enough for a short stay. It is difficult to say whether we got downgraded or not.
Pros: High floor with nice view over Russell Square; quality large size toiletries; good water pressure and shower head; comfortable bed and bedding; complimentary snacks.
Cons: Unreliable and slow internet; low ceiling height (it seems the lower floors have higher ceilings though); fairly dusty due to carpet and heavy curtains; odd smelling and slightly discolored towels.

The variety and quality of F&B outlets meant that we spent quite a bit of time at the hotel. Fitz bar was buzzing with activity and we enjoyed well crafted drinks. A light breakfast at Burr & Co café was of good quality and felt like the well-run independent café it is. A dinner and à la carte breakfast at Neptune were enjoyable. Service was efficient and the food quality was good. 

Considering the London hotel scene and price point, this hotel is a great option for any traveler. If I could, I'd give it 3.5 tripadvisor ""stars"".",3,2019,01,04
124,Good stay,"Nice hotel with food and beverage facilities fitting the Kimpton brand. Unfortunately the rooms are small which many people have already referenced. The bathroom, however is good and has a full size bath with shower over. Slightly disappointed with the attitude of the receptionist when requesting a late check-out (2 hours) for the Sunday I was leaving. Do not expect to be told that as a Spire Elite member I am expected to call the front desk at the normal check out time on the day to chance it. A simple yes or no would have sufficed.",4,2019,01,04
124,"Fabulous, luxurious, a real treat","We stayed for two nights in November. I'd stayed here probably in the 1980's several times and it was a very grand place but after it's refurbishment it is stunning. It's the most 'plush' place I've stayed in in London.

It's right on Russel Square, the reception area is beautiful and the staircase is a really grand feature. If you take the lift up be sure to walk down the stairs - they are beautiful. 

The room was beautifully furnished too. All high quality linen, bathroom fittings etc etc. 

The breakfast we chose was waiter service in the Neptune restaurant. Again the dining room had been refurbished and looked spectacular. The service was extremely professional and the food was excellent; the only negative comment was that the coffee was not nice (we are serious coffee drinkers). 

It is expensive, we paid more than our usual budget for a London hotel stay, but it was stunning.",5,2019,01,04
124,Awesome ,This hotel is exceptional and it’s stunning in appearance. The team are super friendly and professional. I would highly recommend this hotel to any guest. The room is stunning and the views pretty good to. They do an evening social hour where you get a nice drink and socialise with other guests it’s a great idea. I’m now really looking forward to breakfast 😀,5,2019,01,03
124,Outstanding hotel ,"We booked the junior suite for my partner’s birthday and we were not disappointed. The hotel is immense. The decor, the service, the BEDS... all fantastic. I loved the staff who were all so happy and helpful. We really enjoyed our stay and although we had one slight issue, it was resolved by good old fashioned hospitality, a complimentary drink 😊 you can’t say fairer than that. 

Breakfast was good, we dined at the a la carte restaurant and service was good. Our room was looked after well, fridge restocked and turn down service provided. The bathroom in the suite is adorable and I couldn’t get out of that shower! 

We wish we had more time here, it’s definitely the best hotel we have ever stayed in when in London and will be difficult to ever choose anywhere else! 

Thanks again for such a pleasant stay. ",5,2019,01,03
124,Out of this world,"Booked a one night stay for my birthday in the Kimpton Fitzroy.  The hotel itself is stunning, especially the public areas.

We were greeted by Andrea on reception and were blown away by her wonderful service.  She kindly upgraded us to a fabulous room, and I mean fabulous.  There was even a personalised postcard in the room from Andrea wishing me a happy birthday.

We dined in the main restaurant for breakfast the next day and the food was just as wonderful as the hotel.

Overall a memorable stay and we will be back.

124,Above and beyond,"Hi what a place to stay this is. It’s luxurious, it’s 15 minutes walk from Covent Garden and it’s a minute away from the tube.
We went on New Years Eve and we’ve probably had the best hotel stay we have ever had or likely to. We stayed in a corner suite which quite simply had us overwhelmed at the tasteful decor, room sizes, attention to detail and cleanliness. It was superb!!
If you think this is a good start to the review it gets better. THE STAFF ARE AMAZING!! From reception to concierge to bar staff, restaurant staff and room maids “nothing is too much trouble” just ask and it’s done. I can not fault this hotel in anyway and we look forward to our return.",5,2019,01,01
124,Great stay,"Stayed for just 1 night, for a weekend theatre and shopping trip, should have booked for longer. What a fantastic Hotel, staff very helpful and friendly. Great room although small, (urban) it’s was very cosy, clean and comfy. Managed to have a few cocktails in the Fitz which were so good. The hotel
Is perfectly situated on Russell Square, close to Euston and the tube. Would highly recommend and would definitely return.",5,2018,12,28
124,"One of the very, very best...","While spending millions of pounds on a hotel renovation to a result that will almost take your breath away - the best thing for me was still the genuine, attentive service that is in abundance all over from all staff.
I have spend 25 years+ in hotels 2-3 times pr week in average and I can honestly say that I have never met so genuinely happy staff.
I could start off with the receptionist Covi who went beyond any imagination for ensuring we had a special stay... The executive guest relations officer Juliana who warmly greeted us and treated us like royalty... The lady in the breakfast bar who was happy, cheery and just a gem. 
I often find that the higher the stars, the bigger the place, the service becomes somewhat mechanic - or too schooled. Well not here.
We had food and drinks at several occasions and while the food was very good you almost get lost in the surroundings. 
It is a must in London.
it is for sure my kind of place and I will be a returning customer.",5,2018,12,27
124,Absolutely Amazing!,"Had the pleasure of staying at this truly excellent hotel, every member of staff we encountered was excellent from check in to the bell boys! The level of service is impeccable and the hotel and the staff truly go out of their way to make your stay as memorable as possible. 
We were given the most amazing room, a junior suite which was out of this world so much so that we just didn’t want to leave! The standard of the accommodation was first class and my partner who travels extensively with work remarked that it was the nicest room that he had ever stayed in! The cleanliness of the room was excellent, the furniture and fittings in the room super luxurious. The extra touches like the complimentary tuck box made the stay extra memorable. 
We ate breakfast in Palm Court the staff were excellent and we were lucky enough to meet with the restaurant manager he was so informative and gave us the history of the hotel and treated us to a glass of champagne for our special occasion. 
All in all would stay here again in a heart beat! And would recommend to all who want an amazing hotel in a great location. 
Thank you Kinpton Fitzroy for an unforgettable stay 
We will be back!",5,2018,12,24
124,My new go to hotel in London,"I usually stay at the Conrad in London, however, I wanted a hotel that was located a bit more central. I came across the Kimpton in tripadvisor reviews and have to say that this will be my new go to hotel. The location is perfect on Russell Square and a one minute walk to the tube station. The hotel's renovation is stunning with no attention to detail missing. Beautiful lobby, bar and Neptune restaurant. The rooms are also very well appointed with everything you would expect from a new hotel. 

It has been a while since I wrote a hotel review, but feel compelled after this stay.",4,2018,12,21
124,Kimpton is a welcome addition to London!,I love the Kimpton brand and am excited that they’re expanding to the UK. Room was large and one of the most gorgeous bathrooms I’ve seen at a hotel. Recent renovated and the onsite dining options and bars are also favorited by locals. It’s a little pricey but the location can’t be beat and right next to Russel Square Tube stop. ,5,2018,12,20
124,A trip down memory lane,"We chose the hotel as a venue for our Christmas lunch because we used to work in the hotel round the corner about 35 years ago. (We are sure we lent you linen that you may still have!) It is a lovely hotel and you have done great things to it - it is really wonderful to see it restored to its original glory - and even better than that. 
Lovely lunch in Neptune and then a relaxing chat in the Palm Court - really friendly and caring experience and beautifully served. Monika in the Palm Court was really good and also our waiter in Neptune deserves a mention, but I am sorry not to have taken his name. The lunch menu is amazing value and a great choice of dishes too.",5,2018,12,19
124,Outstanding Charming Hotel,"This hotel has everything going for it. At first glance an outstanding exterior full of character. It exudes Victorian England on the outside. And then you get inside and you get a modern stylish interior with a great wow factor of the banister when you enter. A really impressive interior to match the great exterior. The rooms themselves are very comfortable, quite roomy and provide a very comfortable and peaceful sleep. The beds themselves are very comfortable providing a great respite from a busy day in London. And then the final great feature of the hotel is the location. It is right next to Russel Square London Underground station. With this you can easily go to all parts of the city. The breakfast available at the hotel is tasty and varied and the room service quality is pretty high. All in all this hotel hits all the right notes for one’s stay in London.",5,2018,12,18
124,Fantastic,"I stayed here for three nights in a Deluxe Park View room for about $300 a night. I would judge the Fitzroy about 90% as good as other five star hotels in London (HamYard, Four Seasons) for less than half the price. The refurbishment of this historic building is amazing, the rooms are smallish (this is London after all), the decor is stylish in a typically Kimpton sort of way, everything was spotlessly clean, and the staff were all pleasant and helpful. I could not have been happier. It is a short walk to Euston and Kings Cross and easy to access from LHR via the Piccadilly line. The Kimpton Fitzroy will be at the top of my list on return trips to London.",5,2018,12,18
124,Excellent!,"Fantastic hotel, stunning building inside and out, the room was immaculate, as were all the staff we encountered! Would recommend without hesitation, not the cheapest, but set in the heart of London, why should it be!,",5,2018,12,17
124,Wonderful Afternoon Tea in the Palm Court,"I took my mum to celebrate her 75th Birthday at the Palm Court with a wonderful Afternoon Tea. We were looked after from start to finish by Umberto the Palm Court Manager who was very welcoming and definately made my mum feel special all afternoon. The recent renovations have made the ambience in the Palm Court feel luxurious and spacious, sleek and relaxed. We had a palate cleanser followed by sandwiches and a game pie, scones and cream followed by beautiful handcrafted cakes. Some champagne and a lovely cocktail completed our offering. We had a sneaky look in the bar and the coffee shop and I shall definately be visiting again soon. All of the staff were very attentive during our visit. Thank you again Umberto for making it such an memorable experience!",5,2018,12,17
124,Absolutely Perfect Anniversary and Hotel!,"I don't know where to start...perhaps thanking the person/staff member who upgraded us to a beautiful corner suite for our anniversary celebration...thank you! 
And thank you to the wonderful receptionist (Irma) who took such good care of us on check in and check out. 
We were upgraded to room 652...an absolute must in this hotel. Literally, from the tuckshop to the mini fridge, coffee machine, tea etc...all was perfect. The bed was super comfortable (and a four poster). The bathroom...probably the best shower (besides Babington House in Somerset) I have ever had...the toilet has a door inside the enormous bathroom(thanks for the privacy)...with a freestanding gorgeous bath as well. The view from the 6th floor was incredible.
. I have been to The Principal in Manchester and The Kimpton De Witt in Amsterdam so my expectations were high...but wow they met them and more! Literally cannot fault this hotel.
Totally ignore all negative reviews and book!
Housekeeping was incredible, The Palm Court restaurant...WOW. We literally did not move all afternoon, drinking coffee and wine in the Palm Court, who would want to be anywhere else? Then we discovered the Bar...and just had a truly lovely evening, the bar staff (the Sunday crew) were fantastic and the service was impeccable! I recommend the Pecorino white wine and the Cosmopolitan cocktail (bar opens at 4pm)...we never made it to The Neptune restaurant (designed to look like The Titanic's dining room) but met the manager and he was super friendly at the 'free wine and prosecco (to meet the guests and staff) hour' between 5-6pm every eve.
We felt like we had gone back in time (Art Deco is my favourite architectural period) in this monumental fabulous Deco building. 
Have just got home and am grieving...
Thank you to all the staff x 
We were so well looked after and will, without a doubt, be back",5,2018,12,17
124,"Very nice hotel, but...","Beautiful - indeed, even impressing - establishment after its recent renovation with the bulk of attention paid on style, it would seem. Staff very courteous and helpful. The single rooms are unacceptably small for a hotel of this class though. Acrobatics had to be performed even to enter the room, let alone any space for opening a suitcase. Also much less recognition than expected for IHG membership.",3,2018,12,17
124,Beautiful hotel but not a great experience,"Arrived at 4:45 pm when check in was at 3 and my room was not ready, furthermore I was told I could not have the room I had previously requested due to it being fully booked, although I had booked this room over a month in advance.
I was not told anything about the hotel, where to go, what different bars or restaurants there were, where we could have breakfast, check out time - any basic information was not communicated at check in.
The room was nice although there were mug rings on the table from previous guests - not something you would expect in a 5* hotel. The check-out on the smart TV did not work and so I then had to queue for 15 minutes while one member of staff helped a long line of people looking to check out. Had no idea if we could have breakfast or where to go for it, so did not bother.
It was a shame as the service I received did not seem to match other peoples 5* experiences. It seemed like a wonderful, beautiful hotel and I would return if I could guarantee a better experience.",4,2018,12,17
124,Excellent location,"A beautiful hotel. Very small room with great architecture. Avoid second floor as way too noisy when faced inside. Constant vibration of the air system and smell of the restaurants. Wonderful staff and extremely helpful concierge, 
",5,2018,12,15
124,Would give 6 star if possible ,"Checked in for 2 nights for my wife's birthday, booked deluxe double room but upgraded to one bed suite overlooking the park. Incredible room, staff young and incredibly helpful, and Fitzs Bar a cool place to have a couple of drinks ",5,2018,12,14
124,Got the wow factor!! Modern twist on a luxury hotel from a bygone era...,"Loved this hotel. Have stayed in a number of hotels in London of the years but this is by far my new favourite.  From the moment you walk up the steps from Russel Square there is a feeling of luxury, almost like stepping back in time to the Great Gatzby 1920's era. The social hour in the bar was a great idea and good to meet some of your fellow guests. Room was a reasonable size, very comfortable with a huge walk in shower. Hotel was very quiet, staff were very friendly and exceptionally helpful throughout my stay. Tube station is about 100m away round the corner, Looking forward to staying here again very soon.",5,2018,12,13
124,1st class restaurant service,"I took my new wife to this restaurant for breakfast during our honeymoon. It was a fabulous culinary experience! . Everything was perfect, from the decor and setting to the food but especially the service from our NZ waiter (Azzan?) who could not have been more charming or helpful. We would go back again just for his service. 
Highly recommend",5,2018,12,12
124,A beautiful hotel but need to work on the house keeping service,Stayed here for 12 nights on my first stay in London. Front desk service was great but the same can't be said for the house keeping. There were instances when they forgot to replenish the toiletries items on a few occasions and rude behaviour on our last night when they knock fiercely on our door to do house keeping. Hot water was cut off on one morning too. Room service food was also not up to expectation. ,3,2018,12,12
124,"5 Star Decor, 3 Star Service/Customer Experience. Inconsistencies Spotted Everywhere.","We stayed here for 7 days 6 nights at the superior room with breakfast. We may not want to return next time when we come back to London. We feel like the hotel is still under soft opening and not ready to deliver top notch customer experience.

Strengths
-Wonderful location at the heart of London
-Great breakfast (food quality, not the service)
-Very new and nice interior design
-Staff at the main door were helpful and friendly and greeted customers cheerfully.
-Free wifi , strong signal

Weaknesses
-the staff at the front desk who helped with our check in was not professional enough - took our credit card twice to do the deposit transaction. And she did not proactively brief us on the breakfast arrangement - i had to call on the next day morning to sort out.

-Inconsistent housekeeping standard: 
every time when we returned to our room, we always wonder what will be missing in the room. There is a tuck box with complimentary popcorns and chocolate and the 2 bottled water and the milk in the fridge are also free. They were filled up randomly during our stay - very often the chocolate was not replenished, sometimes bottled water are not refilled, tea bags are not replenished. I am not sure how many sample checks were done on the rooms tidied up on a daily basis, it seems to me except on day 1, all other days we have something missing in the room.
The little square towels on the sink were not provided for 2 days. The vanity kits (cotton buds and cotton pads) were not provided for 2 days.
We called for toothbrush and toothpaste once we checked in, we were given only 1 set.So the staff had to return and get us one more set.
The staff put the toothpastes and my teeth aligners IN the glass in the toilet so that he/she could put the vanity kit at their ""standard"" position. Honestly I do not expect those will be put in the glass for mouth washing.

Breakfast - we were free to choose Neptune (order from the menu) or Burr & Co (casual, buffet style).
Neptune has great decor. On day 1 it was a weekday, everything was nice, food portion was big. We returned on the next day - the same set of Butcher's breakfast came with fewer tomatoes, bacons and the beans were missing - we had to ask for the beans. On the 2nd last morning before we left, it was a Sunday morning and it took us more than 40 minutes to have a table (we first arrived at 10:15am) and more than 45 mins to have our food so we had our breakfast almost at noon. The staff in the suit offered us champagne and later a complimentary afternoon tea but we turned it all down - we did not want something extra, we just need our breakfast served at the right time!
The restaurant is clearly understaffed especially on a Sunday morning - the hotel should put extra resources in recruiting enough pair of hands! The experience on Sunday morning was worse than those at a 3 star Inn!

Burr & Co breakfast - we were showed our table and we returned with plates of food from the buffet table, another couple claimed our table was theirs. The staff mistakenly offered our table to another couple who came in later than us.
We understand it was a busy Saturday morning but if the hotel did not have enough staffing pls do not take so many external customers! Also, why didn't the hotel set up a form of system or procedures to identify tables that have been taken? Such as a card? or make sure coffee or tea will be served first? Any 3 star hotel in Japan handled this better than this so called luxury hotel in London! 

If you don't expect good service, you can consider this hotel given its location and the decor. Don't expect any true 4/5 star experience!",3,2018,12,11
124,Lovely coffee stop,We stopped off here when looking for a quiet coffee stop. We enjoyed our drinks In the lobby area and could admire the beautiful hotel environment. Staff were very friendly too. Really good hot chocolate. ,4,2018,12,10
124,Superb luxury hotel,"When your looking where to stay in London there’s a vast selection of hotels and prices, luckily I came across this hotel and loved the look of the architecture and decided to book, well it was superb, moder, super efficient, well trained courteous staff in the most beautiful building. Quite honestly I will be staying there every time I visit London. Fabulous.",5,2018,12,10
124,Great service in heart of Russell Square,"I was travelling to London for the weekend and just needed a place that's in the center near one of the Picadilly line tube stops and this hotel fit the bill. From checking in with Colby (sp?) and Alex at the front desk, both were smiling and cheery at 7:30am it was a great start to my stay. I stayed on the 7th floor and felt it was quiet and never had any noise issues. I requested a bucket of ice and within 10 minutes it arrived. Great water pressure in the shower. Wifi was quite fast for my smartphone.
In the room, bottled water was complimentary along with some snacks. For additional snacks, there is a TESCO express (open 24 hours) just across from the tube stop. Oh and the Russell Square tube stop is only a 1-3 min walk from the hotel. Would definitely stay here again.",5,2018,12,10
124,Other much better choices in London,"We stayed here for a second time.  The rooms are uncomfortable small.  You need to put your suitcases on top of wardrobe as it is so tiny.  Bed also terribly small and shower a metre from your bed.  Can’t move... and feels very mouldy. 

Both times room ready after 4pm and lots of people waiting for rooms in lobby with no welcome drinks.  

Shower leaking and water over the whole floor and nothing done despite several complaints to fix it...  this must be the mouldy smell. 

Breakfast area- we had breakfast 3 days in our total 8 days stay.  Everyday we had hair in our food.  The restaurant is tiny and staff dirty!  Wearing their hair lose and playing with their hair over the food.  Uniforms looks like a dirty butcher jacket.  You feel sick after breakfast.  Gave Isabelle the feedback twice but she obviously ignored us and thought the way to deal with it is to give us complimentary breakfast....  

It is very expensive hotel and there are several better hotels that are located close by. 

Very disappointed as we stay in kimpton in Holland often, however this is more like an airport Hilton.  

Don’t do it if you are looking for luxury and cleanliness. And if you are staying take a small suitcase as you will have no space to move with anything else. ",1,2018,12,09
124,Lovely building but appalling service.,"Came for a black tie event being held in the hotel and had booked a room for the night. The interior of the hotel is very impressive. Rooms are nice but very small. Sadly the worst part was the service. We never got to see a menu and sadly both my starter and my main course were mushrooms, surprised to have the same thing twice and it didn’t even taste nice. The waitress also split my partners gravy down my back and didn’t tell me, only noticed when he put his arm around me so we both spent the night (in black tie!) covered in gravy. I ordered a Diet Coke, took a sip to discover it was a double jack Daniels and they’d got the drinks orders mixed up. Partner orders 4 drinks and was charged £52 but the receipt he asked for showed 4 drinks at £9 each. The service was like this all night and into the next morning, such a shame. I expect much better service for these prices and for such a prestigious hotel.",2,2018,12,09
124,Stunning!,Loved it ! The room was large with Frette sheets and a relatively small bathroom but with lovely bath robes and slippers! Very clean due to the recent renovations! Beautiful 3 bars and restaurants! Very hip ! Burberry had an event here while we stayed! Only thing is that it’s always a taxi ride away from everything ! But we will come back here !,4,2018,12,08
124,Amazing upgrade to corner suite.....,"Wow! The third floor corner suite was absolute luxury: a sitting area with free bar and sofas leading through double doors into the vast bedroom with a four poster bed, raised roll-top bath in corner window and separate bathroom. The bed was so comfortable and the amenities were perfect, including a little red tea cosy for the tea pot. Breakfast was big and delicious and service was far swifter than our drinks the evening we arrived. Russell Square is no more than 20 minutes walk to Covent Garden so a great place to stay. Highly recommend it, especially if you book the corner suite. ",5,2018,12,08
124,Stunning hotel with superb service and extremely friendly staff,"As soon as I arrived I was welcomed beautifully by the doorman, then by the extremely friendly gentleman who checked me in, my room was not ready as I was super early however I just wanted to drop off my bag, I was checked in quickly and told my bag would be in my room when I returned, I then nipped over to see the concierge to check the directions to my meeting he again was very friendly and told me a quicker way to get to where I was going, a 30 second walk to Russell Square tube station and I was on my way from getting off my train at Euston to walking to the hotel to dropping off my bag on the tube all within 20 minutes!  When I returned around 21:30 rather tired again I was greeted by a friendly doorman, my key was ready as soon as I arrived at reception and I was welcomed back I was fortunate to have been upgraded to a stunning suite after a beautiful hot shower I fell into bed and raided my complimentary snack box (which are available in every room type) - at check out once again I was fondly greeted and check out was quick and efficient - I cannot wait to return to what will now be my go to hotel in London",5,2018,12,07
124,Birthday celebrations,"Have stayed many times in the past but what a transformation. Truly been brought upto standard. Was a little disappointed to see an automatic door instead of the round spinning one and the old main chandelier had gone....but then when you get to reception there are new chandeliers to gaze at. We knew we were to early for the room but leaving luggage wasn't an issue. 
Fast forward to the room, very nice, accommodated 4 ladies adequately. Only niggle was only 2 robes & 2 sets of towels; we did pinch 2 more sets off the maids trolley as time was tight due to theatre commitments and they'd taken ages to answer the phone regarding bottled water( also queried as to why I wanted 4 bottles? 4 ladies) During "" getting ready stage"" x4 excited ladies a complimentary bottle of champagne arrived to celebrate my special birthday, very nice touch and set the tone for the weekend.
Arrived back to find a turn down service had been provided, all excess cushions lined up on the floor like a little fence. The last little niggle was when in bed there was no where to put my glasses,clock,earrings by the bed as I was near the door side so no bedside table. Maybe some sort of shelf could be squeezed in?
Breakfast was a bit of a free for all at first, saying it wasn't included ( we knew it was), made to queue up but we got there in the end. Staff do need to be more aware of the floor but its early days.The word of the day was "" champagne-nated"" ...bubbles 
 for breakfast great way to start the day. Check out went fairly smoothly with our luggage being ready and the lively lovely Walter seeing to the taxi.(Think he needs a different hat though ,as we thought he was a guest at first) Overall we all agreed we'd like to return in the future.",4,2018,12,02
124,Lovely!,"Definitely staying at this beautiful hotel the next time I’m in London. It’s location is ideal, less than a 30 minute walk to pretty much everything in central London. Plus, it is literally next door to the tube station, which you can take directly to Heathrow for $5USD. Beautiful historic building, but outfitted with latest amenities. Courteous staff as well. Highly recommended!",5,2018,12,01
124,Stunning hotel brilliant staff,"Stayed for a joint birthday with my sister and our partners. The hotel is stunning in every way. Just 10 minutes walk from Euston and with the tube just around the corner the location was perfect. 

We were both given upgraded rooms on check in which was a nice touch for our birthdays. The rooms were truly gorgeous. 

We are at the buffet for breakfast which was fantastic although the tables are very close together. 

The bar is really something special in the evening although we struggled getting in it until later on after we had eaten. 

Will 100% be using this hotel as my go to place for future visits to London on either business or leisure. ",5,2018,11,27
124,Wow Wow Wow,"I don’t even know where to begin with this review! I’ve only been in my hotel room for 1 hour and already feel the need to jump online and write about it! 
Stunning hotel which has recently been refurbished. I was greeted by the very friendly hotel front of house who then informed me I had been upgraded!! 
When I got to my room I was not disappointed. I had a separate bathroom, living area and bedroom.  
My room came with a spacious shower room and all the appliances you could need from slippers and robes to hair dryers, iron, coffee and tea facilities. 
The hotel offers a stunning bar area, ballroom, coffee area and more! 
The reason I chose this hotel is because it is close to my offices and I needed somewhere to stay before a big work event tomorrow, I had recently had a show around the hotel and its facilities so I wanted to try it out. I am so pleased I book here and will always come back to this hotel for future bookings. 
Fantastic hotel for business, pleasure, functions and weddings!

124,"A beautiful hotel; however, a slighty disappointing stay.","I stayed at this hotel for an overnight last weekend. The hotel is truly stunning: from the picturesque architecture to the even more picturesque interior. The hotel is beautifully furnished with three elegant eateries and a bar- I managed to visit all four and was very impressed! Unfortunately, my stay was hindered due to poor service. After checking in at 11.30am following a long journey to London, I was informed that my room wasn't ready. I understand that this can happen from time to time; however, I had to wait 5 hours before my room was ready. Due to this, my plans for the day were affected. Whilst waiting I ate in the Palm Court- although beautiful and with friendly staff- I wasn't offered a discount or any form of compensation. Upon returning to the hotel in the evening, I complained about my wait. Whilst the staff were understanding and sympathetic, the only form of compensation I was offered was a free drink in the Neptune- the seafood restaurant. I didn't think this was an appropriate form of compensation considering the fact that my day had been affected and I had £200 to stay. In the evening, I ate at Neptune and had a few drinks at Fitz's. I would like to thank Morton and the bar staff for being very hospitable throughout the evening. The bar staff are extremely well qualified and knowledgeable about mixology and were able to make me cocktails that I requested and which didn't feature on the menu. Overall, my experience with staff was mixed: some stuff were friendly; others rude and abrupt. This hotel is a luxurious and elegant place to stay which is also central to London's main amenities and Euston station. I would stay here again; however, I did experience a few issues- which if addressed- would make this hotel truly first class.",3,2018,11,26
124,Wish I could have stayed longer,"The Kimpton Fitzroy is such a beautiful hotel . Unfortunately we were only there for a one night stay, but would love to come back soon. 
Really nice room , with a gorgeous marble bathroom.
Fitz’s bar is the perfect cocktail bar , do visit before going out for dinner.  Lovely decor and music. 
Breakfast was really good. We had the a la carte option ,in the Neptune restaurant . 
Best salmon  this Norwegian girl has ever had in a hotel . 
All staff we met, were really nice and friendly.  ",5,2018,11,26
124,Old style comfort and charm,"Apart from the obvious magnificence of the architecture and the spectacular marble lined walls on the first two floors, the ambiance of (what was The Principal London) is a treat to still find in London without paying ridiculous prices. The staff during my four night visit were superb: attentive without being obsequious; efficient; and always polite and welcoming. The food is excellent and not unreasonably priced and the choice of the oyster bar or two other options enough without the need to wander far outside (although the Friend at Hand pub out the back is a convenient “boozer” with good food). For those prepared to use their feet it’s a moderate walk (20-30 minutes) to the Strand and Embankment or to Oxford Street, but the Russell Square tube station is literally just 2 minutes walk away - you just have to put up with the Piccadilly line. There’s a whole heap of eating options on the 10-minute walk to Holborn; lovely walks around Regent’s Park are a short bus ride away; there’s a small shopping centre opposite the tube; and you have the convenience of proximity to the British Museum, St Pancras and Kings Cross stations, and the British Library. Well worth a stay - and if you’re there Monday to Friday there’s a “Prosecco Hour” 5pm to 6pm.",5,2018,11,26
124,A revived treasure in Bloomsbury!,The Kimpton Fitzroy is a revived treasure in Bloomsbury. It is located in a historical building which has been totally refurbished with great style and taste as well as attention to details. I stayed for a long weekend  in a corner suite which was incredibly comfortable and beautiful with a great view over Russel square. At another occasion I stayed in a double room which was also very comfortable and pleasant. Breakfast in the Neptune restaurant was delicious and the staff highly professional but yet friendly. The bar is a little gem with a wonderful warm atmosphere. Afternoon tea in the Palm Court is a must. The hotel is very well located with a subway station at the corner and Covent Garden within walking distance. I would recommend this hotel to anyone and can't wait to visit again!,5,2018,11,25
124,Luxury renaissance style hotel,"Old luxury recently beautifully renovated hotel built 1898 in renaissance style, based on the Château de Madrid on the Bois de Boulogne in Paris that was completely demolished in the 1790s. Architect Charles Fitzroy who specialised in designing hotels, did the same dining room in the hotel as he had done on the Titanic. The building has a distinctive character and a very impressive exterior and lobby. The brand-new interior features a nice blend of old style and contemporary design. However, the room I got was very small, even by London hotel standards, but the bed was really comfortable, and the bathroom nicely designed. The cocktail bar is not to be missed, but the English breakfast is unfortunately average and fairly plain. It’s a big newly opened hotel but the staff manage to make it friendly and personal anyway, even if they still need to improve some parts like check-in and out. Traveling on business and not happy with all but might give it a go again anyway next time.",4,2018,11,25
124,Lovely Hotel - Stunning Decor - Excellent Staff,"Arrived around 10pm and was walked to the reception area by the stylishly dressed and very pleasant doorman. Swift (but not rushed) check in and headed to my room. I had a single which to be fair was delightfully decorated, although big enough, the bathroom felt around the same size if not a touch bigger than the actual bedroom area.

I headed to the bar and enjoyed a couple fine G&T's with live music playing in the background, I ate in the bar and the food was excellent, although I think it could have been a little larger on the portion size, even if a little more expensive.

I slept very well as bed was one of the most comfortable I've slept in at a hotel, the bedroom was quiet and blacked out. The room itself was more than adequate, it had an iron and board, safe, free wifi, good tv etc. only minus point was the mini bar was not stocked, just complimentary water and milk. Speaking of complementaries, there were a couple of bags of good quality popcorn and some chocolate too.

I didn't eat breakfast as I was rushing in the morning but I'd definitely stop at the Kimpton Fitzroy again for business and with the wife for a treat.",5,2018,11,25
124,Blown Away!!! ,"I’m not even sure where to start! In my lifetime I have travelled plenty and visited countless hotels. Never have I been to a place like the Fitzroy. We were initially greeted by the hotel reception who were all very knowledgable and willing to help. I was made to feel as if I was the first guest the hotel had ever received. I was in amazement that even approaching the reception desk they recalled our name and room number. The service is top notch! I was absolutely blown away (and this is before even getting to the room) 

It was a special visit (I am now engaged) my partner has been in liaison with Juliana Vincente (Guest Relations Executive) I can’t praise the lady enough. She pulled out all the stops, from laying roses and pictures on the bed. Ordering flowers for the room, there was even a welcome chocolate dessert with champagne waiting for us in the room. 

I finally met Juliana before we departed and I can honestly say, she is one of the most caring heartfelt people I have ever met. What an absolute credit to the hospitality industry. It was a breath of fresh air to meet someone who takes such pride in their role. And I would return to the hotel just for her presence! The world would be a better place if there were more Juliana’s in it!

Moving onto the room. Every aspect has been carefully planned, the comfort was amazing, the climate control perfect. They rooms are perfectly decorated with lovely finishing touches. The minibar was nicely presented. Normally I’d find at least one flaw with a room. But I can honestly say this is hands down the best hotel which I have ever stayed in! Even the bathroom mirrors were heated so you can see after coming out of the shower. 

If you want an experience of a lifetime, come here and stay in a suite. You will not be disappointed! 

I would like to say a huge thank you to all the staff - you all do an amazing job and you should be incredibly proud of yourselves! What an utter credit to the hospitality industry! ",5,2018,11,25
124,Love this hotel,"The Kimpton Fitzroy has a great atmosphere and is located in a perfect place. I would recommend it to anyone. We were pleased to stay at a hotel that is modern, clean, and comfortable. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Walter was one of the bellman he was the most helpful and did everything to make out stay the best it could be. The breakfast was delicious and the menu had a huge variety. We were so happy with our stay and would reccomend it to anyone.",5,2018,11,24

124,Luxury stay,"This hotel is a real treat to stay in, great check in experience the staff on the desk were so helpful, the room was small but clean and had absolutely everything you would need, at 5 in the lobby you could have drinks they just kept topping up my glass, breakfast in the morning was also lovely will be making a return visit to this hotel, had a really great trip.",5,2018,11,22
124,A welcome addition to the London hotel scene,"Under Kimpton/IHG management it appears that this wonderful late Victorian property may finally achieve its potential. 

The location is a perfect balance between the West End, for those who want theatres and nightlife, Bloomsbury (the British Museum and a host of other cultural venues) and the City (banking, fintech, law).

The hotel was originally built in 1898, and is architecturally stunning, though perhaps a little exuberant compared with the more restrained late Georgian squares immediately to the West. The recent renovations have been on the whole sensitive to the original character of the building, while making subtle adaptations to the Bohemian/hipster character of the area.

My room, facing onto Russell Square, was not large but with the floor to ceiling windows it was not claustrophobic. Even with the curtains drawn the space felt adequate, and the combination of double glazing and thick curtains meant there was little noise from what is normally a busy street outside. 

The double bed was extremely comfortable. There were more pillows and cushions than strictly necessary and as the hotel does not offer turn-down service I was forced to figure out what to do with them myself. As the hotel has been completely renovated prior to opening as a Kimpton, there were power points everywhere (including 4 bedside USB ports). It is a little disappointing that all the regular power points were standard UK 3-pin rather than the now widely available multiple standard sockets, but adapters were available from reception so this wasn’t a major concern. 

The bathroom was of a high standard with reproduction Victorian taps/faucets. However there was no bath (walk-in shower only) and only one sink/wash-basin). As a solo traveler this wasn’t an issue for me but for a couple this might be a little more challenging. 

What I did find truly extraordinary was the service. While this property has only opened recently (in its current guise), all the staff members I interacted with got everything right. To provide context on that statement, I do over 250 room nights a year, mostly in 5 star properties. This hotel got as close to a perfect stay as I have had in the last 10 years.

In summary: great location, great service, small but beautifully appointed rooms.

I will be back.

",5,2018,11,22
124,The greetings," As soon as we walked in we felt immediately welcome! We were exhausted after flying all might from New York. A shout out to Valter for making us feel  welcome. We have been here for 4 days so far and have been treated like royalty. ",5,2018,11,21
124,So bad we checked out early.,"Very much an 'all hat and no cattle' experience.  The hotel is wonderfully situated and the public spaces are gorgeous, which is why I've given it two stars, but it stops there.  In particular, the front office staff deserve special mention, and for all the wrong reasons.  If they were my staff, I'd be sending them off to hospitality re-education camp for an extended stay. Their unconscious bias is hampering their service recovery.  This is an important issue and one that needs to be addressed ASAP.

We were in London for a weekend at the end of a long holiday.  We just wanted a place to sleep and, as we were two single women, we opted for a single room each.  We foolishly assumed that the rooms would simply be a smaller version of a standard room - i.e. less floor area, smaller bed but everything else as advertised.  Sadly, no; our rooms were so badly designed it would have been funny if it hadn't been such a disappointment.  

The description on the website mentioned 'clever storage' (since removed as of a few days ago, hmmmm...) but still makes mention of the bathtub, seperate hanging closet, coffee maker and coffee and tea making supplies.  To be fair, the last is partially correct - there were 4 tea bags (2 of which were herbal) and an electric kettle.   The rest is, to be blunt, a lie.  

There is no space to store clothes in these rooms - nowhere, not anywhere, unless you count the two small drawers in the bedside table.   Someone  with a rather warped sense of humour has deemed that a 500mm long rail with 4 coat hangers in a cupboard above the mini-fridge and the jug meets the definition of a 'seperate hanging closet'.  This is a misnomer of the highest order.  It is neither 'seperate' (it doubles as the tea room) nor is it possible to hang anything in it longer than a dog jacket or pre-schooler's t-shirt.  Actually, if there really was a coffee maker in the cupboard (as advertised on the website) then even a dog's jacket would be hard-pressed to find a home.  Fortunately, the 'coffee maker and coffee' was actually a card offering one complimentary cup of coffee from the restaurant, downstairs, before noon - so no need for Fido to parade around London in a wrinkled jacket.

The photo on the website is of a bed with the 'wrap around headboard' which is also mentioned in the description.  It also shows a bathroom with a bath/shower combo.  My room had the headboard, but no bath.  My companion's room bore little resemblance to the photo or description.  The bed was shoved up against a wall under a window with nothing between the bed and the wall.  

There were a few other minor niggles.  There was nowhere to open your bags, so I had to ask housekeeping for a luggage rack - which was promptly delivered.  The passage to the bathroom was obstructed by a toe-stubbing doorstop bolted to the floor (try avoiding that in the dark of night in a strange room) and the bathroom was scented with hydrogen sulphide because the trap cover had been omitted from the shower.  This trap was fixed promptly but the doorstop booby trap remained problematic.    Oh, and the shower screen didn't seal properly and the water flooded out and pooled on the floor, where it would have stayed as there is no floor waste.  Fortunately, I used my one, thin towel to mop it up before I slipped in it.  And that's another thing ....  the website describes the towels as 'super sized'.  They're not.  They're standard, middle range, Trade Linen towels and are, frankly, a little worse for wear.  And yes, another thing, the website described the mattresses as 'hand made'.  I have my doubts.  I know my beds, and my mattress looked remarkably similar to a Hypnos contract mattress. It was firm; very, very firm.  In short, this was no Vispring.

So, in all, a room so bad it was funny, with the result that 30 minutes after checking in I went to the front desk and asked to be moved to another room.  

At the time, the hotel's website showed that there were two standard rooms (i.e. bigger than ours) available for both nights of our stay and at almost the same price (GBP289  per night per room). Now, we're two middle aged women, travelling without a male 'protector' and as such, we are invisible and assumed powerless - (unlike the young asian couple who checked in at the same time as us, who complained about their room and were swiftly granted an upgrade at no extra cost) - which is possibly why the manager on duty claimed the advertised available rooms were not really available and wouldn't/couldn't move us.  

Given this, I asked what could be done to compensate us if I checked out immediately, to which he responded that the best he would do is refund us for one night of our two night stay, i.e. if we checked out immediately they'd keep GBP570.

In hindsight, given that the room was both not as advertised and not fit for purpose, I should have risked losing GBP570, gone elsewhere and sought compensation via a credit card chargeback.  However, we were tired, hungry and the prospect of finding accommodation in London on a Friday night at a reasonable price was daunting, so we stayed and left the next day. 

Breakfast service was also a problem.  The room is lovely, the food good but the floor staff aren't on the ball and that makes it a rather tense start to the day.  They weren't scanning the room and it was difficult to get their attention and when we did, we had to ask several times for simple things like coffee as they'd appear to pay attention to our requests and then promptly forget.

Ladies of a certain age, aren't we all so fed up with being treated like this?  When will hotels wake up to the reality that we have time, money, curiosity and, after years of slugging it out as corporate road warriors, we love to travel for pleasure.  Treat us fairly and with respect and you've got yourself a sticky, low-maintenance client for life.   

BTW, when you check out from the Kimpton Fitzroy they give you a cheery send off. We observed others being asked about their stay and enquiries made as to their plans for the day before being presented with a cute little box.  Presumably it contains a chocolate or two.  However, as we didn't get one,  I can only speculate.",2,2018,11,21
124,Perfect stay,"We arrived at the hotel to be initially greeted by the very friendly and welcoming doorman who then took us through to the check in desk.
Were we greeted again by a very welcoming and polite member of the team. I explained we had a room booked for the evening and wanted to know if we could leave our over night case somewhere as it was only 12:00 and check in was not until 15:00, he asked us to wait a moment checked the system and gave us our room early a really nice touch.

The hotel is amazing the architecture and fine detail are worth viewing alone. The room was comfy and had all the normal extra's you would expect with another couple of nice touches.

We viewed a show and eat out so cannot comment on the evening meals. However we did visit Fitz's once we returned and enjoyed a cocktail or two!! a great ambiance with and a relaxed atmosphere.

We also had breakfast in Neptune's which was faultless as was the service.

I would definitely stay here again and would recommend to friends and family.",5,2018,11,20
124,What an incredible transformation!,"I was once employed here as an event manager in 2007 when it was the Hotel Russell and Yes it was absolutely abysmal!  But now it is incredible.  The hotel is just how I imagined it should look all those years ago.

The amazing corner coffee shop was once a storeroom for junk and I am thrilled how it's been brought to life.  The waste of space it use to be really infuriated me.  I love popping in and just breathing in the perfection.

The bar is really cool and sexy too, I always bring my friends here for a drink. 

Not yet had the chance to check out the bedrooms but next time I have guests I'll get them booked into the Kimpton just so I can have a proper nosy!

FANTASTIC TRANSFORMATION OF A GRAND OLD DAME!!!",5,2018,11,19
124,Absolutely Outstanding. A new Star in London.,"As I learned from one of the staff, this beautiful building used to be a derelict 3-star at best property known as the Russell Square Hotel. A new hotel company called Principal bought it, closed it for 2 years, poured UK 90 million into it and earlier this year opened it as the Principal London at Russell Square. Just a few months later IHG Hotels bought out Principal and have now reflagged it as the Kimpton Fitzroy. Doesn't matter what name is on it, it is a beautiful hotel with outstanding staff and service. The building is stunning outside and inside. The location in Bloomsbury overlooking Russell Square is great. All of the staff are friendly and welcoming. Special kudos to the doormen, bartenders and staff in Neptune, the seafood restaurant. The room was surprisingly small. But it was beautifully decorated with many quirky delightful touches, like the Tuck Box. Breakfast at Burr & Co is very nice, and I love the adjacent coffee shop. The Palm Court is a beautiful refuge, and the upscale bar - Fitz's will soon stand with the rest of London's wonderful bars. I ate dinner in Neptune twice - only because my first dinner there was marvelous - especially the service. They have half price oysters from 6-7, yummm, and I had an amazing daily chef special of homemade tagliatelle with aged Parmesan and white truffles. Plus some stated kale and garlic. To die for. Thanks to the very nice waitress who highly recommended it. I brought a friend there two nights later, but alas, they were not serving the truffle pasta that night. Great Property!",5,2018,11,17
124,Amazing building in a great location,"I dare someone to look at the exterior of this fine building and not be impressed. The staff couldn't have been friendlier. The room was surprisingly small for a 5* property, but perhaps that's just London. There was around 2-3 feet of space around the bed, and when the ironing board was out, you couldn't move at all. The bathroom was stunning. A staff member tried to turn me away from breakfast because they were too busy. I went in anyway and easily found a table. They just didn't want a single diner occupying a table of four.",4,2018,11,16
124,Turn of the Century architecture and a tie to the Titanic,"A grand dame facade that stands guard over Russell Square, this historic hotel is perfect for the traveler who enjoys staying in historic landmark buildings. 
My room was for a solo traveler and I can only imagine it must have served a butler or lady’s maid in the past. I was happy to enjoy the deep bathtub and view over the fall treetops of the park even if the room was small. I took the staircase every time with its carved wood bannister and the bronze dragon that is the twin of the one from the Titanic staircase. 
For practical purposes, the tube is next door, as well as a small mini mart and a coffee shop that has grab-and-go sandwiches. 
A wonderful choice. I would pop in for a meal, tea, or a cocktail at least if you  enjoy historic hotels. ",5,2018,11,16
124,Stunning. Inspiring,"What a great hotel. Location is perfect, the design very inspiring and a great choice of restaurants and a great bar, Fitz's. Love the flair and atmosphere of the hotel which is elegantly casual and relaxed grandeur. Am sure will be back soon.",5,2018,11,15
124,"Brilliant location, extraordinary building ","First built when nobody asked how much anything cost, a 2018 refurb relaunches one of London’s lovelier old hotel buildings. It’s dark inside, trying to be a club rather than a hotel, and its coffee bar has become another unofficial coworking space. But reasonable prices - huge glasses of wine for £7.50 to £9.50 - and rooms that are just months old so bang on the money for all the latest hotel comforts mean you get a swanky experience at half what they cost in most of London. And it’s 20 seconds from Russell Sq Tube and 2 minutes from the British Museum",4,2018,11,14
124,Perfect anniversary stay!,"What a stunning hotel! We stayed here in August for our one year anniversary and had the best time. Warm welcomes, a lovely room upgrade and complimentary vouchers to enjoy a glass of bubbly each in the Fitz bar downstairs.. incredible bar! The decor is amazing, the whole hotel is stunning. Breakfast is also pretty tasty here. We had the most wonderful stay and will definitely be back! ",5,2018,11,14

124,One of my best stays in Europe,"Most of the hotel rooms that I have stayed in Europe are usually small in size, moreover, the pictures on the website are not what you really end in (you see their biggest rooms on the booking websites)
The case is not the same in The Principal/Fitzroy London, you get what you see online, the rooms are very clean, fairly sized and have all the amenities that you can imagine
The hotel has a very nice cafe, bar (live music) and 2-3 very nice restaurants.  The hotel is also located in a good area (near the British Museum, Oxford street, etc...) and in-front of a park.
Lastly, I would really like to thank ALL of the very professional and supportive staff of the front desk and the hotel (Alex, Isabelle, Emma and Andrea)....Thank you very much, we had a problem in our room and they upgraded us to one of the best suites I have ever seen",5,2018,11,13

124,A Stay We will Always Remember,"What a wonderful hotel. It's in my favourite part of London - Bloomsbury - and every little detail was thought about - from the graduated choice of lighting in each area of the room and bathroom- to the walk-in rain shower with a bench - to the toiletries - to the comfiest bed and pillows. The art on the walls and the art books in the room were just to our taste. I've never been to a hotel where everything was just - well - so perfect. As we got out of our taxi, someone was there to grab our suitcases. Then, when we took in the grandeur of the art deco lobby we just wanted to linger.  The breakfast at Neptunes was excellent quality and relaxed with lots of choice including a few variations on eggs, avocados and fresh squeezed juices. Burr & Co cafe had such a neat vibe about it, we just wanted to go back more than once that day. Their kale crisps were amazing! And the cocktail bar- well we just lingered till nearly 1am, as we loved the atmosphere there. Most of all, the best bit about this hotel is the staff. Everyone seemed happy to be working there and were very helpful.A special mention to the lovely Juliana, who escorted us to our room on arrival, and made sure our stay was perfect in every way. Thank you everyone at Kimpton Fitzroy for making our special day and night in London even more special. We will most definitely be returning.",5,2018,11,11
124,Luxury as Standard ,"From the grand entrance to the stylish foyer to the classy rooms this hotel oozes class. The staff are friendly, efficient and very helpful with good knowledge of the surrounding area. 
The hotel is surrounded by nice, cozy pubs and good restaurants. Good access to public transport 
",5,2018,11,11
124,One of the nicest places I have stayed,"I was lucky enough to spend a night at this hotel.  The attention to detail is second to none.  The room was stunning, with great furnishings, well thought out lighting (with 4 modes in each room) and a lovely feel.

I also ate at the restaurant and spent time in the bar, both were equally impressive as the room.

The staff at this hotel also made you feel very welcome.  One of the nicer check in experiences I have had for a while.  It really shone through that the staff enjoy working at this place.

I have stayed a huge number of hotels, and I am hard pressed to think of one that was as impressive as the Kimpton Fitzroy.",5,2018,11,11

124,London Weekend,"This newly refurbished hotel, with beautifully restored interiors, offers a tranquil haven near the British Museum.  The staff members are attentive and service is friendly yet smoothly professional. A wonderful English breakfast was served in the Neptune restaurant, with excellent attention to detail. Highly recommended for a London stay and a far cry from standard corporate style hotels. ",5,2018,11,10
124,What a treat!,"I have traveled frequently for business for many years and without exception, this has to be THE BEST hotel I have ever had the pleasure of staying in!  Everything about it screams luxury and quality at you right from the moment you are greeted at the front door by a smiling and helpful doorman.   The reception team are efficient and helpful.  The concierge provided much needed expert advice on things to see and do over the weekend.  The gym is exceptional - all new equipment, with lots of it - water, towels and apples were much appreciated - always clean.  The venues within the hotel are excellent and cater for all needs - a fantastic coffee shop, Neptunes restaurant - I highly recommend the breakfast - freshly squeezed juices, real mint tea, a breakfast to die for and then there's the bar - great place to meet for drinks after work, including live music on one of the nights - all offer great service  ....... and as for the rooms - you couldn't ask for anything better - all new,  the bed and pillows are super comfy, the bathrooms are beautifully appointed, complete with heating rails to go with the big fluffy towels.  The location was perfect with the Russell Square station just around the corner, theaters walking distance away and taxi's easy to get right at the front door.   To say that I have loved my stay at the Kimpton Fitzroy would be an understatement - this will be my go to hotel whenever I am in London.  My thanks go out to Paul and his team for making it such an enjoyable stay!",5,2018,11,09
124,Fantastic Hotel and Staff ,"I have had the pleasure of spending two nights at the Kimpton Fitzroy.  Paul the General Manager and staff were very attentive, nothing is to much trouble. The bedrooms are immaculate and very spacious,  the breakfast is something to behold and the band's playing in the bar making my stay at the Fitzroy a 5 star experience. I will definatley be back!",5,2018,11,09
124,Beautiful Property; Friendly Staff; Great Location,"I'm a Spire Ambassador member, and I stay in hotels about 100 nights a year, at least half of which are IHG properties. I don't frequently stay in Kimptons, simply because I tend not to be in areas where a Kimpton is most convenient. As this is a brand-new property in the Kimpton/IHG family, I was eager to try it.

The newly-renovated hotel is beautiful from top to bottom. The decor is classic with a modern feel, and the rooms, including the bathrooms, have all new decor, furnishings and fixtures.

I ate at all four restaurants on the property while I was there: Neptune (seafood, the oysters were fantastic, as was the Eggs Benedict at brunch); Burr & Co. (hot breakfast buffet until 10:30 a.m., coffee and pastries all day); Palm Court (I just had tea, which was lovely), and Fitz's (bar only, Morten behind the bar made perfect gimlets, from a wide selection of gins). The restaurants were all top-notch, with excellent service all around.

The staff was, without exception, friendly and accommodating. In the lobby area, I found there were always 2-3 staff members available to assist with anything I might need, from arranging transportation to helping with luggage to providing directions to restaurants.

The area is also perfect for either a leisure or business traveler. The hotel entrance is just around the corner from the Russell Square underground station, which is the rare tube station to have lifts (you do have one staircase of 18 steps from the platform to the lift area). So if you're traveling with luggage, elderly people, small children, or anyone who might have trouble navigating a lot of stairs, this is a perfect station to have available near the hotel. It's on the Piccadilly line, which goes directly to Heathrow. Considering the Heathrow Express requires you to go through Paddington and transfer to the underground (and navigate lots of stairs along the way), I found that taking the tube straight from Heathrow to the Russell Square station actually saved me time over taking the Heathrow Express, and was significantly easier to navigate with luggage. Trains to/from Heathrow seemed to run about every 5 minutes, at least (some were 2 minutes apart). The trains from Russell Square station also run well into the night.

The hotel is just a block or so from the British Museum, and there are lots of shops and restaurants within an easy walk. There is a Pret a Manger just around the corner in front of the tube station, and another in the opposite direction just a block away, in addition to the coffee shop within the hotel itself. Several buses stop within a block of the hotel as well. Despite the central location, I found my 4th floor room(s) to be quiet, with no street noise.

The rooms have several conveniences, not the least of which is 2 electrical outlets and 2 USB outlets on each nightstand (in addition to a separate lamp and reading lights on the headboard). There is no electrical outlet in the bathroom, but the full-length mirror in the room has an electrical outlet at the bottom, which would be convenient for a hair dryer or curling/straightening iron. Wifi is free throughout the property, and I had no issues with connectivity or speed (including doing a couple of conference calls online for work during my stay). 

I started in a single room; as the hotel was fully booked the night I arrived, there was no upgrade available. The front desk manager offered to upgrade me the next day for the remainder of my stay, which I did. The single room was quite small, but the space is used efficiently, so it's perfect for one person. The single room had a kettle with a selection of teas and instant coffee. I moved to a double room the next day (room 405); the double room had a Nespresso machine; I didn't see a kettle. Both rooms had a selection of snacks available, as well as a small fridge with both still and sparkling water, and a small bottle of milk for coffee or tea.

The bathroom in the double room had a walk-in shower, no tub, while the single room had a tub with shower. The amenities are in large bottles, which I prefer over hotel-sized bottles. One minor quibble with the walk-in shower: the shelf that holds the shampoo and conditioner is big enough just for those two bottles: it won't fit a separate bottle of body wash, soap, razor, etc., so I put those on the floor while I was showering. It might be a good idea to add a second shelf of the same size in the walk-in shower to hold additional items. 

I noticed a moldy smell in the double room, and told the housekeeping supervisor, who happened to be on the floor at the time. As I had just moved rooms, and didn't plan to spend a lot of time in the room, I didn't ask to be moved again. I also told the front desk about it when I checked out, and the manager on duty very graciously offered to discount my bill.

I would highly recommend this property, and I'll no doubt return when I'm in London next.",5,2018,11,08
124,Too much expectation,"Coming to London to celebrate my 20th wedding anniversary with my wife, booked and informed 3 months ago, had allocated us 1st floor with a room next to the lift, were expected higher floor so rather disappointed, hence, seems party going on on the other side of 1st floor every night.. 
Twice that my wife were having shower, and there was no hot hot water half way, one time my wife was washing her hair, what a mess!
Staff are doing their jobs but could be better, but one thing I wanted to point out is that they are slow in returning emails, few emails took take more than 2 days to reply, therefore, if you need something urgent from them, call them.
Finally the Burr & Co is a great Cafe!",3,2018,11,07
124,Three nights at the Kimpton Fitzroy,The hotel staff were delightful.  Always friendly and exceptionally helpful.  Highly recommended.   Beautiful building with a stylish interior and immaculately clean and tidy.  Delicious coffee.  I bought some to bring home.  Thank you all.,5,2018,11,07
124,Lovely birthday treat,"Enjoyed a lovely stay. Beautiful building both inside and out; ornate terracotta facade, exquisite marble lobby, original mosaic floor and sumptuously interior design make for a wonderful stay. We were in town to go to the theatre, only two stops away on the tube which is handily just round the corner to the hotel, and the staying here made the trip extra special.",5,2018,11,06
124,Excellent hotel,"When i write about a hotel I usually start with the negative and bad things of the hotel. This time it is vary hard to find any remark. The only bad thing I found is that taxis are not permitted to stop in front of the hotel and have to stop in a street near by

I arrived the hotel a little before noon and went to the reception to check in and leave my luggage at storage, was very surprised to be given the room key.

Hotel lobby is very nice with a relaxing atmosphere

Room was not big but for a hotel in city center the size is average.

complimentary water bottles and snacks were available every day

Nice and friendly staff

hotel is a few meters from the Tube station

excellent value for money

for sure I will stay in the hotel on my next visit to London",5,2018,11,03
124,Lovely historical hotel in the centre of London,"Amazing historical building on Russel Square.
Recently renovated but preserving entirely all the original features. Grand entrance, elegant rooms and reception. 
Main hall very beautiful for a cocktail or dinner.
Business rooms quite good for meetings in small groups. 
Gym quite functional but with all you need. 
Food was ok but nothing really special. 
Very gentle and proactive personnel.
The room was a bit small but nicely decorated. 

",4,2018,11,02
124,Exceptional hotel - note name change,"Note from October 2018...  Despite being The Principal for under a year the hotel is now called Kimpton Fitzroy.

Not cheap at all but this really is an excellent hotel.   London is full of over rated 4 and 5 star down at heel places but this is so far from that.  Immaculate condition,  top notch service, excellent location.   The bar and restaurants are great too.

Only criticism is that the rooms are rather small. ",5,2018,10,31
124,Sensational Hotel,Gorgegous hotel and beautiful architecture. The location is great in the heart of Bloomsbury. It’s also worth having a drink in the bar in a cold night! I would definitely recommend it. I can’t wait to go back!,5,2018,10,31
124,Gorgeous ,"Beautiful hotel in an amazing location. I can’t emphasize enough how gorgeous the hotel is. Its in walking distance of the British Museum and library. The park across the street was a wonderful way to start the day and the underground station a few steps away was very convenient. The room was small but impeccable. 

A few cons: 
-The bathroom flooded half an inch or so each time we used the shower
-The restaurants were full and we could never get a seat. We sat at the bar our first night and it took nearly 45 minutes to get the check.
-They closed one of the restaurants for a party one of the few days we were there which would normally be fine but between the service at the other restaurant and the general aloofness of the staff, we felt somewhat unwelcome as guests ",4,2018,10,31
124,Amazing holidays in London,We couldn’t choose better hotel to stay during our holidays in London. All the staff made us feel like we were in our own home. Special thanks to Maria who have been really kind with all the family. For sure we will come back soon!,5,2018,10,30
124,Not 5 Star Service,"Beautiful building that has been superbly resorted. I remember it as The Russell  Great room as well. BUT....being 5 Star is as much about the service and this fell well short of requirements.  Frankly we've had better service in a Travelodge than we did in the first 24 hours of our stay.  Numerous issues that would appear to be minor but all add up and just should not occur in a 5 star hotel when you are paying nearly £400 a night.  Notified reception of these after the 1st night and in fairness they did rectify them.  But after having had to highlight service issues in the morning you would expect your room to have been serviced when you got back to it at 3pm in the afternoon!! Really, come on guys, that's shabby.
Some members of staff were excellent others didn't care when we said we had service issues
Won't be back I'm afraid.",3,2018,10,29
124,Amazing ,The hotel was just amazing service was exceptional and the staff could just not do enough for you. The bedroom was of a very high standard and catered for all needs. The hotel was in the best location for the shows and with Russel sq Tube around the corner you were never far from everything. ,5,2018,10,29
124,Simply WOW,"From the moment we arrived to the leaving the staff where amazing and so engaged.
The lobby is beautiful and the Fitz bar is must.
Excellent all round! we will definitely return same time time next year.",5,2018,10,29
124,great hotel - service has room for improvement,"We went back to the former 'Russell Hotel' and booked it as 'The Principal'. During our stay it changed ownership and became 'Kimpton Fitzroy'
The hotel is as great as ever, although the rooms are somewhat small.
Service has room for improvement. This may have been due to the change in ownership. It seemed to us that either there was a lack of process or a lack of the staff's knowledge of process.
We had to wait very long in both restaurants to get served, got the wrong tea or the bread was forgotten. 
I would still come back though as both the property as well as the location are wonderful",4,2018,10,29
124,Amazing - Amazing - Amazing,"This hotel has no faults whatsoever, we had a Suite on the 6th floor after being upgraded kindly by the hotel staff, knowing we were coming down for a special occasion the hotel had a complimentary bottle of Champagne delivered on ice to our room. A very nice touch! The hotel is pure class, lovely decor very nice split between old and modern, food delicious and the Fitz bar is very accommodating and relaxing. We cannot wait to go back next year!

Thank you,

Daniel & Charlotte. ",5,2018,10,28
124,Fabulous,"Fabulous fantastic amazing hotel  .We had a late lunch ordering. the house burger which was simply delicious with every mouthful sending your taste buds into overdrive ,there were others which were having afternoon tea which look delicious.This hotel is very stylish and what really stood out for me was the exceptional staff the attention to detail to there guest’s is truly fantastic .This is truly a unique hotel and I cannot wait to return . The hotel has change it name to “The Kimpton “ I just loved this place !",5,2018,10,27
124,Still A Stunner!,"Just had another wonderful day / night at this stunning hotel in Bloomsbury. The level of service, attention to detail and quality of the F&B in the bar and restaurant means you don't have to step a foot outside the door once checked in. Love this hotel!",5,2018,10,27
124,"Decadence, Style and Service that makes you feel special...","I stayed here on my recent trip to the UK for work and loved the experience the team have created. Each area of the hotel had its on unique experience and the attention to detail was incredible.  Used the gym every morning, really well equipped and helped me get over my jet lag.
The service was slick and the rooms were spacious and extremely comfortable.  The sound proof windows blocked out the early London buzz.  Right across the road is Russell Square gardens so if you felt like a moment in the sun, you just had to cross the road.  The Principle will be my go to from now on...",5,2018,10,27
124,An Amazing and Exceptional stay at The Principal London,"We stayed here for our honeymoon in August and one of the first things you notice when you arrive at The Principal London is not only the stylish and slick decor of the lobby, or the smiling happy faces of staff who greet you, it is something much simpler yet equally important - the attention to detail given to making guests' stay a memorable one. It is this which makes The Principal an absolutely outstanding hotel. From the outset, the Guest Relations Manager, Isabel, made sure every element of our stay went well. From placing us in the beautifully stylish and luxurious Corner Suite, to the flowers and special treats which adorned the immaculately clean room, through to the sumptuous breakfast brought up to our room,    we felt the professionalism and attention to detail of staff made our stay a wonderful time. The Corner suite is a huge suite which consists of two bathrooms, one of which consists of a shower and bath,a large lounge, dressing area and huge bedroom. The only disappointing element of our stay, was not booking more nights at this wonderful and stylish hotel!",5,2018,10,26
124,Brilliant!,"Just so you know this hotel is now called The Kimpton.  We arrived at the Principal and it officially changed it's name the next day.  We stayed here overnight for a treat for my daughter's 18th birthday and everything about it was just lush.  It has all been newly refurbished so the rooms are modern, beds comfortable, lovely sheets and pillows, coffee machine, kettle, teapot and even a small bottle of milk in the fridge for tea and coffee.  Large flatscreen TV too.  The hotel public areas are very decadent and the architecture is stunning.  We enjoyed wonderful cocktails and live music in the Fitz Bar and a fantastically expansive breakfast in the Burr & Co - all part of the hotel.  I was fascinated to know that the architect of this hotel also designed the dining room on the Titanic, and that one of the brass dragon ornaments that he commissioned for the Titanic and this hotel sit on the ornate balustrade. I will definitely be staying here again - oh and the price is good too.",5,2018,10,26
124,Pleased with my stay at The Principal London,"I just returned from a 6 night stay at The Principal.  Good value for rate.  Clean, updated, modern, youthful all describe the vibe here.  Yet, the building is stunning from outside and original building intact.  The staff was nice and friendly.  I mostly dined in room, food was decent, but nothing special.  The bar was lovely, felt hip and modern.  Beds were comfortable.  Great location for us and close to the Underground station. I liked the peacefulness of the Russel Square location.   

I traveled with a friend, we both got our own rooms. My room was quite small which was fine for me as a single traveler but wouldn't recommend room #638 for more than 1 person in that room.  My friend's room was bigger and would be better suited for a couple.  We purchased the same room so I guess all rooms aren't necessarily standard sized.  

Here are the downsides (not that any of this would keep me from returning): the concierge desk needed more people manning the station, was frustrating waiting in line to ask questions which happened many times (there was usually only one one person there).  And the housekeeping was not consistent.  Some days they refilled the complimentary water bottles, some days they did not.  Where my friend received nightly turn down service, I did not.  The hotel robe that I was using was taken away, not to be replaced for a couple of days.  The room cleaning times were very late in the day. So when we returned from our daily outing and wanted to freshen up before dinner, we didn't have fresh towels or a clean room to return to.  

Before checking out, I received a note the hotel is yet again changing it's name.  Identity crisis?  The Principal is new name in itself...and just so you know many taxi drivers do not know it - best to say ""Russel Square"" for drop offs.",4,2018,10,24
124,Exceptional,We stayed or one night.   Arrived at 10.30pm - very friendly reception staff.  Particularly Alex. Upgraded to a beautiful room.  Cannot fault the service or the breakfast!    So lovely to have all expectations massively exceeded.,5,2018,10,24
124,Guest room,"Absolutely fantastic. Our one night stay with afternoon tea was amazing. Thank you for allowing us to have a mocktail instead of champagne as we dont drink alcohol.
The team was outstanding. Always with a smile throughout our stay.
The starter in the afternoon tea was to perfection, so tasteful. 
We stayed on a guest room to give the hotel a try and our room was spacious enough and cosy. I heard other people saying the guest room were too small noneses it's perfect for a couple. 
We will definitely be coming back!

Breakfast at burr & Co wasn't as I expected (small and chaotic), but that's just my opinion. We will be trying neptune next time! 

Thanks again for the team for making our stay so welcoming and comfortable.",5,2018,10,22
124,Very lovely hotel,"Had a long weekend here.   Got one of the slightly bigger rooms.  Love the public spaces and the room was wonderfully quiet with a v comfortable bed. Fire alarm at night but no great drama. 

Had afternoon tea which was lovely.  Breakfast in burr and co was pricey but very nice. Great omelette.  The food in the coffee shop looked nice. The bar is fabulous.  Very friendly staff. 

Lovely cafe in Russel square gardens and a couple of cracking old pubs nearby.  Brilliant location for British museum and walking to lots of sights.  Ten mins walk from kings cross St Pancras and granary square.",5,2018,10,21
124,London at it's best,"I used to walk by this place when it was on the brink. But still oh so beautiful, such an architectural gem. Now it has been renovated. What a wonder. All the common rooms, the cafes and bars, the incredible staircase and stained glass - plus the way they treated me (Madam this and Madam that), I would recommend this hotel to anyone.",5,2018,10,19
124,Above and Beyond!,"I will apologise for the long post in advance!
We stayed in a junior suite and a classic room for the children.
We stayed from Friday 12th October until Sunday 14th October.
This hotel is located very close to the underground so you will have no problem going to visit different parts of London.

As you approach the steps leading into this gorgeous hotel you are greeted by the doorman who takes your bags to reception.
The reception staff are so welcoming and give you all the information you need about locating different areas in the hotel ie to have drinks, breakfast, evening meals, gym and the beautiful reading room.

The Junior suite was amazing, on entering the room to the luxurious furnishings including the walk in wardrobe, the free standing roll top bath (my favourite!) and the gorgeous bed.
We were greeted with a lovely hand written note from the team and also a complimentary dessert was left for us which was divine!

We had dinner on the first night which was beautiful and surpassed our expectations especially the lemon sole and haddock chowder.
We tried breakfast in both restaurants in the hotel, in Burr and Co the breakfast was a buffet which was great as their was ample of options to choose from especially for the children (try a vegetarian omelette from the chef it was delicious!)
In the other restaurant the breakfast was a choice off the menu I had a full English with home made baked beans!

Don’t forget to check out the lucky dragon on floor 2.

I have read some negative reviews regarding the fire alarm that went off at 2.30am I disagree with the comments about it wasn’t handled well, myself and my family were given clear information on what was happening ( well done to all the staff involved it was handled well) and thankfully it was a false alarm.

A special thank you to Kerry from Fitz’s for marking our Mocktails extra special!
Alberto for looking after my family and going that extra mile to make it a memorable break.
And there are sooo many more staff members I should thank but I can’t remember all the names.
So a big Thankyou to all the team that we came across whilst staying at The Principle London on the above dates.

I can’t wait to visit again!!

124,Amazing service,"The service is always impeccable at The Principal London.  The friendliness of the reception and concierge department is nothing less than fantastic. The teams are always smiling and are very playful with my one year old son. The housekeeping department is wonderful, not only did they set up the suite with the baby cot and special amenities but they always go the extra mile to ensure we are comfortable and have everything we need. They even delivered a box of chocolates personally!! One word to describe this hotel.... ""WOW""!!",5,2018,10,16
124,Weekend in London,"We had a standard room on 2nd floor. The bed was fantastic, very comfortable and large. Shower/wet room was small - floor got fairly wet outside of shower. Not enough shelf space for toiletries (like most). Otherwise well equipped, though really ought to have proper coffee maker - basic tea and Nescafé instant. Good TV.

Brilliant breakfasts - a la Carte - perhaps one of the very best in London. Staff were all really good, welcoming and very friendly. Interior of hotel is impressive, spacious and a great place to spend some time.  Would definitely recommend.",5,2018,10,14
124,Emergency At Hotel No Staff To Help,"Currently 2:40am and fire alarms are going off, fire department is arriving, lobby full of scared guests and we have ZERO HOTEL STAFF HERE TO GIVE US DIRECTION. Emergency’s or security  are obviously not priority at this hotel. It’s our first night of a week long stay and I’m not sure if we should still stay here??? London has enough emergency problems and this hotel is not capable of handling any sort of emergency.",1,2018,10,13
124,Outstanding,"Really friendly welcome which immediately puts you at ease.The Principal is clever at offering top class service and hospitality without the formal pomp and ceremony that other hotels deem necessary.  Room was incredible, large (especially for Central London), beautifully presented, spotless and great design.  I will definitely be back . . . Soon!",5,2018,10,13
124,Great place to stay,"We had stayed here before but there have recently been some significant upgrades. Now the inside lives up to the beautiful exterior.

On arrival, we were upgraded to a corner suite. This was a very generous gesture and much appreciated. It had stylish original features and the modern touches were done very well, particularly the lighting. 

The staff were very friendly and keen to help, special thanks to Alex at reception.

The gym is well equipped with the latest machines. The marble staircase is very nice too. I'm sure we will come back in future.",5,2018,10,13
124,Underwhlemed,"I booked this property back at start of the year and had been eagerly awaiting my stay ever since. Having looked at all the positive reviews on here before my stay I had high expectations. On arrival it is hard to not be impressed with the magnificent building. The architecture is stunning and the recently renovated interiors have been tastefully done. I was less impressed by no one being on the door to help carry our luggage and the queue at reception due to only one person being behind the desk. Eventually some of the many staff wandering around decided to help out but it still was about ten minutes before we were dealt with. All in all a mixed start.

Unfortunately things were about to get worse. I had completed the online check in roughly a week before so expected things to go smoothly. We had arrived a few hours early so we were told our room was not ready which was totally fine. During my conversation with the staff member I was asked if I preferred a low or high floor. My response was a high floor if possible and that was far as the conversation went. We left our luggage and then went off around London to do a few things. We arrived back at the hotel just after five. When we went back to reception we were told our room still was not ready. This was now two hours after official check in. When we enquired why our room was not ready I was somewhat surprised by the reply. The response we got was that it was our fault for requesting a high floor! So nothing to do with the hotel then! If I had been told initially that asking for a room on a high floor would be problematic then it might have been slightly better. Although I really think blaming guests for the hotels shortcomings is not the best way to deal with problems. In fairness the lady who was dealing with us did seem to realise this quite quickly from our reaction. She quickly offered us complimentary drinks and then seem to magic up a high floor room in minutes. So the problem was quickly resolved but I really feel it should never have happened in the first place. All it did was annoy me and put a real dampener on our arrival.

Our Superior Double room was a mixed bag. The room was slightly small and bland but the bathroom was beautiful and huge.It looked like the room had become available so quickly because it had not been properly cleaned. The tuck box was missing items, the bath had hairs in and there was a piece of a previous guests jewellery on the side. I would say the room lacked the wow factor you would expect from such a grand hotel. 

We wanted to try all the restaurants/bars at the hotel during our stay. Breakfast in Neptunes was very good with excellent service. Burr and Co has a more causal coffee shop feel to it but was good for a quick drink. I loved the stylish decor in Fitz's bar but found the service to be a bit hit and miss. Some of the servers were lovely and attentive while others seemed the complete opposite. There were also a lack of seats later in the evening. I can not comment on the Palm Court as it was closed for a function on the afternoon we had planned to go there. I'm not really sure why private functions take priority over the paying hotel guests. After all this was promoted as the ""heart and social hub of the hotel"". It's kind of hard to be that if you close it off to guests. It would have at least been nice to have been informed of this on the day as we came back early to unwind there before the evening. 

Check out was a slow process with another queue which took about fifteen minutes to get to the front of. Although at least the staff member was polite this time! All in all this hotel failed to meet my expectations. The building and public areas are beautiful but the rooms are a disappointment. Service was extremely hit and miss with the check in process being woefully inadequate for a luxury hotel. The closing of the Palm Court for a function in the daytime also irked me especially as we had made plans around going there. Would I come back here again? Probably not. Maybe I was just unlucky but I just felt underwhelmed with the whole experience.

Oh and one final thing. For some reason the corridors leading to the rooms always seem to have loads of cleaning carts and equipment littered around them at all times of the day. It looks untidy and is unnecessary. Surely no one is using them at midnight?",3,2018,10,13
124,Junior Suite is a Large Room not a Suite ,"The Junior Suite which was worth $650 per night was just a large room (by London’s standards) not a suite. They probably should use a more accurate name. It was a good experience, but would have been better with the proper description of rooms (rather than resorting to some indirect tricks). ",3,2018,10,12
124,Great hotel,"We were upgraded to a suite by the reception which was an exceptional room
Valter was of great service at the door during the check in and check out! The hotel interior is beautiful and very historic. Overall the stay was great! 

",5,2018,10,10
124,"Location, location and service","As a self-professed hotel snob I agonized over the hotel choice for my trip to London.  After all, this was my first vacation in a year and my first International trip with my husband.  The hotel had to be perfect.  

We needed a location close to a tube stop, but also in a walkable location close enough to all the city has to offer, but far enough away that we weren’t in the middle of touristville. 

We wanted a great hotel bar and varied food options.

Lastly, the rooms had to be comfy.  After a long-haul flight and lots of exploring we wanted a space that provided a respite from the day. Note that although the rooms are very comfortable, they are quite small so I suggest upgrading to a larger room if there are two of you.

The Principal delivered on all counts with an added bonus of an impeccable staff.

Oliver and the ladies at Fitz’s could write a tour book on food and drink establishments.  We followed several and all were top notch.  And their cocktails are not to be missed.  It’s worth a visit just to experience Fitz’s.

Luis at the concierge also went above and beyond to help with some last minute business services I needed and as an added bonus he provided some great recommendations for our trip to Edinburgh.

We will be back for a second stay soon.",5,2018,10,10
124,Rooms not quite as good as public areas,"Hotel originally decorated by the same designer as the Titanic. Beautifully restored. The lobby and bar are particularly noteworthy. The coffee shop serves rather good espresso.

Guest room is very small for two people  and not great value for the price. The double bed is a small double, barely 135cm wide, which some couples may find challenging.

Housekeeping staff need further training, as they were leaving supply carts in the hallways 24/7.",4,2018,10,07
124,Exceptional customer service and a lovely hotel to boot.,"We stayed there for a 2-night stay that had to become a 1-night stay after my wife broke her foot on a curbstone. The hotel was excellent and provided a credit for the 2nd night even though we didn't check out or make them aware until 11:45 am on the 2nd day. Great service and care shown during our checkout from staff assisting my wife.

The hotel has obviously had a lot of money spent on it and you can see that. I ooze's classic English style and though we had one of the smaller (read cheaper) rooms it was still quiet and clean. If I were to criticise the air conditioning seemed to stop working into the night, so we got very hot and the coffee in the room could be a lot better, but those are small things.

We enjoyed our stay, appreciated the goodwill and service shown and will stay there again because of this.",4,2018,10,06
124,Gold standard in customer service ,"This is a beautiful newly refurbished hotel. The rooms are well appointed and the beds are super comfortable. But the thing that really sticks in my mind after staying here on half a dozen ocasions is the staff. Friendly, efficient, always ready to engage in a wonderfully warm and authentic way. It makes a HUGE difference when travelling away from home for an extended period to get a personal greeting when returning to the hotel. The Doorman Walter in particular was fabulous and always with a ready smile and spot of conversation! I had an issue for two nights running when there was no hot water in my room. The hotel manager, Bemnet, was excellent and resolved the issue with a level of professionalism rarely seen in large hotels. Also we received brilliant servicefrom Isabelle at the front desk who helped us with some tricky onward bookings. Cannot fault these guys!",5,2018,10,06
124,Birthday staycation,"I stayed at the Principal for two nights with my mum for my birthday. We were going to see Hamilton so I wanted a hotel that was easy to get to from Victoria. The Principal ticked that box, was in an area I was familiar with and had good reviews.

You can never really know what to expect until you experience a place for yourself and whilst the reviews were positive I still went in with a healthy amount of cynicism. After my stay I  can honestly say every positive review about this hotel is well deserved.
 
We arrived early  to drop off our bags before heading to the theatre.  The receptionists Bemnet (apologies if I have misspellt her name) and Maria  were lovely and chatty, asking about the reasons for the visit and whether they could help with any plans during our stay. Our booked room was ready but they very kindly upgraded us to a junior suite (256), because it was my birthday and made arrangements for our luggage to be taken up to the room so we could get on our way. 

The room was wonderful and spotlessly clean which is a credit to the housekeeping staff. There were a lot of little touches which made the stay special including the birthday card and mini cake selection left in the room on the first night, daily turndown service,  the beautifully bound classic novels, the tuck box and the fridge with complimentary water which were both replenished daily.

We had breakfast at the Neptune on the first morning and room service breakfast on the second. Both were excellent. The waiters in the Neptune were friendly and efficient.  Our room service  was delivered by a lovely woman who was very helpful and laid everything out on the table for us and came to collect the trolley after we were done.

Special mention to the check in and check out staff Bemnet, Maria and Clare, the door men, restaurant and room service staff and the housekeeping staff including the night manager and the woman who did our turndown for us. Everyone we encountered was friendly, helpful and accommodating. 

A hotel is only as good as its staff and the people who work at the Principal know the meaning and value of delivering good customer service.  If they continue as they are then they will go from strength to strength. This is now my favourite place to stay in London and I am already booking my next stay.",5,2018,10,06
124,5 Star service at half the price,"This impressive hotel building has only recently been renovated and at great cost which is clearly evident from the quality of the interior and room we stayed in. Close to Kings Cross and St Pancras only a short distance from central London and the West End and the British Museum just around the corner , its situation overlooking Russell Square is perfect. We were made to feel very welcome from the minute we arrived at the steps to the entrance and were treated to a mini tour of the hotel by the concierge. All the staff appear very proud of 'their' hotel. It is a magnificent building and has been renovated to high standard. Check in and out were both very quick and their lifts almost immediate. They were also aware of special requests we had made (which other hotels often ignore!) Our room was a good size and the ensuite facilities perfect with a large walk-in shower - we only stayed 2 nights but this room was perfectly adequate for a week or mores stay with an iron, a safe and tea making facilities. Breakfast was nice and relaxed with a good selection up to full English and we also had a snack in the Palm Court area which very good and with excellent service. The oolong tea was particularly good and rare to find in most hotels. I can't fault this hotel in any way from the fabric of the building to the staff and the quality of service down to the price.",5,2018,10,06
124,Brilliant,"This is a beautiful old building which has been refurbished very tastefully and to the highest standards. We stayed for a week and later for one night. Our rooms were lovely and the public spaces beautiful (check out the Palm Court!).  We never tired of using the magnificant staircase.  The location is great, right on leafy Russell Square park, buses and tube practically on the doorstep and easy walking distance to many attractions.      
The staff were exceptional - friendly and helpful. The way in which a problem we had on check in was solved was a lesson in customer relations!     We didn't try the restaurant breakfast because the cafe breakfast was just perfect - plenty of choice in relaxed surrounding - and with perfect staff and great coffee!",5,2018,10,05
124,Amazing,"Took my Mum to London in August for a special birthday weekend and stayed at the Principal London. The staff could not have been more attentive if they tried - from the door man who remembered us every day, always asking how our day out had been, to the reception and concierge who couldn’t do enough for you. We ate on the first morning in Burr and Co which was a lovely buffet breakfast served alongside brilliant coffee! We had dinner in Neptune which is certainly an experience not to be missed and had breakfast there the following morning (I recommend the full breakfast and freshly squeezed OJ!). We also had drinks in Fitz bar and were looked after so well. Even the housekeeping staff were so attentive and kept our room lovely during the stay. We didn’t have time to try the newly opened Palm Court but it looked beautiful from the outside - I will definitely be back to try this one out. Never have I felt so at home in a hotel before, I couldn’t recommend the Principal London enough. It’s certainly the only place I will be staying in London from now on. ",5,2018,10,05
124,Couple of days away,"First impressions of the hotel were excellent. Stepping in to the hotel was like stepping back in time .the decor was old school but brand new and the service by the staff was exceptional, nothing is to much trouble. Food  in the Neptune bar was A1 service was excellent and friendly.The room was of an excellent standard and well appointed.  I will definitely return if in the area.",5,2018,10,04
124,Superb! ,"Fantastic hotel with great staff. Beautiful interiors, very stylish! Nice bars and eating areas. The only let down was the breakfast in the adjourning cafe, too busy and staff didn’t know what was happening, perhaps teething problems? Perfect location for a visit to London",5,2018,10,03
124,Such a beautiful hotel,We stayed when the hotel first opened in May and it was superb. The hotel is simply gorgeous. So tastefully refurbished you have to admire the place. The staff are so unbelievably friendly. Walter was superb at the door but everyone we met from there on was simply brilliant. We returned in September and booked a suite. Outstanding again. The staff can’t do enough to help yet don’t impose. The rooms are stunningly decorated. Fitz bar is delightful. This is a wonderful hotel and a treat to stay in. You have got to stay here. We will be coming again and again.  ,5,2018,10,02
124,Wonderful,"We stayed on the opening night of this fabulous new London hotel, wonderful service, beautiful rooms. As the restaurant had not yet opened we followed the concierge's excellent local tip, soon heading back to try the now open restaurant.",5,2018,10,02
124,Old fashioned style with a modern twist - the very young staff are wonderful,"This was our second stay at the Principal London. Walter on the concierge/porter post absolutely has to get a mention. The first time I stayed was at the soft opening and coincidentally was my 50th birthday weekend trip to see my son and daughter. Walter greeted us on this visit and remembered us- I realise this may be part of the booking in marketing but he was so sincere remembering a dress I wore that it really did seem very genuine. Like greeting friends. We opted for a junior suite this time and it was lovely. Beautiful bathroom, with a proper bath, great plug sockets, lighting and quality furnishings- if you are away from home it’s nice for it to be as good or better.
Fitzs bar is dark and sumptuous- amazing customer service, top ups of water and twiglets are very regular. Furniture and furnishings are beautiful. Staff wonderful. Only niggle as gin lovers is the gin choice is a little limited- it would be good to see a few braver choices. The bar is stunning- it’d be great to have an array of gins covering America, London, Europe etc...this is not a complaint! 
If I could live in a hotel - like people used to do so in retirement.....this would be my choice. Bloomsbury is so handy for so many central places - locally Cosmobar a superb old style Italian is moments walk away. Tropea cafe in Russell Sq Gardens is just delightful for breakfast through lunch to evening if you want to people watch and not break the budget....very popular with locals. 
The hotel is changing hands to be a part of IHG soon......don’t change your staff or service- they are perfect.
If you like a Victorian through to Art Deco style building- visit - it’s beautiful.",5,2018,09,30
124,It's a great hotel.,"We came back to Korea safely.
We stayed from September 19 to September 27.
The exterior of the hotel was antique.
The inside of the hotel was neat.
For us whose English level is low, front staff, restaurant staff, and door men were all kind.
They made their trip to London happy.

위 영어 설명과 다르게 한국어로 리뷰를 쓰자면 우선 외관이 아주 고풍스럽고, 외부는 리모델링한지 그리 오래되지 않아 깔끔합니다.
직원들 모두 친절했고, 이 호텔에 좋은 기억뿐입니다.
호텔 바로 뒷편에 피카딜리라인 지하철역(러셀스퀘어) 있어서 움직이기 편하며 코번트가든 템즈강이 그리 멀지 않아서 버스, 지하철로 이동하기 좋습니다.
걷기 좋아하면 30분 이내에 갈 수 있음.
호텔 뒤편 5분거리에 큰 마트 및 쇼핑몰이 있고 약국도 있습니다.
와사비도 바로 뒤에 위치해 있어서 한국 음식이 먹고싶으면 제육덮밥을 드셔보세요. 양 많음..
홀번역 주변에 ""김치""라는 가게는 아주 훌륭한 한국음식점 입니다.",5,2018,09,30
124,Fab Stay,"We decided to stay in this hotel to celebrate our wedding anniversary. We booked a Junior suite but we were very surprised and delighted to be upgraded to a Corner Suite. The Suite was fabulous, and we could not asked for anything more. The Fritz bar served us fantastic and unusual cocktails and our dinner at the Neptune restaurant was also highly enjoyable. The architecture and décor of this wonderful historic building is a marvel to behold- congratulations to the guys who carried out the recent refurbishment. The staff are very enthusiastic and welcoming, we would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to stay in a lovely building,  enjoy a  good service, great food and cocktails.",5,2018,09,30
124,The best hotel in London,"I stayed in the hotel  for twenty days because I had a surgery done. 
All the staff of the hotel took care of me like my family would have.
It is not just the best Hotel in London, the people who work there have the best human quality !!!!
I would like to thank again personally each one of them; Isabel, Inmaculada, Bianca,
Ana, Sean, Libor, Alex, Harry, Nicolas, Walter, Jeffrey, Gabriele, Maria, Andrea, Martha, Agata, Aylin, Rihonna, Shanah... (if I forgot someone, please forgive me, all of them are amazing!)",5,2018,09,29
124,Excellent stay at the Principal Hotel,"This is a beautiful hotel that is well located in the Bloomsbury district. Underground is right around the corner and there is a variety of good eateries nearby. I want to tell 
people about my unusual experience here as I feel it says more about this hotel than platitudes. I used this hotel as a base for a thirteen night stay visiting my son. I was quite jet lagged my first night so I went to bed early. I was awakened around midnight by an unfortunate incident that made my room uninhabitable. The hotel staff went out of their way to help me repack and relocate to an upgraded room. The next day I met with the manager who once again apologized and told me that besides the room upgrade I would be given complimentary breakfast for the rest of my stay. I was impressed with the willingness and urgency of the staff to do the right thing. As my stay progressed I really noticed the effort of all staff to make sure customers were well served. The Principal hires a lot of young people who are very well trained. They are courteous and efficient, which leads me to believe that management has impressed on them that customer service is very important. I’ve stay at many lovely hotels, but I feel a lot of them could learn from this hotel. 

Some things of note:

Breakfast is excellent and the breakfast staff are extremely efficient.

The decor is lovely. 

I found my room on the fourth floor very quiet for the location.

Little things like the welcoming treats and tuck boxes are a nice touch.

Skip the elevators just once to take a walk down the main staircase. It is quite beautiful.",5,2018,09,28
124,Will definitely stay again,"Absolutely loved my stay at the Principal! Super friendly and helpful staff and gorgeous room. The tuck box is a nice detail I really appreciated. Grabbed a bite to eat at Burr & co, which was simple but delicious, and the drinks at the Fitz were spectacular albeit a bit pricey. I will definitely book again next time I'm in London.",5,2018,09,25
124,Exceptional stay,"A truly exceptional stay had for my birthday. The front desk team were so welcoming and could not do enough to make our stay extra special. 
We were kindly upgraded to a suite, which was truly something special. We wish we could of stayed for longer and tried the afternoon tea in Palm Court. 
We will definitely return!",5,2018,09,25
124,Afternoon tea at palm court The Principal London,"I love afternoon tea and this is what I would consider an example of excellence. 

The food was delicious, from the potato veloute with truffle which was so moreish, to the delicious lemon curd and scones, to the immaculate patisserie. It goes right up there with my favourites.

The setting is relaxing and private, very elegant. It feels like stepping back in time. Service was what I consider to be perfect. Attentive and welcoming, it's five star with none of the pushiness you can sometimes find in fancy settings. Big thanks to Alejandra who was a delight throughout, and everyone we encountered seemed happy to be there. A really lovely afternoon.",5,2018,09,24
124,Superb renovation of a landmark building,"I stayed here for one night, having arrived into Kings Cross. The hotel is ideally located about a 15minute walk from the station, and a 10-25minute walk into central London depending where you're heading.
The standard of the renovation is excellent; the quality of the materials used, the furniture and accessories is superb and the hotel has a luxury feel to it throughout. My single room, was small, but perfectly adequate, and very quiet and comfortable. My only minor criticism was the intermittent hot water (or luke warm) from the shower in the morning, but it didn't spoil the stay!
Breakfast, included in my rate, was excellent; a la carte, with great choices and friendly service.
The staff were friendly and helpful throughout the hotel, and I can't wait to stay here again!",5,2018,09,24
124,First-class stay in Bloomsbury,"We stayed at the Principal for four nights this month.  We had previously stayed at the Principal in Manchester, and were impressed.  The building itself has been beautifully renovated, and the common areas are stunning.  Our room was very comfortable (beds were GREAT) and the staff was warm and friendly.  It's just around the corner from the Russell Square Piccadilly Line station, which makes it easy to get around the city.  Easy walking to the British Museum, Covent Garden, and the West End.  A shout out to Burr & Co, which is the charming coffee house/café/wine bar adjacent to the lobby.  Everyone who works there is a delight, and it's a great place for breakfast or a snack.  One of the staff mentioned to us that Kimpton will be buying the Principal chain this year--we hope they retain the charm of these unique hotels.  We look forward to returning.",5,2018,09,23
124,3-day stay with a few bumps,"I used to live in the area and was excited to see that the former Hotel Russell had been revamped and reopened. I booked a single room as I was in London alone for some business. Check-in was smooth and I was taken up to my room by a lovely gentleman.

To my dismay, he opened the door to reveal a tiny room. I mean TINY. My big suitcase barely squeezed through the doorway.  The bed took up almost all of the room, there was literally nowhere for both of us to stand. On the bright side, the bathroom was a good size. My room overlooked the inner courtyard, so it was very quiet.

The first night, I found it unbearably hot in the room, despite the AC turned on full blast. I asked front desk about it the next day, and it turned out that it had stopped working. I was told that I will most likely have to move rooms, but they needed to confirm with me later. 

As I had an appointment that evening, I asked them to tell me in advance if I needed to move rooms. Despite calling twice for a confirmation, I did not hear back from them. I packed everything just in case, and asked them to move my suitcase if a new room was allocated to me.

When I came back, my suitcase had indeed been moved to my new room. By my estimate, it was larger by about 20%, facing street-side, with an area to prop my suitcase up against, and a bigger bathroom. I also realised that the water pressure was much better in this new room.

There was some noise from cars driving past in the new room, but I definitely preferred it for more space. It was far more comfortable than the first one.

Overall, location is excellent and staff are super friendly. Furnishings are new and of very high quality. However, if you are booking a single room, make sure you ask for a bigger one.",4,2018,09,23
124,Satisfying 3 nights stay!,"Front desk Alex was super helpful and had a beautiful smile on his face throughout.
He understood our request well and greeted us warmly while we arrived. Had a nice email conversation with Faustine before reaching the hotel and she tried her best to answer all my queries and was very friendly.
Room was nice and spacious, bed was comfortable, with a lot of small gestures (e.g. weather report card) it made our stay wonderful and memorable.",4,2018,09,22
124,Vacation ,"Beautiful, freshly renovated, “smart “ elevators, and a great restaurant “Neptune”. Neptune has a very cordial staff. As one would surmise from its name, it’s a seafood restaurant and offers breakfast, lunch, and dinner. The yolks in the eggs Benedict were perfectly cooked and dinner was great too. Hotel has a fun youthful environment and is very comfortable for my wife and I. I’m fifty-nine she’s a much younger fifty-eight.
",5,2018,09,22
124,Three days of luxury,"We had two wonderful nights here , fantastic staff , doorman was a great guy so pleasant and helpful, choice of bars and restaurants first class , beautiful room , looking forward to our next visit great Hotel",5,2018,09,20
124,"Beautiful property, amazing staff","I stayed for one night only on business and I will certainly return. The hotel is beautiful with an impressive entrance and lobby area. The staff at the front desk are truly amazing, they went above and beyond to accommodate me, despite me arriving super early in the morning and the hotel being fully booked. Genuine hospitality.
My suite was stunning and very comfortable with a fantastic bathroom and great shower! Unfortunately I didn't have the time to try out all their outlets, but the coffee bar has a great local vibe and I really enjoyed the a la carte breakfast at the restaurant.",5,2018,09,20
124,What a charming place with a wonderful welcome,"My daughter and i went last week end at the Principal and we liked our stay, both concierge’s advices 
Our bedroom was nice but the bathroom was great! 
We were to Ronnie’s jazz club SUPER 
Thank you at Andrea too 😉 muriel",5,2018,09,19
124,"A luxury hotel, fair price, great decor","What might seem a difficult hotel to stop and un-load luggage is made effortless by 3 porters arriving to help! The interior is wonderfully restored, the rooms very well appointed and the breakfast room / cafe a fully serviced experience.
The hotel will be changing to become a Kimpton and a full evening dinning room added. Currently there is more of a bistro style ""serf and turf"" restaurant.
Very good service from hotel staff",5,2018,09,17
124,Favorite hotel in London,"Perfect location and facilities and very warm staff. The building is extremely beautiful, inside and outside. I have been staying in this hotel since May 2018 in all my trips to London (5 so far and approximately 15 nights). Since the times of the soft launch, the services and facilities have been improving steadily, and now it is all outstanding. By far, my preferred hotel in London.",5,2018,09,17
124,REMARKABLE,"Look nowhere to stay. The Principal is brand new within a classic regal environment. Nothing to criticise. Staff were just AMAZING, from Walter [from Portugal] at the door, to Sean Borgesen at Concierge Desk. All of them professional and friendly.",5,2018,09,17
124,Lovely,"Lovely relaxing stay with first class service. Clean rooms and quiet. Beautiful building located close to restaurants, Transport services and a short walk to the British museum. However Traffic in the morning is quite built up.",5,2018,09,17
124,Fantastic stay in a beautiful new property!,"We were travelling for a special occassion, and from the moment we arrived, we were greeted and looked after by the wonderful staff. The building is listed and has a very grand interior that is impressive, but they have managed to also add very modern touches to the decor. Fitz's bar has a great vibe (we loved the twiglets touch - and very strong cocktails!) and the staff looking after us at breakfast were very warm and friendly. The room we had was beautiful and spotless - special mention to the Guest Relations team who made sure our stay was perfect from beginning to end. Very short stay but would absolutely return again.",5,2018,09,16
124,Amazing stay at an amazing hotel,"We stayed at The Principal for a weekend - first time for one of us in London. And all we can say is that we will definitely be back! 
It’s a beautiful old-looking hotel from the outside, but inside it’s just luxurious and our room was just wonderful! So big and comfortable, and the bed was really good
Everyone at the hotel treated us so well. Everyone from the concierges, Sean and Connor, who helped us with everything, to the staff at the cafe and the bar. Especially a big thanks to Patrick and Morten in the bar who made our night so special and treated us with the best cocktails ever tasted. 
We felt so special staying at this hotel, thanks to Juliana at the reception, who took really good care of us and made the experience a bit better with small treats in our room. 

All in all I can only recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a great place to stay in London. 
* If you go here, be sure to try the breakfast buffet in the cafe - all worth it!",5,2018,09,16
124,Impeccable!,"From the moment my wife and I arrived at the recently renovated Principal London Hotel we were impressed!

The exterior is so grand and captivating and the welcome with a smile from the guys at the door seemed to imply we were going to be looked after and looked after we were. Check in was with Richard who genuinely enjoys his job and was happy to smile and chat with us whilst checking in, he was a pleasure to liaise with. Our short journey to our room on the 1st floor was a pleasure too, there is clearly so much history in this building and it is so easy on the eye. Our room was cleverly furnished with a few mirrors to give the impression it was bigger than it actually was even though it was not a bad size anyway.  We had a couple of drinks at Fitz’s bar before we headed out of the hotel for dinner and this experience continued to offer us a story of the historic building, it was very very cool. We rose for breakfast around 10 am and headed down to a cool looking breakfast area where we had a good quality breakfast. When it came to checking out there was only one person at the desk whilst there was a queue forming but what impressed me was that one quickly became two then before you knew it, there were now four members of the very organised team behind the desk. Alex is the person that handled my check out and he completed the fantastic service journey we experienced... With ease! What a pleasure our stay was from start to finish and just as on the way in, when we headed out with our overnight stay luggage there was a very warm smile and greeting from the guy on the door 👊🏼 This is a hotel that we will definitely return to and stay again so needless to say I highly recommend this wonderful hotel and the team that come with it. Chalky x",5,2018,09,15
124,Now one of my favorite hotels,"I travel often for pleasure and for business. This is now my favorite hotel in the world. 

Walter (one of the porter's/doormen) made my life so simple each time I needed to step out of or return to the hotel. When I was in a bit of a rush to make my flight on the second day, he expertly timed requesting my cab as soon as he saw me checking out at the front desk from afar. He's very helpful and can offer great advice. His service is absolutely the #1 reason I will be back. I unfortunately can't remember the name of his colleague from the Czech Republic, who was also great. 

Alex at the front desk was always in a good mood, funny, friendly and thoughtful. I bugged the front desk who knows how many times when he was on duty. He made sure I knew where to go for my meals, had an idea of what I could do locally and in the hotel, etc.

The staff overall are courteous and were very accommodating. I enjoyed my stay so much that when my flight leaving London was cancelled and there were no same-day options left shy of 1,200 Euro, I decided to go back to the Principal for an additional night.

I stayed in a Standard Room (lovely decor - not a large room but very luxurious) on my first night. 

I stayed in a Single Room (similarly, lovely decor and amenities - only missing the clock radio and bath tub) on my second night. The Single Room is definitely small but perfect for a single traveler who just needs a place to store belongings and sleep comfortably. I love the neighborhood so I was delighted to go back.

Room service was great - I ordered at the front desk when I checked in. It was the middle of the night but it was still delivered to my room quickly. I had the buffet breakfast my first morning (lovely selection) and a la carte breakfast (pancakes) my second day. I regret not taking a picture of the buffet. It really was great. 

I think the prize here would actually be the beautiful common spaces, the fitness center, the cafe, the bar, etc. It's not a hotel where you are meant to retreat into your room and stay there for 20 hours. Be social and explore Bloomsbury! Or just go downstairs to see more beautiful architecture and smiling faces.",5,2018,09,15
124,Very nice stay with some room for improvement 3.5 stars,"I stayed for 6 nights at the Principal, the price was competitive due to the soft opening and this was justified as there was work still going on, elevator shafts being worked on etc.  I found the room ok but nothing special, after the first night I asked to be moved to a higher floor, and got the exact same room on a higher floor.  The bathrooms were small with little space to store your items.  There was turn down service on one of the 6 nights which I found odd.  The bar area is lovely and the wait staff in the bar were impeccable.  Breakfast was good, if a little uncoordinated, lots of servers just in need of some more direction.  I travel to London quite frequently, I think this is a very good option but when I compare it with other 5 star hotels I have stayed in in London, the rooms are not comparable.  If the price stays in the lower then of the 5 star price range then yes this is a very good option.",4,2018,09,14
124,Just wow,"This was our second visit back to the Principal. We love it here and is now one of our favorite hotels in London. The staff are so friendly and happy to help whenever they can.
We stayed in one of their beautiful corner suites and it really was beautiful. With its four poster bed, lounge area, roll top bath and double sinks and shower, it was just gorgeous.
We were staying for our anniversary and they really went out of their way to ensure we had a special stay, we had a free mini bar but on top of that they left us champagne and mini cakes in the room.
The bed was so comfy we didn't want to get out of it! 
The new restaurant had just opened too which is beautiful, this is still being worked on but they are planning an open air bit which is set to have a fire pit. As it is at the moment it is still amazing with indoor plants and a terrace with glass roof, they have done it really well.
Honestly we cant recommend this hotel enough and really hope to be back there soon. Thank you Principal for our amazing stay and for making our special occasion so wonderful.",5,2018,09,13
124,Excellent on all fronts,Our first visit to this hotel - truly 5 stars. Amazing room and one of the most comfortable beds I have ever slept on! We were upgraded to a junior suite and it was superb. This is also the quietest room I’ve ever slept in in London with absolutely no noise from outside or inside a hotel despite a big function! Staff have all been friendly and so efficient. Breakfast in Neptune delicious with many healthier options - so nice to have a la Carter rather than eat too much at a buffet! Dinner at Neptune good but I ordered crayfish and not told it was DIY on the menu - a lot of effort for small reward! Main courses good. Tables for two a little close together so not v private. Overall a fantastic hotel and look forward to returning.,5,2018,09,13
124,"Palm Court  - Afternoon Tea at The Principal London, 1-8 Russel Square","My friends and I went for an afternoon tea at the Palm Court of the hotel. It was an absolute joy. We loved every minute. The staffs were friendly from the beginning to the end, very helpful, efficient. The waiter (brazilian) asked about any allergies and special dietary, we tasted different teas and the food was delicious. 
I adored the interior design of the palm court, the details of the plates, the setup is charming. 
I would certainly recommend to my friends/family to come to the palm court for an afternoon tea and I can’t wait to come back.  
Thank you",5,2018,09,11
124,Palm court,"I recently visited the hotel to enjoy an afternoon tea at the Palm Court. Been receptioned by Umberto. He was absolutely kind and made us feel very welcome.
The food was delicious and its definitely the place to be at the hotel.
I highly recommend and will come back sometime soon.",5,2018,09,09
124,"Hotel very nice, rooms quite small, service...","The hotel is very nice in an amazingly restored building. How ever service is just ok and the rooms are quite small, they even fill smaller when you bring a baby on a trip like we did, three luggages, a lend baby crib from the hotel, my wife and I, is much more than this rooms can take, the rooms floors quick a lot and with a baby sleeping you don't want to move around much. It also appears like the staff don't even know there own hotel much, they assign a room to us which you had to walk a long hallway and then take some stairs to get to, trust me, with a baby trolley that ain't fun. I could also share with you that the cleaning staff just don't care if you run out off anything, because what ever we ran out off they never resupply on either of the 3 days we staid there, except the waters and milk they offer for coffee and tea.",3,2018,09,08
124,Couldn't recommend enough for dog owners,"From the moment we arrived to when we were walking out, the staff could not be more friendly, helpful and accommodating to our dog. The hotel is beautiful and room was perfect. Fully equipped with a welcome pack for both us and our frenchie.

Bar is great for evening cocktails and will definitely be visiting again!",5,2018,09,08
124,WONDERFUL HOTEL.BEST STAY EVER..,"Just returned home after staying in this fabulous hotel for three nights. 
From the time I arrived to the time I left I was so well looked after. All the staff made me most welcome and could not do enough to help me. Every member of staff I spoke to was very polite, curtious & always had a smile.
Bicanca from the front of house was simply the best. 
Thank you for my lovely get well card and magazines for my daughter signed by many staff such a lovely touch.
My room was cosy and comfortable and I felt very safe. I Loved the tuck box and little snacks such a welcome touch. 
I will be back to London for more  hospital trips and there is no doubt where I will he staying.
The Princapal you have got everything so very right, well done to you all.",5,2018,09,06
124,Just wonderful!,"I am going to gush a bit.  I think the Principal Hotel in London is one of the nicest hotels I have ever stayed in.  Not just elegant and comfortable but “nice” - warm, friendly, interested, responsive, helpful.  Genuinely kind people doing their work cheerfully.  I asked the concierge to do everything from find me a hair appointment on Sunday afternoon to loan me a couple of pounds for the taxi (the taxis’ credit card machine failed and I didn’t have enough cash).  All of it was granted with efficiency and good humor.  I love this place.  And look how beautiful.  Oh, the book in my room that I thought was a Bible - nope, Dracula by Bram Stoker.  What’s not to love, I ask you?",5,2018,09,05
124,Refined,"Beautifully designed and furnished, the rooms are impeccable. The service is friendly and helpful and the hotel has an elegant yet relaxed feeling. Go to Fitz's for a drink..! Afternoon tea at Palm Court and visit the nearby Home of John Soane, take a walk through Lincoln's barrister courts, then through temple and finally take a stroll along the Thames.",5,2018,09,05
124,The dog loved it - so did we!,"Our second overnight stay at The Principal confirmed our initial impressions of a really friendly hotel full of history and grand design without feeling pretentious. We were travelling with our small, well behaved, dog who was thoroughly welcomed and provided with her own bed and dog bowl, and looked after by dog loving staff who took her for an informal photo shoot whilst we were breakfasting!  We loved the setting and links to the glamour of the early 20th century and the Titanic, together with all the modern frills, including excellent wi-fi, thoughtfully located  sockets and USB ports, and large TV in the bedroom.  The park opposite the hotel was great for short doggy walks. Overall thoroughly relaxing, nice level of luxury and so friendly - The Principal is definitely our ""go to"" hotel for London visits.",5,2018,09,04
124,Nice and heart-warming service from all the staff.,"It was my graduation ceremony this Monday, so me and my parents stayed here for 3 days from 1/9 - 4/9. This place is really good that I would choose to stay here next time again. 
The staffs are really kind and helpful. The doorman Valter is really nice, he’s polite and humorous, and actively helping us with the luggages (which are pretty heavy lol).
Nice English breakfast. 
One thing surprised me is that, on the Monday morning I told the staff that I’m going out for my graduation ceremony, and when I come back at night I saw a celebration card and dessert on the table, that would be one of the most memorable part of the trip ;)",5,2018,09,04
124,Wonderful Stay,"We stayed here 17th - 19th August for 2 nights and had a wonderful time.  The hotel has been restored beautifully and looks great.

From the moment we were welcomed upon arrival from the doormen, check in, right up to check out we were both really impressed by the level of service and care showed to us by all the staff.

The room was great spacious and well designed.  Breakfast was superb and we ate it both in the Burr & Co and Neptune.

We will defiantly come back and the price was really good for such ac great and centrally located hotel.

Keep up the good work and thank you again.",5,2018,09,03
124,Amazing stay!!,I came here for 1 night at the end of August as a treat for my friends 40th bday. Prior to coming I had informed the hotel that it was a special occasion and when we arrived there was a lovely chocolate mousse cake in the room which was a lovely touch and made my friend feel special. I can’t fault this hotel or the staff they all seem to be very well trained and this showed when being quizzed about the design of the hotel as all questions were answered without hesitation. Also the staff are friendly and helpful and as somebody that enjoys hotel getaways I appreciated this and found this hotel to be one of the best I have stayed at in London so much so that I have another hotel booked in December but am seriously thinking about cancelling and booking at the principal because I enjoyed it so much. We had tea in the palm court which is really beautifully done and again the service was friendly but not intrusive. On a final note I have to mention that once we had checked out we had left our bags at the hotel to have a wonder around and when we came back to collect our bags we were asked by Andrea if we would like a bottle of water each to take with us for our journey which again was a nice touch and thoughtfully done. I think this could definitely become my new favourite London hotel. ,5,2018,09,03
124,Best hotel service and so much charm,"My friends and I stayed at the hotel at the weekend and we had such an unforgettable time. From the moment we checked-in we were made to feel welcome and comfortable. We made sure we made the most of all the elements, including a coffee in the beautiful new Palm Court, drink in Fitz's, dinner at Neptune and breakfast at Burr & co (with it's very own bloody Mary station!). Each venue felt like a new destination and all had so much character and sense of fun. 

This hotel really does deserve to be recognised as the hot new-opening in town, we really couldn't pick a flaw in our experience. I would thoroughly recommend staying here for either a luxury staycation or as the place to be in London during your travels! The central location makes it so easy to get anywhere in town, too. 

My highlights include: the interiors (WOW), the food at Neptune and cocktails in Fitz's.",5,2018,09,03
124,Brilliant,"Really fantastic service, great design, delicious food at both Neptune and Burr & Co. There is also a brilliant atrium covered space for drinks and snacks called Palm Court.Have already recommended to friends and family heading to London!",5,2018,09,03
124,The best ,"The best hotel in London.
Has comfortable beds,the room size are very spacious and the best staff, special mention for the doorman of the House ,his name is Valter and it's a wonderful person ,always kind and friendly and helpful.
 Has a good coffe and restaurant.
I stayed 20 days and everything in the hotel was the best. I'm definitely  coming back.",5,2018,09,03
124,Excellent,"Stayrd in July, prior to the Palm Court opening but the hotel otherwise was excellent. From first arrival at reception the staff were brilliant right through the hotel, extremely helpful but never intrusive. Stayed in a corner suite which was marvellous and the building itself is wonderful. The breakfast was great and the restaurant on the evenings also excellent. Well placed for sightseeing, not far from Kings Cross, a short walk to the British Museum. Not cheap of course but you get what you pay for and that holds true for this hotel. Will certainly be returning.",5,2018,09,02
124,Lovely stay here for in London for our Anniversary ,"Generally lovely - only negative is that the room sizes are quite small (even our ‘larger’ superior room), but the furnishings were very nice. 

Special mention to the bar which was really cool and busy (on a Thursday) which meant a lively atmosphere. 

And breakfast in the restaurant (we didn’t try the buffet which was served separately) was awesome...",5,2018,09,01
124,Amazing! ,"Simply amazing from the moment we were greeted until we left! Food was sublime. London prices are high obviously, but this is quite a treat. We would highly recommend a short stay here- a real taste of luxury. ",5,2018,08,31
124,One of the best trips ,"Recently Came here with my family, I  highly recommend staying in this hotel. Rooms are furnished nicely and clean. Staff is really helpful. And the doormen are really nice and welcoming, specially, Walter he made our stay even better. We’ll always go have a little chat with him on his shifts! He’s really helpful and nice. Was one of the best stays ever! ",5,2018,08,31
124,Stunning Hotel,"I haven't written a review on here for several years but felt that this hotel deserved a special mention.
I knew this hotel many years ago as The Russell Hotel and it has always been a very grand building which has now been sympathetically restored to it's former glory ..... well done , whoever did it!

This is a perfect hotel choice for central London, it seemed everywhere we wanted to go was within walking distance and the staff couldn't have been more helpful with suggestions and advice.
As it was a special occasion we booked a suite on the 6th floor and it certainly lived up to and exceeded our expectations. The spacious bathroom was one of the best we've seen and an excellent nights sleep proved how good the bed was and how quiet the room was considering we were in central London. The tuck box was a nice little extra touch.
The beautiful newly opened Palm Court was serving afternoon tea when we arrived which looked very civilised but time was against us so perhaps next visit. 
This hotel has just been completely refurbished to a very high standard and it is now probably our favourite for future London stays. 
Search ' Lucky George Dragon' for a bit of interesting history.",5,2018,08,31
124,Simply Outstanding..,"I was a little hesitant pulling the trigger on the this hotel, however, the minute my wife and I walked across the imposing and newly renovated hotel lobby to a genuinely friendly and  welcoming lady at the front reception desk I was instantly assured that we made the right choice.  When I was combing the net for a 5 star hotel in London, the Principal London rates were at almost half the rate of other comparable London hotels, which seemed a little dubious at the time, However, the reasonable rates was what ultimately influenced my decision to pick the Principal - and I am so glad I did.  Apparently, this late 19th century terracotta chateau was renovated at a cost of over $110 million and the interior design was commissioned to renowned London design firm, so I needn't detail how impressive the building exterior, interiors, and rooms are. 

The location was ideal from the standpoint of the proximity to several London attractions to the nearby trendy restaurants, cafes, and pubs - The one minute walk to the Underground station was the icing on the cake. 

I could talk for another ten paragraphs on how much we enjoyed staying at The Principal London, only, I'm going to spare you the tedious details. I will definitely stay there on my next trip to London and highly encourage anyone considering it to do so. 

Mr and Mrs Sabbak",5,2018,08,30
124,A perfect stay!,"The Principal is really what one can expect from a five star hotel and even more. Lovely rooms, delicious food, luxurious interior and always wonderful and super friendly staff. Especially the concierge at the Entrance called Walter is very kind, always open for a joke and helpful. He and the rest of the Principal Team made my stay just perfect.

Any time again!",5,2018,08,30
124,Wonderful hotel with character.,"Wonderful newly renovated hotel, small but very comfortable rooms, professional and helpful staff, great gym (for a hotel), breakfast a bit overpriced but good, nice restaurant and exquisite bar. Will come back asap.",5,2018,08,30
124,Fantastic hotel,"This totally refurbished hotel was amazing. The room was stylish and modern and the bathroom exquisite. The attention to detail was just devine, which even included a daily replenish tuck box! Breakfast was sheer joy. Prosecco for breakfast...yes please. It's central location meant walking was a treat instead of navigating the tube. A must go to hotel.",5,2018,08,29
124,Excellent refurbishment,"Wow! The refurbishment is excellent. I was only in London for the night, but could quite happily have stayed longer. The hotel has great history and is breathtaking. The rooms are luxurious and extremely comfortable. Breakfast was great and uncrowded.",5,2018,08,28
124,Perfectly done,"I’ve been eagerly waiting to visit this hotel since the refurb finished and it was definitely worth the wait. The furnishings are perfectly in tune with the building, the bedrooms are cosy, the bar has a great atmosphere and the breakfast was delicious! The staff were attentive and made us feel special, without being insincere. We’ll definitely be back. ",5,2018,08,28
124,Beautifully renovated hotel.,"Recently beautifully renovated, this hotel manages to be both old-school grand and new-school cool. We loved the distinctive character of the vaulted lobby / reception area, a mix of Lenin’s mausoleum and the main hall at Hogwarts. 
We stayed here only for one night. Our room (6th floor) was brand new, nicely furnished, but very small, even by London hotel standards. The bed was really comfortable and the bathroom nicely designed with excellent soaps / cosmetics. 
There were also a few glitches. The minbar was unbelievably loud, we had to unplug it to sleep. The (fixed) shower head was so low that it appeared to have been designed for hobbits (or perhaps house elves?). 

The room service breakfast is staggeringly, stupidly expensive. A full english breakfast costs 32 pounds. The same thing is available at the (excellent) 49 cafe 100 meters away for 5 (yes, five) pounds.

Our highlight was the cocktail bar - full of character, with a great live band, fantastic service and excellent drinks, we could have (and perhaps should have) spent all night there.

Overall, service was very friendly yet professional and efficient. This could be a really great hotel, but for the money (250 GBP/ night, even as a special offer) you expect things to be perfect. Definitely stop by for cocktails though.",4,2018,08,27
124,Near the British Museum,"Received a warm welcome from Andrea and enjoyed my stay at the beautiful hotel. Breakfast was also excellent at the  Neptune Restaurant (ala carte).

I like the fact that the hotel is close to the British Museum (7 mins walk) and a metro  that's just at the corner of the hotel. Hope to be back. ",5,2018,08,26
124,Setting the standard,"One of the rare stays where just about everything was perfect.
The only negative thing I have to say is that the room was actually too small to fit the ironing board and leave room for actual ironing.
On the upside:

Great location
Awesome building, outside and inside
Great service
Great breakfast

From entering the building to getting the keycard in hand was about 4 minutes which is more than excellent.
Staff promptly provided free power adapter for loan on request.

The ""tuckbox"" with some complimentary snacks was a nice surprise. Complimentary still and sparkling water in fridge.",5,2018,08,25
124,"Loved it,","Best hotel experience in London, i dont know how they pick or train their staff, but they have been extremely successful. I have never experienced such welcoming, helpful, polite and «happy» staff in this size hotel. It is a big hotel, but they manage to make it personal anyway.  We did not meet anyone that wasnt doing their job in a very good manner.  The Cumberland could learn a lot from how they deal with breakfast serving for example. Very tasteful decorated rooms and bathrooms. And its CLEAN! Good job ladies.  Loved the bar as well - wish we could have stayed longer.  Coming back soon....",5,2018,08,24
124,Brilliant,"Absolute luxury in a wonderfully restored building.  Couldn’t recommend more highly - from the highly professional check in to the quality room fit out and very attentive staff generally. 

Great location too. 

Can’t wait to check back in. ",5,2018,08,24
124,A lovely stay!,"Really enjoyed my stay at The Principal London - amazing interior, comfortable room, great location + really friendly staff! So much to do without even leaving the hotel - great bars, restaurants, cafes all accessible from inside the hotel. Didn't have a chance to check out the gym, a pool would be nice. Would love to return.",5,2018,08,24
124,Awesome stay at The Principal,"“I’ve booked this hotel to celebrate my first wedding anniversary and wow what a treat it was !!! I don’t have enough great words to say about this amazing hotel. The refurbished hotel has been beautifully decorated and the wonderful period features have been what looks to be a pain stacking restoration . Our room was wonderful . To our surprise we received a complimentary upgrade. And the room was so lush, beautiful, and the beds ...... omg so comfortable which makes you stay in bed the whole day . The staff were super friendly from the moment we entered the doors , the breakfast staff .....I mean everyone made us so welcome . And also we received such a wonderful surprise, we received an invitation to try the extremely beautiful Palm court for the afternoon tea (we didn’t expect this at all) . This was a really wonderful experience. The afternoon tea was wonderful, tasty ...... we were really sad that we had to leave the next day as we were having such a wonderful time . Rest assured we will definitely return hopefully very soon . If not we plan to come and celebrate our anniversary every year here at this wonderful hotel . “",5,2018,08,23
124,"Magnificent, but....","As a regular user of the Russell over many years I have eagerly awaited the hotel's reopening. The refurbishment is quite magnificent, revealing superb details hidden for years, showing this off as the splendid hotel is really is: ten out of ten, no question. This applies also to the room, with top-notch bathroom fittings, and the reception staff were charming. What a shame, though, about the breakfast. The old Russell may have been tired but one thing that set it apart was its buffet breakfast: one of the best English breakfasts available. What was provided in Burr & Co was such a disappointment by comparison: a limited range, lukewarm and served on cold plates, simply not even a shadow of the old breakfast. To be fair, the Neptune restaurant was just about to open. Maybe breakfast has now been moved there and maybe it will be better. I desperately hope so. Everything else about the hotel was so good that I want to make it once again my regular hotel when in London, but it will take the reinstatement of a good English breakfast to make me do so.",4,2018,08,22
124,Perfect stay,"Conveniently located in a nice neighborhood, this hotel provided me everything. We are staying in this hotel for a 10 day vacation, it is already the 4th day. Perfect hotel overall. Nice decoration, very clean, nice personnel, classic as needed, modern touch in all details. 

Incredibly nice guest relations. When we checked in to our room, we have found toys and candy for the kids. They continued nice surprises the next day as well, a book and a full tuck box. 

It deserves a 5-star rating. Strongly recommended. ",5,2018,08,21
124,YOUR SEARCH STOPS HERE!,"From the second you lay eyes on the outside of the building, you know you are looking at a piece of history .The architecure is stunning. We were IMMEDIATELY greeted by the doorman even though we were across the street. He trotted over and stopped traffic for us as if they were phones by the US embassy and were awaited our arrival for days. It was very flattering. ""Hello, I am Walter, the doorman. Please go inside and get settled as I take care of your luggage"", he said. It was very comforting to be welcomed like that. Once we stepped inside we were blown away by the ambiance. I happen to be a self-proclaimed interior designer of sorts and I must say this was like nothing I have ever seen before. The combination of vintage and modern was unsurpassed and offered a cool, eclectic and warm vibe that should resonates with both older and younger generations alike. They recently underwent a massive renovation which took over 3 years and it shines through in every single place you look. They have 2 restaurants, a cafe (morning breakfast spot), and a bar. Each one of these are so eloquently designed and so much detail was put into their themes and decor that they could each individually be featured in a deigns magazine (if they haven't already). You probably think I'm over reacting about the decor, but it says a lot about a hotel when you pay that much attention to detail. 

Check in was a breeze. Once we got to our room which was also decorated wonderfully and we noticed that there was really nowhere for us to unpack our clothes. I am one of those people who needs everything laid out, especially when I'm with the kids (9 & 11) in another country for 9 days. In the morning, as I was opening the one and only drawer in our room, the dresser fell on top of my foot. It was a fairly small dresser but quite heavy for a toe. Needless to say, I screamed loudly and woke everyone up. I decided to wait until we were headed for breakfast to speak to the manager, rather than call. I did. She was great. She upgraded us to a suite with a connecting room for a discounted price. We were fine with that option. The suite was OUT OF THIS WORLD. It had his and her closets and a small den with a TV. Loved it! 

Every morning our breakfast was included and this was no ordinary breakfast buffet. It had lots of healthy options including overnight oats, selection of cheese, juices, eggs any way you please etc. It even included all types of lattes and or treats. Simply wonderful. We ate breakfast there every day because we wanted to get the most out of our days. It was a time saver as well. All the servers in the restaurant came to know my kids pretty well and by day 3 hugs were part of the morning greeting. 

Every day they included chips, candy, chocolate, water unlimited in your room. HOW GREAT IS THAT??? C'mon!

They leave cute little weather updates on your mattress and even a stuffed teddy and a rubber ducky for the kids! 

I'm not embarrassed to say that my husband and I are snobs when it comes to mattresses and pillows. We own the most luxurious mattress known to man and even though we don't usually complain about it, our hotel stays normally end with neck pain. These mattresses were DIVINE!!!! Not one complaint. You will see for yourself...

On day 5, we had an issue with something so minor that it's almost not even worth mentioning, if not for the hospitality we received because of it. Small internet issue and not only did they fix it upon complaint, but they credited me a nights stay. Who does this? THEY DO!! lol

We ordered room service on several occasions and the food was SUPERB!!! I promise you that every single thing we ordered was way above average. I don't really eat sweets nor do I care for ice cream, but if you know whats best for you, then order one cheesecake and one sundae and get back to me. It's unlike anything I have ever had and even my teenage phoned me from her room to express her deeply profound love for the dessert. DO IT! 

We visited all of the restaurants and each one was magnificent. I could go into detail but I feel like I am rambling already so I'll just say that they were all wonderful and special in their own way. We had tea time at the newest one (can't remember the name) and it was perfect. We had late night drinks at the bar which had a live band that sounded like they were straight out of New Orleans. It was perfect as well. We even made friends with one of the servers...and we aren't very social people these days.

On our last night, we returned to find an odd gift in our room. It was special cookies made just for our kids. They personalized them!!!!! Can you believe that? They actually found a couple of slap bracelets in their room and copied them onto cookies! SUPERHERO COOKIES especially for my kids!@$$^??!! Are you serious? How cute is that?

I would like to especially thank Walter and Maria. They took the time to make sure our stay was simply perfect. Walter spent every single morning speaking with my kids about London, suggestions for the day, and life! He also was on hugging terms with my little one by day 3. We wish you all the best with your acting career! Don't forget the little people when you make it to Broadway! xoxo

Oh, I almost forgot...LOCATION! This hotel could not be more centrally located. It is within walking distance to so many of the places that you will want to visit and a short cab to the destinations you will want to see both east and west. Its literally right in the center. It is away from the hustle and bustle by at least 2 blocks so I felt very safe as well. Right across the street to the west, is the stop for the hop-on hop-off bus. You can jump on that within 30 seconds. Its MAGICAL!

I can go on and on about this place, but instead I will leave you with this...I never leave reviews and I just wrote you a book. Stop searching, book your room. YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT!",5,2018,08,21
124,"Beautiful building, not the greatest hotel","We made the mistake of reading reviews before we stayed so we were built up for an amazing stay.  It was not amazing - it was okay.  Food was awful, staff weren't well trained, our room was small (and stuffy - I guess we went during a heatwave but still) and they did not make a fuss of our daughter (which was the biggest disappointment for all of us).  Our expectations were high (our mistake) and the only expectation that was met was the beautiful building and the gorgeous décor.  Oh and it is not finished yet so no gym, business center, lounge area...  My husband went down to get a beer while I was packing.  The bar was closed for a private event so he went to the coffee / tea shop for a beer.  He got a beer and had the entire staff stared at him, waiting for him to finish.  They then closed up.  He came back to the room as there was nowhere available for him to relax and have a drink.  They didn't even offer to serve him another beer that he could enjoy it in the lobby!  I could really get into the nitty gritty things but all-in-all, it is an okay hotel, a little pricey for what you get (we thought we were getting a deal) and in an amazing location (speaking of location - there is a shopping center behind it with plenty of dining options and most do lovely breakfasts for a decent price).  Maybe when it is fully open, the staff is properly trained, the food improves and the hotel delivers on what they advertise, it'll be worth another go...  Maybe...",3,2018,08,20
124,Lovely Hotel,"Excellent location, incredibly comfortable beds and impeccable service. 
The rooms are bigger than average and very clean and modern.
We did not dine in the restaurant  but the atmosphere appeared lovely. The same in the cocktail bar. 
Would stay here again.",5,2018,08,20
124,Our 1st trip to London,"Our family of 4 (my wife & I, and our sons age 17 and 21) had a recent, tremendous trip to London in mid-August of 2018. We made a great decision to the stay at the Principal London hotel. This is a beautiful, 5-star property with a 5-star staff. The concierge team, led by Colin McDowell, was incredibly helpful and insightful. The location is incredibly ideal. I would absolutely recommend this property.",5,2018,08,19
124,Great city break - fantastic service,"We stayed last night in one of the larger suites. Beautifully designed, comfy beds, great light settings. I particularly liked the DAB radio which I had on whilst in the bubble bath. We had a lovely powder room in the suite near the entrance and a main bathroom near the bedroom. Fantastic!

Upon entrance to the hotel, we were greeted by friendly staff and the public relations manager. Our room has a welcome tray with fresh cakes from the kitchen and a hand written note.

It was amazing and didn’t feel like we were in the middle of busy London!!! Really relaxing, a great getaway!

The only downside was the breakfast bar Burr & Co (?) quality of food was ok, acoustics was bad and big gusts of wind came through from the entrance door. The design was very casual, unlike the elegance of the rest of the hotel (Designed by Tara Bernerd and Partners - great work!) 

The service was fantastic at both the breakfast bar and the rest of the Principal hotel team! Well done!! We were really impressed with the coffee at the breakfast bar too!

Thank you for a fantastic stay! Housekeeping staff Libor (?) did a great job of welcoming us into our suite and explained where everything was.",5,2018,08,19
124,Simply amazing,Stayed here for our birthday celebrations. On arrival we were upgraded to a suite which was the size of a London flat. We went out to the theatre on the first night and on our return we found birthday balloons in our room. The service is second to none and without doubt the nicest hotel I have ever stayed in.  We had an a la carte breakfast which was just delicious. All members of staff I encountered were polite and engaging and went above and beyond to make sure our stay was enjoyable. Could not fault our stay at all! Will definitely stay here again.,5,2018,08,18
124,"Very cool hotel, good location, nice rooms","Stayed with the family. Hotel looks like a castle. The lobby is slick and the first four floors are laid out with marble. Of course the kids had to use the stairs because they wanted to rub george the dragon's head - which is a replica of the dragon on the Titanic.  This is because the hotel was designed by the guy who designed the Titanic's ballroom.  We liked the cafe which is connected to the hotel. Super friendly team (with a special call out to the Italian hostess and the Scottish bartender!).  Cool place to hang out.  There is a more formal lounge bar which is also nice and a restaurant.  Room was large for London, beds comfortable - all great.  Hotel is in a great location right across the street from a park and tons of restaurants in walking distance.   

One half negative and one negative - we traveled lite so my wife sent down the kids socks, underwear and tshirts to get washed.  It came back at 320 pounds which is ridiculous.  Shame on us for not reading the prices but the next day she went a block down the street with twice as much laundry and they delivered it for 20 pounds.  The hotel team really didnt care.  I thought it was BS.  The other disappointing experience was the concierge giving us two bits of info that were out of date.  The tube they sent us to was closed for the weekend and the bus they sent us to didnt run on saturdays so we missed our tour.  Very nice team but you should double check the info.  Minus these two things and the place is a 5 star.  

All in all great place that is still working out a few kinks after reopening.",4,2018,08,17
124,Loved it!,"I stayed here some years ago and back then this lovely old building was looking very tired, especially compared to the other great hotels in London. Well that’s all changed. The beauty of this amazing old building has been carefully restored, whilst installing all the mod cons that you could wish for in a luxury hotel – it is breath-taking!
The welcome we received was excellent – young, enthusiastic and well-trained staff. Free water, a quick check-in and very nice bedroom. Unfortunately, my request for no interconnecting door was missed, but they handled my disappointment well.
Despite double glazing, there’s still a fair amount of road noise from the road outside – maybe a high floor or a room on the other side would help?
The various restaurants and public areas are all beautiful and the food very good. Well worth a stay.",5,2018,08,13
124,A great hotel.....,"I have just returned from my second stay at the Principal.  I was in London for work and got a great deal on a Single Club Room - a small yet perfectly adequate room for a single traveller with an amazingly comfortable 3/4 bed.  This is an amazing hotel, chic, well refurbished and classy.  My only niggle is breakfast - which is served in a cafe like restaurant on the ground floor.  In my view it is out of keeping with the elegance of the rest of the hotel and the concept is not quite right.  It was very busy during my stay and the ambiance didn’t lead to a very relaxing breakfast most days.  The bar, on the other hand is amazing serving the best Negroni cocktails I have ever drank.  I will be back.....",4,2018,08,12
124,opulent hotel but with friendly staff and casual vibe,"stayed at this hotel for one night with my husband who had booked it as a surprise. we had tickets booked for the summer screen at somerset house and the hotel was situated perfectly between our train station and somerset house. this hotel is so stunning inside. every detail has been thought of. the staff are also wonderfully friendly and make the hotel feel casual and modern. we didnt spend much time in the hotel as we had made other plans but i would have loved to have visited fitz's bar and unfortunately the palm court seemed to be closed but we had a delicious breakfast in neptunes bar and also had snacks in the burr&co coffee shop which had a really young casual vibe. 
room was small but had everything we needed and obviously had same level of attention as the rest of the hotel. i especially loved the plug socket built into the full length mirror.so many hotels never have a socket near a mirror.how do they expect ladies to dry/style their hair? problem solved here!! super comfy bed too and really quiet.we were on fourth floor at back of the hotel.",5,2018,08,12
124,The Pleasure Principal,"What an absolutely fantastic hotel! From the first moment we walked through the doors we were treated like valued and important customers by an unfailingly polite and friendly team. Although we were early, our room was ready and we were lucky to be upgraded, which was a lovely surprise. On entering the room however, we soon realised that the power was not working, but a genial member of the maintenance  team soon had us back on the grid. The duty manager (sorry forgot her name) was excellent ensuring that all was well and certainly went the extra mile to ensure that we were happy. The room, on the third floor was vast with views over Russell Square and top-end fixtures and fittings. The overall finish is superb and the interiors are all tastefully finished in a contemporary style with a nod towards the hotels history and architectural features. We had drinks in Fitz's bar which again were staffed by the most attentive waiters and drinks were reasonably priced. Sadly, we'd pre-booked a meal in the West End, but would have loved to sample the food in the urban-chic Neptune restaurant. Palm Court is an opulent space for afternoon teas and cocktails whist Burr is a relaxed coffee shop serving breakfast and lunches in a light-filled airy setting. I genuinely cannot find fault with the hotel and we are already fans of the brand having stayed and booked again to visit the Principal in York . Massive thanks and congratulations to a great team providing five star service.",5,2018,08,11
124,A truly special stay,"We booked The Principle for my partners 30th birthday, staying one night (9/08) to access London, mainly West-End. We stayed in a standard guest room. From the moment we arrived, until the moment we left we were made to feel special by the wonderful staff. 

The hotel was beautiful, the standard room comfortable and the bed just amazing.The decor and ambience of the hotel was first class, a lovely coffee and snack at Burr & Co, watching the world go by whilst it rained!
Fitz cocktails, complimentary before the theatre were gorgeous and a special touch for our birthday stay. Palm Court looks beautiful, for afternoon tea or even better, make use of the 'Gin trolly' that looks divine. Breakfast at Neptune, was probably the best we ever had.

The staff generous and attentive and without fault.
Thanks you for making us feel so welcome, and for letting me spoil my partner for her birthday.

Don't doubt the 5 star reviews. Spot on and fully earned.",5,2018,08,11
124,Lovely stay and great location,"Spent 4 nights here in late July 2018. Single room at very fair price ($250 a night with all taxes etc). Room small but well thought out and suited my needs. (Just wish the bedcover went more than halfway so I wasn't always sitting on the linens.) 

Hotel recently opened after 3-year renovation; public areas are stunning and offer comfy chairs and sofas for sitting. Only negative I found was my room was right above the bar which hosted a private party one evening so very loud music until 11pm. No one answered front desk when I called to ask what the noise was. For that reason, take a higher floor!

Location excellent. Tube station (Piccadilly line) around the corner and British Museum just on the other side of Russell Square. About a mile straight walk to St Martins Church/Portrait gallery/Trafalgar Square. Russell Square is a pleasant spot for sitting and has a very nice cafe for coffee or drinks or a quick meal. 

Did not try the hotel breakfast, but Burr & Co off the lobby is perfect for coffee/tea/pastry and later in the day is a wine/light meal stop. Neptune restaurant pricey but excellent food. Attentive staff in both spots.",5,2018,08,10
124,Afternoon Tea at The Principal,"I am a person who adores food and usually find Afternoon Teas a thing for the tourist only; however, on this occasion, it actually exceeded my expectations. 
My first impressions were about how beautiful the building and settings are.
The staff greeted me in a very warm and professional way and service was outstanding; a great thanks to the training team.
As far as the food was concerned, I was impressed by the quality and options of cakes and scones; so many choices.
The tea selection is also quite good and the glass of Taittinger, a perfect compliment.
The whole experience was terrific and I would like to comment on the professionalism and knowledge of the our lovely waiter, Cristiano, who not only provided us with a warm service but also helped one of our guests who could not speak English, so his language skills was essential, thank you Cristiano.",5,2018,08,09
124,Two night stay,"I stayed at this Hotel for two nights. I was alone and expected a reduction in double room rate which I usually receive in hotels. In their email reply to my comments, I was advised that single rooms are available but I had seen this on their website and the single bed looked like a sofa bed.
My room was quite nice but not very big for the money and the scale of the building. It was quiet being away from Russell Square. 
The TV showed incorrect weather information. So inaccurate that I thought they were being funny.
I was looking forward to the tuck box but was bitterly disappointed...it contained some sachets of tea and nescafe, a small kitkat and two packets of crisps. There was fresh milk in the fridge which is always nice.
Guests had received apparently a discount because the hotel was re-launching after renovation. However, the renovations were still underway and the Palm Court hadn't opened. 
The bar staff were excellent when I met with my group of family who were staying in the hotel too.
I left my room about 10am and  returned to my room about 4pm and found itl not made up.
All in all for what they charge , this hotel should have been perfect but I was very disappointed.",2,2018,08,09
124,Excellent hotel. ,"We had an excellent long weekend here.  The building has been restored beautifully, our room was nicely decorated and furnished and well equipped and the staff were friendly, accommodating and charming.   The Hotel is well placed for walking in London.  Thoroughly recommended.  ",5,2018,08,09
124,What a find,"This beautifully restored hotel made for the perfect London visit. Only staying 3 nights we didn't get a chance to experience everything the hotel had to offer but we were very impressed with what we did see. We had a deluxe room overlooking russell square which was perfectly sized. I would certainly recommend trying to get a higher room so you can see over the square. The staff were excellent, willing to cater to your every need. The location of the hotel was ideal. Right next to a tube station and only 10 minutes walk from Pancras international.",5,2018,08,09
124,"Outstanding Staff, Central Location, Highly Recommended","Hats off to everyone at the Principal!  Every staff member we met, without exception, was friendly, engaged, and helpful! We booked two rooms; both were very nicely appointed, very clean, and very comfortable. We did not dine in the hotel restaurant, but Burr and Co. offered a perfect cup of coffee and a delicious array of pastries, sandwiches, and salads throughout the day. With the hotel’s central location off Russell Square, it is an ideal base for catching the Underground to anywhere in London.  All in all, The Principal was perfect for our visit to London.  We highly recommend this hotel to everyone!",5,2018,08,08
124,Breath taking building with history,"Loved this hotel...the entrance was exceptionally beautiful with a spectacular  staircase. The hallways were large, impeccably decorated with gorgeous well placed mirrors...the room was beautiful with high ceilings a comfortable bed and all the amenities one could need.  The shower was exceptional. Now about th staff, everyone was friendly, welcoming and was pleasant to deal with. We got to London early and made our way to the hotel after our night flight, even though we were extremely early for the check in they accomadated us as quickly as possible, allowing us to rest and get out andenjoy the city. The cafe in the hotel served excellent coffee and scrumptious treats...hotel comes highly recommeded...also excellent location with the tube being steps away from this hotel",5,2018,08,07
124,Beautiful hotel + friendly staff + operational challenges = great potential,"The Principal is a beautifully renovated hotel that has succeeded in recruiting some of the friendliest staff I've ever encountered. It has ""5/5"" potential if it can resolve its often-chaotic operational and customer-service procedures. For example, I needed an extra bed for my son, but had to call repeatedly to get it; when we extended our stay, the rate quoted orally by the front-desk staff member was 30 pounds less than the one on the bill; the room was only partially cleaned one day, with cleaning supplies left behind and forgotten; the wi-fi didn't quite reach our corner room, requiring me to sit in the hall to check email. Fortunately, most problems were cheerfully resolved, usually after a lot of explaining. This is a place with impressive assets and great potential.",4,2018,08,06
124,Blooming Brilliant in Bloomsbury,"Went to London for a reunion with mates from Australia. It is very easy to see why this is the new exciting area in London and why this hotel has reset the standards for 5 Star hotels. 
Where to start? When I was living in London it was evident this area had been crying out for a good hotel and this delivers in bucket loads. Best location with easy walking distance to Convent Garden, Oxford Street and the fab new bars and restaurants in the revamped Kings Cross area. Super easy to get to the rest of the city and from Heathrow just jump on the Piccadily line and it delivers you to the doorstep at Russell Sq Tube station. 
Apparently this was once a very famous hotel 100 years ago but declined into a kennel from neglect. The place has been given a head to toe reboot but instead of going down the""restoration"" rabbit hole it has been really clever by keeping the original features but adding a contemporary high luxe aesthetic. 
Each restaurant and bar has its own style and character. We had a look at the restaurant but didn't eat there. It looked like a chic early 70s vibe. We went to Granger & co nearby, seeing as we were all Australians. 
The cafe is an open and easy space that has a great local feel and a very yummy and healthy breakfast.
The room was ridiculous. Both me and my companion had similar rooms when we compared. Open plan junior suite with high ceilings and views out over the park opposite.  Beautiful, tasteful residential decor. Big, bright bathroom with a stand alone tub. Four Poster bed I found it difficult to leave.
I stayed at The Ned late last year which was equally impressive in the over all experience but this room felt more spacous, comfortable and homely. I visit London usually once a month I'll definitely be back.",5,2018,08,06
124,"Convenient, Friendly, Comfortable!","What a brilliant place to stay! We were here for five nights and had lovely stay. The hotel was recently refurbished, so everything is clean and bright. There was still work going on the upper floors, but you wouldn't know it as it was kept separate from the guests. The staff are all so helpful and friendly, service excellent and the rooms are kept neat and tidy. This may sound like and advert for the hotel, but we really did have a great stay and can't praise it enough - definitely be coming back.",5,2018,08,05
124,Wonderful place with a couple of teething problems,"The people are as nice as one can imagine. Friendly, helpful and smiling. The room was immaculate and the add ons were all there. That said it was definitely the smallest room I have ever stayed in. There was nowhere to move around at all. It had no fridge or minibar or coffee machine. Since I was only in town for 18 hours it didn't make a big difference but any longer than that could have been disastrous. The concierge was helpful but sent me to what he wanted and not what I had asked for. Also they seem to be in love with apps and insisted on using them to get a cab instead of just hailing one, which would have been cheaper and quicker. Overall this has amazing potential with just a few teething problems that need to be addressed",4,2018,08,05
124,Amazing Hotel in fantastic central location,"We stayed three nights in this fabulous hotel which we have stayed at prior to its refurbishment- Wow, wow, wow. Absolutely fabulous. All the staff were amazing, so friendly and helpful. The refurbishment was stunning. We were allocate as a junior suite which was beautifully decorated and had a sumptuous four poster bed. The bed was very comfortable and we had a fantastic sleep. We were very impressed with the senate walk in shower in the bathroom which had a drench shower as well as a seat and the shower was one of the best we ha e ever experienced. We enjoyed breakfast in both Burr & co and Neptune’s. These were both fantastic, different styles so good to experience both. Again the staff were amazing. The Palm Court lounge was not open, however we had a sneaky look and it looks incredible and will definitely be very popular once it opens. We would not hesitate in recommending this hotel to fellow travellers - it will not disappoint.",5,2018,08,04
124,First class stay,"We had a great time at The Principal when we were there in July. The building itself is an absolute beauty, inside and out. The staff was welcoming and friendly - and up for a pleasant chat, as well - a small intangible, but the sort of thing that sets establishments like The Principal apart from the rest.

Only had a chance to check out Burr & Co for an afternoon refreshment, so can't comment on the rest of the facilities - but can recommend Burr & Co's house lager. :) As for our room, our Junior Suite was perfectly designed and equipped – and was larger than my first apartment. Our only regret is that our stay wasn't longer!",5,2018,08,04
124,On transit!,We stopped there for a day on our way to Paris had a great time. The hotel is close to all major attractions and within walking distance to St Pancras International which was very handy for us. The building itself has a rich history and it has been beautifully restored with all the modern day amenities. ,5,2018,08,02
124,Amazing new “Midtown” hotel,"I stayed at the recently renovated Principal London Hotel and I was made to feel at home from the very beginning. The welcome from the doorman and bell team really set the tone. The check in was seamless and professional. 

I dined at Neptune on the first evening and the oysters were simply amazing! The other evenings I put my trust in the concierge team’s recommendations and they were spot on every time! 

I very much look forward to coming back to the Principal for my birthday in January.",5,2018,07,31
124,Fabulous modernised hotel ,"Had a great one night stay here , room was lovely and immaculately clean , the bar is awesome , great staff and drinks , breakfast was delicious !! Although recently just opened all staff seemed to be fully aware of the surroundings , and I have to say the hotel was extremely clean and beautifully decorated. Also a great location , tube station round the corner and if you fancy a pint there are a few pubs around,
Thoroughly recommended ",5,2018,07,31
124,Fabulous stay in a beautiful hotel!,"The Principal far exceeded our expectations.  From the moment we walked through the front doors the staff was friendly, courteous and helpful. Alex at the front desk went above and beyond.  We stayed in a lovely and spacious suite.  The pictures do not do it justice, but I took a few just so other travelers can see. The room is well stocked with anything you would need while staying in a hotel.  We ordered room service for breakfast and it was promptly delivered at the desired time.  
I can not say enough good things about this hotel, don’t miss it if you are planning a trip to London.  ",5,2018,07,31
124,The New Russell.,"The London Principal, located overlooking Russell Square in Bloomsbury, has just about completed a 2 years plus major renovation. It was formerly known as the Hotel Russell and was built in 1898. The hotel has a long, celebrated history and I have stayed there numerous times over the last dozen years or so. Returning for the first time after the hotel reopened in April was a revelation. I was not sure how the new hotel would preserve the character of the old with all of its amazing architectural treasures. There is still work to be done. The Palm Court has not opened yet and floors 7 and 8 are closed and two lifts remain unfinished. During the day, the noise of construction is evident. This will, of course, pass. We stayed in a Signature Suite via an upgrade offered by the management. It was outstanding. More than once , when dropping us off at the hotel, taxi drivers asked what it was like inside and also mentioned that it was the best looking hotel in London...quite an endorsement. I replied that the inside was as good as the outside and that the Principal provides a text book case on how to bring a classic into the 21st century with flying colours. It's a shame that the old name, whose initials are still visible in terracotta on the buildings exterior, could not be retained. The gas lamps around the perimeter were a surprising plus. Fitz's Bar, the Neptune Restaurant, and the coffee shop were all good. The breakfast offering could have been better service wise but this will no doubt improve as the new staff develops and the hotel reaches its stride. I feel confident that this ""new"" hotel will quickly  claim a place as one of the top destinations in London. I will be back.",4,2018,07,29
124,Five star stunning hotel!,"This is just a fabulous hotel, with a wow-atmosphere and interior and decor. It just has to be experienced. To me, it is also special because it is the hotel from TS Eliot's ""Cats"", which I am a great fan of. Friendly doormen, reception and staff. Our room was lovely, nice and comfy beds, always clean - and the floor was quiet, slept well. Everything was just perfect, including the location - just a 5-10 min walk to Tottenham Court Road and Oxford Street. Will definitely come back (when I can afford)!",5,2018,07,29
124,Your search stops here. This is the one.,"We stayed at The Principal last week for three nights. What a hotel - restored beautifully, such great detail and staffed with people who truly care for guests and clearly love their hotel.

We took the Piccadilly line from Heathrow to Russell Sq, the hotel is minutes from the tube and a short 10 minutes walk to Covent Garden, Soho and the British Museum is across the square. Without exception all the staff were welcoming, genuine and professional - they love what they do and we felt so well cared for at every turn. Our room was perfect with the most comfortable bed and linens, a bright bathroom with a fantastic shower and the room had lots of guest friendly touches. And so quiet for a London hotel.

We enjoyed great cocktails in Fitzs - what a classy bar with class service and had dinner on our last night in Neptune - decadent and delicious. A great hotel and one we will be returning to in October.",5,2018,07,29
124,New hotel with a WOW factor,"I took my wife to this beautiful hotel for a surprise anniversary weekend and from the time we walked in we were blown away by the stunning feel of the hotel. The doormen and reception staff are so friendly and yet very professional and made us feel very welcome.

The interior of the hotel was so beautiful with marble pillars, stairs and walls. It was a real wow experience.

Everything about our room was so tastefully done and even down to the little tuck box of goodies they give you made us love our room.

We went to the bar, Fitz’s, which was probably the best bar I have been to in London. The service was great, the lighting and decor were beautiful and the cocktails were to die for.

We had dinner in Neptune, a stunning restaurant. Dinner was delicious and so was the wine. It had a really cool vibe to it with great music and the staff seemed to be very happy.

Next morning, we did a walk around the hotel and had a peep into Palm Court, a beautiful glass roofed atrium in the centre of the hotel which the staff told us is for Afternoon Tea service, It’s due to open in 2 weeks so we can’t wait to go back for that.

All in all, a delightful experience. My wife was really happy and we both had a fab weekend.

We will be back again very soon.",5,2018,07,29
124,First Class,"Stayed here last night with my wife as we attended a dinner nearby. The hotel is billed as a 5* and we were certainly not disappointed. We received excellent service in every facet of our stay, credit to their team, we were looked after from beginning to end with a very friendly but professional manner.

Our room was very pleasant. Nicely appointed, spotlessly clean and a great bathroom with a really good shower. It was also very quiet which helps when trying to relax and sleep. The beds are certainly among the most comfortable I’ve slept in so we both had a great night sleep.

Breakfast was perfect. The chap on the eggs station cooked up some perfect poached eggs! The rest of the breakfast was comprised of excellent quality produce, a rarity these days with accountants running the world. Breakfast was included in our room rate but even at its non resident rate, would still represent good value for money. The service in the restaurant was friendly, quick and efficient.

I will stay here again when I am in town but will also recommend the Principal to my friends, colleagues and family.",5,2018,07,29
124,Stunning Place,"I stayed one night at Principal in the begging of July and absolutely loved it! Service was amazing and food absolutely delicious! Bedrooms are very nicely decorated and spotlessly cleaned. It’s a shame that I have only been there for one evening as did not have a chance to experience every dining option. Can’t wait to return for an afternoon tea in new opened Palm Court, which sadly was not finished while I was staying! ",5,2018,07,28
124,Excellent ,"Still doing alittle work on the 6/7th floor, but if your out all day this wont inconvenience you. Has had a fist full of money frown at it and it looks really good, rooms are smart and very clean, people are very friendly and efficient, breakfast was excellent, definitely be staying there again in the future",5,2018,07,28
124,Long weekend break ,What a lovely hotel from minute you arrive at the main entrance greeted always by a very friendly door men arrived early and was able to check in and Hotel kept bags and took to room once it was ready. Cases where also taken up to room. Decor of main lobby reception area lovely and lots of seating and rest areas and  coffee bar lounge area. Plenty to choose from for a snack and coffee tea beer wine. Large marble staircase with George the Lucky dragon situated on 2nd floor. (Only two where ever made other 1 is 2.5 miles down at bottom of Atlantic Ocean in wrecks of the Titanic. Bedroom was of very good standard with all expected amenities supplied. Tuck box containing tea coffee crisps and biscuits refilled on a daily basis. What I did like and never got anywhere else I’ve stayed is fresh milk which was very much appreciated. Neptune’s restaurant is lovely tho only dine once on my stay large selection to choose from seafood and steaks. As weather was very nice and warm on my stay my Only one issue I did have was room service/ maids took key card everyday from slot at door as I like to keep air con on while out. All in all I’d highly recommend to anyone.  Also location is perfect for local sights and with in walking distance of Covent Gardens and Leicester Square with tube station just found corner   ,5,2018,07,28
124,A job well done,"I typically have a regular hotel that I stay in when in London but seeing the launch of this here and its impressive reviews, I decided to give it a go.

I can tell you that this hotel delivers a really great experience.  First of all — the staff.  The warmth, personal investment and genuine desire to help hit you immediately.  The staff is warm and authentic.  I could tell getting it right really matters to them.  I especially appreciated the bellman from The Czech Republic — what a terrific guy.

Rooms are small but that’s the norm.  They are very well appointed and offer a smart elegant environment.  Hallways are nicely designed and the overall decor and tone is modern and elegant.  Not fussy — serene.

Gym is great.  Rooms are quiet.  Location is ideal.  Food is terrific.  I am not someone who raves easily.  But this hotel won me over.  

Congrats to the entire team and thank you for a great stay.",5,2018,07,28
124,Lovely hotel,"I booked this hotel following a recent stay on two occasions in the principal hotel Charlotte square Edinburgh.

I was quite excited to be staying following its refurbishment and hype of the advertising and I was looking forward to my 3 day stay.

Unfortunately I was left quite disappointed, whilst the hotel is classed as 5 stars it 
appeared half finished. The hotel in itself is quite lovely and old worldly and reminiscent of bygone days a step back into the past which was nice and the experience that I was looking for. The staff you couldn’t fault, polite at every level, each and everyone of them and nothing was too much trouble really nice people and something that the hotel have got spot on, customer service was a key point and they nailed it.

My room was as expected by the advertised web site and reflective of the Edinburgh experience, unfortunately i was at the rear of the hotel where the scaffold was up and the workmen began their day @ 0800hrs. I wouldn’t have been alone with this experience which was disappointing.

I always enjoy dining in the hotel restaurants and the Charlotte square hotel had the hotel mezzanine of which I spent a fair amount of my time in just relaxing etc. I was looking forward to the same experience in the London principal but alas it was closed due to it not being ready for opening.

Whilst I enjoyed the overall hotel experience I was quite disappointed by the building work and the closed palm court area, this reduced the eating experience as the only restaurant available in the hotel was the Neptune restaurant, my wife is not a big fish eater and this restaurant was a fish restaurant, this meant that we had to eat out of the hotel on an evening which was a bit of a bummer.

As said overall the hotel was really nice and the staff absolutely superb, but had I known that they had ongoing building work and that the essential (to me at least) palm court area wasn’t ready I would not have booked the hotel. I think perhaps that this little snippet of information should have been disclosed at the time of booking? 

The hotel isn’t cheap and this detracted from the experience, I was told that the owners wanted the hotel open due to the cost of the refurbishment of which I can understand as it is the height of summer, but they should have disclosed the building work and the closed palm court.

Initially due to a lack of passing on information at the time of the booking by booking.com my room was incorrect and so the hotel immediately changed me to a room that I had initially requested, my 1st room was scaffold clear I must point out and therefore I suspect the room that I wanted was sadly in the building area.",4,2018,07,27
124,"Progressing, Not Quite There","I think this will be a good hotel eventually, simply some teething troubles as they settle. Rooms and general decor immaculate and modern. Great rooms, bathrooms and amenities (good gym) and very comfortable bed (I stayed in a single which is bigger than some doubles in London). The small issues are in service - with check in system not working as well as it could (could not find booking, then room not allocating), slightly confused (and bizarrely too many) staff at breakfast not really knowing who was taking care of what, and generally an organized chaos as the hotel progresses from its soft launch (its almost as if every question / query has to be checked with someone else just to make sure). The staff were all in all very engaging and helpful but it was obvious they are getting used to how everything works. For the price point / location at the moment in that location it is very good - will see if these change over time. ",3,2018,07,24
124,Grand old hotel comes alive in 2018!,It may have been built in the 19th century but The Principal Hotel certainly suits modern London now! The facade is suitably impressive but the interior has combined old world glamour with modern convenience. Lovely energetic young staff who want to make your visit a good one. Great funky bar for a late night cocktail or cafe on corner for good coffee in the morning ... both ends of the day covered! A great base for exploring local Bloomsbury area but also centrally located for wider London trips.,4,2018,07,24
124,"Old world charm, new world hip","Great service.  A first rate coffee, wine and beer bar with a La Marzocco espresso machine.  Russell Square is across the street so grab a coffee or beer and enjoy it in the park!  My room was small (ordered and expected), but excellently appointed.  Great location.  Excellent bar.  The lobby atrium was not open (construction) but they Kindly gave me a beer while waiting for my room.  Highly recommended..",5,2018,07,23
124,"Historic facade, modern interieur","The old Russell Hotel became the very chic modern Principal. Depending on your taste, for us it is a Little bit overloaded. less is more, but for 5 stars fresh flowers is a must.
Yet they Need some time to finish (not only the Palm garden). Very international friendly staff. Superbe. Little things needed: Shoehorn e.g. and some other stuff in the room. Breakfast in the Restaurant offers a nice athmosphere but very short selection of bread and, I am afraid, of almost everything, from fruit to fish (the salmon was very good though). All in all, I am sure, they will improve and then you have a perfect place near Bloomsbury (give them advice, they ask for it).",4,2018,07,23
124,Wonderful stay,"We've spent 8 nights in this hotel and left with regrets since we really enjoyed its nice atmosphere, location, transport and services. The Front Desk and Concierge were very helpful and the housekeeping was twice a day (even more when it was needed). Tips were only a way to say thanks and we sincerely recommend this hotel to other travellers for its ratio of quality-price.",5,2018,07,18
124,Outstanding!,"Outstanding ! Fantastic building full of historical features! Great check in experience and friendly staff. We had a suite on the 5th floor nicely decorated and with a sense of details l have rarely seen in 5 stars hotels in Europe. Timeless yet modern decoration, huge bathroom and very comfortable mattress! Location is great : 15 mn walk from Euston station  and 15 mn walk to Covent Garden!!Will comeback for sure! I found my home in London! Kudos to you guys!",5,2018,07,18
124,The New Kid On The Block,"So with a great deal in hand due to the soft opening, we were pleased upon enetering this grand refurbished building. The Ozzy doorman was cheerful and polite and pointed us to the reception desk. Niow this is where it could have all gone terrible wrong..... we arrived at 4:30pm with the usual ""can I take your surname pleae"" and your ""address"" I've been here some many times that I just new our reservation was in danger, and sure enough they found the booking but no room at the Inn (well not the room we booked) However the Reception Supervisor (Romyr) but into gear his customer service mode and pulled out all the plugs in secure a triple upgrade to a signature suite. His attitude was spot (if only other hotels took this approach they would learn very fast taht good customer service is key to happy and returning guests)

The room was of a very good standard with a seperate lounge area, TV , free mini bar (apart from full bottles of spirits) and seperate WC, also dedicate air con. Bedroom very relaxing and well set out. Good size bathroom witha larger than normal walkin in rain shower. Roll-top bath fior those wanting to relax.

Breakfast appeared to be a bit chaotic but im sure this will settle down in time.

All in all a great hotel, great staff a true 5 Star Hotel in the making",5,2018,07,16
124,Top notch service and luxurious finishes,"I stayed in a single room for one night, and altho the bedroom was small, the bathroom was a very generous size with a full sized bath! The staff were friendly, welcoming and above and beyond helpful, the location was brilliant and the finishes luxurious. I would highly recommend staying here when in London.",5,2018,07,15
124,"Wonderful historic hotel, but I was disappointed with the design and size of the room","Pro: The exterior of the hotel, communal areas, restaurant (great food too) and bar are wonderful. It's a hotel for lovers of history and style. Staff is extremely kind and helpful. The area is great. However, I was a bit disappointed with the quality and size of the rooms.
Con: My request for a quiet room was met in that I was given an end room. Unfortunately, it was rather noisy. It was next to a sort of service room, and I could hear people talking in the neighbouring room, construction noise from the backside of the hotel and the underground. In my opinion, a high-end hotel should not open before the construction is completely finished. I had a very small room and the carpet was already looking worn-out and untidy. The bathroom is too small, there is no room for toiletries and almost no room to hang your clothes. While the communal areas and restaurant are fantastic, I unfortunately didn't feel at home in the room.",4,2018,07,14
124,Convenient Location For a Hotel of High Rating,"We had stayed at The Principal London for 5 nights. The Principal front desk was very prominent although the concierge was a little hidden. The whole hotel structure was very ancient looking but the renovation really made it a 5 star look. Everything was very new and produced a very comfortable feeling staying in the hotel. The rooms was a little too cozy for liking and the toilet door was facing right beside the bed (for the basic room offered by the hotel). The toilet itself was a very nice though. The TV had a variety of channels to choose from although we mainly used the TV to watch the World Cup live. The staff of the hotel were all very welcoming, helpful and friendly from the front desk to the concierge to the bell boy and also the cleaning staff and that really made us very comfortable as well during our stay. Not forgetting the London Underground was easily accessible right behind the hotel and taxi was available as long as you communicate with the front desk.",5,2018,07,12
124,Fantastic hotel stay,"I stayed at the Principal Hotel, Russell Square for 5 nights. It was a wonderful stay in a beautiful London property in a fabulous location. I would definitely recommend for a great stay somewhere central but not mobbed with traffic or tourists! It really feels like a London gem with the history, location and service.

The building is stunning, recently restored (I think). The architecture is beautiful neo-Gothic, one of my favourite buildings in London. The terracotta facade is stunning against the (rare!)  blazing blue summer skies! The original features are in place which you can admire the moment you enter the property - the original style contrasts to the modern rooms. The bedrooms were immaculately clean. I had a room at the back of the hotel so it was also very quiet.
 
Russell Square is opposite so if you fancy some parklife, it is just a few steps away. There is a brilliant little family run cafe, Caffe Tropea, in the park for an alfresco breakfast or sundowners in Central London. Absolutely gorgeous. The tube station is just tucked at the side of the hotel and Euston/Kings Cross/St. Pancras are a 10 minute walk. Of course you can also walk easily to many central spots within 15 mins - British Museum, Seven Dials, Covent Garden etc. Really a wonderful location. 

The ac wasn't particularly powerful (the 19° displayed on the screen wasn't reached!) but I guess that is to be expected in the UK! That being said, I was still able to sleep in the heat.

The bathroom is small but beautifully decorated. Very modern decor with grey tiling and nice taps/shower fittings.  There are nice touches from the brand such as the analogue style phone in bright red or the quirky mugs and note cards. The staff were friendly and helpful. 

I didn't have any problems during my stay and I didn't try any of the F&B outlets as I had other plans - however all stunning little places!",5,2018,07,10
124,Flying visit to the West End,"We stayed for one night on July 7th. From the off, the hotel was very impressive, we were delighted by our choice. It's a gorgeous Victorian building and we were very lucky to be upgraded to a corner room suite. Special mention to the staff at the hotel, in particular Harry, fantastic service ethic and a really nice guy, couldn't have been more helpful and the delightful Spanish lady who handled our upgrade beautifully, making the stay very special indeed. The room was perfect and the whole hotel is stylish, visually stunning but what makes the hotel, is the staff, all excellent, all completely focused on making our stay wonderful. Highly recommended.",5,2018,07,10
124,Great stay in this beautiful hotel,My wife and I stayed for one night whist up in London to catch a couple of shows. Although not fully open yet i am sure it will be stunning once completed. We were lucky enough to have a corner suite and it was truly stunning. Every detail has been thought about. Staff are all great too.,5,2018,07,10
124,Outstanding! Hard to leave.,"This hotel is striking to look at - both inside and out.  It is old glamour reinvented, keeping the best of what it was, but adding enough of what is new to add comfort and convenience.  The linen and pillows were lovely and so nice to have the water and snack box refilled daily.  However, what really impressed us the most here is the service - it is by far the best we have experienced.  Without exception the staff were polite, helpful and invested in our experience as a guest - housekeeping staff, front desk, door staff and concierges, restaurant and bar staff, all of them top, top notch.  If this is what soft opening looks like I can't wait to come back when they are under full steam.
The only issue we had is that there is no space in a standard room to store your bag out of the way.",5,2018,07,08
124,Great remodelation,"Stayed here for a week with a friend, gorgeous remodelation the hotel reopened 2-3 months away, beautiful, rooms are great , and the staff very friendly.
Some problems in room service and the café and bar best forgotten.
But a good option in central London, problems will surely be resolved with time.",4,2018,07,08
124,Great Hotel and Dog friendly,"We stayed at The Principal London in June of 2018.  We where very pleased with this hotel.  It is newly remodeled and has a great bar and coffee shop.  The rooms are very modern and the WiFi was fast.  The rooms have smart TV's so you can stream movies.  The bathrooms are very stylish spacious.  The best part of the hotel though is the staff.  Everyone was very helpful and nice.  Harry was even nice enough to do a walk by our room to make sure our dog wasn't lonely and howling while we stepped out to get a bite to eat.  I can't recommend this hotel enough, definitely @Frenchie_Fryz approved!",5,2018,07,07
124,Stunning hotel with excellent service,"It was our first visit to The Principal and were very impressed with the stunning hotel, it's location and friendly, fantastic service.    All the staff we came across were extremely helpful and friendly, especially Andrea on reception.    Our room was amazing, I only wish we could of stayed another night.   Fitz's bar has a great vibe and again fantastic service.
We'll definitely return but next time for more than one night!",5,2018,07,05
124,What Style and Superb Service,"We booked into this beautiful hotel for one night as we needed somewhere to stay in London.
My wife and I were blown away by the opulence of the interiors and its old world charm.

The hotel staff could not have been more welcoming and friendly from the moment we set foot through the door. We checked in early before our room was ready but received a fantastic reception from Inma Moleon the reception manager.
She took our bags and advised she would phone us once the room was ready. When we arrived back, we were given our keys only to find we had been upgraded to a suite.
The room was so luxurious, with fantastic toiletries, snacks  and ambience.
This was the first time we have stayed and will definitely be returning on one of our frequent trips to London and yes I know they can’t upgrade us every time ",5,2018,07,04
124,Superb,"The Principal opened this spring following a multi-million pound renovation - a job well done as the hotel is stunning inside & out. Victorian, Grade 2 listed, & with a striking terracotta exterior, the property is grand & imposing. The lobby is lavish with marble, the staircase majestic - you get a true feel for the buildings' illustrious history in these areas. The 334 bedrooms are tasteful, modern & stylish with thoughtful touches such as a complimentary tuck box & fresh refrigerated milk. Beds are super lux & showers outstandingly powerful. Given the recent make over, everywhere is shiny & new & the hotel feels top notch. Staff are smartly attired & customer focused, check-in slick. We loved the speedy lifts which stop only at the floor required. The late night bar, Fitz's is absolutely stunning, decadent & plush with superb service & fantastic cocktails. The seafood-focused restaurant Neptune serves breakfast, lunch & dinner with more casual all day dining offered at bright & breezy coffeehouse 'Burr & Co'. The 'Palm Court' Restaurant opens later this month (July). We had a peek - it will be a gorgeous spot for Afternoon Tea. The gym is really well equipped & open 24 hours. Location is a further bonus, - super central & just a 2 minute walk from Russell Square tube. Fabulous stay - well done.",5,2018,07,03
124,2 night stay ,"I stayed for 2 nights with my teenage daughter. 

The hotel is simply stunning, a beautiful refurbishment. It is right beside Russell Square tube station which was so useful. There is also a Tesco opposite the station which was handy for buying water etc. 

We had booked the cheapest room. It was tiny but well designed. Fine for 2 nights but not longer. Lots of quirky little touches in the room. I liked having still & sparkling water provided and fresh milk for tea or coffee. Also a cute tuck box with snacks. 

It was extremely warm in London when we visited, but the air conditioning was super. We slept so well in a really dark and cool room in a comfortable bed. 

The stand out thing about this hotel is the staff. They are outstanding in their attitude. Hard to describe it - go and experience it! They ooze enthusiasm and seemed to be genuinely interested in our plans and conversation. 

I absolutely loved this hotel experience and it would be top of my list now for London. ",5,2018,07,03
124,Great location! Comfortable for the family,"My teenage daughters and I just spent 4 nites at this hotel on Russell square. A great location in a beautiful old hotel that has been marvelously updated. We were lucky and overlooked the square. The staff were exceedingly nice and helpful. We also enjoyed the two restaurants - one for casual tea and the other for a late night bite. We wanted to be near-ish to the theater district and this was perfect!  The tube is just around the corner, easy to walk places and taxis are easy also. ",5,2018,07,02
124,Beautiful hotel and amazing suites.,"This hotel recently reopened after a two year renovation.  We booked one of their largest suites and it was beautifully furnished.  So much  so that my wife actually photographed the finishes for future design ideas at our home in the States. The staff are very attentive and try to accommodate your requests quickly.  The only hiccup was that it took them until almost 5 PM to have our room ready.  I highly recommend this hotel.  Please note that the atrium restaurant is not open yet but they have at least two other areas to eat and drink.  Prior to booking I read reviews with some people complaining about it not being ready for opening yet.  I can tell you that the hotel is ready, the staff was great the rooms were beautiful and it is in a great location.",5,2018,06,30
124,Sumptuous Hotel,"Exquisite new hotel. Outside and inside. We spent much of stay just wandering around looking at every peice of the well considered design. We had a suite which was spacious for an inner city hotel, and was quiet, even though we were on the main road. We ate at Neptune’s and drank at Fitz’s, which were both top class. All the staff were very attentive and friendly. We’ll be back.",5,2018,06,30
124,"A brand new hotel, done right! 👍","I had the pleasure of staying in this hotel for 1 night. The reception staff were brilliant, not patronising or condescending.
The standard rooms are lovely and the beds very comfortable. I particularly loved the staff in the Cafe, they were upbeat, professional and looked happy in their work; clearly the cafe is well run by a good boss ☺ My last part of the review is the fact that it's nice to see a hotel that gives you complimentary snacks. There are wine glasses and opener already in the room(no calling reception!) and no annoying little cartons of milk; instead a mini bottle of fresh milk in the fridge.
Thank You, I will be back! 🤗",5,2018,06,29
124,Great location for London visit,"We stayed here for a five day visit. The hotel was in its ""soft opening"" phase after a remodel. Great place. The food was good, the service excellent, the rooms comfortable, and the staff very helpful. This was a good central location from which to see most of London.",5,2018,06,28
124,Fabulous stay,"We’ve stayed in a lot of good hotels in London over the years and our recent weekend at The Principal tops the lot. The hotel has a grand, luxurious atmosphere with high ceilings and beautiful decor. There are amusing, quirky touches which add to the enjoyment and make the hotel extra special. The staff were faultless with their friendly, helpful attitude. There is an excellent bar and restaurant plus a more informal coffee cafe. The beds and bed linen were super comfortable and very nice toiletries too. We will be back!",5,2018,06,25
124,Absolutely amazing hotel!,"My wife and I chose The Principal for one night due to proximity to the tube station and being in the direct line to go to Trafalgar Studios where we had booked to see Killer Joe. We parked in the nearby NCP car park, only a couple of minutes walk away. From arrival to departure every member of staff was fantastic. We made use of the bar which had a lovely ambience and served excellent cocktails. Our room was a superior double.....clean and of a good size as well as being decorated very well. Breakfast was excellent and my request for gluten free bread was dealt with without fuss and promptly brought out. I have only two regrets.....and that is that we did not have time for neither lunch nor dinner in the hotel, as well as only booking for one night. We have now decided that this is our favourite hotel in London and we will hopefully be back for another night to celebrate our anniversary in September.",5,2018,06,24
124,Preview Visit,"We visited this hotel prior to a visit later in the year. We were made to feel most welcome by the door staff, reception staff and the concierge Conor. We were given a tour of the hotel ground floor and told of the history of the hotel, formerly known as The Russel. We look forward to our future visit with great anticipation. Later the next day, whilst staying at another hotel, we visited again and ate in the Burr and Co coffee house, which is also very welcoming and friendly. Would definitely recommend, the hotel and the coffee house.",5,2018,06,22
124,Dog-friendly,This is an excellent hotel. It looks grand and imposing but it is comfortable and relaxed. They are super-friendly to dogs. You can leave your dog alone in your room and can take them to all areas of the hotel. This is a hotel that you can happily spend time in. Food is lovely. Extensive drinks menu. Staff are really good at their job and patient. My only complaint was that my room (218) was on two levels - bathroom and wardrobes downstairs. I found this awkward but others might like the quirkiness of it.   Location is good and having Russell Square Gardens opposite is marvellous for dogs. I will definitely go back.,5,2018,06,22
124,Quality ,"I haven’t been here for years , but time has been good for this beautiful building (or a few million pounds ) the refurb is amazing , warm and welcoming , supported by brilliant staff . The rooms are not huge, but very comfortable and ample bathrooms . It would be a 5 but I didn’t have time to experience the bar and restaurant . Highlight for me - clever lifts, no stopping on many floors! I’ll be back",4,2018,06,21
124,Old meets new - a beautiful new historical hotel,"The new renovated hotel managed to keep its history and although the room is new you can still feel the years. The location is great, near underground station, ten minutes walk from the river and srounded by many coffee shops and restaurants. The staff are welcoming and friendly and the restaurant serves excellent breakfast. Definitely a place to pay a second visit!",5,2018,06,21
124,Majestic building housing great hotel,"Stayed at The Principal for 2 nights during their soft opening. The lobby and entrance area are both stunning. Service at Reception is great - friendly, amicable, and service oriented staff. 

Rooms were not too big but have everything once requires: comfortable bed with great pillows (good pillows are very rare I believe), powerful shower, enough closet space, and little table with chairs. Rooms are not spectacularly unique, but very convenient. 

Did not have a chance to try out the restaurant and bar but they seemed very busy. 

I will definitely return once fully opened!",4,2018,06,21
124,Exceptional service in a beautiful hotel,"Unexpectedly found myself alone in this hotel for a couple of nights while my husband was in hospital. The staff were excellent, they could not have been more helpful and made me feel safe and welcome. My room was a standard double, but was a very good size with everything beautifully presented and the building as a whole is exceptional. Instant hot water and a superb shower also an added benefit. Definitely good value for money, will be top of my list next time I visit London.",5,2018,06,21
124,Excellent hotel and with really good staff.,I stayed at The Principal hotel last week.  Check in experience was seamless.  Room is extremely modern and very comfortable.  Loved the shower.  The best part for me were all the brilliant cocktails at the bar.  Absolutely phenomenal.  Dont bother staying elsewhere.  This is the best new hotel in town,5,2018,06,20
124,GENUINE  HOSPITALITY.,"First time at this hotel and would certainly return when next in the area. It was my husbands 50th and we were upgraded from a deluxe to a junior suite, which is Uber sleek and smart. A complimentary moreish chocolate ganache cake was also provided.  Four poster bed was super comfy, and the large shower room was everything and more than we could have hoped for. All staff from the lovely guys on reception to the doorman bar staff and staff at breakfast all were genuinely friendly and helpful. Thankyou Principal for a great stay, you sure know how to run a great hotel.",5,2018,06,20
124,Lovely hotel with excellent service staff,"Love the whole design of the room to all the small touches to make you feel welcome, at home, but at the same time know that you're in London.

All staff I encountered from the front door, front desk, to the concierge were very helpful, welcoming and friendly.

The hotel's location is great too. The underground and bus stops are less than 5 minutes walk away. There are restaurants and a Tesco Express just behind the hotel. Russel Square Park is just opposite the hotel. Major spots like Oxford Street, Hyde Park, Piccadilly, Buckingham Palace and more are all located 10-20 minutes away by public transport or are also walkable to enjoy the beautiful London streets and parks along the way if the weather is good.",5,2018,06,19
124,Beautiful hotel,I stayed at The Principal Hotel just behind The British Museum which just opened after a very thorough renovation. Very beautiful and the rooms were very nice and quiet. Breakfast was good and had a large selection and nice service. Staff is very polite and service on top. The hotel bar beautiful and drinks are great. Even the hotel gym was fantastic. Definitely worth a stay with walking distance to Soho.,5,2018,06,19
124,Birthday celebration,"Had pre dinner cocktails at the Fitz Bar
Wonderful reception by the doorman and especially the concierge.Top marks for service.
Cocktails were wonderful and all at Fitz made our time there a pleasure.",5,2018,06,18
124,"Amazing stay, best staff ever, clean and renovated, kids friendly","We traveled as a family, two parents and a four years old daughter. This will be a long review, but it's needed to recognize the efforts done by the staff.

This visit is our 4th visit to London but our daughter's first. It was the best trip ever, and the hotel was a major part of it. We were lucky enough to have stayed in luxurious hotels in the past but The Principal London is truly something else.

The excellent service started before we have even arrived, as both of us suffer from allergy and asthma, we asked the hotel to remove the drapes from the bed in the Junior Suit we booked, which they did. We also asked them to receive a shipment from Amazon (an air filter) which they did as well. We ended up not needing the filter as the room was very clean and the air quality was good for someone with allergies and asthma.

On arrival we were welcomed with a smile from every single person working in the hotel, check-in process was swift, and the junior suit was big enough for our family (Europe standards), though it could use a bigger wardrobe. we were welcomed with desserts and special vanilla ice-cream for our little princess because they heard her ask my wife when will she eat ice cream.   

My wife has special dietary requirements due to Crohn's disease, I informed the hotel in advance and they relayed the information to the chef. During our stay they did every request for special meals, from ordering items that are not on the room service menu, to making special breakfast sandwiches that are safe for my wife, to making porridge that we bought from M&S. Every one went the extra mile to make us happy even when they were fully booked and the chef extremely busy.

As for our daughter, she was so happy that she and I quote ""wanted to stay there forever and ever"".  One of the staff members noticed that she was carrying twilight sparkle, a character from my little pony, and our daughter expressed her love for pony ville, so Maria, from Everything else department, sent daily rainbow yummy cupcakes from ""ponyville"" with thoughtful notes to our daughter every single day! 
(Thank you Maria :) we kept the note)
All the staff talked to her and pampered her even with toys on several occasions.

That brings me to the amazing team of ""everything else"" department. special thanks to Hamzah and Maria who made our stay so magical.

The concierge team was beyond helpful, they memorized the appointments we had and reminded us with them and even suggested places to go to that were around our destination. Thank you and apologies for not remembering everyone's name.

Checking in and out was very easy and fast. Amazing team really.
 
No one is perfect, but even when they don't deliver as expected, they try their best to make it up, the first day we had an appointment few hours after checking in, and the room service brought the meals late and my wife couldn't eat as she had to rush to the Dr's appointment, they prepared it again when she was back and didn't charge us for it, in fact, they gave us the 3 meals complementary.

The area of the hotel  is very nice, with taxis a couple of minutes away, and a three minutes walk to an underground station. Mini-markets and exchange service are available within walking distance as well.

The hotel itself is beautifully renovated and the architecture is beautiful. The Cafe (they serve breakfast there as well) is very nice with excellent coffee, and friendly staff. The restaurant ""Neptune"" has delicious options and it is very nice as well.

We didn't feel for a minute that the hotel was commercial, or that the staff were just doing there job. We felt they genuinely wanted to help and make it a memorable and happy stay for us.

We will definitely be back!
Thank you The principal London :)",5,2018,06,18
124,Trooping of the Colour 2018,"This hotel has recently been refurbished to an extremely high standard; I thought I was stepping into Buckingham Palace itself. The staff were all extraordinarily polite, helpful, professional, courteous and accommodating. I could not have asked for a nicer place to lay my head at the end of the day. It was well-located near the Tube and within walking distance to many of the London attractions I wanted to visit. The concierge, Mr. Sosa, and the front desk attendant, Ana, were just fabulous. The next time I am in London for an extended trip, I will book this hotel again. I cannot give enough praise to the Principal London. Excellent establishment!!! Thank you for a memorable London experience!!",5,2018,06,11
124,Spectacular building but rooms and service could be better,"This hotel has a great location (just 1' to the tube station) and the building is really beautiful from the outside. However, it's a pity that the inside doesn't really keep up with the promises the outside offers: the ""superior"" room feels really tight and it's hard to believe that this should be at least 22 m2 in size! It definitely feels much more crowded and the room is also not organized very well, i.e. there are only very limited opportunities to place stuff. 
The service experience was a bit mixed: We arrived too early on our first morning for the room to be ready. We therefore left our bags at the reception and were promised that they would be in our room when we'd come back. However, when we returned late afternoon the bags were not there yet and we had to wait for their delivery. On another day, we came back around 5 pm and our room still hadn't been made up! These things are no disaster but I believe that a hotel with this attitude could do better. At least, all the staff were very friendly and they apologized extensively about the things that didn't work properly.",3,2018,06,10
124,Elegance without stuffiness - but still finding it's feet,"We had one night in The Principal in a Junior Suite and it was a great stay, however being a new kid on the block there do seem to be some teething problems but the room rate compared to other London 5 star hotels makes up for this.  It was unfortunate that our room was not ready at check-in time but the duty manager Isabelle was incredible - she sorted things out and could not be more accomodating.  The room was stunning and the beds are the most comfortable I have slept on.  The food at Neptune was superb and we have a function in the bar which was wonderful - the staff could not be more helpful.",5,2018,06,10
124,Outstanding hotel!,"We checked in on Saturday 9th June for my best friends Hen party, there were 4 of us. The reception manager was lovely, and when we got into our room he had left a hand written card congratulating my friend on her wedding and 4 vouchers for champagne as a gift from the hotel which was just lovely!

We had booked 2 of the superior double rooms. When we came back late in the evening our bed had been turned down, a hand written weather forecast for the next day left on the bed and fresh bottles of still and sparkling water left on our bedside tables. There were also 2 beautiful bath robes left for us to wear too. The bed itself is the comfiest hotel bed I’ve ever experienced...feather duvet and pillows and a feather topped mattress and the covers where beautifully soft white cotton sheets. 

The hotel itself is breathtaking. There is marble columns and floors as far as the eye can see and the attention to detail is stunning. It is the best hotel I have stayed in in London and will undoubtedly be staying here again! Thank you The Principal! Xx",5,2018,06,10
124,Great stay,A nicely renovated hotel in a beautiful historic building.  Very clean and comfortable.  Friendly staff who went above and beyond when we accidentally left a laptop charger in our room.  We were traveling throughout the UK for the week and the staff graciously packed up the charger and expedited it to our next hotel.  This was such a helpful and kind act and really set the hotel apart.  We had a great stay and would definitely return on our next trip.,5,2018,06,09
124,Fantastic stay at The Principal!,"We booked the Hotel as it had rooms with two beds and we were travelling with our teenage son, price and location were also considered and both were excellent. The Hotel is literally a few steps from Russell Square underground station, and is also opposite a lovely little park area (you must try the Italian cafe there). The hotel building is incredible and the door staff were very welcoming and helpful. (Darius) 
Check in was very quick and our room was ready early, always nice. Claire on reception was very nice and explained everything that we needed to know. We did not notice the removation work at all, everything was seemless. 
Our room was modern, clean, comfortable and we liked having robes, slippers, kettle, fridge, snacks water etc provided, what a nice touch.
Breakfast at Burr and Co, was very well cooked, and a great choice of food, the only slight comment I would make was their were many staff but it was chaotic service, took ages to get a cup of tea. A calmer more efficient breakfast experience would be good, but the food was excellent - smoked salmon, eggs, full english, cakes, cereals etc. And even a bloody mary or prosecco should you wish! 
All in all a great experience and we will be back in the future to enjoy this lovely hotel again.",5,2018,06,08
124,Good to be back and what an improvement ,"Stayed in the newly refurbished hotel
First the bad news 
Why put a towel rail above the wc ?
And the room wasn’t big
But it was beautifully decorated 
The hotel in general was brilliant highlighted by amazing staff. Their attention to detail was second to none. 
It is officially my favourite London hotel
Please keep it up!",5,2018,06,05
124,Could not ask for much better. 5* Staff!!,"Myself and my fiancee' stayed for two nights over the bank holiday to celebrate our anniversary, recent engagement and her birthday. We love London and wanted to stay somewhere both central and nice and we could not have picked anywhere better!

Literally round the corner from Russell Square underground station, the beautiful building greets you as well as someone at the front door to welcome you which was very nice!

We arrived at reception to a very friendly welcome from Ruben. He was very polite, again welcoming and very informative and happy to help with any querey we had. Our bag was taken by a member of the concierge team (we forgot his name but he was a very polite, tall man!) who told us about the building and took our bag to our lovely bedroom on the second floor.

The room itself was spacious, modern, big cosy bed and a very good sized bathroom with bathtub that we requested. The room also had a tuck box with teas, coffees, chocolate and crisps which again, a lovely touch. We did not stay as long as we would have liked in the hotel during our stay but whenever we came back for a rest bite during the day, to sleep or get ready in the morning; the room was always quiet, always well looked after by the housekeeping team. Again we forgot the names of the housekeepers but whoever worked between Monday 28th May-Wednesday 30th May on the second floor were absolutely fantastic. Thank you so much!!!!

As we came back to our room after going to the theatre on the first night we were greeted with some homemade desserts and a note from Isabelle congratulating our anniversary and engagement (Thank you Isabelle!)

On the second night after we returned we went to the lovely boutique bar on the ground floor and were served by Patrick behind the bar. He was absolutely fantastic, very knowledeable about the drinks offered as well as making very polite conversation. We were both really happy with his service and gave him a £10 tip, so thank you very much Patrick.

As you can read from this review, staff members from pretty much every department were brilliant, 10/10 and cannot thank them enough. Although the hotel is a bit costly (although we went on a bank holiday which will raise prices of course!) it was worth every single penny and would not hesitate to go back again.

Absolutely great stay and a big thank you to all mentioned and apologies for those people whose names we forgot but hopefully the management team can find the names of those we described and thank them too.

Can't wait to stay with you's again! : )",5,2018,06,05
124,"Wonderful hotel, exceptional service.","My wife and I stayed here twice during the hotel's soft opening in May.  The refurbishment has been completed to a very high standard and the level of personal service and attention was even more impressive, perfectly striking that fine balance between thoughtful assistance and excessive fussing.  On our next London visit this will definitely be the first place we consider.",5,2018,06,05
124,Aka Russell Hotel of the 19th Century,"Even our cab driver didn't know where the Principal was until we said: it used to be the Russell. We stayed at the Russell, a grand pile that had seen better times. Now, the place is totally refurbished and not quite finished. But what is finished is very fine. Based on the floor plans we could see, the rooms facing the square are large, so if you want a double with no frills, then you would get rooms facing the side streets, or worse, interior walls. The decor is tasteful. We laughed at the tuck box with water and kitkat in the room - cute. Service excellent. On a very hot day, the staff offered us water to take with us. On a rainy day, umbrellas of course! The lobby is a bit of a maze and could use some elegant signage. We didn't try the bar, but Burr & Co cafe is excellent.",4,2018,06,04
124,Outstanding!,"We recently stayed with our 3 children at this beautiful hotel for two nights; our stay at the Principal London couldn't have been better!
The refurbishment has been absolutely beautifully done; they have retained and enhanced all the original features but also turned it into an extremely luxurious 5 star hotel.  There is attention to detail everywhere in both the design and all the extra touches they have put in such as the 'tuck boxes' in the rooms and special gifts for the children. The bed is the comfiest bed I have ever slept on - it was like sleeping on a cloud!  The bedrooms are beautifully designed.
The staff were also all amazing; a great balance between being very professional yet friendly and interested in the guests. And above all, really wanting us to enjoy our time in the hotel and in London.  The location is excellent - we walked to many places straight from the hotel or caught a short taxi ride to the west end.
Coming back to the relaxed luxury of this hotel after a long day sightseeing was just perfect and really made our trip special.
",5,2018,06,03
124,short stay,"Clean, well equipped rooms in the center of the town ! A wonderful, peaceful stay in these simple & beautiful surroundings. Would recommend to anyone who travels to London. Thanks to all the staff for their hospitality.",4,2018,06,02
124,Cool and modern,"Had a few drinks on the bar last time with the warmest welcome from the guys at the entrance, beautiful cocktails, also special thanks to a guy call Gabriel as he kindly show me the best rooms around and make me feel I had to come back soon! 
Very recommended X",5,2018,05,31
124,Quick stop over in London,"The newly opened Principal London is a stunning building that is a short walk from Euston, making it great spot for an overnight stay with meetings either side. From the incredible exterior to the beautiful interior, the hotel has the wow factor. My room was very comfortable, Fitz's cocktail bar is very flamboyant yet super cosy and dinner in Neptune was divine. I had a great night sleep in a very comfortable bed and breakfast was served sat next to a Hollywood A lister. The hotel will be a regular home from home for myself when in London on business or pleasure.",5,2018,05,31
124,Fantastic,A fantastic renovation of this beautiful hotel. Brilliant room and service. Lovely little touches throughout the hotel. Fitz’s and Burr and co both excellent. Will definitely be back soon. Such a great addition to London.,5,2018,05,28
124,A Gem,"Newly refurbished and very cool hotel, brand new on the London scene.  Outstanding.  The architectural work of this first-rate refurbishment is remarkable.  The bar and the soon-to-be-fully opened restaurant will be part of London's top-tier fabric.  We were lucky to stumble upon this hotel when we found ourselves having difficulties at our standard haunts which seem to have been filled by visitors on the occasion of the recent royal wedding.  Although I am something of a traditionalist in my London hotel choices, my wife got no argument when she pointed out that she would just as soon stay at the Principal as our well-established, longstanding favorites.",5,2018,05,28
124,Perfectly satisfied ,We stayed for one night in a superior king room. The room was small but perfectly equipped with everything we needed and a little tuck box too all complimentary. The ensuite was also small and a bit of a squeeze for my XXL partner but the shower was spacious and hot. Soft and fluffy towels and a firm bed made it a lovely experience. The cherry on the top was my favourite dark rum in Fitz’s served by knowledge staff who know how to take care of customers. We will be back,5,2018,05,27
124,Amazing refurbishment,The hotel has been transformed and it is easy to imagine what it was like when it first opened.I so love the sweeping staicase. I did think our superior room was on the small side. It was well equipped with some really thoughtful extras. There were even mini bottles of fresh milk in the fridge. The staff were all so helpful. Many thanks to Tommy on reception and Jeffrey. Look forward to coming back for afternoon tea when the Palm Court is open.,4,2018,05,27
124,LOVED IT,"Fantastic room, fantastic location and brilliant service. The staff is lovely and call you all the time by your name. Unfortunately we didn't stay long enough but we will definitively come bact.
We loved the breakfast too!",5,2018,05,26
124,Mixed experience ,"
Stylish Victorian building which was still being refurbished.  Many of the public areas and Fitz’s bar were too dark, bordering on oppressive, for our liking but this may be a personal taste issue  All staff encountered were extremely helpful and welcoming. The superior room was spacious, comfortable and well equipped and came with a Bluetooth Ruark player. Air conditioning instructions were unclear and we didn’t get it to work properly but are sure staff would have been more than willing to assist if we had asked. We only stayed one night.  The chocolate cake delivered to our room as a birthday surprise was delicious. ",4,2018,05,26
124,Lovely refurbishment of a magical and mystical hotel... But!,"Please PLEASE please turn off the endless background music that follows you from bar to corridor to coffee shop and is actually louder than just background noise. The main problem is it IS noise, poor quality 'house' style music with no character at all. In my option were the music to be classical and beautifully programmed this hotel would become the most unique venue in London and its mystery would be genuinely respected. Asa. local resident I was often at the hotel previously for all kinds of occasions and it is lovely to see it alive and well and mostly very sympathetically revamped. But I may have to start a campaign to turn off the music if I am going to be a regular again! And give it the marks it properly deserves...",3,2018,05,24
124,No need to look elsewhere.,"The Principal London was previously the Hotel Russell which was a 4* hotel of great standing and a favourite of many. Now as the Principal, which has only been open for a month, it continues to fly the flag as one of the best hotels in the metropolis. 
I stayed at the Principal over a weekend as part of a birthday treat for my wife, I must admit I was thoroughly impressed with the building, facilities and most of all the staff, all of those I met greeted us with a smile and enquired if they could assist with anything. This was without exception. I have never experienced such a happy crew (I hope this continues). 
The bedroom was fine and of a perfectly adequate size, the shower room / loo as expected. It may be worth requesting a room with a view if you wish as we were on the second floor at the back with an 'interesting' vista of switchgear / generators and a wall of plastic plants to conceal the functional equipment. The glazing was super efficient and soundproof.
At the time of my visit the restaurant was not quite up and running, but to be fair this is London and if you cannot find a meal to suit any budget there is something wrong. It was no problem at all. A substantial breakfast was served in the hotel coffee shop 'Burr and Co.' next to reception. Full english, (even with black pudding,) Continental and everything in between on offer. Even a bottle of Vodka for a 'Bloody Mary' and Prosecco for 'Bucks Fizz were available.' 
All in all the Principal deserves to go from strength to strength and should the occasion arise I will choose the hotel for my next accommodation in London.",5,2018,05,24
124,It would be nice to be told it was a work in progress,"The staff are really great and helpful - they need to be. We telephoned a week before to check we could eat at the hotel, only to find on arrival that the restaurant was closed for VIP's only so we could not eat, we were made to feel little. The room service was a great menu but did not link to the other bars. We had buckets in the reading room and painters outside the restaurant. When it is finished it may be good - but not a patch on their York Hotel. We appreciate it is a work in progress but tell your guests first. The doorman needs work, had no idea how to get a taxi or remember you even stay there.
I have given it poor as we had to buy room service on the first night and go out on the second due to no restaurant. It may be complete by end of July. Palm Court was boarded up.",2,2018,05,24
124,"Superb hotel, reasonably priced due to soft opening","I stayed for 2 nights for a business trip, paid little more than I would have done for a premier inn but got a luxury room and superb service. Everything was sparkling and new. Staff were incredibly friendly and helpful. My room was 333 which was quite small but did the job for me, and didn’t have a view, but I wasn’t bothered as I wasn’t in the room much. Main thing was that the bed was incredibly comfy, felt luxurious, the bathroom was lovely and had everything you might need. I would love to stay again though not sure what prices will be when soft opening is over, though worth joining their mailing list as they have offers. Highly recommended.",5,2018,05,23
124,great hotel!,"great staff & location!
the room is small but well aquipped. the bathroom is very cold compering to the room and quite bright so you can leave the door open.the bath is very tall and it's frightening to step down  wet after the shower. other than that- great hotel, quite room,  unforgetable experience- we will come back, I want to acknolage the night shift and especially Sadik who welcomed us on our very late check-in and suprised us in the morning with a beautiful greeting card and a present because he found out that I'm pregnant!",5,2018,05,23
124,"Lots of ""snags"" untill completion.","This is a spectacular Victorian (Heritage) hotel.
It is some way from fully opening and work to the building is ongoing.
That means temporary breakfast room, Neptune restaurant not yet open, Palm court area not open, many bedrooms not open.
Despite all that we had an enjoyable 2 nights, with one warning, our Superior Room on the spacious first floor was small and the en suite VERY small.
The hotel marble entry and stair are simply WORLD class gorgeous, if you like Victorian hotels with a Harry Potter feel to them. I do, and will look forward to returning, but only for a larger room.
We had 2 carry on cases and there was really no where in our small room (146) to store them.
No under bed space, no rack, no floor space really.
What there is is excellent furniture and loads of designer style.Great sound deadening from the traffic.
The standing or turning space was very small in the en suite, but the shower was very fine.
Staff were excellent, very friendly. Pity that housekeeping staff waited to offer a turndown service until we put the do not disturb sign up at 21.30 each night!!
So early days for this excellent renovation.",4,2018,05,23
124,"Fantastic hotel, great service and location","Stayed 2 nights midweek in mid May. Hotel hadn't long been open at this point but there certainly didn't seem to be any teething problems. 
Excellent service, very friendly and attentive staff. 
Good room service, delicious breakfast and the bar is great. 

Would heartily recommend.",5,2018,05,22
124,Stunning Hotel with Exceptional Staff Service,"What a great place to stay while in London during our short visit. We flew in on a Friday and departed on a Monday. It being such a short trip and our first time being in London, we were excited to see what the city could offer. This hotel had exceptional rooms, a stunning front lobby and the staff were beyond assistive. Sean, the concierge, gave detailed mapping for us to fit all London has into three short days. Couldn't recommend this premium hotel more. ",5,2018,05,21
124,Beautiful hotel in great location,"My husband and i stayed here in a recent visit to London to celebrate a special occasion. The hotel is absolutely beautiful from the outside, such a gorgeous building. The inside dosen't disappoint either, very nicely refurbished. First impressions were very good.
Upon checking in we did have an issue with the room that had been allocated but it was handled extremely well and we were very happy with the outcome.
Our room was again really lovely, modern and classic feel. Bed very comfortable and great shower. You are left a tuck box in your room which is a nice touch and has some crisps and chocolate in it. Water supplied in bottles again was great esp as it was such a hot day. We were even offered water as we left the hotel for our journey.
We didnt have breakfast so i cant comment on that but we used the bar Fitz's and again it had great decor and fab service. 
Looking forward to our next stay. Will leave another reviews after our next visit in a few months time.",4,2018,05,21
124,Beautiful Hotel in Central London ,"My husband and I spent 1 night in the Principal Hotel in late May. Everything is absolutely perfect. The staff were charming and efficient, our room was stunning with a balcony view onto the park in Russell Square and the general decor and feel of the hotel is wonderful. We had a late nightcap in Fitz’s Bar which was suitably dark and inviting, and the buffet breakfast included in our stay was out of this world - fresh, amazing ingredients and great coffee. 100% recommend The Principal London for a luxury experience with the whole of the Capital on your doorstep. ",5,2018,05,21
124,Quite the best restoration of a grand hotel: oity about the small rooms.,"I would have given this a 5 star review had our room not only been small but needlessly badly designed. It was a  so-called ""superior"" double but what was it superior to? Small is often what you get in big grand hotels in big cities but I do wonder if hotel executives and their overpaid and over-hyped interior ""designers"" ever spend a night in their so-called superior and other rooms or do they only dwell in large suites.
The room decor is attractive but the furniture too large for the square footage available. Why have a huge, albeit very comfortable, plush velvet covered chair when the punters have to squeeze around it? And the somewhat stylish round table is again far too large. Ditto huge cushions on the bed that have to be strewn across what is left uncovered of the carpet. Why also have a full length mirror that is built into a useless thick metal box of a frame whose sole purpose is to take up more floor space?
And the en suite shower room is TINY. The cleaners must be contortionists to get in and round it because we had to carefully plan each entry to it. The shower itself is excellent but there is no bathroom mat for the floor as you cannot open either the door to the shower or the one to the room if anything is on the floor. Yes, it looks nice but it is so impractical.
But there are great points to this hotel not least the history brought out faithfully in the restoration that cost millions and is not yet complete. While work continues and less than half the rooms are ready, we were not disturbed by the ongoing work.
Fitz's, the main bar is beautiful and probably overstaffed but as throughout the hotel the young staff are engaging and getting more efficient. 
Burr &Co serves a good breakfast albeit with ""hot food"" rather cold. We negotiated on the breakfast as it is included, I think, now if you book with the hotel directly.
And they have the least arrogant and most helpful concierge in London. In fact, while it is aiming high in the line of stars, the staff are welcomingly down to earth. Let's hope that the recent change of ownership to the Intercontinental Group won't change that.
The greatest joy of a stay here is the marble and terracotta embellishments by architect Fitzroy Doll who certainly ""dolled up"" this place and the restoration has been true to him.
Lastly, I noted that many of the books in the bookcases in the smaller public areas are by women authors and that is to be true to the suffragettes associated with the area and the hotel over a hundred years ago - a thoughtful touch.",4,2018,05,21
124,A Gem,"We stayed here for 3 nights, in a lovely superior room. This is an historic hotel renovated beautifully in a great position. Everything is new, including the friendly and helpful multicultural staff. As they are still in the process of opening fully, so only around half of the rooms are open. But the bar is and it’s a work of art. 
Highly recommended and a special hello to Walter the doorman. 
",5,2018,05,21
124,Wonderful new hotel,"Just stayed at The Principal London for three nights. Although some of the rooms are small (I stayed in two different rooms over 3 nights), they are all beautiful and fresh. Every staff member went out of their way to be helpful and friendly. The location was excellent, very central, close to tube and bus stops. The onsite cafe offered a great breakfast. The blackout shades make the room so dark you could sleep for days, and walls are thick, so no ambient noise. I would go back in a second!",5,2018,05,20
124,Great hotel with excellent staff,"Had a great stay at the Principal. The hotel looks amazing, especially the public areas. The rooms were lovely and the shower was excellent, easy to use which i find is becoming a rarity in hotels these days. The staff are another highlight of the hotel, both friendly and helpful. Give that the hotel is having a 'soft-launch' and that there's still construction work going on I didn't notice any noise on my visit.

Great hotel, great staff and I look forward to another visit soon.",5,2018,05,20
124,Should not have opened,"I stayed at the Principal in London for one night and, while the hotel is beautiful and the atmosphere is lovely, I do not recommend it at this time, as my stay was simply unacceptable. I understand that this is still a ""soft"" opening, but there are certain, dangerous occurrences that simply should not happen, regardless of construction. There were several problems but, most disturbingly, I was waken up at 4am by water dripping from the corner of the ceiling straight to the electronics and outlets on the bedside table. It was not only an annoying, sleep-depriving sound, but simply a fire hazard. When I reported it the next morning to the receptionist, she apologized and nothing more. I believe that this kind of hazards should never happen. I slept very little that night and my enjoyment of the stay and the trip was completely ruined.",2,2018,05,19
124,Fantastic visit at a stunning hotel!,"We had an excellent 4-night stay at The Principal.  In a city filled with outstanding architecture, we were in awe of the beauty and uniqueness of this hotel, both inside and out.  While the renovation efforts continue during their soft launch - we heard occasional noises in our room, and the main restaurants are not yet open - neither were significant enough to change our enjoyment of The Principal. 

From a location perspective, the hotel is immediately across from Russell Square, a quieter area within Bloomsbury, away from many of London's main tourist areas. This was a huge plus for us as we enjoyed evening walks back from the theaters (most 15 minutes away) and restaurants in areas like Covent Garden.  At the same time, the Russell Square tube station is 1 block away from the hotel on the Piccadilly line, which gets you to Heathrow directly or most major west-end destinations in 3 or 4 stops.

Our standard double room was more than sufficient for our needs with beautiful decor and nice touches including a towel-warming rack (with incredible towels) in the bath. 

The gym was larger and brighter than we've experienced in most hotels with fantastic new TechnoGym equipment and lots of free bottled water and towels.  

The ""Fitz"" bar and breakfast restaurant were also enjoyable with a shout out to the Fitz for probably the most unique cocktail selection we've seen in a while.

Last and most notable about the stay were the staff - from check-in to the helpful and informed concierge - they aimed to please and ensure our comfort and enjoyment of our stay, both inside and out of the hotel.  We'd especially like to thank Head Concierge, Conor, and also Sean for their thoughtfulness and great restaurant recommendations.

In sum, this was a 5-star experience for us and we'd highly recommend the Principal for those looking for a personalized and luxurious experience just outside the fray of London's west-end.",5,2018,05,17
124,Premature opening.,"We had read about the reopening of this old but famous hotel now effectively rebranded .
Our over riding feeling was that perhaps it wasn’t quite firing on all cylinder, there is no doubt the staff are most certainly well prepared even if the hotel isn’t . The staff certainly were well disciplined and trained, each and everyone one of those we met said hello with a smile and seem to mean it, something maybe that comes with any hotel reopening although that wasn’t the story when the Savoy reopened, anything but.

It’s hard to comment on the food because to our surprise on checking in, the resturant isn’t open yet .

We had bar food for supper, low tables to eat off ?not a good idea really and if you don’t get fed up with waiting you will regret not ordering a full meal because the ‘starters are so small two mouthfuls is all you get unless you are  not starving, that’s fine.

Breakfast in the coffee shop was outstanding, awesome mushrooms and an obliging chef, fabulous.

Maybe we will come back when they are ready for paying guest to provide a fairer assessment , at the moment it’s all about the enthusiasm of the team who would earn a rating of 9/10.

Of the interior ?  Well it’s  ok, but not breathtaking and the famous stairway to the rooms is incredible with lots of famous history though I couldn’t hel but feel they required more lighting as for me they were all a bit gloomy.

124,Excelent care of solo traveler,"I've decided to write a review of The Principal even though I didn't actuay stay there. We decided to break up my 21-year-old daughter's long haul from Capetown to New York with a 3 night stay in London at The Principal. As parents, you never stop worrying about the safety of a young woman traveling alone and staying in hotels alone. Even before her arrival, the front desk and concierge corresponded all day to coordinate a beautiful welcome treat of champagne and fruit. Her flight came in to Heathrow at 6:30am, and incredibly the Prinicipal managed to check her into a beautiful Superior room at 10:30am!!! We were so relieved to know she could check right in and refresh and relax. My daughter reported superior service from the entire staff as well as prompt room service and tasty breakfasts. She enjoyed a great bathtub and the location can't be beat - right across from Russel Square Underground - all in an exquisite historic building. My husband and I can't wait experience The Principal ourselves.",5,2018,05,16
124,Absolutely brilliant,"My wife, our four year old son and I stayed for three nights at The Principal last week and it was brilliant! 
The staff were super attentive and very kind to our little man (even when he accidentally broke something).
Big shout out to the concierge Conor who was always cool, informative and generous with his time, whether it was an adult or a four year old asking the questions.
Our room was also great: good space to move around in, views over Russell Square, lush fit-out.
Thoroughly recommend this hotel.",5,2018,05,15
124,The name has changed!,I stayed here when it was the Russell Hotel! It is a beautiful place! The lobby is spectacular and the staff were very nice! Don't let anyone get you any taxi but a LONDON TAXI CAB   NO UBER! They tried to rip us off! The night time concierge had booked us a black taxi and the morning bellhop? got us an Uber earlier 6am and they had our luggage loaded and before we could resist we found ourselves inside! The driver had NO METER and while pulling off said the 5 min drive would cost us 15 pounds! I told him we paid 9 pounds at rush hour 3 days prior...I told him to F'n take us back to the Russell or drop us on the street! He took us to the airport and charged us 9 pounds! The Russell is amazing and the food and drinks and very good!,5,2018,05,15
124,"Brand New Rooms, Excellent Service","We stayed here for the first 2 days of our honeymoon and we loved it! The room was very comfortable. Smallish, but that is to be expected in London. The bathroom was done very well.
The service was amazing! We asked for a curling iron and a power converter. They couldn't be nicer and more accommodating. The cafe that was attached to the hotel served vegan items, which was great for my wife.",5,2018,05,15
124,"Small rooms, nice staff, but no attention to detail.","We booked to stay the night at the Principal for a celebration. On booking we had no idea that half the hotel was still not open. We requested a high room with a pleasant view, and told them we were celebrating. 
On check in, we explained again we were celebrating, and as we had tickets for an exhibition, dropped our luggage and dashed. The staff were pleasant, the building especially main foyer was beautiful and ornate. That’s the selling point of the hotel. So even though there was no resturant, and other areas were closed, we were disappointed but positive.
On return, we had a drink in the bar. The waiter was great, after looking at the lacklustre cocktail menu, he suggested one, on the promise if I didn’t like he’d take it away. Can’t say fairer than that! It was nice, I didn’t order a second, but it was drinkable. He and the other bar staff were very attentive. 
Back to our room, had a better look - we didn’t get the high room we requested, (though we were told on check out the rooms above were not ready) One of the cupboards had wires sticking out the wall inside. There was a couple of chips and scratches in the furniture and chipped paintwork already. I think maybe only a few rooms are ready, so have been used and used, even the carpet already was dirty and slightly worn near the bathroom door (it only opened last month!) the room was very small and the bathroom door next to the bed didn’t help. Also, they’re missing some of the expected things a five star hotel room should have:

No dressing table (I had to sit on the floor in front of a full length mirror)
No luggage stand
No bath!!!!
No slippers
No literature/Magazines or books (strange how you miss flicking through them when they are not provided)
Extra pillows
Filthy windows, with building work still on, dusty dirty windows inside and out.
Bathroom scales
Not much space to put toiletries in the bathroom
No turndown service

We mentioned all of the above on check out. We got a sorry and not much else. I’m not trying to be precious, but you expect these in 5* hotels otherwise it then becomes a 3/4*. I’d say at the minute, being kind at best, it’s a 4*. The hotel is very clearly finding its feet. Some of the staff were lovely. There’re certainly worse hotels, but on the whole, we didn’t feel special, or that the hotel was special. Had we known this, we would’ve chose another hotel to celebrate. So disappointed.
The location is good and tube station extremely close. Parking below a hotel opposite is handy. I hope things improve in the future as it could be a great hotel.",3,2018,05,14
124,A thrill every time we walked through the front door!,"Attentive, professional staff who significantly improved our visit.  We've stayed at similar-level hotels in other capitals, and have never before experienced an A-level team such as this. We'll be writing a letter to the General Manager and Head Concierge to praise the staff members by name. 

As preservation architect & planner, we were drawn to book here by the restoration, and yes, it is fantastic! A visible commitment to Britain's design legacy and landscape urbanism. Historic materials and features brought back to life. Modern improvements done with sensitivity. Room layout logical yet inventive; furnishings comfortable & plush, but not overdone. Spacious, decorated elevator foyer on the room floors. Bar was  fashionable & fun. 

Thank you Principal London for supporting us warmly and unequivocally when we received that emergency call.",5,2018,05,14
124,"Excellent stay, but look closely at the bill.","This recently refurbished hotel was instantly welcoming with it's sticking marble entrance hall. All the staff are extremely helpful. Our room was small ish, but very well finished. With an ensuite that was both pleasing on the eye and attractive. And low and behold a tv that is simple to use, joy. We drink in the cocktail bar and were force fed twiglets....usual London drinks prices so no surprise there, but watch the surcharges. 
On check out I was horrified to see I had amassed nearly £20 in charges. Of course this was knocked off at my request, but nevertheless it was shocking seeing how we only had 4 rounds of drinks. The front desk also knocked off a meal that was wrongly allocated to our room. No bother. So learn my lesson CHECK YOUR BILL. The concierge suggested going to a local Italian for our evening meal (name escapes me). FANTASTIC meal.",5,2018,05,14
124,Stunning!,"We stayed at the Principal for one night and the hotel was absolutely incredible. From the attentive staff from the moment we walked, to the interior design and everything in between. 

We checked in and had a cocktail in the stunning Fitz's bar before going to our room. Our room looking over Russel Square was beautifully furnished, the bed was extremely comfortable (the best nights sleep I have had in a long time!) and breakfast in the morning was brilliant - a good and varied spread. 

I cannot fault for a second the level of service we experienced while at this hotel, we were treated so well by the kind and friendly staff. 

I look forward to returning to The Principal at some point in the not so distant future, we loved it and would highly recommend!",5,2018,05,14

This used to be our favourite and we wanted to see what the refurbishment had achieved.We were hoping they had not spoilt it’s wonderful style and atmosphere.We were absolutely delighted, it is fabulous. Great decor, wonderful attentive person centre customer service.Thankyou to Richard who took time to show us round. Great cocktail bar, and the breakfast was special when my wife was treated to a lovely cake and card signed by all the staff in the coffee shop,This hotel is definately worth a visit, we booked again for June. My wife is hard to please and she rated it five star all round, making me a happy man. Thankyou to all the staff at the Principle from a very happy Mr and Mrs Boulton.",5,2018,05,13
124,Stunning hotel and fab staff ,"Just spent a day and night here I got an upgrade to an amazing room, the bar is super cool and I will return when the new palm court lounge is opening in June.  All the staff where fab and friendly and really looked after me, great job guys 😉",5,2018,05,13
124,Birthday Weekend,"Principal London, we were upgraded to a junior suite and would like to thank the hotel, Staff were exceptional have to mention Morton and Stephanie in Fitz bar, and also dancing door staff. 

Cant wait to go back and see the completed Hotel, Great Staff and Hotel. ",5,2018,05,13
124,Fabulous stay in a historic building,"I usually stay in The Rosewood or Ham Yard Hotel, but was attracted by the price of the Principal. It is an amazing building with so much character. 

We were made to feel at home as soon as we walked in by George and he was clearly passionate about the hotel as he described the history of the hotel.

The room was overlooking Russell Square & was perfect for a city break. The service was the impeccable from the breakfast team to the late night bar. Special shout out to Connor who took care of our arrangements. He even called a friend to walk over to a restaurant we wanted to go to, to make our reservation when their phone lines appeared to be down. 

We hope to be back again this November and can’t wait to see the finished product of this hotel.

124,Great hotel in a terrific location,"I can't speak highly enough of this hotel and its excellent staff. The service - from the front door staff, the front desk staff, the breakfast room staff, the bar room staff and the room staff - was uniformly warm and attentive. The room was well appointed and meticulously kept. The hotel is beautifully situated close to the tube station and several great places to visit, such as the British Museum. I found the whole experience to be faultles",5,2018,05,11
124,Bank Holiday treat,"We only spent one night over the May bank holiday weekend but felt like we had been transported back in time. This hotel is simply stunning. I remember this building way back but the refurb of this hotel is something quite special.

Stayed in a superior room and slept so well (I need one of these beds!) Really nicely furnished throughout and nothing is missing. And enough power points wherever you are wish makes a nice change. Good lighting and a great rain shower. bathroom small but really nice decor and again, everything you need. Had a drink in Fitz's, served by a lovely Scottish girl who was so attentive and chatty. Breakfast was in Burr & Co and lots of choice and great food.

All the staff we came in to contact with were so happy to help and seemed so happy to see us.

Will definitely return once the rest of the hotel is open as I can't wait to see The Palm Court as the plans sound very grand.

In summary, stay here it is well worth it and closer than you think to Covent Garden etc.",5,2018,05,11
124,Three days in London,"Hotel is situated in vintage building, but rooms are new and well organised.Staff is very friendly, breakfast is allways fresh and tastey. The only bad side is that they don’t know how to make cappuchino, everything else was amaising.",4,2018,05,09
124,Short but wonderful visit,"We visited the hotel after the grand opening. We were assisted by Gabriel (Italian gentleman) the concierge. He gave us full details about the hotel, its history and the upcoming plans within the hotel.
The place is breathtaking and really it's worth the detour. Perfectly located. The deco is amazing. 

The rates for the opening are great and must be seized. We look forward to coming back...

124,Great experience,"We arrived in London at 5am direct from Australia. What a spectacular building! The reception staff were delightful, arranging our room straight away. Room was comfortable and newly appointed. Furniture is stylish. Below us construction work was continuing on the renovation. It wasn’t too intrusive until our third day (not at night and not insurmountable). Reception immediately moved us to a different room and it was perfect. Sun shone in to both rooms each morning when you pulled back the blackout curtains - yes, London was sunny! The location opposite Russell Square was convenient. The tube is next door and St Pancreas Station just a short walk. A perfect place to explore London. Cool, understated and with an exceptional staff. Stay!",5,2018,05,08
124,Fantastic Hotel and Great Staff,"We stayed at the hotel for 3 nights over the May bank holiday weekend to celebrate my 50th birthday and our eldest son finishing his university degree. Our experience throughout the stay was one of being made to feel very special, the staff in all areas of the hotel are very friendly and provide a very high quality service. Our particular thanks to Alex (Reception) and Ro (Concierge) for helping make our stay extra special and for arranging fantastic restaurant bookings.
My wife and I stayed in a suite and our two sons stayed in a Deluxe double-double room, both rooms were of a very high standard, with very comfortable beds.
We knew that we would be staying during the hotels soft launch period and not all areas of the hotel would be open, from the areas that are open we can see that the hotel has been beautifully renovated, the parts yet to open sound great, The Palm Court looks like it will be a great area to relax. The Principal hotel will for sure be one of London's top 5-Star hotels.
Thank you again to all the staff for helping make our stay in London very special and we look forward to staying again in the future.",5,2018,05,08

The room is medium size with opening french doors, our room overlooking side st. The bed and pillows are extremly comfortable with quality sheets and towells. A larger than usual fridge that they kept stocked with still and sparkling water and small milk. A provided 'tuck box' of daily complimentary snacks, potato chips and kit kat was a nice treat. The staff were friendly and helpful. Russell square station was just around the corner as well as brunswick shopping centre with many restaurants and a waitrose. The decor is beautiful, would definately stay again to experience the finished product.",4,2018,05,08
124,Exceptional Hotel,"We stayed at this hotel last weekend and had a wonderful experience. The hotel has been beautifully renovated in keeping with its history. We stayed in a superior double room which was immaculate, perfect for a family of 4 and decorated to a very high standard. The staff were exceptional and provided excellent service, in particular we’d really like to thank Ana for the lovely surprise that she left for our daughter when we returned to our room, this was really unexpected and thoughtful (it made her weekend!). Also a special thanks to Valter for his fantastic welcome and infectious enthusiasm! It was lovely to hear about the history of the hotel from him. The hotel is perfectly situated for travel anywhere in London and we found it easily accessible by car. It is a really exciting time for the hotel as it nears completion, we will definitely be staying here again on our next visit to London. Thanks again for a wonderful stay! ",5,2018,05,07
124,Amazing Staff & Hotel,"I have only left this hotel today after spending the weekend here I can say its the best hotel ive stayed in for a long time and I love trying new hotels. The hotel itself is beautiful and will look even better when completed and the staff are all fantastic, very friendy make you feel very welcome .We went as a family of three with my little boy who is 2 and being in this hotel made our weekend in London certainly one to remember the location is great aswell. We will return to this hotel for our next trip to London ,thanks to all the staff for making our stay so enjoyable. Sarah",5,2018,05,06
124,Amazing staff!,"Almost certainly the best hotel staff I've ever come across in London - they couldn't have been friendlier or more helpful despite obviously having to cope with a bit more than they could easily handle at this early / partial opening of the newly refurbed hotel. 

My mother and I had a deluxe double double room, which was a little smaller than I expected, and with all mirrors oddly positioned away from the natural light, but it was absolutely spotless; the beds were sumptuously comfortable and the double glazing did its job exceptionally well given constant London traffic outside! 

The bathroom with waterfall shower was fabulous, although a bath would have been nice to have too, but of course they can only work with the space they have in such a lovely old building. 

Things that will undoubtedly improve over time as staff get more used to their hotel: room service and bar menu is not that great - but the breakfast was great and there are plenty of eateries around about. Plus of course their own main restaurant is still to open. The 'tuck box' in the room made us laugh: two small packets of crisps and one kit kat. But hey I need to diet anyway! The cocktails in Fitz's bar are great - but oh so pricey!

The highlight, however, was the staff. Which is how it should be and is - of course - what you remember best afterwards. From organising a bus tour to booking taxis to restaurant advice to helping with bags or even just saying 'good morning' with a smile when we passed by, they were all lovely. Long may that continue!

124,Wonderful hotel,"I stayed one night in the first week of opening and was blown away by the beautiful architecture and interior design, and welcoming atmosphere.  My room was small but cozy with a luxe bathroom and some very thoughtful touches.  I loved the sense of London style with the iconic red telephone and the tuck box full of snacks and treats, lovely toiletries and the most comfortable bed. During my stay, I had cocktails at the glamourous Fitz's, and breakfast at Burr & Co which was relaxed, and easy going.
I love how the hotel is so grand, and the interiors are just spectacular - Tara Bernerd & partners have designed much of the hotel. The marble and historic interior architecture have been beautifully preserved and maintained, and the Victorian origins reinterpreted. But there is a modernity to the hotel that I felt was so refreshing for a London 5 star hotel. It will be exciting to see the opening of the Palm Court and Neptune Restaurants.  Bloomsbury isn't an area I have thought of to stay at recently when I've been in London, but I enjoyed walking through the quiet streets near the Museums to Fitzrovia and it was very convenient for Covent Garden.  I think this hotel is one to watch and will redefine the area.  I'm sure any teething problems will be ironed out smoothly - the staff and management were so attentive and anxious to get it right.",5,2018,05,02
124,Still work in progress with highly motivated and friendly staff,"We spent 3 days/2 nights in this brand new hotel. It has just reopened and shows already its undeniable potential to become a 5-star hotel. We faced though still some issues, which hopefully won’t happen again once the hotel is fully redone:
- our reservation for a double-double room (made in February) was not found in the system and no double-double was still available 
- we were offered a deluxe room instead with an extra bed for our daughter. The room was nice but rather small for this room category 
- the receptionist tried to find the best solution and also kindly offered the breakfast during our whole stay
- we were woken up by hammering sounds at 7:30 just above our room
- the milk in the mini-bar was due, but once we called the reception, they quickly replaced it

What annoyed us the most though was the lack of transparency. We heard on different occasions that the hotel was fully booked, to find out at the end of our stay that only two floors of the hotel were already finished to welcome guests. We would have had more understanding and would have been last frustrated, had we known that right from the beginning. 

As already mentioned we were impressed by the highly professional and friendly staff, doing the impossible to make our stay unforgettable despite the little issues. Everyone was really child friendly and the concierge team tried hard to help us whenever necessary. 

A big thanks to Valter, the doorman, who even surprised our daughter with a little Paddington writing set, after she had told him about having recently watched the movie.

124,The Best Stay in an Iconic Building ,"The Hotel is brand new, it opened April, 16, 2018.

It is the old Russell Hotel, completely refurbished, but keeping the old architecture 

The building is iconic, the decoration is superb and the team is lovely and very responsive. 

Very comfortable rooms (albeit smaller than it should be), good bathrooms and very honest breakfast

The location is the best, close British Museum, underground and the cozy Russell Square. 

Since the operation just started there are minor adjustments that are being made, but with thus team is just a matter o time

I definitely recommend The Principal to a good stay and in London 
",5,2018,04,29
124,Brand spanking new,"Fabulous building housing newly opened Principal. All amazing-room, furnishings, decoration etc. Very helpful attentive staff.
Groovy bar.
Water and milk and a tuck box provided in-room as an extra touch.",5,2018,04,29
124,Bloomsbury Revisited,"In between the the retail mecca of Central London & the hip-and-happening trendy East London, Bloomsbury has been off the radar for way too long, even for Londoners. That's all set to change with the opening of a grand Bloomsbury classic, overlooking Russell Square. A new brand on the hotel scene and brand spanking new multi-million renovation of one of London's original purpose built hotels. 

From the imposing, slightly OTT gothic exterior. to the understated luxury of the public spaces,The Principal has been tastefully re-imagined for todays sophisticated travellers with eclectic tastes. The mix of heritage & contemporary, grand and intimate makes for wonderful bedfellows. The attention to detail in the public spaces, including artfully curated Fitz's bar with a nod to Bloomsbury's creative history works beautifully, while the hotel rooms are tastefully pared-back and luxe, in a palette of timeless neutrals.

The efficient and super friendly service, fashionable staff dress and contemporary soundscape throughout, is perfectly pitched for the location and the times. 

I can't wait to return and experience the next stage of the hotels development, the Palm Court and Neptune restaurant. Me thinks it might be a little harder to get in!",5,2018,04,29
124,Coolest new kid on the block,"I love hotels of all types but understated luxury and friendly service are most important things when it comes to a memorable stay. I stayed at the Principal London the week it opened and I have to admit - for a hotel in its opening week the service, attention to detail, quality of stay was impeccable. I went to university a few stops away at LSE and lived in Fitzrovia so visiting this neighborhood and staying here again brought back many memories and a refreshing outlook for Russell Square.The hotel is extremely close to the British Museum, Charlotte Street, Covent Garden and a wonderful option for those looking for a fun bar to relax in and a great coffee house for the mornings. Kind of reminded me of a New York hotel in many ways with lots of warmth and personality. The bathrooms are lush! You will love it.",5,2018,04,29
124,Brilliant relaunch of a London classic,"Truly exceptional across the board -  check in; room quality, amenities and style; bed comfort (absolute heaven); bartenders at the bar; housekeeping; breakfast. Flawless, efficient and friendly across the board. It was an absolute pleasure to stay here. 

I was a big fan of the historic Hotel Russell, which was renovated into The Principal, and I’m delighted with the thoughtful, classy restoration. The work respects the history of the original grand hotel while breathing much needed new life into the place. 

Well done and congrats. I’ll be back. ",5,2018,04,28
124,Beautiful with exceptional service,"I ended up rolling into The Principal at just gone midnight, exceptionally tired, bedraggled and angry as my previously booked hotel had mucked up the reservation and left me without a room for the night.

From the second I arrived at reception I felt truly welcome and the staff reassured me and made an effort to sort a few issues with room booking very quickly (it’s tricky in most hotel systems to book in after midnight). This only took a couple of minutes and I was escorted to my room by a very nice and attentive staff member who checked I was ok before he left. 

The hotel itself has just been through a refit and as a result it is beautiful. My room was petit (probably the last room left in the hotel at that time) but it was very well appointed,felt comfortable and had some nice touches (and a big TV!). The bathroom and in particular the shower was exceptional.

The placement of the hotel is excellent for covent garden which has lots of nice bars and restaurants on the doorstep and it is essentially next door to the Russell Square tube station entrance (one stop away from Kings Cross St Pancras).

I’d go out of my way to stay in The Principal London again, primarily for the brilliant staff but also for the Hotel itself. I’d give it six stars if I could!",5,2018,04,28
124,Fantastic Hotel,"My wife and I stayed in the Principal London for 3 nights last week. It had only re-opened on the Monday, but we had an amazing stay. 

All the staff we met were without exception, extremely  courteous and helpful without being too intrusive. 

The recent refurbishment is incredible, the hotel has been transformed from a rather tired dated hotel ( that we had previously stayed in) into a beautiful interior design success. Our bedroom and bathroom were tastefully decorated and spacious with both being equipped with everything you needed for your stay.

We had a wonderful cocktail in Fitz’s bar in the evening and a delicious breakfast in Burr and Co where they also serve  coffee, drinks, delicious cakes and sandwiches throughout the day. It’s also worth mentioning the mouth watering  banoffee  croissant which we’d definitely recommend on any visit! 

I’m sure Principal London is becoming one of the best hotels to stay in London and we wish them every success, as judging from our visit they definitely deserve it. 
",5,2018,04,26
124,Perfect stay,"We stayed here and I must say it was lovely room, not huge but beautifully done , staff were excellent and attentive and the barman was friendly and informative in trying to help with my choice of drink

Definitely worth a visit and we will return 

",5,2018,04,25
124,Worth a visit,"I stayed at The Principal London on one of the first days of opening and was extremely impressed by the high quality of the renovation- it's a complete transformation. My bedroom was clean, elegant, and had everything it needed including great toiletries - most importantly, the bed was heavenly. I slept like a baby in high-quality sheets, mattress and pillows. They obviously heavily invested in this area. The bar had a delicious Pinot Noir Rose and a moody midnight lounge vibe that allowed you to relax. I was also really impressed with the staff who very attentive but without being invasive as can often happen. Overall, a brilliant new hotspot in London and a definite for the next London visit.",5,2018,04,24
124,Majestic rebirth,"I'm thrilled that the interior has been sumptuously renovated to match the majestic exterior. Modern meets historical in a sympathetic way.
Inevitable 1st week teething problems meant a room shuffle for us, which was dealt with unending staff professionalism, decorum and generous compensation for the downgrade. The room was perfection, with luxurious comfort in the bed and bathroom. The staff (thanks again Harry) are afforded the time to give an exceptional service...... long may it last when it gets up to 100% capacity. Their excitement and knowledge of the refurbishment is infectious, so I can't wait to see the grand finale.... ballroom. This hotel has long been my favourite for location and exterior majesty and now it's my favourite for everything.",5,2018,04,23
124,The very next day!,"We stayed two nights when the hotel was only one day opened. Fabulous staff, clearly things need bringing in to service and some teething troubles but our suite was very good/ excellent, and Conor the chief concierge tremendously helpful. Highly recommend, not cheap and wait for all the facilities to open.",5,2018,04,22
124,Very promising openning,The hotel openned this week after a significant refurb (with official openning next month). Both the exterior and interior are stunning. The rooms a fitted out very well with some very nice touches. Breakfast was in keeping with the Hotels upgrade. The staff at the Principal were very attentive and keen to make my stay as pleasant as possible. The only reason I have rated a 4 rather than a 5 is due to a number of teething problems (which you might expect on the first week of openning). I would have every confidence that these teething problems will be sorted out in the coming weeks and the hotel will deserve a 5 rating. ,4,2018,04,22
124,Fantastic re-launch of a stunning hotel,"I stayed at the Principal recently for a two day trip.  The summary is that this is a beautifully restored hotel, but I suspect it is a month yet from being ready (hence the drop of a star). You also have to take this review in the context that I checked in on day two of the opening of an effectively new hotel.   

Location: right beside Russell Square tube station, so very central and handy for Euston as well. On a busy street but that was not a problem at all in my room. 

Facilities: I can not really comment too much on this as I only used the room and the bar. However I really liked the bar as far as hotel bars go. This is very well finished, sumptuous  and luxurious without being tacky (which a lot of hotels are... especially a Mal). Great choice of drink and the bar food was good (not great though).  They have partnered with a local gym until the hotel one opens at the end of the month - a nice touch. 

Room: I had a basic double and although it was not that big, for a central city hotel it was perfectly fine.  I have to say that it was probably the best hotel bed that I have ever slept in - heaven! The shower was good and large and the rest of the bathroom nicely finished and adequate.  Tea/coffee etc all in the room with water in the fridge - yay (why do sooo many hotels not give you water in the room!!!). The decor was muted too and whilst my view was of scaffolding I totally understand that they have only completed two floors to date and still have work to do.
Overlapping heavy curtains....again a plus as so many hotels like to leave gaps to create that sliver of sunrise effect that drives me nuts. 

Staff: This is where the review goes from 3 to 4 stars. The staff are great. They are all new and no doubt trying to learn their craft, but they were all attentive, helpful, polite and best of all actually spoke to you when you passed.  From the initial reception (Andrea I think), the porters and bar staff I only had a very positive experience.  Checkout was simple and again they offered a bottle of water as I left...nice touch.

I dropped a star as they are still in build mode, despite this I was pleased to see that they have kept the intrusion to a minimum.  I look for 3 things in a hotel - comfortable bed, clean room, great shower - tick in all those categories and a great staff experience means I will be back.",4,2018,04,22
124,Perfect!!,"I been here first time with my friends.  really good hotel, perfect staff and I really like location of hotel. Nice atmosphere at the hotel. I wish you all the best in your business thank you for all!!",5,2018,04,21
124,Wow what a masterpiece,Had breakfast in their beautiful cafe and a drink in their bar. They just reopened after a 2 year renovation and this place is gorgeous. All old marble and amazing tile work. Room rates in keeping with London and it’s right in the heart of Russell Square just a 10 to 15 minute walk to theaters and Covent Garden. Definitely staying here next trip!,5,2018,04,21
124,"Exquisitely curated, elevated style for all ""the Bright Young Things""","Delighted and tickled by this hotel.  Every item in our room was of quality & luxury & was perfectly picked.  Reflecting the fabulous ambience and personality of the Principle, the staff are amiable and zealous.  What a darling trip in Bloomsbury's new and sparkling Emerald!!!",5,2018,04,21
124,Absolute Gem!,"Loved, loved, loved this hotel! I was really looking forward to my stay at this newly opened hotel and my, I was not disappointed. Firstly, the staff is absolutely amazing, probably the best service I’ve ever gotten at a hotel. You can tell that they are hospitality-oriented, from the front desk to the bellmen to the Burr & Co staff, everyone was great,
especially Irma (I believe) who provided such an outstanding check-in! 

Secondly, the room was nicely appointed, the bed comfortable, the bathroom nice and spacious and, as with the Principal brand, complimentary bottles of water, milk and snacks are offered in the room. 

The location is ideal, i.e. facing Russell Square and a short three-minute walk to Russell Square station. 

The only thing that was not up to par was the breakfast, which I felt was a bit of a let down compared to the rest with runny scrambled eggs and not super tasty. 

Nonetheless, I would definitely and absolutely recommend this hotel and I cannot wait for my next stay!",5,2018,04,21
124,Great stay,"I was very excited to book a room for their opening night, and the door person was very proud of telling me I was the tenth guest to check in.

I knew the hotel was still under construction, so was preparing myself for the fact that I may have construction very near or directly next to my room, but this wasn't the case.  My room was on the 3rd floor, and there were no signs of construction on my floor and no sounds of construction, either at night or in the morning.

You can see bits where they're still finishing off the hotel, but everything that I needed was there. There was a bit of grit and dust on my bedside table, but I'm not going to mark them down for that, as it was minimal, and it's not a food preparation area.

The staff are all warm, sincere and friendly, without exception, and I hope that lasts.  They seem genuinely happy to be there, and that makes for a really good experience as a guest.  If the hotel can maintain that level of enthusiasm and warmth in their staff, they'll have something special.

I didn't try the room service menu, as I knew there were cheaper places to get a good meal nearby, so I dined out.  However, when I returned, I did try the cocktail bar, and - again - was met with warmth and enthusiasm, and given my choice of tables and a cocktail menu. I don't drink alcohol, but staff were very attentive and helpful in creating a mocktail for me.

The bed was comfortable, and the air conditioning worked well, which meant a good night's rest.  The shower was spacious, and the toiletries were great.

If you're looking for something a bit special and happy to spend a little more on your room, I think the Principal is a great choice, and I'm happy to recommend them.

When the renovation is completely finished, it'll look incredible, and if they manage to maintain their staff enthusiasm, it'll be a wonderful venue.",5,2018,04,20
124,WOW!,"I feel incredibly lucky to have stayed in this newly opened hotel this week because I'm sure when word gets out it will be impossible to get a room!  First up the location is amazing and looks directly onto the leafy Russell Square in the heart of London. The building is stunning and they've done an amazing job of taking the historic features a giving them a truly modern and luxurious twist.  It's absolutely immaculate and full of gorgeous little details that made for a special stay. Big shout out to the staff - so many warm welcomes and smiles.  And as for the bed, it was so comfy I could have slept in it for years!  As a business traveller you get tired of average hotels but after a night here I left with spring in my step and a smile on my face.",5,2018,04,20
124,Happy reminiscence,"A lovely traditional old building, formerly the Russell Hotel. Now beautifully updated in contemporary décor.  Staff all very enthusiastic and eager to please and this should become a showpiece hotel, ideally situated, immediately adjacent to Russell Square tube station and a very short walk to British Museum and easy walk to Covent Garden and on to Leicester Square.",5,2018,04,20
124,Excellent when it’s finished,"The refurbishment deserves 5 stars. The staff are also extremely friendly especially in the coffee bar, so once again 5 stars.... BUT

Building work going on right outside my room and along the corridor. Attention to detail in room was poor. Windowsills covered in debris from the renovation. A view of builders discarded rubbish from the window, banging and clattering from the ongoing refurbishment from the rear facing standard rooms. 
The shower is a disaster, water leaks under the shower enclosure door. I had to put the numerous towels provided on the bathroom floor to stop water ingressing in to the bedroom and soaking the carpet.
Once again really nice( but small) bathroom ruined by a lack of attention.  Huge chip in the beautiful tiles next to enclosure fixing. As above, who signed this room off to let!
I think my room was let before anyone checked that it was suitable. Housekeeping is ropey too. Not one member of staff cleaned the room even though I requested it via the door card and being out of the hotel on business for 8 hours
A shame really as these issues in a 5 star hotel are not what should happen... two days into opening or not.

Guests may look through rose tinted glasses at the public rooms... these have been there since the late 19 century!

A real shame because I really like the principal brand.",3,2018,04,19
124,Stunning new hotel,"Staff hospitality and customer service obviously come first at the Principal London- from our arrival to leaving we were very well looked after. Special mention to Walter the doorman for helping with our bags and being generally hilarious! The room was similar to other Principal Hotel rooms and immaculate. We went to Fitz’s cocktail bar both nights of our stay, were again well looked after and had a fabulous time- great relaxing atmosphere! Being right next to Russel Square tube station made it really easy to get to places in the city centre. But surprisingly we never heard any noise from trains- our room was completely quiet. Breakfast was in Burr & Co at the back of the cafe, there’s another room with buffet breakfast laid out. There was a great choice of food- bacon, sausages, eggs cooked to order, vine tomatoes... and cold food included chia pudding, smoked salmon, cheeses, cereals and pastries. Well worth it! I did discover the worlds best hot chocolate too- which I will have to revisit for. The building itself is absolutely stunning, but it’s a shame that neither the Palm Court or Neptune’s restaurant are open yet, because it meant we had to leave to get dinner. I can’t wait to revisit the hotel in the future!",5,2018,04,19
124,Luxxxxxury in London,"This wonderful refurbished  property has blended the historic with contemporary luxury and created a wonderful base to stay in London. With a tube station (Russell Square) just around the corner, moving around the city couldn't be easier. We had a query before we arrived that was responded to quickly and with a warmth not usually associated with accommodation bookings.  On arrival we found ALL staff to be welcoming, professional and very keen to ensure we had a wonderful stay. Most importantly, it has an extremely comfortable bed for a great night's rest after a long flight. Can't recommend highly enough.",5,2018,04,18
124,Perfect night in London ,"A true sample of excellent hospitality.
We were warmly welcomed by the staff and all the people working around.
We had a great evening in the Fitz’s, all the waiters well prepared about drinks and food.
The room are brand new, our beds were so comfortable and with a great view upon Russel Square.
The atmosphere was special, thanks to everyone for my “princess night”!! ",5,2018,04,18
124,Absolutely Stunning,"From your very first step into The Principal, you feel welcome. The customer service was second to none in The Fitz Bar and the cocktails are to die for! Special mention to Morton for making us feel like VIPs. Very much looking forward to my return to explore the rest of this stunning hotel.",5,2018,04,18
124,The cocktails are delicious!,"Went there for the opening on Monday with some work colleagues to check the Fitz's bar.  The attention that went into decorating the rooms in this bar... it's just beautiful. Even the staff have stylish floral shirts to add to the vibe. The staff are extremely friendly and seem to know everything about the menu, which is good because they'll find you a drink that suits your taste. Morten waited our table and suggested I first have the Orlando, which was a fresh pineapple daquiri (delicious), and then the Baby Babel, which is probably the most tasty cocktail I've ever tried (it's very sweet, but my god it's like a dream). 

I'll definitely be going back with friends to try out the rest of the cocktail menu and the rest of the hotel!",5,2018,04,18
124,A touch of elegance,"My partner and I recently stayed at the Principal Hotel on Russell square after it's recent rennovation. The experience was outstanding. From the friendly and knowledgeable front of house staff to the beautiful glitzy entrance hall, the hotel exudes glamour and class.

After checking in and getting comfortable, we went to the Fitz bar for some cocktails. They were truly exquisite. The bar staff are very knowledgeable and passionate about the drinks on offer and helped us decide what to try. 

We stayed in a deluxe room and it was very classic in style. A huge extremely comfortable bed led to a great nights sleep. Shower pressure was perfect and for once there were plugs by the bedside!

I would definitely stay again, highly recommended.",5,2018,04,18
124,Stunning hotel with fantastic hospitality,"A group of us went to the official opening of the hotel on 16th April. We had drinks in the stunning Fitz bar. The staff were simply fantastic. Hospitality is clearly their passion. Our waiter was Morton and he made the effort to remember all of our names and was very knowledgeable on the drinks menu. The host at the door was chatty and engaging. The venue overall looks stunning from what we can see.

Would be very happy to come back again.",5,2018,04,18
124,Historic place with excellent location,"If you are a history lover, you must stay here. From the lovely exterior, to the story of similarities of dinning rooms with the Titanic and the lovely bronze dragon in the stairs this hotel is wonderful. Plus, the tube station is around the corner, the British Museum, UCL, Oxford street and Kings Cross are at a walking distance.",5,2018,01,29
124,Perfect stay,"The stay at the hotel was wonderful. The staff was very friendly, attentive and helpful, especially Estefania. The facilities are beautiful and what caught my attention the most was the cleanliness of the entire hotel: rooms, dining room, common spaces... I would definitely repeat the experience if I returned to London.",5,2024,03,25
124,Stylish hotel with charm,"I had to go to London for a few days for a conference and was looking for a pleasant hotel with character and ambience and stumbled across this beautiful hotel while surfing. I was immediately fascinated by the architecture of this magnificent building, as well as the interesting history - so I thought I'd treat myself to it. And I was not disappointed.
I had a few questions before the trip that were answered promptly, friendly and reliably. I felt warmly welcomed as a guest in advance. During the check I was looked after by Dorine, a very competent, hard-working employee.
I had arrived in the morning and they made sure that my luggage was kept safe while I was able to leisurely stroll through the British Museum, which was just a few minutes away.
When I came back, my luggage was already in my room. My room was more spacious than I expected. The bed was exceptionally comfortable and I slept well. The bathroom was also a good size.
The room and bathroom were very clean!

For me, the absolute highlight of this magnificent hotel, in addition to the very friendly and helpful staff, is the extraordinary architecture of the building, the magnificent marble columns, the staircase, the mosaic work and the lead crystal windows. My tip: pay attention to the small details, it's worth it. In a showcase next to the reception you can find some older contemporary documents about the history of this house.

Breakfast was served in the brasserie. Anyone who had special requests could choose from the menu in addition to the extensive buffet. A tip, try the little lamb sausages - they are delicious.
In the afternoon between 5 and 6 p.m. a glass on the house was served, once on the ground floor - in the hall that was used for a wedding event during the day - the atmosphere was enchanting. On another day there was a glass of wine on the first floor in the gallery between the beautiful marble columns - it was quieter, quieter, but very relaxing after a strenuous day when you just feel like resting.

In front of the hotel is Russell Square, a small oasis with nice benches to relax.
Another advantage, even if you have to ignore the dinginess of the London subway, right behind the hotel is the Russell Square subway station, where the Piccadilly Line stops and takes you to London Heathrow Airport in around 50 minutes.
Bus number 91 stops next to the hotel and goes directly to Trafalgar Square.

My conclusion: I really felt like a valued guest in this hotel and I felt very comfortable. I hope I get the opportunity to come to London again, then this hotel would definitely be my first choice - I would love to stay there again!",5,2024,03,21
124,This time only problems,"I was a regular guest. Very nice rooms (King Studio Suite Park View) with a nice bathroom. Problems this time: 1. Heating doesn't work (only fixed after a second call to reception and complaint). 2. Coordination between reception and Fitz Bar in the hotel doesn't work (table is promised but then not available). 3. Staff in the Fitz hotel bar very unfriendly, especially doorman. 4. Telephones in the room don't work well (just static). 5. Breakfast at Grace (very nice staff) more on the level of a Holiday Inn. Manager contacted us today and apologized, hence two stars.",2,2024,01,27

Non abbiamo fruito della colazione poichè siam partiti prestissimo, ma avremmo gradito fare in room dining, ma la scelta era limitatissima.

Personale gentile, preparato. Non tornerei",3,2022,12,19
124,Soggiorno eccellente,"L'hotel mantiene tutte le sue promesse: ottima posizione, camera confortevole, ben disegnata e ben arredata, personale cortese ed attento. Ottima la colazione che predilige la qualità alla quantità e che viene preparata espressa. Un ottimo posto in cui soggiornare a Londra",5,2022,12,17
124,Bellissimo hotel. Torneremo!,Abbiamo trascorso un week end in questo Hotel di fascino con personale meraviglioso! In particolare Sara e Cristina sono state di grande aiuto e supporto accogli di ogni ns richiesta e soddisfacendola. Anche la ristorazione è stata buona. Torneremo sicuramente,5,2022,11,27
124,Großartiges Hotel mit unbeschreiblich freundlichem Team,"Beruflich bin ich immer mal wieder in Hotels unterwegs und auch wenn ich privat verreise bevorzuge ich stets die guten Hotels der IHG Gruppe. Als ich nun diesen Trip gebucht hatte, war direkt klar, dass ich in diesem Kimpton Hotel schlafen möchte.

Und ich wurde nicht enttäuscht. Das Hotel befindet sich in einer super Lage und sticht durch das tolle Design heraus. Das historische Gebäude ist wirklich beeindruckend und man kommt nicht aus dem Staunen raus wenn man durch die Lobby, die Gänge oder das Zimmer läuft.

Was allerdings das eindrucksvollste war, war das durchweg hilfsbereite und stets freundliche Personal. Man versteht im Kinpton, dass man sich durch guten Service von der Konkurrenz absetzen kann. Man merkt, dass die Mitarbeiter Spaß an der Arbeit und mit dem Team haben. 

Macht alle unbedingt so weiter!",5,2022,11,13
124,Hotel fabuloso. Trato excepcional.,"Nos alojamos 5 miembros de la familia. El hotel es precioso. Por dentro y por fuera.  La habitación muy bonita y el baño también. Muy bien localizado. Los desayunos muy buenos. La atención de los empleados y su amabilidad, excepcional. Empleados como Silvia o los camareros que nos atendieron en el desayuno (siento no recordar sus nombres), ha sido realmente buena. Volveré sin duda al hotel, que aunque caro, merece la pena.",5,2022,11,09
124,Hotel de referencia en Londres,"Estancia increíble en este hotel, totalmente reformado y con una gran cantidad de opciones de bares y restaurantes dentro del hotel. El gimnasio es espectacular y con la última tecnología. La ducha y la cama de la habitación son la joya de la corona, junto con la estatua de Lucky George en la planta 2 que tiene una historia memorable y que redondea el concepto y el branding de este hotel Kimpton",5,2022,11,06
124,Estancia perfecta,"Pasamos 5 noches en el hotel y fue una experiencia buenísima.  Nos encantó la ubicación, súper céntrico junto al museo britanico  y con una parada de metro de la línea picadillo justo en la puerta.  La habitación era perfecta, camas súper cómodas, y limpieza excelente. El desayuno espectacular y el servicio de hostess cada mañana muy profesional. Cenamos  una noche y tomamos un cóctel en el bar y ambas experiencias muy buenas. El personal es muy atento y cercano. Sin duda lo recomiendo y volveremos. ",5,2022,10,18
124,Nicht mein Favorit,"Sehr schön und opulent gestaltetes Hotel, gute Lage nahe Russell Square. 
Die Zimmer haben eine angenehme Größe - Aussicht oftmals (londontypisch) eingeschränkt (bis inkl. 3.Stock). Badezimmer mit tollen flauschigen Handtüchern.
Leider relativ laute Klimageräte im Hof - die durchgehend vernehmbar brummen, was meinen Schlaf sehr beeinträchtigt hat. 
Frühstücksbüffet ist gut, während die Sitzmöbel zum Essen nicht geeignet sind. 
Das Personal war freundlich und bemüht - allerdings wirkte mir dieses zu „aufgesetzt“.",3,2022,10,11
124,Precioso hotel con muy buen servicio,"Precioso edificio, con nuevas Instalaciones. Muy buenas habitaciones, con una limpieza impecable y un personal excelente y amable.
Nos ha gustado mucho, lo recomiendo.

124,Wundervolles Hotel,"Sehr charmante Atmosphäre, überwältigende Architektur, very Britisch! Lage sehr gut direkt an U-Bahn Piccadilly-Line, Personal engagiert und freundlich. Frühstück im wunderschönen Galvin Restaurant sehr gut. Zimmer groß für London und gemütlich, sehr bequeme Betten. 
Alles in allem ein perfekter Platz in London für uns. 

Negativ nicht wirklich etwas, höchstens die mangelnde Ablagefläche im Bad.",5,2022,09,13
124,Excelente hotel,"Excelente ubicación y el personal muy amable. A destacar Diorka en el turno de desayunos. Una persona muy profesional y amable. El servicio de bici gratuito es una fantástica ventaja de esta marca, ya que nos permitió conocer toda la ciudad. Sin duda regresaremos.",5,2022,03,28
124,Hotel lussuoso in posizione strategica,"L’hotel ha una struttura architettonica imponente e suggestiva. Gli interni sono lussuosi e curati. Servizio di alto livello e personale cortese e disponibile.
Dispone di una palestra molto grande ed attrezzata.
La colazione ha una base al buffet e piatti più elaborati alla carta: tutto ottimo e di alta qualità.
La nostra camera era standard al primo piano: curata nei dettagli e negli arredi ma un po’ piccola, soprattutto il bagno al limite del vivibile.
Comunque hotel consigliato anche per la posizione davvero strategica (sulla linea metropolitana Picadilly).
Ci ritornerei (magari scegliendo altra camera).",5,2022,03,13
124,"Elegante, personale gentilissimo.","Albergo elegante ed accogliente, arredo lussuoso e con personalità. Personale gentilissimo e disponibile . Pozione discreta a nord del centro. Unica cosa migliorabile il buffet della prima colazione, decisamente migliorabile. Consigliato.",5,2022,02,28
124,Capodanno,"Abbiamo soggiornato in questo splendido hotel per capodanno.
La struttura è molto curata ed elegante, la colazione molto ricca e abbondante con preparazione di piatti caldi su ordinazione (Buonissime le uova alla benedict).
Personale molto cordiale e giovane. 
Posizione ottimale, in zona tranquilla a pochi passi da Soho e Piccadilly.
Le camere sono ben arredate e pulite. Molto bello il bagno e in particolare la doccia grande. 
Consigliatissimo! 
Simone",5,2020,01,22
124,Gran hotel con excelente atención y buen precio para Londres,"Llegando tuvimos problemas por la agencia /AmericanExpressMéxico Viajes pero el personal del hotel (Ramón) se portó de primera e hizo todo lo posible para resolver los inconvenientes. Nos obsequió el desayuno y nos apoyó con un cambio de habitación. El desayuno vale mucho la pena tomarlo, y las chicas del restaurants son lindísimas. Si vuelvo a Londres definitivamente me quearía acá. El metro está a menos de una cuadra además de que está muy bien ubicado.",5,2019,11,27
124,Wunderschönes Hotel das besonders von Asiaten frequentiert wird.......,"Wir hatten das Fitzroy aufgrund der Architektur, Ausstattung und Lage gebucht (Russelsquere Park gegenüber, Metrostation um die Ecke). Das Haus ist ein Traum (Architekt war für die Gestaltung der Titanic verantwortlich); der Service war sehr gut und die Suite wunderbar. Ein wenig sonderbar fanden wir die Unmengen von Asiaten die sich in diesem Hotel befanden, welche uns aber nicht wirklich gestört hatten. Wir können das Haus empfehlen und werden warscheinlich im Mai wieder dort absteigen.",4,2019,10,25
124,Kurzer Besuch in London ,"Nach Amsterdam das nächste Hotel aus der Kimpton Reihe in Europa.
Die Zimmer sind sehr großzügig und modern ausgestattet. Das Bad lässt auch keine Wünsche offen. Ein separates WC wäre wünschenswert. Die Lage des Hotels ist zwar Zentral aber etwas entfernt von den Hotspots. Die U-Bahn ist nur wenige Meter vom Hotel entfernt. Der Service ist sehr aufmerksam und auch hier ,wie auch in den anderen Hotels dieser Gruppe ,ab 17:00 Uhr die Wein beziehungsweise Sozialstunde in der Lobby.",5,2019,09,29
124,Muy bueno aunque habitaciones pequeñas ,"Este hotel es encantador. Está lleno de detalles por todos lados que le dan un toque “cozy”. Las habitaciones son pequeñas pero cómodas y agradables. El baño es de buen tamaño y tiene artículos como shampoo, crema, acondicionador de muy buena calidad. 
El staff fue agradable y servicial en todo momento. Está situado a media cuadra de la estación de metro que te lleva a todos lados. 
",4,2019,06,12
124,"Tolles, modernes Hotel an bester Lage - ideal für einen Städtetrip!","In diesem Hotel wird Persönlichkeit gross geschrieben! Sehr moderne und grosszügige Anlage mit Stil und Ambiente welche sich im bestem Zustand präsentiert. Die Lage gleich an der U-Bahn Station (keine 80 Schritte) und mitten in der City ist top (zentrale Anbindung via Underground, Bus oder auch zu Fuss). Der Service überzeugt, insbesondere auch aufgrund der persönlichen Note. Den Concierge-Service haben wir rege genutzt und war sehr wertvoll. Ein Hotel mit Wohlfühlambiente - auch für unsere beiden Kinder. Wir werden gerne wiederkommen!",5,2019,06,12
124,Muy buen hotel,"Estoy haciendo el check out del hotel. Y la verdad fui tratada muy bien! Todos muy cordiales y respetuosos. 
Muy limpio todo! 
Cumplieron con mis espectativas. 
Precio calidad esta perfecto. 
No le pongo las 5 estrellas, ya que su ubicación no es muy buena. 
Si o si dependes del metro o uber. 
No es para ir caminando. 
Pero lo recomiendo👌🏻",4,2019,05,14
124,Perfekte Wahl!,"Dieses stylische Hotel ist ja wohl recht frisch renoviert, und das sieht man auch. Alles sehr hochwertig. In fast jedem Hotelbad wird man ja meist irgendetwas finden, was einem nicht gefällt, wie verkalkte Wasserhähne oder nicht mehr ganz frische Silikonfugen. Hier nicht! In einem anderen Review habe ich gerade gelesen, das Personal sei unfreundlich gewesen. Kann ich nicht bestätigen, im Gegenteil. Ich war eher erstaunt, dass hier wirklich kein einziger ""Querschläger "" dabei war. Von der Rezeption über Reinigungspersonal bis Kellner fand ich wirklich alle Mitarbeiter außergewöhnlich freundlich, im positiven Sinne kommunikativ und angenehm im Umgang. 
Fußweg vom Hotelausgang zur U-Bahn etwa 100m, der Russel Square ist auch sehr verkehrsgünstig gelegen. 
Insgesamt eine ganz klare Empfehlung!!",5,2019,05,11
124,Soggiorno londinese di alto livello,"Il nostro soggiorno presso questo bellissimo hotel ha rispettato tutte le nostre aspettative. L’hotel è vicinissimo alla fermata della metro “Russel Square”, quindi ben collegato con il cuore della città, e a due passi dal British Museum. La struttura, un edificio storico da poco ristrutturato, è davvero bello e caratteristico con un fascino particolare che lascia subito incantati.
La nostra stanza, una camera base, non era grandissima (comunque in linea con gli standard di Londra) ma molto silenziosa e ben pulita (peccato per la moquette...)
Unico neo della nostra permanenza qui la colazione: purtroppo lo spazio adibito ad essa non era adeguato al numero di persone presenti e spesso abbiamo dovuto fare la fila prima di poter accedere alla sala e aspettare che gli altri commensali si alzassero da tavola (cosa che, essendo in vacanza e senza fretta, abbiamo accettato con tranquillità, ma non può essere considerato un servizio adatto ad un hotel a 5 stelle). Abbiamo in generale notato a colazione un servizio più disattento e lo stesso cibo presente era discreto, ma non eccezionale.
Nota di merito ai Concierge, sono stati veramente un prezioso supporto nell’aiutarci a organizzare le nostre serate. Varrebbe la pena tornarci anche solo per l’attenzione al cliente.",4,2019,04,29
124,"Grazie, grazie a tutto il personale....","Sorprendente la bellezza dell’edificio che costituisce la pelle esterna di questo avvolgente ed accattivante hotel di lusso a Londra. Ho amato tutto: la hall, con i suoi materiali, i colori e l’eleganza tangibile ma non sfacciata. Il servizio erogato, dall’accoglimento alle varie persone che ho incontrato durante il soggiorno le quali tutte mi hanno sorriso o chiesto di eventuali necessità o bisogni. La camera “Urban”, dalle dimensioni ridotte ma sufficienti per garantire un soggiorno qualitativamente superiore alla media di htl della medesima categoria. Che dire....grazie, grazie a tutto il personale, che sembra amare ed apprezzare il proprio lavoro...oltre a sperare di tornare durante il mio prossimo viaggio a London city.",5,2019,02,13
124,Habitación impecable y excelente atención. El desayuno: un fiasco,"El edificio fue minuciosamente restaurado y realmente es un lujo caminar por el lobby. La habitación impecable, bien calefaccionada, con todos los elementos que uno espera en un hotel de estas características: caja fuerte, jarra eléctrica, plancha. Curiosamente las toiletries son propias de un hotel de 2 estrellas: frascos de plástico tamaño familiar que se rellenan día a día. Mi habitación daba a un patio interno, y a pesar de la ventana doble se oía una vibración como de un generador, o algún motor.  
Una noche pedí room service. Según el menú, las cervezas tiradas se eligen en el bar, que una vez que bajé me enteré de que solo ofrece dos tipos de cerveza tirada. Le expliqué a la chica que recepciona el bar que iba a pedir room service y quería elegir una pinta de cerveza. En lugar de tomar el pedido, me entregó un vaso de cerveza y me hizo firmar el cargo. Le pregunté si eso era una pinta, y me respondió que no, pero que no tenían vasos más grandes. Por no discutir, firmé el cargo y me fui a la habitación con la cerveza en la mano (que tendría que haber llevado el personal del hotel), y luego pedí la comida. 
Me encantaría volver pero después de la mala experiencia con el bar y con el desayuno (capítulo aparte en comentarios sobre Neptune), creo que la próxima vez elegiría otro hotel",4,2019,01,20
124,Molto da migliorare,"Comoda la posizione , personale gentile e cordiale. Stanze sottodimensionate , colazione non all’altezza della categoria dell’hotel. Pulizia della camera durante il soggiorno frettolosa e non accurata. A parità di prezzo strutture più interessanti.",3,2018,12,28
124,"Unico, superconfortevole e bellissimo","Uno dei migliori hotel in Città che la mente possa desiderare. Spettacolare architettura Vittoriana, una sala da the’ con un giardino interno e ulivi bellissimi, bar e ristoranti ottimi e accoglienti. Qualità del servizio e del cibo, superlativa. Ci hanno assegnato una Suite, non grande, ma con camino, 2 bagni e letto a baldacchino. Tutto impeccabile, funzionale ma bellissimo al punto che abbiamo cenato con il Room service in camera data l’atmosfera che c’è. Peccato perché l’unica pecca è proprio lì dato che il menù del room service è limitato e non a livello dell’hotel, come del resto il contenuto del minibar. ",5,2018,11,04
124,Hotel stupedo,"Ho soggiornato in questo albergo nei primi giorni di ottobre, e mi sono trovata benissimo. Le camere molto belle, pulite e spaziose. Il personale gentilissimo, cortese e molto disponibile.

Colazione top, con doppia possibilità nei due locali a disposizione. Davvero un’espereinza notevole.",5,2018,09,26
124,Alucinante,"Uno de los mejores hoteles que he visitado. Tiene una gran ubicación pues encuentra a unos metros de la estación de Russell Square o St. Pancras  con lo cual la movilidad es buenísima.
La atomósfera del hotel es increíble pues es un edificio antiguo pero con todas las comodidades de un hotel moderno. 
El servicio es de primera clase. Llegamos temprano, antes del check in y en las dos veces que nos hospedamos ahí tenían una habitación lista para nosotros. Lo cual se agradece sobre todo cuando vas llegando de un viaje largo, como era nuestro caso. 
No tomamos ningún alimento pero los restaurantes y el bar se ven increíbles. Es un lugar al que regresaría seguro!",5,2018,09,14
124,Excelente hotel en Londres,"Hemos pasado tres días en este fabuloso hotel y ha sido todo perfecto. La habitación es amplia, silenciosa,  y las camas son muy cómodas, lo que garantiza un buen descanso. El personal del hotel está integrado por personas jóvenes, muy eficientes y dispuestos a ayudar en todo momento, en especial queremos agradecer a Valter (doorman) y a Lucía (desayunos) por su atención y amabilidad,  asi como al personal de recepción. Es la segunda vez que nos alojamos en este hotel, y si en el futuro viajamos de nuevo a Londres sin duda volveremos al mismo. Un diez.",5,2018,09,02
124,Magnifico hotel,"L'hotel è spettacolare.

All'esterno è uno degli edifici più belli del centro di Londra e di notte raggiunge il massimo del fascino.

All'interno è stato completamente ristrutturato ed ha uno stile moderno che richiama però gli elementi storici della struttura anche se a volte rischia di dare l'impressione di essere su un set cinematografico.

La camera graziosa e cool, il bagno segue lo stile dell'esteticamente impeccabile ma poco funzionale e dal sapore leggermente finto.

Il personale, tranne pochi individui, non l'ho reputato molto professionale ed è un peccato perché rovina un po' l'esperienza.

E' stata la prima volta nella mia vita in cui al check-in mi è stato fornito direttamente il foglio che ho dovuto compilare a mano inserendo i dati del mio passaporto, le persone che hanno fatto con me il check-in sono state accompagnate in camera mentre a me è stata semplicemente fornita la chiave, con un leggero imbarazzo nell'ascensore quando, tutti insieme, osservavamo la evidente differenza di trattamento.

A Londra vengo spesso per lavoro e vorrei lasciare un caro Hilton che comincia ad essere poco affidabile, avrei bisogno di un hotel che diventi come una seconda casa e nel mio prossimo viaggio gli darò un'ulteriore opportunità sperando di ricevere un'attenzione più adeguata perché la struttura merita una seconda occasione.",4,2018,08,28
124,Wunderschön und gediegen!,"Das Principal präsentiert sich renoviert und sehr geschmackvoll ausgestattet. Schöne Zimmer mit wunderbaren Betten, ein moderner Frühstücksraum mit reichhaltigem Buffet und sehr nettes Personal sagen für einen rund um entspannten Aufenthalt im hektischen London.",5,2018,08,06
124,Migliore 5 stelle a Londra! Bellissimo,"Esperienza eccellente. Ho pernottato in questo fantastico Hotel giusto dopo l’apertura e devo dire che nonostante ciò’ tutto e’ stato perfetto. La struttura e’ davvero imponente ed all’interno tutto e’ curato nei minimi dettagli. La camera era spaziosa e di tutt’altro livello rispetto agli altri 5 stelle in cui ho pernottato a Londra. Il letto comodissimo e un bagno principesco. Tutto il personale con cui sono stato in contatto si e’ dimostrato di una disponibilità’ eccezionale (sopratutto la ragazza spagnola alla reception, Imma!). Nota aggiuntiva per il bellissimo bar Fitz’s, davvero fantastico (consiglio le varie versioni del Negroni per gli amanti de cocktail). Il tutto in una posizione eccellente per visitare la città’, con la stazione della metro giusto di fronte all’ingresso. In definitiva direi la migliore esperienza degli ultimi anni!",5,2018,08,04

Salotto, 2 bagni , letto a baldacchino, vasca in camera, mobile bar, gin corner, Tecnologia all’avanguardia....
 Colazione ricca con croissant da gran boulangerie  (simili a quelli di Paul), angolo bio, uova , salmone , formaggi etc.                                                             Ci siamo goduti il soggiorno fino all’ultimo minuto (per fortuna Londra la conosciamo bene😜)!!!",5,2018,07,27
124,Fantastico,"No hay otra palabra para describirlo. Su ubicación es buenísima, muy cerca del British y también de Oxford street, pero con buena combinación de metro y bus.

He lamentado no poder pasarme una noche por el club, una de las noches tocaba un grupo de jazz que sonaba espectacular.
Volveremos seguro!",5,2018,07,08
124,Tutto perfetto,"Sebbene vi siano ancora dei lavori (in quanto l’hotel è stato recentemente inaugurato), questi non hanno minimamente interferito con il mio soggiorno: la camera era silenziosa e arredata con gusto, mentre la colazione era varia e buonissima!
Ma ciò che rende speciale questo albergo è il personale: sono stati molto gentili e disponibili, in particolar modo Gabriele! C’è stato un problema con la mia prenotazione e si sono tutti attivati per risolverlo, offrendomi anche l’upgrade da camera singola a camera doppia!
Lo consiglio",5,2018,06,01

124,The Principal London: l'unica cosa bella di una vacanza andata malissimo!,"Sono tornato con la famiglia in questo albergo per la terza volta ed ho ritrovato, anche dopo il restauro, l'ambiente elegante ed un personale gentile ed efficiente.

La posizione dell'albergo è molto favorevole sia a chi predilige la cultura (il British Museum è a 5 minuti di cammino), sia a chi preferisce lo shopping (si arriva in Oxford street in 10 minuti).

Purtroppo all'arrivo, appena usciti dall'aeroporto, mia moglie ha avuto un incidente ed ha dovuto passare tutta la vacanza in ospedale.

Tutto lo staff si è impegnato per rendere il mio soggiorno più gradevole possibile, nonostante l'incidente, ma mi permetto di segnalare l'impegno particolare di, Francesco e Gabriele, che hanno fatto di tutto per rendere indimenticabili le uniche 24 ore trascorse da mia moglie in albergo e che, insieme a Conor, mi hanno dato una mano a risolvere i problemi logistici legati al rientro in Italia in sedia a rotelle.

Grazie di cuore, ragazzi!   Appena possibile torneremo al Principal per fare la vacanza che non siamo riusciti a fare questa volta - contateci!

                                                                                            Andrea e Fiorella Manetti",5,2018,05,12
