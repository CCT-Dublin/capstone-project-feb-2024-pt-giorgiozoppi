123,Exceptional stay in Central London! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️,"5 Star Service at the Marylebone!
I went to the front desk one evening to ask how early I need to leave the hotel to catch an early train to Windsor. Princess and Jhalak offered a wake up call, they ordered me a taxi and they arranged to have a to go breakfast waiting including specific coffee orders for my wife and I. This was probably the best service I’ve received at a hotel. On top of that the location couldn’t be better, the room was large and very well appointed, and the amenities were excellent. Would definitely stay again and recommend to anyone looking for a boutique hotel in central London!",5,2024,10,19
123,Lovely stay for our family at The Marylebone,"We spent five nights at this delightful hotel.  It was a great base for our family of five, all of whom loved their stay.  

The hotels is in a perfect location -- a nice street right in the middle of Marleybone -- which looks and feels like the London out of a movie.  Lots of small shops and good restaurants.  Small parks near by that our 4 year old loved -- while also being in walking distance to famous Hyde and Regent Parks.

The hotel itself has a great boutique feeling.  The staff really gets to know you, and the rooms are charming.  (Being London hotel rooms, they are on the smaller size, but the design takes this into account.  They even figured out how to get full bathtubs in the bathrooms.)  Our kids loved the breakfast (and became addicted to British back bacon).   The attached restaurant, 108, has nice food.  The room service menu mirrors that of the restaurant, so you aren't just getting basic room service meals.  This could be an issue if your kids are used to chicken fingers, etc.  But we loved having real food come to the room.

The staff were great -- helpful, attentive, communicative.  We came a day early and were prepared to have to switch rooms on day two, but the hotel figured out how to keep us in our rooms and not move.  Stan -- who works at the front in the evenings was especially great.  He saw to our every need, really went out of his way.  When we arrived on night one late, our kids really wanted pizza.  I wasn't able to sign up for a delivery service or an online take away order without a UK cell and he volunteered to let me use his and helped us set up the order.  When we had issues in our room or needed a drink he was right there ready to help.  Everyone was great but he stood out.  Whether we needed a cab or advice of a bucket of ice, it was all easy and fast.

If you are traveling with your family, try and book early.  That way the hotel can guarantee that you will be in connecting rooms.  Ours shared a common entry before leading into two rooms.  These do seem to get taken, so best to book well in advance.

Also, I would recommend booking studio suite rooms if you can, as these have extra sitting space and just a little more room.  For a family as big as ours it made sense to have two connected studio suites.  If you are traveling on your own or as a couple, a regular room will be fine.  But if you can afford it, go one up to studio suite.

We will def return to this delightful spot.",5,2022,08,18
123,London wouldn’t be the same if we didn’t stay at The Marylebone Hotel!,"It’s always a special occasion, because of the people who work there. Adrian the Concierge knows all of our family so well and nothing is too much to ask. He has made every special occasion even more memorable. Thank you Adrian for your attention to detail and making us feel part of the family at The Marylebone.",5,2024,10,14

123,Thanks to amazing hospitality,"Had a lovely experience. Would like to thank Jhalak who played a key role in making our stay memorable.

123,My Marylebone expirience,"My daughter is just starting college in London, so my hunsband and I came to organize all the details. Its not easy to say goodbye but Marylebone felt like home. The location is fantastic and the service is amazing. Adrian, the concierge booked the best places and helped us with everything. He was fantastic. The whole team is great! Specially Jojo, who was incredibly kind to offer us support in this important moment. I trully recomend the hotel and will be back soon!",5,2024,10,02
123,Incredible location and super accommodating staff!,"A 4.5 out of a 5 star for sure! The staff from check in to the concierge to the bell hops were wonderful..Spot on with tips on local spots, hotel amenities, reservations, they were very warm and accommodating. The location which is equidistant between Bond Street and Regent’s Park tube is awesome…Heart of Maryleborne, easy to Mayfair and Belgravia spots, great area for walking and shopping, etc. Bars and attached restaurant were well appointed  and food/beverages were great…Great pool, steam/sauna, and easy to access. Only downside was that the room was tiny even for European standards…Thoughtful on the storage design, queen bed, and bedding/linens were wonderful, but the  little things…No luggage racks and the bathroom was not as tidy as the rest of the hotel…very tight, a little touch up needed on paint and the door frame, etc…nitpicky for sure! 

Bottom line, the place was great, the location and staff were top drawer no question!",4,2024,09,30
123,"Lovely location, very comfortable hotel and great service too!","The experience at Marylebone hotel was excellent even before arriving.  I went to London with my golf club and we had one day that was totally flexible for touring outside of the city. I contacted the concierge named Joao before arriving to arrange a private tour to Stonehenge and Bath for a group of 6. He was so incredibly helpful and paid excellent attention to our requests to make it a perfect day. He reserved a Mercedes which had a driver and a guide, Shadi and Ulrich respectively. They were superb. Well worth the cost which was above what you would pay for a large group. Ulrich was amazing. He was encyclopedic and very pleasant. 
More about the hotel: ALL of the staff was warm and welcoming. Efficient too. ?The restaurant where we had breakfast had terrific food. Our server Beata handled our large group pleasantly and efficiently. The hotel has a pretty bar and multiple cozy areas to enjoy a drink or conversation. 
The hotel is near High Street shopping, a lot of restaurants and bars but it never feels congested. 
Enjoy your stay!",5,2024,09,29
123,My London experience,"The hotel is in an excellent location, near the market. Prices are not cheap. The personel very polite, and i have to give my thanks to the reciptionist Mr. Sagar for his exceptional service to us. A special remark for rooms facing the side of the first floor that are not to the standards of that hotel.",4,2024,09,28
123,Amazing and wonderful experience,"Had a great stay at The Marylebone, and a special shoutout to Shabz at checkout. She was super professional but also so bubbly and friendly—just the kind of energy you want before leaving! The manager even gave me a card to leave a review for her, which says a lot about how much they value their staff. You can really feel the positive vibes from the whole team. Great hotel with a great culture. Definitely recommend!",5,2024,09,26
123,Great experience,"Just gotta say, huge thanks to the team at The Marylebone, especially Jhalak and Alex. These two were pulling 12-hour shifts, and they were STILL so friendly and helpful every single time I saw them. It’s crazy how they kept the energy up. Feels nice. Hospitality is not an easy industry.",5,2024,09,24
123,Amazing experience,"Stayed here for work and the hotel itself is nice, but what really impressed me was how the staff worked together. Especially Jaluck, Ubin, and Palashaa,—I overheard them checking in on their team, making sure they were good and giving them props. You don’t see that kind of leadership often, and it totally showed in how smoothly everything ran. The whole vibe was relaxed but professional. You can tell when a place has a good work culture, and this hotel definitely does. Will be back for sure.",5,2024,09,24
123,Good hospitality,"We stopped in London on the way to Texas and stayed in The Marylebone Hotel as we have done many times in the past.
The Lobby Bar and the Restaurant are absolutely stunning! 
All was perfect, special thanks to the Night Lady Jhalak for her kind and professional hospitality, and all the help with suggestions around the museums!",4,2024,09,22
123,These staff members give the hotel a good name.,"Sagar. A day manager who was alway ready to do the  best he could for us on both our visits.   And always listened.    

Noel.  The night manager who was so kind and helpful in helping us move one evening. 

Arham.  The porter who helped me carry all the luggage at a stressful time when Ieas changing rooms alone.",5,2024,09,22
123,One word AMAZING,"We bought my parents who are semi disabled for the weekend to London and stayed at The Marylebone.
From the minute we arrived at the front door to when we left it has been the staff that have been outstanding and make what is already a beautiful hotel a really fabulous place to stay. Two special people to mention are Joao on the cocktail bar and Guillermina who looked after us in the private dining area.
Thank you to all the team we will come again’",5,2024,09,22
123,Stay at Marylebone nakhi de,"We spent 5 nights at The Marylebone and were thoroughly delighted. Classy and elegant with an incredible staff that took care of us at every turn. It starts with the team out front greeting us upon our arrival and carried on with everybody we encountered until we departed. We checkedout really early in the morning and the porter was busy but the manager Jhalak herself went and got us a taxi which was quite reassuring. The restaurant, and bar staff was really good as well. The room was great and the dining we experienced was all great. The gym attached is also wonderful, just maybe understaffed. The lady showing us swimming pool didn't finish her tour as she was called for another job, but overall not bad experience.",5,2024,09,21
123,Top of the top,"Everything was perfect specially the staff who is very kind and careful, thank you to Elizabet who is the best honestly. I stayed with you for 19 days and from the first day, everything was nice, professional and very friendly, welcoming what ever.",5,2024,09,21

123,Thanks Jonny!,"Staff at the hotel were very helpful. 
The hotel was lovely. Rooms were very comfortable.
A huge shout out to Jonny at the front door. He went over and above to locate my taxi, which had been already booked. I would have missed my flight without him. Thanks Jonny!",5,2024,09,17
123,Beautiful Hotel,"Incredibly happy and helpful staff. Gorgeous hotel, comfy beds, delicious food and situated in a beautiful part of London. The staff went above and beyond to make our stay enjoyable. 
We stayed in a twin room with walk in shower, in hindsight I wish I had asked for an accessible room upon our arrival for my elderly aunt as the walk in shower room was exceptionally small and had quite a steep step up to access the shower. The shower base was not ground level as I had anticipated a walk in shower would be. 
I would definitely come back to this hotel, the staff are really what makes this hotel so special. ",5,2024,09,15
123,A very good experience at the Marylebone Hotel in London,"Location is great if you are into Oxford st. Shopping. Minutes away from Bond Street tube station and, Mayfair is Mayfair.... 

Service in general is superb, both friendly and very professional. This is true for both hotel staff as well as the hotel restaurant, Brasserie 108.

We booked a deal including breakfast and felt very much at home with the friendly and efficient Beata who served us most mornings and did a great job at that.

The only downside, if at all, the rooms, while clean, are small for a 5 star hotel and the bathroom is tiny.",4,2024,09,14
123,Empowering Stay at The Marylebone: Exceptional Service and a Perfect Location,"We had such an amazing time at The Marylebone! We’ve stayed at their Kensington property before, which was equally wonderful, but The Marylebone has this lovely village vibe that we really enjoyed. Plus, it’s in a great spot for shopping!

The staff were just so welcoming and friendly. A special shout out to the housekeeping team because every corner of the hotel was pristine. It was really impressive how clean everything was!
What really stood out for me though was how empowering the hotel is for women. I saw two ladies cleaning the common areas throughout the night, and they were so kind and humble. On top of that, the night manager and receptionist were both women too! Jhalak and Samantha were amazing—so bubbly and funny even though they were working late shifts. They really made us feel at home!

Also, big thanks to the concierge, who gave us all the best tips and maps for exploring the city. His advice was spot on, and he was super helpful.",5,2024,09,14
123,Our stay at Marylebone,I had an amazing time at the Marylebone! I was travelling with my best friend and couldn’t have been happier.. check-in was really smooth and I loved the room we were assigned. Location is very central and had access to almost everything at walking. Onur is really lovely and helped with our luggage and zhhalak for accommodating our requests. Hope to come back soon,5,2024,09,10
123,Great ambiance,"We had a great experience at the Marylbone. The hotel has a great location close to everything. It was a great ambiance at the hotel, the staff in the bar and the breakfast were very friendly. The doormen (Arham and Johnny) were really helpful in assisting us at the point of departure with a taxi of a suitable size. We will be back for sure. Thanks for a great stay.",5,2024,09,09
123,Superb- high end stay!,"We first found this fabulous hotel by eating at their restaurant.  Luckily we were able to stay and had the loveliest stay. We were attended by Alex and Jhalak at the front desk with kindness and sincerity. 
The entire team at the Marylebone are extraordinary. The food and rooms are superb. We had the best sleep! We will back and highly recommend this hotel!",5,2024,09,09

123,September trip,Excellent service in particular from beata and Johnny . The rest of the staff were also very helpful and courteous. Nice breakfast in pleasant surroundings. The bar can sometimes be very noisy but there are quiet spots   elsewhere.  Looking forward to going next year.,5,2024,09,07
123,The best hotel experience,Absolutely love this hotel. My business partners and I have been coming to this hotel for many years. They always have the best service. Special thanks to the concierge! Jhalak and Onur for taking care of all of our needs! I hope everyone gets to stay here!,5,2024,09,06
123,I just love this hotel,"Breakfast as usual, the think I love is that you can have what you want that is in terms of the amount, the order you eat it and the variety. It is always laid out well and the service is second to none.

This morning I was met by a smiling lady named Caitlin and served by Gaetano who is always charm personified.

As you can tell, I am a regular for breakfast and justifiably so.

Thank you",5,2024,09,05
123,UK Exploration - August,"As an Aussie exploring the UK for 20 days, this hotel in London was a fantastic base for my adventures. After trekking and camping through the stunning landscapes of Whales and Scotland, and braving the crazy English weather, I definitely feel like I need a second trip just to relax! My 4-day stay at this hotel was spot-on. The service was exceptional, and the staff truly went above and beyond to make sure I was comfortable and special shout out to zalak. From the warm welcome at check-in to the attentive support during my stay, every interaction was friendly and professional. The room was spotless, well-maintained, and had all the amenities I could ask for after a long day of exploring. The location was also perfect for wandering around London. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone seeking great service and a cozy place to rest in the heart of the city.",4,2024,09,03
123,Fantastic hotel in a charming neighborhood,"Loved this hotel. Friendly and attentive staff, nice rooms, very comfortable bed and linens, charming cocktail bar ( open to outside on a warm evening) and great breakfast ( included in my rate). Niaz made sure I had an early morning cab even though I just barely mentioned it on my way in the night before. Excellent night manager ( Jhalak?). The neighborhood is wonderful , full of shops and restaurants and easy walk to Regents or Hyde Park. Already planning a return trip!",5,2024,09,03
123,Sagar and the rest of the team!,"Myself and my 6 year old daughter are now on our way home after what should have been 1  night stay, but ended up as being a 2 night stay at The Marylebone. We were met at reception by a wonderful man named Sagar who couldn't do enough for us. Firstly upgrading our room, adding a complimentary breakfast for us both, and handing my daughter a gorgeous teddy bear! (She thought he was wonderful and kept telling me what a nice, kind man he was). 
Arriving in the room my daughter had treats left for her - colouring books, colouring pencils and a goodie bag. What a lovely touch! 
All staff took the time to speak with her and ask her questions which made her stay that little bit more personal. 
Hotel was the perfect base for us to go exploring, everything was in easy reach and hotel staff always asked if they could help organise transport etc.
We enjoyed it so much we stayed for another night. Sagar met us at reception, again with his cheerful demeanor and instantly upgraded us, added breakfast and handed me 2 drink vouchers to use at the bar. We were made to feel so welcome, especially by Sagar. We are so very grateful of your kindness. 
Rooms were lovely, although very 'lived in', beds comfortable and pillows were like sleeping on a cloud. Im always appreciative of people going above and beyond, but I have to be 100% honest. I did feel the hotel was quite pricey for what is it.  
Even so, we had a fabulous time, made better by such wonderful staff, especially Sagar!",5,2024,09,02
123,Chic hotel with warm hospitality!,"I saw a recommendation for this hotel by Southern Living in an email. It was our first time visiting London. I was drawn to this hotel because I wanted it to feel like I was in London and not any other city.  This hotel delivered!! The location was also convenient to all the tourists attractions, either by walking or short distances on the Tube. Many restaurants and cute shops nearby. Like most London hotels, the rooms are smaller than most hotels in the US, but we easily adjusted. Clean, comfortable and quiet rooms.  The staff were very friendly and treated us like family. It was especially nice to return to the hotel and see the welcoming smiles of Patou and Samantha. It was like coming home in the evening and seeing a really good friend. They helped us with our needs and maximizing our vacation time! The daily breakfast included with the room was so much more than we expected! The best breakfast we have ever had included with a stay! The avocado toast was delicious! Beata provided us top notch daily service! She always remembered our preferences! Will definitely stay again!",5,2024,09,01
123,Very Nice 7 day stay.,"This hotel is in a fantastic location.  It is well maintained, clean and neat.  Staff is very attentive and eager to make your stay a good one.  Breakfast is outstanding.   My only criticism is that the rooms are quite small.  But if your goal is to see London and not stay in your room all day, the room is fine.  ",4,2024,08,30
123,Doyle Collection hotels - my new favourite when in London,"I was very impressed by the high quality of the Doyle Collection hotel that I stayed at in London this summer. I have been to London many times over the years, and this was a stay with the kids and a chance to catch up with old friends. The room was spacious and the beds were very comfortable, nice selection on the breakfast menu, great neighborhood with lots of little shops nearby, close to all the key major shopping areas near Regent Street, only 10 minutes walk to get to John Lewis and Liberty's and 15 minutes to walk to Fortnum and Mason's, a few minutes walk to the Q parking garage at Cavendish square. Also, there was a cute French brasserie with outdoor terrace at the back of the hotel and very nice lounge and bar areas for a drink with friends. Close to the Wallace Collection for those seeking a little culture, since it's quite a walk from the British Museum. They have a sister hotel in Bloomsbury that I may try on a future visit.",5,2024,08,28
123,The best Hotel in the best London Neighborhood,"The Marylebone Hotel. 

Everyone very attentive, polite and discreet. Frequently cute amenities. Amazing experience. Plus the Food at 108 Brasserie was unforgettable.

Thank you everyone!",5,2024,08,28
123,Thank you to Godwin for an amazing stay!,"An absolutely incredible stay, made possible by Godwin, the night manager.

I arrived in the late evening and was greeted by Godwin, the night manager. He checked me in right away and even offered me a complimentary upgrade. I felt instantly at home.

One of my favourite hotels in London by a long way. 

I have stayed in hotels all over the world and this is one of my favourite - highly recommend! 

(The hotel has an excellent gym too!)",5,2024,08,26
123,Godwin the night manager is so lovely,"The night manager, Godwin, was incredible. So helpful, kind and polite .  Cannot recommend this hotel enough.

We’ve stayed in London many times but really enjoyed it here. This is by far my favourite place to stay because of how welcoming they are.",5,2024,08,24

123,Quick stay for the weekend,"Was coming for one of the Taylor Swift shows and was recommended it by a friend. It did not disappoint at all!!

I had emailed the hotel a couple days prior to 1) ask about check-in early and 2) anything I could do to surprise my young son related to Taylor Swift.

Victor surprised my son with TS cupcakes and juices in our room.

Samantha at check-in was so nice and we got a room within an hour. Check out Watch House to get breakfast and coffee.

Breakfast at the hotel was amazing! Our room
Included breakfast and I love a good hotel breakfast. Beats was our server both mornings and she was so kind. Staff there was awesome.

We tried the pool too when it was open for kids. It’s a nice pool at the fitness gym around the corner. Nice but wasn’t for kids.

Our room was the deluxe king and it was lovely. The only bad thing I have to say is our neighbors were terrible and so inconsiderate. Slammed be doors at least 10x in the middle of the night. In addition, someone was banging hysterically on the door and it woke up my son who seemed scared. Not the hotel’s fault though!

Highly recommend this place.",5,2024,08,18
123,"Great location and facilities, but small room and staff service is wanting","Great location: great neighborhood and close to many attractions.

Room was well appointed but very small. The bathroom was claustrophobic (using the word of a previous reviewer). Other facilities (dining room, meeting rooms, etc) are very nice.

Food is good.

Issue at check-in. During check-in, the staff member could not find any note about our special room request (which I made over the phone). Instead of acknowledging the mix-up, she asked me for proof that I did make the request. But of course I don't record my phone calls so all I could show was the hotel's phone number on my phone call history. She then told me that it wasn't their hotel's number (later she acknowledged that it actually was). Then she suggested that I must have called a different hotel and made the request. (!!!) She was just rude. Her manager saved the day by being courteous and sincerely apologetic, and figured out an easy solution.

Aside from this one incident, though, I found the staff team very courteous. But definitely mishaps here and there: mixed up our breakfast order once, and confusion about what was included in our prepaid breakfast.",3,2024,08,18
123,A Prize in London,"What a wonderful hotel. The staff immediately made us feel at home with their genuine warmth and attentiveness. Special kudos to Johnny, the major-domo of the lobby whose warm welcome kicked off the whole experience. He’s the best.

123,"Impeccable 5 star service, affordably","Absolutely delightful!  Accommodations, dining, scale, locale, bar, and ambiance all top notch.  But what really stood out, was the staff… each and every one went out of their way to make you feel welcome with a greeting, smile, or nod.  We had a single inconvenience due a fault in the room, and they couldn’t have done more to rectify quickly, with so many apologies and a couple of treats at the bar to ‘compensate’ us for our trouble.   I believe the managers have instilled a culture of ‘customer service’ throughout the team, which evident in all they do; Sagar at the front desk exemplifies that in every exchange. Will definitely be returning in the future",5,2024,08,14
123,Enjoyable stay,"A quiet hotel in a lovely area of Marylebone.Clean and comfortable bedroom.

123,"Super Hotel in a Great Location, Brilliant Staff","Staff were all superb and are a credit to the hotel, and one of the reasons that I would recommend this place to anyone staying in London. 

Location is great, the bistro leads onto Marylebone Lane, and there are so many places to eat and have coffee or a drink. We ate in the Bistro one  night, food was lovely and Beata looked after us, making sure we had everything we needed. 

Breakfast choice is excellent and of high quality. Room was immaculate and the size you would expect in central London.  

It’s a 5 minute walk to Bond Street tube and you can hire a Santander bike about 2/3 mins walk from the hotel. Having both lived and visited London many times, this hotel offers a great all round package, and it will be my place of choice the next time I visit.",5,2024,08,05
123,Summer at the Marylebone in London,"From stepping out of my cab to the moment I left, the service was impeccable! (Only one not so great experience, was at the Bar one evening. I guess my tab didn't look worthy of attention.)
All of the other staff were friendly and professional. Special shout out to John and the other doorman and Godwin and Akex at the front desk and ALL the reception staff. The glass of champagne was a refreshing touch too!",5,2024,08,04
123,Super experince,"I had a wonderful stay at the Marylebone Hotel. Like all my others in the past. The service was outstanding, and the bedrooms were spacious and comfortable. The bar and bistro offered a lovely ambiance and delicious food. The friendly staff made my experience even more enjoyable. Highly recommended!",5,2024,07,30
123,Enjoyed our Stay at The Marylebone,The Marylebone is a very nice boutique hotel in a lovely neighbourhood filled with shops and restaurants. (Ottolenghi is right across the street and their pastries are divine.) The hotel has its own fine restaurant on the premises. The service was excellent and the whole family really enjoyed staying in this hotel.,5,2024,07,29
123,Another incredible stay,"My favourite hotel in London, in my favourite part of town.
Everything about The Marylebone is fantastic.  I've stayed many times over the years and it keeps getting better each time.",5,2024,07,29
123,Marylebone Hotel Service,Rehmian was a great help today despite the many changes and large amount of luggage my party carried. He continued to aid in all services with a smile and positive attitude which made the whole experience much easier and more agreeable. Love the staff at this hotel.,5,2024,07,27
123,Great experience,"Rooms are really nice. Staff are super helpful, front desk Shabz is a superstar. Her manager is also brilliant. We needed their help to upgrade and it was totally worth it. Awesome gym, awesome pool, kids entry times to pool is 10-12 and 3-5..",5,2024,07,27
123,10/10 would recommend!,"The hotel was absolutely fantastic. The location couldn’t be better, at the heart of Marylebone. Rooms were really good, comfortable beds and pillows.

The service was fantastic, Sagar at the front desk was delightful, made us feel right at home.",5,2024,07,24
123,Stay last minute,"We booked last minute , one hour before arriving,We were welcomed as it should be ina this range of hotel.
The staff was extremely serviable and kind.
The rooms very clean. All this made our stay agreeable.",5,2024,07,21
123,Excellence and luxurious,"Fantastic two night stay at this luxury hotel. 

Staff are very friendly and the service is great.  The room was tastefully decorated and equipped with everything you need, to a high standard.

Breakfast was delicious, although it took some time to arrive (approx 30 mins) but this was at peek time so understandable, and it was worth the wait! 

Would definitely return!",5,2024,07,14
123,Wonderful service at 108 Brasserie,Breakfast at 108 Brasserie was a fabulous start to our pearl wedding anniversary. Food was delicious and I loved the complimentary chocolate cake (nut free as I’m allergic) for our celebration. A couple of glasses of champagne provided the perfect finishing touch. Special mention to Liz who looked after us exceptionally well.,5,2024,07,13
123,Lovely brunch,"Felt special as soon as we walked in. Lovely brunch and great service. The waitress Liz made us laugh. Nothing seemed too much. Would highly recommend it!

Felt special as soon as we walked in. Lovely brunch and great service. The waitress Liz made us laugh. Nothing seemed too much. Would highly recommend it!",5,2024,07,13
123,Tried it and regret it.,"I love the location and was encouraged to stay here as it’s part of the GHA loyalty. Thought of trying it out but turned out disappointing for me. It may suit others but it’s not for me. Floor layout is claustrophobic with narrow corridors and low ceiling. Loft room has awkward location with stairs going up (unfriendly. Front desk team seemed to lack training. Upgrade policy is rather restricted so GHA top tier gives you nothing here if you booked loft. Cost cutting is visible in many ways. For example, in-room coffee and tea used to be top brands and now replaced with lower/generic ones. In London, I would definitely find much better value and quality elsewhere. ",1,2024,07,12
123,Exceptional service. Exceptional stay!,This hotel is absolutely amazing. We actually moved to this hotel because we did not like one we original we were staying at. The service is exceptional. The staff are incredible. Liz at 108 Brasserie made breakfast even more enjoyable. Gym facilities are fantastic. Can’t say enough good things about this place.,5,2024,07,10
123,Another stay at the Marleybone,"Stayed at the Marleybone a number of times, it’s a quiet location with plenty of nice pubs and restaurants close by, only qualm with this stay was the size of the bathroom in our room, a bit of a tight squeeze to say the least, net curtains in the room had also seen better days, apart from that a pleasant stay as usual, special shout out to Caitlin in the breakfast restaurant, first class service and very welcoming.",4,2024,07,08
123,Fabulous boutique hotel,"Fantastic property within steps of fantastic dining and shopping. Service was positively lovely. Upon our 6:30am arrival at the hotel, the concierge Adrian walked us through the property and even walked a couple blocks in the neighborhood with us to help us get our bearings. I won’t forget that! Will definitely stay here again!",5,2024,07,07
123,Prices don't reflect the offer.,The website of the hotel promises much more than what was offered especially for the price charged. Better options in London!,2,2024,07,07
123,Perfect Breakfast with Liz,"Liz was our breakfast server... amazing prooer hotel luxury!  Full Irish, perfectly served.  Thank you to Liz and team.  Was cooked and served with care, even with a very busy dining room.  The food service at the Marylebone is far better than it needs to be, exceeded expectations.",5,2024,07,06
123,"Beautiful hotel,  not overly expensive, in a great neighborhood","We stayed for three nights on the first leg of a UK/Ireland family vacation.  This hotel was a little more budget-friendly than some other high-end hotels recommended by a travel consultant, but it turns out we didn't sacrifice anything.  The lobby, rooms, restaurant, and bar are all beautiful.  The staff was awesome, very attentive and helpful and knowledgeable but not the least bit snooty.  Easy walk to Bond St or Oxford St tube stations.",5,2024,07,03
123,Fantastic brasserie!  Highly recommended!,"We were wandering around in the area when we came across the brasserie. Feeling peckish, the restaurant was good looking so we gave it a try. We'll definitely return and pay a visit to our host. We had a nice evening and thumbs up to Veli for being an amazing host!",4,2024,07,01
123,"Wonderful on every count, but room air conditioning sweltering","Everything about this hotel is fantastic, staff, interiors, food, drinks, everything. BUT the air con in the rooms doesn't get down to temperature and we didn't sleep for all the nights we were there because of it. The engineer tested the ceiling cavity and said it was getting down to temperature - but we weren't sleeping in the roof cavity! We will never stay again because of this, but apart from that it is a truly wonderful hotel on every other level ",3,2024,06,30
123,Great hotel in central London,"Excellent business hotel. Quiet and clean, staff was very friendly. Bed and bed linen were comfortable. Breakfast was tasty.

Rooms are small, but that is understandable given London. Prices are very fair.

Would highly recommend for business stay.",5,2024,06,28
123,Top quality,"This was our second stay at the hotel. On both occasions everything has been faultless. All staff are friendly and genuinely committed to guests having a great experience. Particular thanks to Liz our breakfast server (the breakfast is amazing) for being so helpful and Raja who sorted us out a pot of Earl Grey tea way after midnight..
Our room was spotless and the bed very comfortable. 
We loved the ideal location of the hotel for exploring the classy area of Marylebone village and easy access to Bond St tube and Oxford street.
We would thoroughly recommend the hotel and can’t wait to be back soon",5,2024,06,26
123,Great base for our London activities,"The doorman and check in staff were all helpful, attentive and amazing.  Luggage service to the room included room and building reviews (by Rehman) to the point, informative and also great.   The rooms are finely appointed and comfortable.   The Marylebone Hotel is a great base for our London and UK travels.",5,2024,06,23
123,Great cocktails and outdoor seating,Anna was a spectacular server and we loved our experience - would highly recommend the fish and chips and the outside seating is perfect for a summer cocktail or meal outdoors…nice corridor that isn’t too crowded and has great sunlight!!!!,5,2024,06,22
123,Exceptional food and service,"Taylor Swift may be in town, but Caitlin, our server at 108 Brasserie, made me feel like a rockstar!  Incredible food and service. The restaurant was busy, but they managed well and she didn’t miss a beat. This will be a tough act to follow. I think I live here now:)",5,2024,06,22
123,Warm welcome,"Elisabet at the reception area was extremely helpful and polite. She made our stay even more pleasant.
Room was clean and comfortable making our sleep extremely easy and making us feel relaxed!
Definitely recommend!
Massive thank you!!!",5,2024,06,21
123,London at its best,"Superb gem in a  wonderful location. No snobbery here.. its clear the hotel prides itself in making each guest feel personally welcomed.  A lovely little bar perched next to the lobby, where hotel guests can languish and watch the neighbourhood. The rooms were large and very functional, with a London charm. I loved the gym ( very cool place called Third Space full of hip and fit Marylebone crew) . Without doubt though, its the obvious effort made by the hotel to look after whoever stays there. There were a few small hiccups with misinformation about how to check in ( my girlfriend had to wait for me to arrive despite an email assurance to the contrary the night before). However , the error was owned, and the stay was the best I have had in London. I stayed at the Nomad in covent gardens last time.  I dont usually compare but I was easily more delighted at the Marylebone.",5,2024,06,18
123,Understated luxury,The Marylebone is my favourite hotel to stay in when I visit London. The rooms are small but comfortable and quiet. I love the brasseries for breakfast and I always use the pool and gym. Perfect little place in a wonderful neighborhood. Thank you for  providing the perfect home from home hotel. ,5,2024,06,16
123,Fab experience,"I loved this experience. The hotel and the room were plenty and perfect. The amenities including third space & restaurants were my favorite. The neighborhood charming. The team working especially top tier - Adrian at concierge helped me in so many ways, even sending out a letter I wrote to my mom back in the US, which meant a ton to me. The bell men staff at the front entry became a second family to me as I was on this trip solo and they were always taking care that I had what I needed and was safe to go!",5,2024,06,15
123,Great service,Great experience! Very comfortable rooms and the location is absolutely perfect. Liz was the nicest waitress we’ve had the pleasure of looking after us in a long time. Will definitely return soon to stay and dine. Breakfast is spot on as well,5,2024,06,15
123,Ideal Location with Style to Spare,"I’d met a friend at the cocktail bar at The Marylebone on a previous trip, and enjoyed the experience so much that I decided to book one of the hotel’s suites this time in London. Good decision. The same sense of style—refined but not overbearing, precise but comfortable—extended to the suite I booked. Service was lovely, the 108 Brasserie overperforms, and the bed was perfect for me. Highly recommended, especially if you have designs on wandering around Central London and/or shopping at Selfridges.",5,2024,06,14
123,Service,"Liz was great even when we told inappropriate stories in her ear shot, lovely lady, so welcoming :-)
…………………………………………………………..,,,,,,,,.,,,.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,??????????",5,2024,06,14
123,Very pleasant and great service,"Beata was such a kind server to my family and I, she was attentive, helpful, and extremely friendly. The food was wonderful and we enjoyed every bite! The restaurant was clean and had a wide selection of delicious food options!😁😁😁😁😁😁😁",5,2024,06,14
123,Good food amazing service,"Beata was amazing smiley and so helpful. Great food and perfect  service!!!  Love this restaurant.
The food was outstanding. Each dish was a delightful blend of flavors and textures, showcasing the chef's expertise and creativity. The ingredients were fresh, and the presentation was impeccable.
The ambiance of the restaurant was warm and inviting, with a tasteful decor that added to the overall dining experience. The lighting was just right, creating a cozy yet elegant environment.",5,2024,06,13
123,"Lovely lunch, served by Liz!","Liz was fantastic. Nice chilled atmosphere. Food was great. Also a very good selection of alcohol-free beverages which is a big plus. Quick service, modern and clean space that was nice and inviting. Staying at the hotel so will certainly be back again.",5,2024,06,13
123,Excellent experience,"Calm spacious and comfortable environment. 

All the staff were very friendly and accommodating as we had limited time to eat. They made sure our food arrived very promptly .  

Special mention to our waitress Liz.  

We both enjoyed our food which was fresh and nicely presented.",5,2024,06,13
123,"First visit, but not the last","First visit here and really impressed so far.   Spacious, clean, room and great service at breakfast, especially from Liz and Jada. There is a lovely ambiance in the hotel and some really friendly staff. It’s close to the parts of the city we need to be in and easy to get to from Euston or Paddington. 
We’ll be back for sure.",5,2024,06,13
123,Great service from Beata,"Beata was a fantastic server and so lovely to chat to.  A very friendly and obliging host, making us feel at home and comfortable. She gave great advice and showed great knowledge of the city. Such a wonderful person and great experience engaging with her.",5,2024,06,13
123,First time in London Experience,"The Marylebone was in a beautiful area with walking distance to many stores, restaurants and sites. The hotel staff was excellent and very helpful. We were able to enjoy the gym facilities and restaurants located on the premise. I would recommend this place highly.",5,2024,06,13
123,We will be back!!,"This was a most lovely stay! Any time you entered a space, a staff member would come over and see if you needed anything, rather than ignore you. The location was EXCELLENT! There were a vast variety of restaurants and shops right out of the building and at a walking distance. Our stay could not be more wonderful!",5,2024,06,12
123,Top Hotel Restaurant,"Went with a mate having only been here before for drinks. Didn’t book but they fitted us in with no fuss. 
Two key points :
The service was genuinely excellent from the moment we walked in. Nothing was too much trouble and Liz, who looked after us, could not have been more friendly and helpful. 
The food was also excellent. My friend had the hake with chips and he finished every last morsel of that. I had arguably the best burger I have ever had ( they even made it medium rare which is uncommon these days what with ridiculous H&S rules.) How can you serve a steak tartare but not do a rare burger?
Overall almost faultless. Not cheap but then where is these days?
Thoroughly recommended.",5,2024,06,12
123,Terrific spot for lunch away from the crowds,Wonderful lunch today after the Wallace collection visit. Liz was so kind and helpful during our service. Thank you. We will definately be back for more. Soup / salad / gnocchi and hand cut chips and a lovely G and T. Off the high street so not a lot of foot traffic.,5,2024,06,11
123,Very nice hotel,"Good location and overall very nice hotel. Very small room with all amenities. Nespresso’s is a plus but only 4 pods. Great cocktail bar and breakfast quality however you are forced to pay for the buffet 32 Pounds even if you have two eggs and espresso? Unless the hostess misinformed me? I waited for 8am to go for breakfast as the website page for breakfast says 8am. I learned upon arrival at the brasserie that they open at 6:30am for hotel guests? 
Very strange. Outside guests 8am…",4,2024,06,10
123,Great experience!,"I booked the Marylebone for a work event.   We used the meeting/catering service along with 10 sleeping rooms.  Lia in sales and her team were wonderful.  Very responsive and attentive to all of our needs.  The front desk staff and concierge, Adrian, went over and above in their services.  We look forward to coming back to the Marylebone!",5,2024,06,07
123,Great,"Chose this hotel for the convenient location and a swimming pool, and overall was happy with my stay and would stay again.

Special shout out to Sagar who helped me checking-in and showed great kindness. I don’t know how he does it, but he did remember my last name and always acknowledged me whenever I was passing by lobby. One might think hospitality professionals are used to do it, but regardless it didn’t feel prétentious and showed how the staffs at the hotel cares for each guest.",5,2024,06,07
123,Perfect!,"I had a wonderful relaxing overnight stay, the hotel is in a great location (10-15 minutes from Selfridge's /Oxford & Regent Street) and has everything you need on your doorstep, they have a fantastic gym underneath the hotel, this is not your average hotel gym, it has absolutely everything including a pool and all underneath the hotel accessible via the lift. 

The room was lovely as is the whole hotel and the bed was extremely comfortable. 

You are never going to get a massive room in London unless you pay for a suite but it was a really nice size and felt luxurious with everything you need including Chrome cast to stream your own devices Netflix etc which is a must for me and lacking in so many other hotels. 

Breakfast was fantastic, I thoroughly enjoyed it, both the Continental and cooked were delicious with lots of good options on the menu for meat eaters & veggies, again the service was very friendly, professional and attentive. 

A huge thank you to Sagar who advised me on local eateries and made me feel extremely well looked after and Theodore for the unexpected protein shake and bar  because he had heard I was going to the gym! Such wonderful personal touches. 

I left the hotel feeling relaxed and pampered. 

I've visited lots of hotels in London over the years and I've never been back to one for a repeat visit. I feel like I've found my hotel in London and I will be back on my next trip. 

This is how a 5 star hotel should be!",5,2024,06,05
123,Lovely and welcoming,"Great stay during visit to London for a conference. Staff is professional and friendly and responsive, shout out to Noel the night manager who helped me navigate best option to the airport on an early departure.

The evening bar is a great way to wind down, and the breakfast buffet in the restaurant is sumptuous. 

The location is convenient to lots of other shopping and restaurants, and as a daily runner it was just about a half mile to Hyde Park and Regent Park.",5,2024,06,03
123,Lovely MARYLEBONE,"This hotel is fantastic. It is freshly redone with very nice rooms and nicebedding. The room service is excellent with a great turn down service every night. They provide you with a fresh bottle of water morning and night. They have a very good restaurant for fine dining, and breakfast was included for us, and it was good as well. The waitstaff could not be nicer. The bar area is nice With a nice assortment of liquor and wine. Check in was easy. The doorman were friendly as can be and helped with directions as well as assisting with taxi. The hotel is located in a lovely area of town. That is upscale with wonderful small shops.",5,2024,06,03
123,Perfect overnight stay,"Our second visit to The Marylebone Hotel

He showed us around and was genuinely interested in our visit and experience in London, which really added to our feeling comfortable while visiting the hotel. 

The hotel is beautiful, and the restaurant serves delicious food. On our way out, we engaged in a little chat with John at the door. What delightful people work here! It really made our trip more memorable. 

Thank you Marylebone Hotel!",5,2024,05,28

I'm coming back!",5,2024,05,17

123,"Understated Luxury, Fun Neighborhood","We loved our stay at The Marylebone Hotel.  Conveniently located, it sits in the middle of Marylebone, a fun and lively neighborhood, and is only 5 minutes from the Bond Street tube station.  While a five-star hotel, with lots of amenities, it doesn't feel stuffy or over-the-top; it is simply welcoming.  But what sets this property apart is the service.  The staff is consistently helpful, competent, and friendly.  To a person, they go out of their way to make sure you are comfortable and have the very best stay at the hotel and as a tourist around town.  ",5,2024,04,23
123,Excellent customer service!!,"This hotel definitely gets a 5 star for customer attention! Everyone there is so pleasant especially  the door guys, concierge & lounge staff.

I was staying here a night before surgery and the staff did all they could do to assist me with my check in and check out.,5,2024,04,01
123,Excellent stay,"Returned to the hotel after a 6 year break. We were happy to see during our one week stay that the standard of the hotel was not only kept on the very high level which we remember from our previous stays, but even improved in some areas.

The Classic Rooms, one of which we booked, are not the biggest ones, but still with enough space to stay there as a couple. The bed is one of the best hotel beds I know, which guarantees heavenly sleep.

I recommend to book a bed and breakfast rate, as the breakfast at The Marylebone offers a big selection of fresh food for every taste.

The location of The Marylebone is perfect to explore London. The Wallace Collection, restaurants, shops, public transport - everything is in a very walkable distance.

However, the real gem of the hotel is their staff. Every member of the staff is very friendly, very professional and is going the extra mile to make their guests feel ""home away from home"".",5,2024,04,01
123,Fantastic location,"I switched over to this hotel last minute. Although my stay had a hiccup, Palwasha straightened things out in a professional and experienced manner which you don’t always get nowadays. 

The hotel is located on a quiet street in Marylebone with fantastic shopping and dining a short walk away. The staff were lovely, sweet and helpful which I appreciated as I was traveling alone with a young child who was not doing well with the time change, so we both were a bit haggard. 

Suggestion-I do hope that Doyle updates their website soon to note that children under 18 are no longer allowed in the swimming pool as this adds unnecessary stress to the staff who are guest facing. It’s easy to click two adults instead of adult and child when you’re booking on your phone. Please fix it. Still, this didn’t take away from it being a lovely stay.",5,2024,03,31
123,Fantastic hotel & staff,"Fantastic hotel, lovely rooms & great food. A great trip made all the better by the brilliant staff especially Malachy from Waterford, Ireland who could not have been more helpful. 100% will be returning at the earliest opportunity. 5 stars+",5,2024,03,28
123,Great visit,Great first experience at the Marylebone. I’m very thankful for Sagar’s help. He was able to get me into a room fast and was attentive throughout my short trip.  I will stay here again if I’m in the area.  Great staff. The first floor restaurant / bar looked fun also.,5,2024,03,27
123,A London gem,"We've just come back from a one night stay at The Marylebone ... our first stay at this hotel and I feel that it won't be our last!

The hotel is beautifully styled, feeling both cosy and elegant but it is the wonderful service which really makes this a great place to stay.
From your first contact with the friendly doormen you are made to feel welcomed and valued and this continues with every member of staff we came into contact with.
We enjoyed a wonderful Sunday lunch in 108 brasserie, a nightcap and snack in the cocktail bar and a superb breakfast before we left this morning.  Couldn't fault any of it!",5,2024,03,25

123,Amazing location!!!,Amazing location in Marylebone and close by many boutiques and restaurants.  The room had many amenities but was a little bit outdated and needed new carpeting because of some stains. Bed and pillows were very comfortable and worth mentioning there is an excellent turndown service and super nice housekeeping staff. Guests can use the gym and pool facilities but may not go directly with a bathrobe... which made it a bit more complicated to enjoy the pool.,4,2024,03,06

Like any big city the rooms and the bathrooms are not huge but if you want someone in reception that can facilitate a late checkout and a attentive barman  that can arrange a late bite after a few drinks (bottles of red) and a concierge that goes looking for a cab, well, this is place to lay your head between shows and sightseeing.  
It’s the small things that count and  if your a breakfast coffee lover then this is the place for you.

It was quite disconcerting as it was difficult to know if it was day or night. I looked forward to stopping into the lobby bar in the evening for snacks and drinks. The bar staff were very nice. 

FYI – Watch out for your credit card statement. I had charges that I didn’t recognize from the Marylebone and when I inquired, I was told that it was “probably” from an establishment in the area. I submitted a fraud claim to my credit card company, however, I reached out once again the hotel and asked them to have the charges reviewed by management. I asked if this possibly came from the hotel lobby bar. I await their response and am annoyed that this has required so much energy from me.",3,2024,01,04

123,Weekend break,A wonderful hotel in the beautiful Marylebone Village area of central London. Staff are always welcoming and excellent and the room is exceptionally comfortable and clean. Would highly recommend this hotel to visitors from anywhere and just a short walk to Oxford Street.,5,2023,11,14
123,A thoroughly enjoyable stay,"This was my second visit to this hotel.  The first was over the New Year with my family and was a wonderful experience.

Happily this second visit was almost on a par with the experience we had earlier this year.

My friend and I booked a standard twin room.  On arrival at just after 1pm, we were able to check in early; which was hugely appreciated. 

The room was, as expected, smaller than the King studio suite we had enjoyed as a family of three in January; but it was perfect for my friend and I to share.  

On return from our arranged afternoon activity, we enjoyed an aperitif before dinner in the Cocktail Bar.  Despite being very busy, service was fair and the drinks a delight.

That evening turndown service was provided, which was a welcomed, and which provided that little extra special touch.

The small issues we had with regard to the heating overnight were dealt with swiftly at reception.

The concierge staff on the door were discreet but quietly friendly and did their job expertly.  They really are an absolute asset to the hotel.

Breakfast was also lovely.  Swift and efficient service allowed us to reflect on a very pleasant stay.

I will undoubtedly return to this Doyle Collection Hotel.  The brand has several hotels in London, all of which I have had the good fortune to stay at and it is pleasing to see that they continue to have excellent service at the heart of everything they do.

Thank you so much.",5,2023,11,13
123,Great location,"This hotel was everything we were looking for.  Great location, access to the High Street where there are lovely shops,cafes and restaurants.

The hotel has a lovely cocktail bar and restaurant. Both highly recommended. 

The staff are all friendly, professional and very helpful. 

Special thanks to Roxana for all her help and attention.  Outstanding customer service experienced.",5,2023,11,13
123,London Break,"This hotel is perfectly located for transport, shopping, theatres etc and central London. It is large enough to be vibrant but small enough for each guest to matter. A real gem that remains consistently good",5,2023,11,03
123,Fabulous cocktails and a luxurious pit stop. ,"Birthdays always make me think of cocktails, so we decided to pop into the lovely little cocktail bar at The Marylebone. 

Everything was absolutely perfect. From the warm greetings on arrival, we were dressed up, but clearly not their ""regulars"" (think green beard and tattoos, but with a suit and tie) but they couldn't have made us feel more at ease and welcome.
The cocktails were, as one would expect, fairly pricey (£16 - £20) but it is very evident that you get value for money as they were deliciously punchy, as well as beautiful. 
If you're in the area for lunch/dinner/shopping, I highly recommend stopping here. Just don't go straight to Daunts Bookshop ... or you might end up with an entire new library, fuelled by cocktail enhanced enthusiasm. ",5,2023,11,01
123,Great hotel,Excellent hotel second time we stayed clean rooms great gym great location breakfast and bar are very convenient too… also Roxana DRAMBA who checked us in was very helpful and an excellent host would come back anytime ,5,2023,10,29
123,Short stay trip.,Great location &  welcoming hotel. Very comfortable beds and surprisingly quiet room which is great as I am a light sleeper. Food and coffee was great. Found all the staff to be very welcoming. Room service is quick and tasty and Farouk who served was a lovely chap. As was Johnny on the door. I would say the staff are a asset to this hotel.,5,2023,10,29
123,My favourite spot.,"The perfect location with a relaxing but luxury ambience  to have a cup of coffee or a cocktail. I will also add that the decor is stunning / comfortable! Rare as normally its one or the other! -  and it has to be said, the bar staff really make you feel at home. With a special mention to Frederico,  Daniele and  Davide. 
I will be back again and again. 
",5,2023,10,29
123,Perfect,Great location and lovely staff always available and willing to help you. This place will definetly become my go to place in london. I cale for business trip then decided to extend. I totally recommend! ,5,2023,10,27
123,5 star - best hotel in London by far ,"A beautiful stay. 

We had a terrible  journey down to London which meant we missed my husbands operation that afternoon. Upon check in, the staff member (so annoyed we didn’t catch his name, a lovely man with glasses) surprised us and upgraded us to one of the top suites. He escorted us all the way to our room and showed all of the facilities of the hotel. This was a beautiful surprise and the room was gorgeous. Having stayed in various 5 star hotels in London, I can confirm that this was the best by far.

What was a stressful day turned into a lovely stay at the hotel. We also had drinks outside brasserie 108 and all staff members were very accommodating.  

Breakfast in our suite the next morning was 5* and we spent a lovely few hours relaxing and looking at the views from our panoramic windows.

We will be back at the hotel at the end of November and can’t wait to use the spa facilities for that stay. Thank you again. 

",5,2023,10,23
123,Worst hotel in London,"Luke warm water in the shower.  A room that smelled like...diapers?  No one cleaned my room on the day I was staying at the hotel.  The fish I ate at 108 gave me food poisoning.  Staff, that for the most part, seemed aloof.  Oh yeah, and a gym that doesn't open until 8am, even though I had to leave the hotel by 7 for work.  Honestly, my worst experience in a hotel, maybe ever.  It's a good thing I wasn't paying for it.",1,2023,10,22
123,Fantastic,"What a great stay from the beautiful hotel to the magnificent staff.
Incredibly helpful with local knowledge. 
From the moment I stepped up to the front door I was greeted with a smile.
Assistance was offered for anything that might be able to help me with.
Had the best night sleep after a long hall flight. Room service quick tasty.
The breakfast also was quick hot and so lovely.
The restaurant there was just beautiful. 
I can't speak more highly of the amazing staff.
",5,2023,10,21
123,A wonderful stay in Central London,"A lovely room which was surpassingly quiet for the central location. The breakfast was second to none and the food for supper was delicious. Bed was very comfy and clean, with large marble bathroom including shower and standalone bath. Just brilliant ",5,2023,10,18
123,The new standard of London hotels,"We simply loved our stay and have already e mailed the GM. From arrival to departure our 3 days were simply faultless.

Every member of the team was smiley, happy and looked after all its guest very well. 

We could not fault our room, bar service, breakfast service, concierge, reception, and housekeeping and I’m sure everyone behind the scenes works just as hard and it shows.

Our new place to stay when in London in a wonderful location in Marylebone Village with lots of market stalls, quirky and trendy shops, restaurants and cafe’s it’s a must to visit

Thank you everyone for making our stay so enjoyable.",5,2023,10,17
123,Husband and wife get away from Canada,"My wife arrived from Toronto and I stayed 2 times during our 12 day stay in England Staying there a second time to end our trip highlights how happy we were at the Marylebone. While the rooms were modest, the personnel were all very good and a special shoutout goes to David Morton who steered us to the best restaurants snd the entire team at the bar near the reception (where we spent far too much time)🥂",5,2023,10,12
123,Weekend Stay At The Marylebone Hotel,"My husband & I have just returned from a fabulous weekend in London spent at The Marylebone Hotel.
We had 2 nights stay bed & breakfast.  Throughout our stay staff were extremely attentive and professional.
The highlight of our stay was eating in the restaurant on Saturday night, the food and service was excellent.  I would like to make a special mention of Beata, who looked after us with exceptional attention and professionalism.  She made us feel so special and looked after, nothing was too much trouble.
Breakfast was delightful and staff on service were very friendly and helpful too.

I would definitely recommend this hotel for service and in addition kit is ideally situated for central London and only a short distance from Euston station.

We will definitely stay at The Marylebone Hotel again",5,2023,10,10
123,Bad experience ,"Membership of the Doyle Group Discovery Hotel used to include breakfast.  We were not aware they'd withdrawn this.  The booking emails were silent on this. We were then told at check in that breakfast was included. We had breakfast. Then we were charged for it (it's not cheap) and told they'd made a mistake.  The hotel refused to address the problem and insisted we had to pay. I thought this was appalling. It's cost them more in a loss of goodwill than it would if they'd written the cost off. It left a very sour taste for our group. 
",2,2023,10,10
123,Safe Broken,"My fiancé and I stayed in this hotel from September 27-October 3rd. While the doormen and most hotel staff were helpful, we had an issue with the in room safe being broken. We complained several times but no one came to fix it. At night, the safe door swung open and hit my fiancé in the knee. He was unable to walk for most of the days following the incident. The hotel manager stated he would speak with us on the day that we were leaving but he was not there and no credit was made to us to make up for this inconvenience. I do not recommend this hotel.",2,2023,10,09
123,The Marylebone - Event spaces research and business stay ,"The venue sourcing team at Flavour Venues and Events find that first-hand experience is the best way to recommend the right venues to our clients. Our September 2023 London research visit brought us to The Marylebone. This handsome property near Bond Street, Mayfair and Soho offered luxurious tranquillity in a popular part of town. With excellent travel connections and a wealth of nearby shopping, dining and entertainment, The Marylebone is perfectly positioned for leisure guests, plus business stays and corporate events.
The Marylebone houses a premium collection of 252 bedrooms and suites set across 7 floors. Ours featured a gigantic and extremely comfortable bed, in a room which was well insulated from any outside street noise. Such features as a workspace, safe, smart TV and minibar are a welcome touch for business travellers like us. Luxury toiletries, robes, slippers, and premium technology made our stay even more special. The room was spacious and lavishly decorated to a timeless fashion, ensuring a great sleep and a relaxing stay. 
We were given a comprehensive tour of the communal areas and event spaces by Stephanie, MICE Sales Manager for The Doyle Collection (to which The Marylebone belongs). We were totally smitten by the décor of the Cocktail Bar, which is inspired by the four seasons of the year. The space fills with natural light during the summer months and offers fireside warmth in winter. The hotel offers an impressive range of meeting rooms and versatile event spaces. A highlight for us was Number Six. This stunning, multi-purpose space has a private ground floor entrance, with its own cloakroom and reception area. The space is bathed in daylight, with mirrored surfaces reflecting the rich colours of the furniture and wooden floor around the room. There’s capacity for up to 180 standing guests, with moveable walls and even a lavish concealed bar which transform the space for a multitude of uses. Other impressive spaces include The Courtyard, an internal terrace featuring a retractable roof and striking fireplace for year-round events, such as private dinners under the light of the stars. The Blue Room, as the name suggests, is vibrantly decorated, and offers configurations to suit events from 8 to 80 guests. Every space we viewed had been furnished and finished with loving attention to detail. 
Our stay included breakfast, which gave us the opportunity to sample one of the best full Irish breakfasts I’ve enjoyed. The food was of excellent quality, and service was warm, friendly, and attentive, giving us confidence that event guests would be well looked after too. The delicious calories offered at the table were well spent at the onsite Third Space luxury health-club and gym. Featuring cutting edge equipment, great spa facilities and an energetic vibe, I can honestly say they were the most impressive hotel fitness facilities I’ve used.
With their collection of top tier event spaces, luxuriously comfortable bedrooms, plus the five-star hospitality we enjoyed, we’re delighted to recommend The Marylebone to our clients. To plan your corporate events at this excellent hotel, contact the team at Flavour Venues & Events.

123,Above and beyond service!,"(My mom isn't the most tech-savvy, so I'm posting this on her behalf!):

After spending a couple days at the beautiful Marylebone in London, I believe they have set a new standard for hotel service. From the time we got in to when we checked out, every employee we were in contact with went above and beyond to make sure out trip was perfect. 

The front desk, restaurant and bar, and concierge staff were all professional, patient, and kind. However, the MVP for our trip had to be Adrian Piele on the concierge team. He was always ready and able to give advice on and organize reservations for plays, boat trips, and restaurants. Because of him and the concierge team, we managed to do so much within only four days. Also, Adrian specifically helped me with a restaurant cancellation that went smoothly despite my last minute request. 

I look forward to coming back and recommending the Marylebone to all my friends and family! ",5,2023,10,07
123,Lovely hotel,"Staff are great & very helpful..all the doorman lovely esp jojo Barman Francisco & all the bar staff & front desk staff.
Its a shame there is no tap to tip feature at the door for those who don't carry cash all the time..hopefully they will set up",5,2023,10,07
123,"Excellent hotel.  Comfortable,  convenient and clean.  5 stars.","The cleanliness of the room was amazing.  Housekeeping comes twice a day and changed the sheets every day.  The bathroom was beautiful. 
The bed is so comfortable. 
The neighborhood has lots of cafes, restaurants and high end shops.
Staff was excellent and very friendly especially Adrian the concierge who spent time taking with me, recommending going to Covent Garden and explaining how to get there by the underground. 
The tube station is a bit of a walk from the hotel, but the walk is very interesting. 
The breakfast was excellent and the bar and bartender was very friendly. 
And while I didn't use the fitness center, I looked at it and the pool and it looked very inviting.",5,2023,10,06
123,Beware at the bar,Room accommodations were good.  Staff’s friendliness was below average especially in the dining area for breakfast.  But buyer beware if you order drinks from their bar…they diluted our drinks ordered neat by over 50%.  The manger “fixed” this issue by supplying an adequate pour but after that type of service we would have expected more.,3,2023,10,01
123,Champagne Al fresco at the end of September ,"Love this hotel. The wonderful smell on arrival. The excellent staff and stylish bedrooms.  Celebrating a clients industry award win. Champagne @108Brasserie thanks to Beata for looking after us, you are a credit to your industry. ",5,2023,09,28
123,Unforgettable experience,"My recent stay at The Marylebone Hotel exceeded all my expectations. From the moment I walked through the door, I felt welcomed and exceptionally well taken care of.

What truly made my stay exceptional was the service provided by the hotel's staff. They were always ready to assist and make my stay comfortable and enjoyable.",5,2023,09,27
123,Lovely Experience with the 5 Star Staff,"I was there last weekend and I loved this hotel, ideal for business travelers and people who want to be close to the city.

Above all, I would like to mention Georgia's attention, she has been an excellent host and server at the cocktail bar. Thank you for your smile and your special treatment. Georgia is Very Kind.

The breakfast is delicious and the waiters are very friendly, especially Tatiana and the barista.

And of course, highlight the work of Jonas and Sara at the reception, who with their kindness make the hotel a wonderful place.",5,2023,09,23
123,Outstanding receptionist,"On a recent stay at the Marylebone Hotel in London, my husband and I encountered the most professional and accommodating receptionist ever, Roxana.  We had a serious issue with our studio suite and she immediately acknowledged the problem, moved us to a new suite and discounted our room for the previous two nights.  We will definitely return and recommend your hotel to our friends!",4,2023,09,23
123,Wonderful Stay,"We just returned from a wonderful stay at the Marylebone Hotel.  We traveled to London to settle our daughter in for her semester abroad.  The Marylebone was recommended to us by friends who live in London.  The location is incredible, so many cafes and shops to walk to and lots to explore.  The rooms are well appointed and comfortable. The staff were all amazing, especially Adrian who is the concierge.  He greeted us warmly and put us on a priority list for an early check in which was greatly appreciated after our overnight flight.  No request was too small for him to fulfill.  He even brought us over to L'Entrecote behind the hotel to get in the queue for a unique steak dinner experience.  Frederico and Douglas were a pleasure to chat with over perfect martinis in the lobby bar.  We would absolutely stay again and look forward to returning in the future.",5,2023,09,21
123,A stunning hotel in Marylebone ,"Our home whilst we were in London was The Marylebone Hotel. Amazing location. The Loft suite is huge and very luxe. Attention to detail is very apparent in all the little touches, including linen and bathroom amenities. Indoor swimming pool, gym, bar and restaurant all top notch.  We will be back!",5,2023,09,17
123,Perfect place to stay in london,"We have stayed 3 times at the Marylebone this year and we have enjoyed our time there. The rooms are comfortable, breakfast great and excellent service. In particular Palwasha has been very helpful in ensuring that all our needs are met. Also Elizabeth, Jonas and Jo Jo . We will definitely return. We love the area! ",5,2023,09,16
123,Love hospitality,Malachy at front desk and the Italian bartender was fantastic. Comfy beds. Great area for walking around and access to the city. We will certainly be back for a return.  Go to place across for pastries...walk to the park etc.,5,2023,09,16
123,"Great stay, great staff, great location!","My wife and I required a centrally located hotel for our 2-week stay in London during September 2023 and we choose The Marylebone Hotel. 
This proved to be a great choice for us for many reasons but mainly for the location and the wonderful staff. The location is excellent and with Marylebone High Street on its door step, there is a great selection of cafes, restaurants and bars to choose from.
The staff were wonderful, friendly and helpful at every opportunity. Our main contact was the guest services manager Roxana Dramba. She went above and beyond to help us during our stay for which we are extremely grateful. She really ensured we had an excellent customer experience while staying at the hotel.  We will most certainly be back and would highly recommend The Marylebone to anyone who is looking for a great place to stay while in London.

123,My new favorite hotel!!,"Wow! My new favorite hotel. So stylish and chic. The best location in London, in my humble opinion. Walkable to many things, but in a charming and hip neighborhood. So many wonderful restaurants within a few minute walk. Our queen suite was roomy and seemed newly renovated with comfortable beds. The bar area is intimate and moody with excellent cocktails. The staff were nice and extremely helpful. The online photos don’t do it justice…Don’t hesitate!!",5,2023,09,13
123,A truly 5-star experience!,"My stay at The Marylebone was impeccable. I was originally given a room that had a small but noisy function outside, but they expeditiously accommodated my request to move to a quieter room as I was there for business and needed to work. Unfortunately there was no upgrade available, but it did not matter.

Room service from 108 Brasserie was timely and tasty. I had the miso black cod and can highly recommend. They also had a nice amenity of fruit, macarons and brownies as part of my booking through Capital One Premier hotels.

I had to have a rush breakfast the next day before heading to the airport, and they were able (again!) to accommodate my request with understanding, efficiency and aplomb. The buffet is for cold items and larger dishes are ordered off the a la carte menu. 

I can’t speak to the convenience of the location due to the brevity of my stay, but it is a short 20-minute walk to Piccadilly Circus. And Ottolenghi is right across the road!

Everyone who worked there made it feel like every whim was their wish; it was truly a 5-star service experience! Shout out to the doorman, Jonas, who is a sweetheart and very personable.",5,2023,09,12
123,Best concierge ever,My compliments for a great team at The Marylebone but the superstar is their concierge Adrian. He helped me navigate multiple bookings and event tickets with ease and a smile . I shall definitely be back. Thanks for a great experience,5,2023,09,10
123,Loved The Marylebone Hotel!,"Marylebone is by far my favorite location in London and this hotel is perfection! 3rd floor Classic Queen, nice view reminiscent of Peter Pan...Lovely starched white bedding, comfy pillows...yes marble bathroom is small, but they're a full size tub, so no complaints! What makes this hotel stand out is the peaceful location and helpful staff...from bell man, to housekeeping and front desk, everyone is friendly, kind, efficient and caring. Kudos to Malachi Flynn, reception mgr., for his outstanding service. Refreshing! ",5,2023,09,08
123,I wanted to love it,"I wanted to love this boutique hotel near the offices of a client.   They need to up their game on service.    I had requested early check in after arriving from US.  I offered to pay for it.  Next, several calls needed to be made to housekeeping to see if it was possible.  I was told it was if I paid extra.  (Did it). 

Rooms have very comfy beds.  Bathrooms are TINY meaning it's hard to close the door once you are in there.  Each day I had to call to see if they would get me a room service ordering card for breakfast as I was working in the mornings.  So no anticipation of service needs-- one must keep requesting.   I did have wonderfully kind and conscientious room service waiter ( Ninad) at breakfast.  His service encouraged me to offer the property the benefit of doubt.  Likely would not stay here again despite the convenience to my clients office.   I did eat one night in restaurant.  Gazpachos and salad -- tasty and service at dinner good as well.",3,2023,09,07
123,Fabulous hotel,"I have been to the Marylebone 15 times and it never disappoints. The staff/customer service are top shelf. I highly recommend The Marylebone. I only stay at The Marylebone, because they treat everyone in such a special manner. ",5,2023,09,06
123,Concierge Mr.MANDAR,"Super!
Specially MANDAR the concierge, whom help me a lot for a family staff..My daughter is student. Hopefully he was there and did all the things to be safe for her.Also he helped me for restaurants around, Nails Spa etc…👍👍🕺🏻.
Go to reach him!!",5,2023,09,05
123,You won't find better,"My wife and I stayed at the Marylebone Hotel for 5 days in August 2023 and were absolutely thrilled with our decision to stay there. The hotel is located in a fantastic, quiet, and safe area where there are dozens of restaurants ranging from casual ""pubby"" types to the more upscale & trendy (and not overly expensive). We learned about many of them through the hotel concierge, Adrian, who by the way, is an absolutely amazing asset for the Marylebone. He advised us on a daily basis with recommendations we'd more typically expect from a personal travel agent or tour guide. As for the hotel itself, the staff was particularly accommodating. This place is the ultimate boutique hotel, We'll certainly stay there the next time we visit London.",5,2023,09,04
123,Lovely time at The Marylebone,"I just spent 5 nights at The Marylebone and had a wonderful experience. The staff were so welcoming, kind and helpful. My room was cosy and comfy. The neighborhood had a great vibe with lots of history, parks, shopping and great restaurants. The hotel was closely located to the tube and bus transportation and a cab was always available as well. Thank you Mandar for quickly organizing a driver to the Cotswolds. We had a lovely time!!",5,2023,09,04
123,The only place to stay!,"There are not enough words to say how perfect this hotel is. The location is spot on. The tube is .5 miles away and there are a ton of restaurants within walking distance as well. The hotel itself is on a very quiet and charming street so no street noise. It's just the everything you want in a hotel, hotel. Great bar, great lobby, great breakfast and they have a restaurant which is delicious as well. 
Let's not forget about Adrian, the concierge! We certainly put him to the test and he passed with flying colors. He recommended fabulous restaurants, not touristy and neighborhood gems. He was able to plan our daily itineraries, including exactly what trains to take and we were able to get in everything that was on our list for the four days we were there. He actually emailed me while we were out to make sure our day was going well....I mean come on, who does that? Adrian, you are the best!!",5,2023,09,02
123,Wonderful trip,"I stayed at The Marylebone for two nights in July.  Check in was easy and friendly.  My room, which was a 'cosy room' was just that.  It was enough space for me... I think even for two people it would be ok, but not a ton of space.  Everything was clean. 

The pool was located in the basement - you don't have to leave the hotel to get there.  You use your room key to go to the gym reception - check in and then go downstairs.  It's a nice space and there is a steam room too.  You can use the lockers and they have towels to use. 

The attached restaurant was lovely - I was there by myself for dinner and the staff were so attentive and caring.  They made sure I was sitting somewhere nice and I just want to say a BIG thank you to them for making me feel so welcome and not at all awkward.  The restaurant was beautiful and the food was great.

The bar was great too - really well made drinks and great service. 

I just loved this hotel and I want to go back!

123,Best VFM hotel in central London,"I can’t believe, after so many years of travelling to London for both business and pleasure, it’s taken me so long to find this gem. Constantly getting rinsed for over-priced, average quality hotel rooms, this place is the best VFM hotel bar none. Perfect location, friendly attentive staff, great breakfast. I love it.",5,2023,08,30
123,Highly recommend this hotel,"We really enjoyed our stay at the Marylebone. The few small issues with had with our room (TV, lights) were taken care of immediately. The breakfast was very good, and the neighborhood was full of interesting shops and good restaurants. Also it was convenient to other areas and the underground. 
I want to especially commend the night staff (Elizabeth, Isaac and Mohammed) for going above and beyond to get us breakfast before we had to leave for a very early flight.",5,2023,08,27
123,The most comfortable hotel in Marylebone,"I stayed at this hotel in august of 2023 for 2 weeks and it was great in terms of service and cleanness. The rooms were also spacious. The staff were very positive and friendly, they’re always ready to service us, in particular Roxana who who always greeted us positively. I definitely Recommend this hotel to anyone whose planning on visiting London.",5,2023,08,27
123,Best Hotel in London.,"Just returned from a delightful stay at The Marylebone hotel.  The stay far exceeded any other hotel stay we have experienced.   Upon arrival the doorman and concierge staff were warm, friendly and hospitable and their manner was not scripted but was genuine.   The guest experience host had hand written a card for our anniversary with such kind words, as well as flowers and a balloon, we were both so touched by these kind gestures and this made our stay even more special.   To sum up our experience, if you wish to stay in a 5 star hotel in luxury surroundings which feel like a home and the service feels like a warm hug then this is the place to stay, nothing is too much trouble and the hotel is a real gem in a great location.",5,2023,08,24
123,Adrian and staff were impeccable! ,"My wife and I stayed at The Marylebone last week for five nights.

We were in town for a business conference and a little sightseeing afterwards. We booked the hotel through American Express Fine Hotels & Resorts collection and found it to be fairly central to everything we needed to do.

Unfortunately, upon arriving in England, my baggage was lost and I was actually told by British Airways that it was stolen. I had a business conference for two days immediately following our arrival, and we were in a panic to begin replacing my suits and other items.

Once we arrived at the hotel, we went to our assigned hotel room. Frankly, we were not enthralled with the first room we were presented with because it had an odd shape, and we had booked a larger studio suite. The staff accommodated us by showing us other available rooms we could possibly move to, but we needed to go shopping to replace my items.

Adrian, the concierge, had been discussing with my wife where to go to get suits and a tailor. Adrian went so far as to locate a tailor that he knew and had them on standby for me, so no matter what, I could have my suits tailored immediately.

To make a long story short, we ended up purchasing the suits at the store he recommended and had them tailored immediately so that everything went smoothly with my conference. When we returned to the hotel, the staff had located a room on the seventh floor to move us to. That room was far superior to the others and came at no additional cost.

That night, we sat at the hotel bar, spoke with the wonderful bartenders from Italy, and finally got to relax and start enjoying our trip.

From the front desk staff to Adrian at the concierge, the doorman, and the cleaning staff, our service experience was exceptional. I am very impressed with this hotel and will stay there again on my future trips to London. Thank you, everyone at The Marylebone!",5,2023,08,24

123,"Location, Room, & Adrian!","I had a great time staying at the hotel, the best thing about it is that the it’s close to most shopping stores and restaurants, yet in a quiet neighborhood. 

I had an excellent experience, as by the time I checked out leaving to airport, Adrian helped me measure the weight of my luggage in the hotel before heading to airport, as that helped me not go through the struggle at the check in desk! 

We had to move stuff from one bag to the other up to 3 times to insure we don’t exceed the limit.

Staff are super friendly and helpful. Didn’t have enough time to try the restaurants and other facilities. 

But Adrian was always nice, and although I’m always in a rush. I can still remember his face, he never hesitate to say hi and have a quick chat. 

I would definitely love to stay here again.

123,Wonderful and helpful staff . The hotel is modern and in a great location. Excellent overall.,"From the minute we arrived the wonderful experience of staying at The Marylebone Hotel started .

We were then guided to our beautiful, clean, spacious room which had everything we would need .
Sri Sompalli from the hotel’s Guest Experience department had contacted me a few days earlier and had arranged for fresh flowers , a thoughtful hand written card plus a ballon to be in the room on our arrival. My wife was very impressed by this .

123,"Incredible staff, gym and hotel!","This is such a great hotel. I’ve stayed all over London this year in 5 star hotels but this actually has become one of the best I’ve stayed in and here’s why:

Staff - the staff really are incredible. Everyone is super helpful and friendly. It’s on another level to anything I’ve experienced in London. Jorge is the most welcoming, friendly and helpful hotel manager I’ve ever come across. 
Also have to mention Mandar who helped us get a lost item back. 

Gym - The third space gym amenities take hotel gym to another level simply because it’s a partnership the gym has with an impressive gym in the complex. It’s perfect for gym goers wanting to get workouts in before or after work.

Location - the location is great and although in a map it doesn’t appear to be that close the buzz of London, it’s only a few streets away from great restaurants and shops. The great thing it’s slightly away from the hustle and bustle to have the best of both worlds.

Decor and Rooms - the rooms and decor are really chic. The bar and restaurant are always busy full of people wanting to experience the service, food and cocktails.

Thank you for a great stay! I’ll defiantly be back when I’m next in London!",5,2023,08,09

123,Terrible experience,"Not only I was given a tiny room by the service elevator and every morning the hotel stuff would start their day early, talking very loud between them and being very noisy with their trolleys. But had a major issue with some gifts I asked to the concierge to deliver to some customers staying at the same hotel. They never gave the presents to them. I learnt few days later for the customers that they never received anything from me. After almost ten days of calls, turning in rounds, they told me they would send by courier the gifts to my customer. The customer received only a part of the gifts I left at the hotel. Extremely disappointed from such a high standing hotel. 
I wouldn’t recommend it. They are not serious.",1,2023,07,28
123,Close to everything and great staff at the hotel,"Lovely rooms with great staff. They were so helpful and friendly. It’s so central and close to everything. You can walk to Selfridges (7-10 min walk) Godwin Chima is the absolute man.

123,If you want to feel special….,"We stayed 2 nights to celebrate our 40th Wedding Anniversary. We hadn’t stayed at The Marylebone before but they made us feel like very special returning guests. From the welcome on arrival, through the lovely goodies in our room & spotless housekeeping to the wonderful service from everyone - breakfast staff, front desk & doormen - it was all truly special. Although I think the hotel has about 200 rooms it felt more like a smaller boutique hotel where every guest really mattered. We had a truly memorable stay & we would highly recommend The Marylebone Hotel",5,2023,07,17

They were super efficient right from reservation through to final check-out, and they treated us and our family guests with kindness, politeness and a great sense of humour, which we found utterly charming. We were made to feel very special - the Guest Experience team had even decorated our room with a beautiful vase of flowers, with wedding balloons, fresh macarons and a bottle of champagne, chilling on ice, which was a lovely and unexpected surprise when we returned to the hotel from the church. Roxana as Guest Services Manager, was an absolute delight and made sure that our wedding weekend at the hotel was totally joyful! The warmth and friendliness of the entire staff was simply amazing - we could not have wished for a nicer hotel stay nor a more perfect place to enjoy celebrating getting married in London.

123,Wonderful Stay ,"Very service oriented.   Nasim was particularly helpful after I checked in and offered to show me a larger studio room if I wanted to upgrade myself for an extra fee.   The new room was large and comfortable for 6 night stay.   JoJo, the bellman always greeted me by name which was impressive considering how many guests they must have. 

My main reason for choosing this hotel was the adjacent health club and pool that hotels guests had full access.   Big bonus for me to start day with sauna and swim. ",5,2023,06,25

I wanted to feel comfortable and pampered. My expectations were truly met. The hotel is stunning, decorated to a beautiful and high standard. My room was warm, comfortable and welcoming. The bathroom and toiletries a delight, and I had the most fluffiest bath robe ever. I dined alone in the restaurant and requested a quiet table as was not looking my best. I was looked after well and seated in a cozy quiet section of the restaurant. The food and service were excellent. 

My most memorable experience and memories however of The Marylebone, are the wonderful ladies who looked after me on reception. They were aware I was staying alone, and of my surgery and they couldn’t do more to make feel safe, welcome and valued.

Andrea’s the Guest Experience Manager was a delight and helped us with an issue outside of the hotel. 

The ladies in the cocktail bar were lovely. Knowledgeable, and friendly!

And Barta and Aileen (scuse spelling) in the 108 were just amazing. They were great company, offered great advise and bent over to help us. Going to meals was like bumping into old friends. Just superb!

This was reflective across all the staff we met. Just a wonderful experience. 

It is not cheap, for sure but not remotely sterile or false like many top end hotels I have stayed at. The staff appear to enjoy being there!

We have stayed here twice and will certainly stay again for special occasion and and I shall be looking for excuses to classify trips as special!

We look forwards to our next stay !

Thank you!

123,Amazing stay,"When I first arrived at the hotel, I felt very welcomed in the reception area. Roxana greeted me very well and treated me very well. Even the location of the hotel was very nice and near everything. I was very happy with my stay and I’m definitely coming back. Definitely Recommend this hotel to anyone going to London.",5,2023,05,10
123,London vacation ,"Best hotel and location. Staff could not have been nicer. I stayed here and requested a quiet room which they tried to give me by putting me at the end of a hallway and facing an alleyway but alas delivery trucks and trash men destroyed any quiet. They then moved me to the top floor not on a street and I was in heaven. Shoutout to Andras and Mandar who went above and beyond to make sure I was happy. The staff more then earned my respect as they consistently went out of their way to make sure all was well. This is a top notch hotel in a great neighborhood and would 100% recommend it to anyone wanting a classy, cool hotel. I didn’t use the gym which is connected to the hotel but it had a pool and I heard it was great. Just loved loved loved my stay so a HUGE thank you to making it great. And lastly shout out to the General Manager who made a point of introducing himself. AGAIN HIGH MARKS to the staff!",5,2023,05,05
123,Lovely stay at the Marylebone hotel,"I  recently enjoyed a lengthy ( 9 nights ) stay at this lovely hotel. Traveling solo on this trip for a couple of dental procedures, this hotel is perfectly located for all the medical facilities that this area has to offer, not to mention the fabulous high street with great shops, restaurants and pubs on the doorstep. 
After a warm welcome on arrival I was pleased to be allocated a cute room on the 5th floor perfect for a solo traveler. It was a queen junior suite but actually felt like two separate rooms due to the L shaped layout. It was very comfortable and well appointed with perfect bedding, towels and bathrobes, plenty of coffee and water amenities included.The room  location was also quite quiet. Very clean as housekeeping does an excellent job in this hotel. ( A few knocks and marks on the furniture but clean nonetheless).
The 108 Brasserie was always busy and the staff were all very kind and friendly especially Beata. The maitre’d always greeted me with my name and a smile, (sorry I didn’t catch his name). The food and wine selection was very good  made with quality ingredients. I also had room service on 3 occasions which always arrived immediately and on a perfectly laid out tray. I met with the Guest Experience Manager, Andras Jeremias by chance and discussed my stay experience with him . He kindly sent a lovely gift to my room later that day. The cocktail bar and overall deco and artwork in the hotel is very pleasant and makes for a comfortable stay with lots of different rooms to relax in off the lobby. In the lower floors the hotel is served by huge gym and a pool.
I am looking forward to returning very soon.

123,ONE OF THE BEST HOTELS I HAVE STAYED IN,THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST HOTELS I HAVE STAYED IN ACROSS THE WORLD. THE FOOD IS UNBELIEVABLE THE BEST STEAK/BREKFAST/CHICKEN MILANESE EVER! FROM OUR ARRIVAL MALACHY AT THE FRON DEST AND THE WHOLE TEAM DELIVERED THE ULTIMATE CUSTOMER SERVICE EXPERIENCE. THE ROOM WAS SPACIOUS CLEAN AND SERVICE JUST FANTASTIC! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED ! ,5,2023,05,05
123,An Absolute GEM in London,"The staff at the Marylebone Hotel is probably the most attentive and friendly of any staff at any Hotel I have ever stayed.  Every person we encountered went out of their way to help, not only in just the regular ""I'm a tourist and need assistance"" ways, but above and beyond that.  Andras the Guest Experience manager took time to assemble a Transformer for my 4 year old son.  Mandar, the concierge, helped us with every experience we had in the city.  We had candy and plush toys and coloring books delivered to our room for my son, free of charge. The doormen everyday helped us navigate our way around and took time to converse with my son and give him high fives and fist bumps.  The room was lovely, well appointed and the bed, very comfortable.  But more importantly, you knew when you went down or called the front for any reason you would be treated like you were in a high-end establishment, without the high-end establishment prices (comparatively to what those prices are... it's not cheap, but it's not the Waldorf)  When we go back to London, we will be goign back to the Marylebone Hotel.  ",5,2023,05,01
123,Beautiful hotel and amazing service!,"I was traveling abroad to London on business and stayed at the Marylebone Hotel. This is a wonderful location in a beautiful neighborhood. It is a short walk to high street shopping. It is easy to access by taxi from the airport. The hotel was clean and stylish. The restaurant and bar had amazing service and menus. My colleagues and I ate breakfast and multiple dinners at the restaurant on site. I stayed in a cozy room which was just the right size for my trip needs. Housekeeping was friendly and my room was always clean. The front desk staff were welcoming, very helpful and professional. Mandar (Conceirge) was extremely helpful in organizing a shipment I needed to send out. His customer service level was beyond 5 stars! 
I would highly recommend the Marylebone hotel for personal or business stay.",5,2023,05,01
123,A wonderful anniversary experience,The Marylebone is a wonderful hotel close to many of the main attractions in London. The staff are top notch and gave us a lovely experience for our anniversary. The bar service and breakfast were exceptional. Cannot recommend this hotel or the Doyle Group enough.,5,2023,04,27
123,The best of London !,"Our second stay at this elegant, stylish boutique hotel in the heart of Marylebone village.

The facilities are fantastic (bar, gym, pool, brasserie) and the helpful and friendly staff are the cherry on top.

Special thank you to Andras, the Guest Experience Manager, who added magic to our special anniversary weekend and made our stay even more wonderful!! 

We can’t wait to be back again!

123,"Stylish and Friendly Boutique Hotel, Incredibly Well Situated","This cozy and chic boutique hotel is tucked away on a quiet street, but just moments away from a wide array of marvelous shops, restaurants and tourist attractions (such as my fave London museum, The Wallace Collection) in the upmarket and trendy  Marylebone area.  The hotel's staff are numerous, attentive and friendly.  There is a lovely bar and meeting area.  A full service restaurant, 108 Brasserie, is situated in the back of the hotel.  This is a great quiet yet cosmopolitan retreat for your stay in the ever bustling London.  I would definitely consider staying here again in my next visit to London.",5,2023,04,19
123,Wonderful and caring staff,"My mother has been staying here whilst having medical treatment nearby and the staff have been wonderful in looking after her and looking out for her at all times. Special mention to Mandar, one of the concierges, who has been very kind, but everyone has made her feel extremely well looked after - thank you all",5,2023,04,19
123,A wonderful stay ,"We visited London for few days during the Easter/Passover/Ramadan holidays.. The hotel was fully booked, but Palwasha and Malacky at the reception made us feel   special answered our questions, and catered  to all our needs. They  even surprized  us with personalized birthday wishes, baloon and cake waiting in our room .
The room and breakfast were great! It is not our first time at the hotel, and after this stay we   will definitly return.  ",4,2023,04,18
123,Great Stay,"Small (yet comfortable) rooms, beautiful decoration and atmosphere in the common areas, great location... but, above all, excepcional treatment by the team. Special thanks to Katerina (Reservations), Roxana (Reception) and David (Concierge) for having taken fantastic care of me before and during my stay.",5,2023,04,18
123,Warm Recommendation,We enjoyed very much our stay at the hotel. We would like to specifically mention the service and attention we received from Mr. Mandar Naik and the rest of the hotel staff. The breakfast was excellent.,5,2023,04,17
123,Access to a great gym ,"This is a solid choice hotel for central London. Great location just 20min walk to Marylebone Station or 30min walk to Paddington. You can walk to Oxford Circus in 10mins. 

The staff are all very friendly and professional, or those I encountered were, especially in the restaurant and concierge. The food in the restaurant was delicious, I had dinner and breakfast and the quality remained high across all meals. 

Guest rooms let the hotel down a little. Its a maze and I took the wrong turn a few times. As expected because its a London hotel the room was very small. That said it had most of what I needed, robes, slippers, tea and coffee facilities, nice amenities in the bathroom, big TV, very good WiFi. The shower was powerful, there was a bath but no salts and the bed was comfy. The negatives however, no iron and ironing board so I had to go out with a creased shirt, it was pretty noisy from the road and I couldn't get the room warm, it remained pretty cold no matter what I did with the thermostat. Also for a luxury hotel the carpet was a little worn and tatty and looked very similar to the carpet you get in Premier Inns.. no shade on Premier Inns, for budget hotels they are generally awesome. 

Now to the gym.. this was an absolute golden addition to this hotel. Probably the best hotel gym I've ever seen. It is an independent gym attached to the hotel that guests have free access to. A lift takes you from the hotel straight into the gym. It's well kitted out with everything you need for a solid workout and is set across three floors. Loads of dumbbells, barbells, trap bars, racks, resistance kit, loads of cardio machines. The changing rooms are kitted out with a sauna, iron and ironing board, deodorant, toner, hair spray, cotton pads, earbuds, hair bands, hair dryers, towels, cowshed amenities and weighing scales. You can also access the swimming pool through the changing room. I always have to train in pay as you go gyms normally when I travel but this one had everything I needed. 

All in all a good choice, the reason I couldn't give 5* were for the points above on the actual room. 
",4,2023,04,16
123,The best hotel in London,"Everything about our stay was perfect. Every single member of staff is an absolute credit to the hotel. From the staff at the front of the hotel who helped take our cases, to those on reception and everyone else we encountered were all lovely. Even when walking down a corridor, we were greeted and asked how our day was going. This felt genuine and sincere too. I have stayed here many times before and would not stay anywhere else in London. The hotel still retains its family feel and is almost a home away from home but everything about it is luxurious. 

We would like to give two particular thanks to Andreas for the beautiful welcome gift of sparkling wine and chocolate and to Jonny one of the porters. On our return from Paris, we asked if we could leave our bags with you for a couple of hours whilst waiting for our return train to Manchester. Jonny was so accommodating and allowed us to leave our cases. This is again first class service. We had a great chat with Jonny before leaving. It is so nice that your staff take time out of their busy days to interact with clients.

The breakfast was beautiful and the location of the hotel is amazing. Honestly we cannot recommend this hotel enough!",5,2023,04,13
123,The perfect London home away from home,"After venturing in most London hotels for business purposes, I only came back to this one as I love everything about it: its central location, bedding quality, convenient access to gym and pool, incredibly yummy breakfast (highly recommend the granola and porridge for sweet tooth) but above all its very kind, caring and dedicated staff. A special and very warm thank to Roxana who is the loveliest and makes sure you do have the best stay. ",5,2023,04,13
123,Exceptional experience,"Our stay at the Marylebone was perfect from start to finish ! 
On arrival we were asked was it for a Special occasion and it was for my nieces birthday so she was given a teddy bear and the lovely girl who checked us in said she would organise some birthday treats to the room the next day for her . 
We met John in concierge who went above and beyond to help us and because of him he cut hours of travel time off our journey to the Harry Potter studio , he was exceptional. 
We also were assisted by mandar who was very professional and helpful to us . 
The hotel was exceptional, lovely friendly atmosphere and helpful staff from start to finish. 
We will definitely return thank you 😘",5,2023,04,09
123,Very good quality,"Really good quality in almost all respects. London hotels were very pricey at the time we went - Easter - so we had to swallow the cost. We had a King deluxe which was lovely. Only criticism would be the bathroom - a shower over bath, not walk in. And the bathroom was small. Service was excellent, both reception and restaurant. We had the continental breakfast and it was great, plenty of choice, high quality OJ and at £18 not too expensive for the area - we would happily walk in as non residents if we were in the area.",4,2023,04,09
123,Fantastic hotel and staff. Absolute perfection.,"Fantastic in every way. Staff was attentive and very welcoming, rooms comfortable and efficient. Breakfast was wonderful each morning and room service was timely. The location was wonderful as Marylebone was a very neighborly feel and not overly touristy. Stay here!",5,2023,04,05
123,perfect boutique hotel in perfect location ,"This is my second time staying in The Marylebone ..I cannot praise Andras Jermias and his staff enough... Palwasha was helpful and nothing too much trouble. Also a big thank you to Alister Sivills who helped me with my reservation this time and made everything effortless my end..
The staff are just brilliant from the concierges to the beautiful Noa and Michele in the cocktail bar who made my stay very special.  Well done to you all, a beautiful hotel in a great location. We will be back to stay again soon.",5,2023,04,05
123,Exceptional Customer Service - thanks Andras Jeremias,"All I have is utter praise for The Marylebone Hotel - I've stayed there a number of times in the past - rooms are comfortable, location is superb and they do the best breakfast in London! On my most recent stay we had a leak in the AC unit and the drip kept my husband awake during the night. I called reception the next morning to let them know. Someone was up to check it out immediately. We went out for the day exploring and when we came back, we were told we would be move to another room........I was expecting a similar room, but wow was I in for a fabulous surprise - we were upgraded to room 736 - an amazing suite with outdoor terrace, huge open plan living room, bar, eating area, comfortable bedroom and the most gorgeous bathroom with TV in the bath area. In total four TV's, two gas fires, 700 sq foot space, terrace could have entertained 20 people.......in one word SUBLIME. Not only that but the fantastic manager Andras Jeremias had kindly left a complimentary bottle of wine, chocolates and a thoughtful hand written not to apologise for the inconvenience. Needless to say we abandoned out plans to go to a local restaurant and I soaked in the fab bath and we ordered up room service (which was delicious!) and make the most of the suite. I want to say a huge thank you to Andras and all the team at The Marylebone Hotel for such a treat and we are looking forward to our return trip - we can't afford the price of room 736 but any room in the hotel is great. Highly recommend this wonderful hotel!!",5,2023,04,03
123,Best 5 star hotel for a relaxing stay in London,This is my go to London Hotel. Super location. Friendly staff and ver accommodating. Not to stuffy for a five star hotel and therefore relaxing.

123,Treated like royalties,"This is my second time in this hotel. It never disappoints! We spent 3 wonderful nights in London. The hotel is well positioned, right in the heart of the centre but a bit further away from the busy tourist spots. A few minutes walk from Oxford street and the closest tube station. The rooms are spacious, tastefully decorated. Super comfy beds with crispy linens. We had a late night snack, accompanied with delish cocktails in the bar area. Special shout out to Andras and Roxana, who made our stay special. We were treated like royalties! Can't wait to return in the very very near future. ",5,2023,03,15

123,Mrs. Florentina Grosu,"Have been staying at the hotel for a few days in February 2023. Very nice service and the location is very good, you can take walks by foot to a lot of important sites, including Hyde Park. Roxana from the reception was particularly helpful, always guiding and advising for one’s stay to be as comfortable as possible. 
Also, good food and a nice spot for business meetings. Would recommend. :)",5,2023,02,12
123,Perfect Babymoon Getaway,"The Marylebone was perfection from start to finish. The hotel is on a quite street but then you turn the corner and there are adorable shops, restaurants, etc. making it the perfect location to explore London. Everyone who worked at this hotel went above and beyond; they were so nice and accommodating. From check-in, to having breakfast every morning to check-out, our experience was so lovely. The breakfast was also so filling and went above and beyond anything you get here in the states; we were so impressed and very full! We will definitely be coming back!",5,2023,02,11

A fantastic stay at the stunning Marleybone. We started off with afternoon tea which was delightful and we were waited on and looked after extremely well by Miguel. Everything you would expect and more from a high end afternoon tea. 
We then treated ourselves to dinner at the restaurant and wow the food was incredible and was made even better by the service we received from Elenor  (who remembered all 8 of our names when serving us) and Emre who was extremely attentive. 
Overall one of the best hotels I’ve stayed at in London, I would highly recommend.",5,2023,01,30

The access to the pool was a bit confusing and the deposit payment they take wasn't explained on check in very well but all good in the end. Requested a late checkout and that was no problem.

Mandar Naik went out of his way to make sure I was ok. He mailed a package for me, brought me ice, found my phone in my room..even tied my shoe as I couldn’t bend over. Amazing!!

123,Faded glory,"We always considered the Doyle properties must stays in London. Have stayed at all their hotels in London various times of year since 2016, particularly the Kensington and Marylebone. This last stay at the Marylebone will be our last Doyle visit. 
It was a very poor experience from the moment we arrived until our departure 3 days later. The front desk attitude was disinterested and unwelcoming. Walking to our studio suite room we noticed very unpleasant odors in the hallway (old fish curry takeaway?) entering the room was like walking into a sauna. Very hot and steamy. On a cool October afternoon. The staff carrying our bags was flustered, tried to open the non functioning windows, agreed it was very hot (thermostat showed 85f) and took us back to reception. 
We spoke to the manager and were informed that the hotel was full, so the steam room was our only option. After refusing to accept this she returned and said they could make an exception and that they had a beautiful upgrade for us. We were moved with our luggage to the basement to what could only be described as a dystopian gulag. Also very hot, with NO WINDOWS. Our original room was top floor studio suite with a city view. Also hallways still smelled of fish stew. Exhausted from travel we relegated ourselves to the top floor toaster oven. Maintenance staff arrived and removed wall panels, worked on the cooling and were able to get it down a few degrees, said there were cooling problems. We were able to get a window partly open, and slept without covers, listening to traffic noise. Hardly a 5 star experience for 650 pounds a night. I think we were given 2 drink tickets for our trouble. 
It wasn’t just us. Dismay was the common theme among lift rides with other guests. And the smell never left. Bizarre. 
So. No longer our favorite properties in London to say the least. Our sixth stay at a London Doyle definitely our last. Sad. Anyone have a recommendation for a good hotel in London?",3,2023,01,20
123,Brilliant Hotel,We stayed in the hotel for two nights and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. It was a brilliant hotel with good facilities and we were provided with great service. Malachy the reception manager looked after us and was extremely helpful. We will definitely stay again!,5,2023,01,18

123,An amazing hotel,"We visited The Marylebone together with another couple and we are all in agreement that it is one of the best hotel stays we have every experienced. From the moment of arrival everything was easy, staff extremely friendly while professional and always available during the entire stay. A big hotel but with the feeling of a small boutique hotel with great ambience - truly a secret, beautiful hide away from the busy streets of central London. Reception staff helped us with everything we could think of, breakfast and room service menus were outstanding and the gym (with pool - a rare sight at hotels in London) held very high standard. A special thanks to the doorman John who was not only a great conversation but also beyond helpful everytime we arrived by the steps of the hotel.",5,2023,01,09
123,Beautiful hotel in a wonderful neighborhood,"I stayed at the Marylebone Hotel with ~40 of my colleagues for a work retreat December 2022 and could not be happier with the experience.

I would 100% return for work, or with my family - kids included. It was a dream!",5,2023,01,09
123,Lovely stay at the Marylebone,After reading some of the reviews after I booked this hotel I was a bit concerned! I didn’t need to worry though. The staff were all amazing and the service second to none. The location of the hotel is wonderful. The bed was really comfortable with immaculate white bedding which I love. The room was a little small but in London is really to be expected. I would highly recommend and we will certainly be returning.  ,5,2023,01,07

123,London solo trip,Great stay for one person.  In a great neighbourhood within walking distance to a lot of great shops and restaurants.  The staff was very friendly and accomodating and very helpful.  The concierge team was great.,4,2022,12,21

123,Perfect Gem of a Hotel,Perfect location in Marylebone.  You don't really feel like you are in London! Away from the mayhem it is a delightful location.  The hotel's cozy bar serves great food or try the Brasserie 108 - lovely vibe in the bar here - cocktails and the perfect pint of guiness!  Rooms are super comfy with Malin & Goetz products. Brilliant breakfast.  Highly recommend.,5,2022,12,12
123,Beautiful hotel in a great location,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Attention to detail is everywhere you turn and you’re made to feel welcomed and important. 

Rooms are beautiful and immaculate and location is superb. 

We would certainly return when visiting London again. ",5,2022,12,11
123,Service needs improving,"I had a great ribeye steak here but what spoilt it was being told they had no English mustard, only whole grain! 

Then 90% through my meal I was asked if I wanted more and that time I had a choice of English and whole grain 😞

Everything else was very good however!!",4,2022,12,08
123,Best Customer Service in London,"Was on a business trip to London for 5 days with my wife, who is recovering from a major stroke and has many challenges.  The staff, and particularly the concierge, couldn't have been more attentive, helpful or thoughtful.  They made a potentially challenging trip easy. This is our ""go to"" hotel in London!",5,2022,12,08
123,Excellent Customer Service!,"Came back to the hotel for dinner after a great stay back in the summer, and was surprised and delighted that I was remembered by the manager, Malachy. I mentioned I was back for a birthday dinner, and he surprised me even further by sending our table a bottle of bubbly! What a lovely touch.

The 108 staff had been fantastic as well, they were extremely friendly and attentive. They also took care of us the whole time. Food was great. I will most definitely be back to stay again, or even just to dine! Thank you to the Marylebone team.",5,2022,12,06
123,Best Value in London,Long overdue review from summer 2022...this is a London hotel favorite for us; we always look forward to staying here - the value is incredible. They staff are wonderful and the location is fantastic. This was a deferred trip from the beginning of covid and the front desk was always so helpful with adjusting our details and answering our questions. We're looking forward to continuing our visits here asap! Thank you again so much for making our vacations so great!,5,2022,12,06
123,Wonderful place,"This is our 3rd time hear with same friends and it’s definitely one place to stay in London. The moment you step into the doors of reception, which a door man will do for you, it feels good and I know we are going to have a lovely stay. Great location, shops, bars all around yet peaceful. Once checked in and in our room with free delights, ( complementary to do our friends) you feel special.. large bed, seats, iron, iron board, hairdryer, tea, coffee and bottles of water ready to use. All of good quality. The shower is of a good size. The breakfast room is vast, the cold buffet is there for you two help yourself, hots drinks order taken by waitress/ waiters. As is choice of hot food.. buffet is something to see for yourself. The pouched eggs.. well I must say best ever.. yellow in the middle of the egg is again something to see for your own eyes.. nothing is to much trouble and we are planning to go back few more times next year. Our friends book the rooms, we had de lux .. I am sure when we go on our own we won’t be disappointed. The staff are so polite and professional. Well done all of you, maids do “turn down” also on an evening, just those little things that count.",5,2022,12,04
123,"It´s the ""ultimate"" - the only - place for Christmas","It´s been my fifth year for Christmas and I believe my eigth visit in total to this place and it never disappoints. After a year of Covid-related difficulties, this year the hotel became a cosy place again with the lounge for tea, the bar for apres-cocktails, the 108 for dining and partying with friends after shopping. The place is luxury, yes, but you know what you get for such a price - luxury. The rooms are cleaned up to twice a day, the breakfast offers excellency in service and quality and the reception staff makes you feel at ease, especially Laura from Spain, Ben and Godwin both from the UK the later who is indeed an icon of service in the late evening when you feel welcomed returning from sightseeing. Apart from the obvious Regent street and Carnaby Street area nearby, Marylebone itself offers a tremendous variety of shops and restaurants and this part of town alone is worth to stay here. As an addition, the Third Space spa of the gym is great to relax in both sauna and steam room, though this hotel does never react to the ""European"" question of opening the spa longer than the obvious 20 o´clock at weekends, because especially on a Sunday, once you return and your feet burn, you would ultimately want to relax in a steam room because entering either bars or restaurants. But maybe it´s just me. I love this place, and I cannot wait to return for Easter.",5,2022,11,30
123,I had high hopes,I had stayed at other doyle hotels and had high hopes. Location was great and service at bar and restaurant very good. Great gym  Multiple problems with room (hvac broken) very noisy Given a key to someone elses room which  was occupied   Many small touches mentioned on website as included in room were forgotten.  Lots of very nice staff.  Just didnt come together to deliver the experience ,3,2022,11,30
123,"Uncomfortably Small Room, Great Location","This hotel has a great location, right in the beautiful neighborhood of Marylebone. The room and bathroom were unfortunately quite small, even for London standards. I would not recommend the cosy room, that was a mistake.  The bathroom was tiny, and very uncomfortable. 
The service, on the the other hand, was great. The bar downstairs had great cocktails and an excellent wait staff. Overall,  although I liked the location, service, and cocktail bar, I do not think I will be staying here again.",3,2022,11,27
123,The Marylebone,My family loved the outstanding amenities at the Marylebone hotel! The food was exquisite and the service was even better! The bell and concierge staff made a huge difference in helping us plan our way around London. Thank you for a trip we will never forget!!,5,2022,11,26
123,Top service,Great staff and incredible service.  Very friendly and helpful.  Made me feel at home and very comfortable. Willingness to find solutions for my special requests. Very nice pool and sauna facilities. Perfect central location.,5,2022,11,19
123,"Excellent stay, wish I didn't have to leave!","The Marylebone was simply perfect. Friendly and professional staff. Clean and comfortable room. Beautiful common spaces for hotel guests. Breakfast was simply superb. Food and drink lovely. But the attentive of staff tremendous, remembering my name and orders from day prior. It was a dream stay. Wish I didn't have to leave! Gladly return and recommend!",5,2022,11,18
123,"Noisy room but super friendly, helpful and very professional staff","Very friendly staff, helpful and very professional, but my room is quite noisy. The first room I was assigned was quite noisy with what sounded like construction work going on above it, drilling sounds, thumps and bangs. I was assigned another room but there is a lot of banging and what sounds like things being dropped on the floor. I chose this hotel because it is quite close to the hospital where I had my operation and was hoping for a few days/nights of peace and quiet to recuperate. I haven’t raised the issue of noise again because I am not sure if I will ever get a quiet room and I cannot bare the thought of moving again. Hopefully tomorrow it will be quieter. Quality and service by staff is definitely 5 star, the only negative is the noise issue, otherwise I would everything else is 5 star.",3,2022,11,17
123,Fabulous stay,"Our stay at the Marylebone was perfect. From the moment we arrived we were treated very well by all members of staff who were courteous and friendly, Our room was spacious and well equipped with a super comfy bed. We went to the cocktail bar for the evening, which was comfortable, relaxed and with a lovely ambiance . A special mention to Miguel who’s drinks and overall customer service was excellent. Certainly wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel.",5,2022,11,13
123,Amazing hotel!,"Amazing hotel with super attentive staff.  I was there for a week with work and I hope to stay there again. The room was lovely and spacious and the bed was super comfy. The room service was excellent, having pretty much the full menu available from 108 brasserie. 5 stars just isn’t enough!",5,2022,11,13
123,Great hotel,"Had the best time in this hotel. Room facilities and attention to detail was amazing 
Staff super friendly and gave an upgrade and bottle of wine when found out celebrating our anniversary 
Roxana in particular was brilliant but so were the many other staff - too many to mention by name -  from the time of arrival to the time we left.
Would highly recommend thanks we will be back",5,2022,11,12
123,Best spot for both tourists and business travelers!,"Fantastic location, great quaint little hotel. But the real winner is the staff who are some of the most attentive and well mannered I’ve ever come across. Kudos especially to Mandar Malik, assistant head concierge who was always around to attend to any concerns.
Will definitely visit again!! ",5,2022,11,12
123,Lovely experience,Lovely luxury hotel. Really liked the intimate cosy feel of this hotel. Situated near Marylebone village makes it great for shopping. Staff very friendly and efficient. Mr Naik the concierge was excellent. Definitely recommend,5,2022,11,11
123,Return to London and the Marylebone was Great,"We spent 5 days here in November 2022 and we will return. This is our second visit to the Marylebone Hotel. The first was in 2019, just before COVID. We love the location and it’s proximity to great bars, restaurants and shopping. It’s not far from Paddington station, which makes it straightforward to transfer here from Heathrow. The hotel is nicely designed and well-appointed without feeling stuffy. The staff is warm and welcoming. The concierge (Mandar) is excellent - always ready to provide a recommendation, a reservation or an explanation about how to get somewhere. He is a good example of why we like this hotel. ",5,2022,11,11
123,overpriced,"this is a nice hotel, and in a good location. i also cannot fault the service, however per night this is vastly overpriced, i stayed in a premier inn (one of the better ones) recently and there really was no difference yet it was a fraction of the price.",3,2022,11,09
123,Excellent choice for central London,"A very nice Hotel a few steps of Oxford Street. Very good staff, excellent breakfast. The rooms are quite nice, the showers maybe the best ever. The direct surrounding is attractive, the touristmagnetshoppingarea is a small footwork away.",5,2022,11,07
123,Business trip and meeting in the Marylebone,"Cosy atmosphere, friendly staff and excellent food and drinks. Rooms are clean, bed is made in the morning and also prepared for the night. Loved the coffee machine in the rom. Food in the restaurant was excellent. 
In summary: I can highly the hotel",5,2022,11,05
123,A marvelous experience,"We recently stayed at the Marylebone Hotel for a family trip a 70th birthday. I have to say the Marylebone really exceeded our expectations. It's a bit of a hidden gem and located in such a beautiful part of London with lovely fashionable shops, bars and restaurants around. The staff could not do enough for us to make us feel so welcome. We will definitely be back !",5,2022,10,31
123,Best location!,"Loved the Marylebone, their staff (in particular Laura and Andrei at the reception), and the best location in London. The interior decor is fabulous. The breakfast is good. The room a little big on the small side but very comfortable.",5,2022,10,31
123,Birthday Treat,"We stayed at The Marylebone for my wife’s birthday. Whilst it was not cheap for a hotel of this level of service so well located it is worth it. The staff were excellent, the hotel clean, well appointed and very quiet. We enjoyed our stay which was very relaxing. ",5,2022,10,30
123,Great hotel for both business and pleasure.,"Great location and staff that go over and above to make you feel welcome and relaxed. Superbly set just minutes from lots of lovely shops, bars and restaurants. All staff are friendly and helpful. Any questions or advice is swiftly answered. Feels like home from home. Will definitely be back very soon.",5,2022,10,29
123,The Long Room - perfect for a networking drinks reception and dinner,"We recently hosted a VIP dinner for our client in the Long Room at Marylebone Hotel and both myself and the client were very happy with how it went. We have since received feedback from our guests who also expressed their positive thoughts on the event.

The events team were clear with their communications and very efficient in the lead up to the event, and assisted us when we required a viewing of the space.

During the evening all of the staff were very attentive, efficient and ensured that the event went smoothly and our guests were happy. A special mention to Otto, Andrea and Carolina for all of their hard work as it didn't go unnoticed by the client.

The Long Room was perfect for our event and I would definitely have no hesitation to recommend the hotel for future events and also to our other colleagues and clients in our portfolio.

Thank you to everyone who helped with our event.

123,"Marvellous gem hotel in the hearth of Marylebone, London","High level of quality & attention to details.
Very comfortable room with design touches in the hearth of Marylebone area in London.
Breakfast is wow 🤜🤛
Access as hotel guest to the Third Space gym (with a large pool). 
",5,2022,10,22
123,Overpriced and Pretentious,"A comfortable stay but bathrooms are very small. More space provided in ""economy"" level chains at a significantly lower price.
Food and drink in the bar was average but again ridiculously overpriced. Yes it's in the West End but did not provide the value and quality expected of the rates charged.
If staying on business there are better, more spacious and better value for money than here.",2,2022,10,20
123,underwhelming,"The beds were sure comfortable.
The breakfast was good.
The independently run gym was excellent
The location was fantastic.
Yet the overall experience of 4 days at The Marylebone this past week failed to deliver. 
Not sure why, as several of the staff certainly appeared to be trying. 
Despite their efforts, something felt ‘off’ and they simply couldn’t come through.
Setting the negative in motion was our room assignment of 291. It was literally a broom closet, with low ceilings, and the bed pushed up against the bathroom door. 2 BY 2, and no space to swing a cat. Trying to change the room for something decent revealed chaos in operations and  felt like a major ordeal. The staff made some gestures towards helping but the issue was simply not addressed. Until Malachy Flynn stepped in. He did a great job in changing us to a decent size room( THANK YOU Malachy). To have someone go the extra mile, even if only on the second day, felt like a big deal, compared to the feigned efforts and lip service of those that didn’t understand what service is. The rest of the family in 290 had also complained about their room but Malachy was off for couple days and no one was available to take charge. Alister didn’t even bother. Alona at the front desk simply refused. 
So we settled for 1 nice room and 1 mediocre one. Imagine paying 600 pounds per room for something that was simply ok/inferior. ( If you’re assigned 291, , simply refuse)
Each time I was at the front desk , on either side of me other guests were complaining about issues, too many to mention.
For us too. Example: We returned 1 night and the restaurant was closed, the bar was closing and the bar manager assured us we could get room service 24/7, and after checking came back to apologize( with a look of disbelief on his face) that no room service Sunday/Monday. Of course the excuse given as Covid, and no staff- Sure I understand this, and am sympathetic to the challenges the T&L industry faces, as so many of us are facing too. BUT then DON’T charge 600 pounds for a broom closet with no room service available- give your customers a break as you get through this resettling time.( I can give several more examples but why bore you with similar details)
I would be concerned if I was the GM. Although, clearly he/she is unaware of what’s going on, or doesn’t really care. 
It was a treat to be in London again and watch 3 football games. I can’t wait to return. And staff like Malachy, Godwin, Laura, Dilitza and the excellent doorman John almost tempts one to consider giving the Marylebone another try on my next visit. That spirit of going over and above, exemplified by Malachy and others makes one believe what is possible if everyone is similarly aligned and committed to the right cause. But it’s a risk I wouldn’t gamble on; not just yet.
I so much wanted the Marylebone to deliver- I see its potential. I’m hopeful it will find its rhythm again. But there’s REAL work to be done.
Till then, stay anywhere, BUT the Marylebone. 
If you ignore this warning, you do so at your own costly peril",2,2022,10,17
123,This hotel is a real find!,"Perfect location in the heart of London. The suite we had was excellent value and 
quiet with a very comfortable bed. Top quality breakfast, and the staff were all very friendly and helpful. We will definitely be back. ",5,2022,10,17
123,Avoid room 537 at all cost,"The room is outdated, small, and very expensive. It was very poorly cleaned, which just left me with the feeling that I paid big bucks for a gross room. Even the wardrobe smelled bad! And no way to wash your hair with the old rain shower. Glad this was just a one night trip. 
",1,2022,10,12
123,Excellent stay,"The hotel is beautiful and located in the heart of one of my favorite neighborhoods in London. We stayed in a King Studio which was big and comfy. The beds are super comfy, albeit be aware that they only have connected beds. The service is above and beyond, the hotel is well managed and made us feel at home.",5,2022,10,10
123,The Best!,"Amazing! My favorite hotel  in the world, stayed there  many times and its always outstanding! The hotel is in  the perfect location, has excellent service, the bar and the outdoor cafe is lovely. Always smells delicious and the  decor at Christmas is exceptional.",5,2022,10,09
123,Felt let down,Stayed here for a wedding and was rather disappointed by the whole experience. The wedding itself was great but the room was small to say the least. Paid £360 for 1 night and thought it would marry up to other hotels near by but very disappointed with the whole stay.,2,2022,10,08
123,Great location,"Love staying here, good staff, beautifully comfortable bed, clean, spacious rooms and excellent food. It’s  a great location for a London stay, close to all I need. Everything about this place is efficient and friendly.",5,2022,10,07
123,Not a 5* experience,"Booked for business. Issue with checkin as they'd cancelled the wrong room and told my client she had no room which caused a lot of back and forth and multiple calls. An apology given but nothing offered to make up for the inconvenience to the client. 

Glass recycling bin was emptied outside the room at 5am. 
",3,2022,10,06
123,First Class Hotel,"My wife and I had an amazing 3 night stay at the Marylebone. The location is fantastic (love the Marylebone neighborhood!) , centrally located near all the sights of London, with lots of shops, restaurants and pubs nearby. The hotel, especially the room, was well-appointed, and the bar/restaurants were great. The gym/spa/pool area is as good as it gets in London.

But it's the staff that made our trip special. Everyone was so welcoming and accommodating. I have to give a special shoutout to Roxana at the front desk. From the moment we arrived until we checked out (and every day in between) she was there to help, ask if we needed anything, and see how our stay was going. She also went above and beyond when we had a problem after we checked out of the hotel.

All in all, we loved the Marylebone and will definitely stay again next time we're in London.",5,2022,10,04
123,Great stay,"Fantastic stay in a beautiful room with super friendly and attentive staff, all areas of hotel looked great and was super clean. Marvellous breakfast with such great staff in a beautiful setting that was really comfortable. Thoroughly recommend ",5,2022,10,04
123,Exceptional service made a night to remember,"I can't thank the staff of the Marylebone enough for making last Saturday night to remember. I was able to propose to my girlfriend in a private space painstakingly organised by the endlessly helpful Angela, who catered to my every need, selected the room and even went so far as to help me decorate it at short notice with the brilliant help of Vincent.

The personal touch added with the aid of Palwasha and Georgiana made it all the more special, ensuring the room was set up before hand, lighting candles and leading us to our ""table"" without letting my secret slip. They even went out of their way to serve us champagne and take photos for us after the fact.

Overall, it was a faultless evening in a special venue made perfect by a brilliant team of staff. Can't recommend it highly enough from my experience and will surely be back soon!",5,2022,10,03
123,Our London Home Away From Home,My wife and I stay regularly at the Marylebone Hotel and have done so since 2010. We are treated like returning family - with a smile and greeting. We like a particular room and they go out of their way to block it for us. Little extras like remembering we need extra hangers and towels always impress. We can store bags when we travel without any issues and any technical problems are sorted quickly and efficiently. It is located right next to the High Street which is full of eateries and shops. I can't recomend The Marylebone highly enough. ,5,2022,09,30
123,"One has to wonder if Ben England, yes, that's his REAL name, is for real","I've been a longtime fan of the Marylebone...of the perfectly orchestrated mechanics of running a flawless little gem-of-a-hotel in the middle of bustling London. There's a great energy coupled with a gentle relaxation factor. The restaurant and bar teams want to be sure you're at your happiest at all times. And there's nothing like having that nightcap in the colorful lounge by the fire...

But a new face has been on the scene post-pandemic (and during) and he's a delight. With a name like Ben England one has to wonder if he didn't choose it as a stage name (Big Ben meets the City itself) but he's as real as you might hope for. A good listener, a caring and often comical person who stays cool under pressure (I've seen it first hand) Ben keeps the lobby flow at a very Zen minimum.  

The Doyle Collection is very lucky to have this man who is as stylish as the hotel itself.  And then some. 

Looking forward to seeing him again.  And knowing my favorite boutique ""home"" is going to stay the same if not better, thanks to Ben.",5,2022,09,27
123,Fantastic Birthday treat at the Marylebone!,"What a great Birthday stay that my husband and I had at the hotel - which is situated right in the heart of the vibrant and very classy Marylebone district. From the moment we checked in, service by the Hotel's staff was exemplary - which made you feel very special! Our room was light, airy and contemporary that overlooked the buzzy village and 108 Brasserie. The room given was spotlessly clean with an exceptionally comfortable bed and pillow sets. The linen, towels, robes, and slippers were all of a high-quality standard and the free water in glass bottles showed a nice sustainability touch.   Dinner in the 108 restaurants (booking a must) did not disappoint.  We choose to eat outside that gave us a romantic setting by patio heaters and a great people watching position! A special thank you must go out to Nickie in 108 and Migel in the cocktail bar who gave my husband exceptional service and helped make the Birthday treat a very memorable occasion indeed – with Champagne and Chocolates! We will be back.",5,2022,09,26
123,Poor nights sleep,Good Location very small room with tiny bathroom. Fire alarm went off 5 time between 1am and 5am and reception would not answer telephone. On check out did not have to ask or  deal with situation even although every guest was complaining. Charged for breakfast that we didn’t have received credit for this.,3,2022,09,24
123,London Sept 2022,"What a find! right in the heart of London, but quiet location with fabulous restaurants and shops within easy walking distance. The staff were amazingly helpful, friendly and courteous. Perhaps upgrade from the classic room as it was slightly small but spotlessly cleans super comfy bed and pillows so all was great, and very eco friendly, with water in glass bottles everyday.",5,2022,09,22
123,Travel Diaries,"It was the first time at the hotel. The reception was too crowded, there were people not required that did distrub the checkin process. Pelvasha was really kind and humble, she suggested nice restaurants to eat and also sign me up for the memebership program that I was not aware off, was also offered the complimentry drinks in the bar. The room service was difficult to get to. Overall nice expeince. Nice room and easy access.",4,2022,09,17
123,Marylebone,"Staff was extremely warm, professional and clearly liked their jobs. The vibe in the lobby was great from the doorman/bell to the front desk and the bar. The location is fantastic. I highly recommend this hotel. ",5,2022,09,17
123,Exceptional Staff,"We chose this hotel because my wife required a second knee operation nearby, I unexpectedly required an emergency spine operation, again nearby, the following day. We both needed assistance and the staff at this hotel are excpetional in their understanding and kindness and I am confident would be to all guests. The bed was extremely comfortable, the bathroom a little small. The food very good but not cheap. Very pleased to have found this hotel and flying home met another couple who had also stayed here who needed medical procedures - we agreed this place is first class.",5,2022,09,13
123,Great central London Hotel,Modern design and comfortable rooms Inma great area of London - booked through secret escapes and got a nice discount too. Very friendly staff and good breakfast. Shame we didn’t have time to try out the bar which looked great ,5,2022,09,13
123,Best hotel and location in London!,"The Marylebone totally exceeded my expectations!  

Loved it from the moment I arrived, from the friendly professional staff at reception to my lovely spacious room, to the wonderful in-house restaurant (108), cocktail bar, Third Space club and gym, and finally the incredible location. 

I don’t think there’s a better located hotel in London, and I could easily have stayed another week, with everything in such close walking distance. It’s so safe, quiet and welcome - my new home away from home (or at least when I’m in London)!

All in all a fantastic experience, made all the more special due to the professional manner which this hotel is managed. 

Thank you The Marylebone. I shall see you again before too long!",5,2022,09,11
123,Fantastic Experience,"The Marylebone Hotel was fantastic all around. The rooms are comfortable, clean, and stylish. The staff were kind and very helpful. The location is safe, central, and walking distance from great places to eat. We had a beautiful room on the fifth floor that had a lovely view. Our original room was on the second floor that just faced a wall so it felt a bit dark and dreary, so we asked for a different room and they accommodated our request seamlessly.",5,2022,09,07
123,Very nice hotel and staff!,"Our 4 days stay in the Marylebone Hotel was great. From the very warm welcome (it was already midnight) to un upgraded room, delicous breakfast and excellent service (special thanks to David, Beata, Gentian and the barista).....everything perfect!
Not to forget the nice bar where we enjoyed very good pisco sours (special thanks to Julia, Nicole and Meenakshi ...for this lovely evening). We really liked the 108 Brasserie for lunch. 
We will definitely return to The Marylebone Hotel!",5,2022,08,31
123,Feels like home 😬,"Each time i come to London I stay at the marlyebone. It never disappoints! For years i stayed at a lager well known hotel in the same area - double the price and half the hospitality. 

The marylebone is that boutique hotel that makes your stay comfortable and unique. Everything is catered for, the staff are amazing and go out of their way to ensure your stay is nothing short of perfect. The bar, restaurant and facilities are always immaculate and the manager Roxana will go ourt of her way to ensure you have the most perfect stay. 

Could not be happier to be back, and will no doubt be back again very soon. Feels like coming home 😬",5,2022,08,31
123,Great hotel!,"The Marylebone hotel was a great stay. It’s a very nice and cosy hotel that felt like home. The service was great and all the staff were super friendly, especially Malaki who was super kind. The location of the hotel was also great (near the center) with many nice cafes and the food was also really nice. I really enjoy my stay.",5,2022,08,31
123,Fabulous hotel and staff,"Thank you for a fabulous stay. We were given an upgraded room which was lovely. The 108 Brasserie was fabulous with a fantastic selection of drinks and food. The hotel is situated in such a good area with lots of nice bars, restaurants, and shopping within a short stroll. The staff are amazing so friendly and helpful. A special thanks to Stan on the door and Palwasha on reception, along with a very helpful manager who assisted us with a change of room. The hotel also has a pool which was just fabulous. We’ll definitely return to The Marleybone Hotel.",5,2022,08,30
123,Always a Pleasant Stay!,Probably our tenth time at the Marylebone Hotel - it never disappoints. We've stayed in a few room categories and love the small suites but especially the Marylebone Suite with its outdoor patio = AMAZING!!!! The hotel is constantly upgrading and improving everything from the rooms to the public spaces. During this past stay the concierge (named Mandra) was beyond helpful with an airline issue - thank you for the extra care you took in helping us. Oh and I almost forgot to mention their signature candle scent is also nice - always a welcoming and familiar fragrance when I arrive!,5,2022,08,28
123,Exceeds all expectations,"From the doorman to the people at reception everyone bent over backwards to be accommodating .
The mattress was super be as were the down filled pillows. The room was very large and  airy with an intriguing view of life on the street. Wonderful !
Room service was flawless as was the delicious food they prepared for us .
The bar was cozy and we were served lovely drinks. The girls in the bar serving us were all so gracious and sweet. It was pleasure retiring there after a long day .
When I visit London next this is where I will be staying !",5,2022,08,28
123,Fabulous family long weekend,We stayed for 5 days at the Marylebone to experience a 5 star hotel in central London location. Ticked all the boxes from start to finish and proper 5 star experience. Very attentive and obliging staff and everything we needed or asked for was provided with no fuss. Excellent trip and we will be back,5,2022,08,23
123,Nothing but good things to say!,"We just returned from 7 nights here and have nothing but good things to say. The AC was a perfect chill and v appreciated given London was having a heat wave!! Our room didn’t have a view but it was incredibly quiet so we looked forward to retreating to our room late afternoon for some AC and peace. We regrettably only had breakfast on the last day at the hotel. Employees were courteous and friendly, like they all got the same memo and believed in it. Location was great. High street Marylebone and Bond/Oxford Circus shopping and tube stations close enough.",5,2022,08,22
123,Hit and miss,"Positive things first: Great Location, Quick check in, Brasserie Great. 
Not so Positive: Rooms small even with non basic, Staff efficient while not very friendly, Bar area not very welcoming, Bathrooms very small and not as clean as one would expect, shower had few dirty bits. Air con wasn't working would have reported it to reception but phone wasn't connected {First time ever in 100's of hotels I've stayed in}.
Overall i think this shows a little haphazard approach to staff training which certainly comes across in all aspects of the hotel.",3,2022,08,22
123,Exceptional visit,"We haven't had this level of service in a long time.  Malachy and his team were wonderful.  When you are made to feel that you're this welcome and the hotel is pleased to have you as their guests and show it at every opportunity, it's a great experience.  We're looking forward to returning.",5,2022,08,21
123,Excellent!,"Wonderful staff! Extremely friendly and attentive. Mandar was an excellent concierge and helped with all of our plans around London, taking the time to answer our questions and make sure we were happy. The location is also great for families as it is very close to many restaurants and shops without being noisy.",5,2022,08,21
123,Great location,"Is a very nice hotel in a great location .
the staff was most helpful .

123,Love this place!,"We just spent a few weeks in Europe and had to bookend with stops in London. During the first part we stayed at the Hard Rock Hotel - it was TERRIBLE! On the back end we stayed at the Marylebone - it was amazing! The staff across the board was outstanding. Particular shout out to ""Vincent the great"" - the best bell captain in London. The rooms were very comfortable, the bar is elegant, the breakfast and the breakfast room were very inviting and the location is excellent. The hotel is surrounded by great restaurants and boutique shops. There is no doubt we would stay here again if coming to London.",5,2022,08,15
123,Great trip,Really lovely stay at this hotel - great location lovely staff - particular shout out to Stan - the breakfast was so delicious and it was all seamless - a really good stay with all our needs taken care of - we really appreciate the attention - we will be back for sure,5,2022,08,15

Totally recommend.",5,2022,08,14
123,Excellent location near restaurants and shopping areas,"The hotel rooms are very comfortable and renovated with excellent location near restaurants and shopping areas such as oxford street and Marylebone high street. I recommend it for couples, families and who is alone. The hotel staff are very helpful and they will satisfy your requests.",5,2022,08,13
123,"Excellent staff, teeny room, expensive","The staff are very friendly and efficient, the hotel were flexible when I had to change my booking to escape the rail strike. The public areas are lovely, breakfast seating is squashed, the food is delicious though. Biggest issue is the teeny room and teeny bathroom, London hotel prices are ridiculous now.",3,2022,08,12
123,Best cocktail bar in London! Go here if you want an to enjoy some cocktails !,"Best cocktail bar in London.. actually.. England.. 10/10 drinks paired with 100/10 staff. What more could you want. Beautiful elegance and amazing music to drink to. Complimentary olives and nuts too ! 

Was welcomed by the really nice hostess who let us choose our seat. 
Served a number of delicious drinks custom made by the amazing bartender ( Miguel).

Sam was amazing too, he recommended us to a few nice spots for some more cocktails. Service was impeccable. 
 
Nicole was the sweetest girl too us, she served us some amazing martinis! 

Classic cocktails are amazing here but you should try their signature menu! 

Thank you to the amazing team for looking after us!",5,2022,08,10
123,STUNNING!,"I held a course here and I can't recommend enough. The room, the food and the staff all fantastic. Special thank you to Alessandra who helped management and execute the day for me and all the staff who went above and beyond for the delegates and myself.",5,2022,08,10
123,Disrepair,"The hotel is coming apart. Repairs are not forthwith. 1 of 2 main Elevators out for days. TV out- no repair. A/C broken- limped along. They agreed it was broken but non-fix during our stay.Standard room requires slim waist or you might best walk in side ways! Toilet stopped up. 

Service is quite good. The Brasserie in hotel excellent. The gym is not exclusive to guests. So street folks are using gym and can access floors. The rates are high relative to what you get. 

If you do stay there and choose to ignore what I  say,  then at least bring your own tool box and personal mini air conditioner.",1,2022,08,08
123,Sweet 16,"I had a surprise stay booked for my daughter, she didn’t want a big party, so I thought why not treat ourselves to a night away from home, with dinner and Theater. 
From the moment we arrived, we were made feel very welcome, greeted by Jojo at the door to the friendly smily Anastasia and the rest of the front of house team, everyone been very engaging. A big thank you to Alba who helped me in getting last minute tickets to Wicked , great seats and fab show, so to speak was wicked. 
To my surprise , we had been given this amazing upgrade to the terrace suite, my daughter (including myself)was speechless when opened the doors, to find a tower of cute little cakes, a bottle of bubbly, flowers , balloons and even a signed birthday card from the team - I did not expect that. The space- indoors and outdoors, with fireplaces, huge TVs, modern design, the decor, all these little touches, clean, fresh, the view just above and beyond. The reaction of hers and mine, priceless.  The king bed, you could get lost in there, with these crisp fresh soft linen, we slept like princesses, then to wake up to this gorgeous generous breakfast we had ordered to the room, which was set out in the terrace, in the sunshine and blue sky overlooking the city. We both had a everlasting memorable stay, thank you Marylebone for making sweet 16 even sweeter.",5,2022,08,08
123,great experience!,"My family and i really enjoyed our stay in this hotel. since the first day of our stay it was very comfortable and enjoyable the checkin was very simple and fast which was great. Even the location of the hotel was great near a lot parks and shopping malls, a very good location nearing most of London. and all the staff were so lovely during our checkin especially Roxana, thank you so much for everything during our stay! It was a great experience i would give it 6 stars if i could, definitely coming back!",5,2022,08,06
123,Great stay,"Brilliant location, great options for bars, restaurants and transport nearby. In walking distance to sights. The leisure centre, breakfast and housekeeping service were standouts of the hotel. A brilliant place to stay in during a visit to London.",5,2022,07,20
123,Holidays in London,"Excellent hotel, service, location and restaurant. All the staff very attentive with us and our kids. The location is amazing with very good restaurants walking distance from the hotel. Recommend for families.",5,2022,07,13
123,Outstanding,"Myself and my wife stsyed at the hotel on 30th June and 1st July..check in lovely polite and smooth as i had my own booking vua booking.com and another from a compsny doing an ed Sheeran package we should of had 2 different rooms but the receptionist kept us in the same with no problem when i asked even though hotel was fully booked..
Staff always polite and friendly nothing was an effort to them politeness was perfect the owners and management should be proud of all staff..
Pity we didnt have time to use facilities like pool etc.
Food was excellent also one of the best cup of teas weve ever had.
10 out of 10 to all staff thankyou for the lovely stay and politeness.
Mr &Mrs Thompson room 452",5,2022,07,03
123,Highly recommend,"Outstanding staff and a beautiful hotel. We would return. The room was spacious and clean, and the staff was attentive and friendly. Only wish we had stayed there sooner, especially because of its convenient location. ",5,2022,07,03
123,Great location and staff,"Stayed here for two nights on a short London trip. Location was ideal, staff were excellent and very accommodating. 

As an anchor point to travel around London it doesn't get better than this. 

Would definitely stay again when in London",5,2022,07,01
123,The Quintessential London boutique hotel.,"The Marylebone is a fantastic boutique hotel.  The service is genuine, warm and unpretentious. The hotel rooms are spacious for London standards and elegantly appointed.  General Manager Paul Walters has curated an experience that provides both a high price/value as well as a delightful stay continuously exceeding expectations.  Beverage service in the cosy
Lobby bar is on point - discrete yet attentive.  The menu selections, food presentation and quality in the Brasserie are world class and make for the perfect business or social meal.   Thanks again for a wonderful stay.",5,2022,06,28
123,"Fantastic service, immaculately clean, would highly recommend","We stayed at The Marylebone for 2 nights, from start to finish the service was amazing. Staff very attentive, helpful and friendly. 
Breakfast was very good and the staff were able to cater for my gluten intolerance. ",5,2022,06,28
123,Am,"We have just returned from a long weekend stay at this hotel. We had a great time. What makes this hotel stand out is the service from the staff, we have stayed in a number of other hotels in London but the service here is a different league. A big thank you to all for looking after us so well and making my daughters birthday so special. We will be back to celebrate my birthday in November.... looking forward to it already.",5,2022,06,28
123,Event space,"Attended a two week conference at the Marylebone. Georgio, Otto and the entire staff couldn't have been more helpful! From the daily room setup, abundant lunch/snack offerings, and even technology support - I could not recommend this place enough! They went above and beyond to ensure all guests felt at home.",5,2022,06,27
123,Only gets better,"A wonderful clean hotel ! Always ready to oblige with a smile! Rooms functional and clean breakfast excellent . 
Position of hotel is fantastic 
Thank you Antje, Russel and all at the hotel who made our stay so good ! Definitely ely am coming back like always!!",5,2022,06,27
123,Definitely not  5* property,"This is absolutely NOT a five star hotel. It's more like a 3 1/2 star place.

What's missing? The amenities are scant (only one bar of soap - WTH, limited towels, no turn down service), the rooms are beaten up, and the staff are pretty absent.  The breakfast is nothing special and simple requests for a coffee go missing.

The location is great and that's the only highlight of this property.  I would not stay here again and pay exorbitant prices for an average hotel.

If a manager responds with the usual ""come back again we will do better"" -- no thanks. I gave you my money and I did not receive the service and hospitality I was promised. Why would I trust you again and why don't you first refund me what I overpaid for?",3,2022,06,25
123,Pure bliss,"The hotel lived up to our expectations the staff were so friendly warm & professional cannot rate it highly enough, we have stayed in many 5 star hotels across the world & the Marylebone certainly is up there with the best",5,2022,06,23
123,"Lovely room, staff & perfect location","Had a great short-break at The Marylebone. Perfect location for those wanting to shop and sightsee in London. 

Room was clean & bed very comfortable. Staff throughout the hotel are helpful and friendly - big thank you to the lovely young lady at the front desk (Anastasiia I believe was her name). ",5,2022,06,22
123,Fantastic Stay!,"From the arrival through to the departure - a great stay! Fantastic welcome, scrumptious breakfast, delicious cocktails and heartfelt departure. Cleanliness on point. Good rooms and decor. Will be back soon. Thank you to all who assisted me during my visit to London.",5,2022,06,21
123,Very convenient,"A bit disappointing compared with the Clifton Ford, its predecessor . The breakfast buffet did not have any cover over it to prevent sneezes and covid landing on the open dishes. The scrambled egg was very good and the coffee very strong.",3,2022,06,19
123,Great location but room rate very flexible.,The rate of the room on the day of arrival was £200 cheaper than booking on line.  Was unable to contact hotel direct.  Unanswered phone plus assistant was unable to help with making reservation for me.  No spa available either,3,2022,06,18
123,Exceptional hotel under every point of view.,"Everything was perfect during my stay, from the moment I arrived to the moment I left. The exceptional customer care and service, the staff at reception, at the door and in the cocktail bar is absolutely amazing. The food in the brasserie and at breakfast was fantastic; the public spaces were decorated in a fantastic manner and the toilets were spotless. I have never experienced such a high level level in a hotel under every point of view. This is my hotel of choice in London and I wlll be coming back here every time I am in the city.",5,2022,06,13
123,"Satisfactory, no more. Dissapointing for a 5* Hotel.","Bedroom fine but bathroom so small it was difficult to use. 
Bar not available on a Friday night despite being resident in the hotel. 
Breakfast satisfactory. 
Nothing that would tempt one to make the Hotel a regular venue when in London. ",3,2022,06,13
123,Luxurious London getaway,"I’ve been fortunate to travel extensively for work and I must say The Marylebone is really a stand out. From the welcome by a doorman (who met me as I crossed the road with my bag!) to the stylish decor (every inch of the place!) I would really recommend this hotel to a discerning traveller. The bed was insanely comfortable and the bathroom was a marble temple (with Malin & Goetz toiletries - my favourite!) 
The area is also a very nice part of London and just the right distance from the tourist traps! I found the price very competitive to other 5 start with much more personalised service and vibe. Give it a try!",5,2022,06,11
123,"Great decor, staff made us feel so special!","Myself and my boyfriend spent a night here back in March. As soon as we arrived the doorman was friendly, helpful and accommodating, taking our bags as we went to explore before check in. When we were checking in the woman was so friendly and chatty (I think her name was Francesca), and would have given us any information we needed. We were concerned that we may feel unwelcome as two students in a five star hotel but they were all so welcoming, facilitated our request for a room with a bath and gave us a room upgrade. Inside there were treats to celebrate us finishing our exams! Great and thoughtful attention to detail.
The style of the whole place was funky yet sophisticated, I would have liked to have spent longer there. The rooms were great, with lovely toiletries and tea and coffee facilities. And lots of mirrors. The pool area was nice, though if you're private you may want to walk down in your normal clothes as you have to pass through the gym! The robe didn't bother me. Gorgeous changing rooms there too. Unfortunately we only got to try breakfast at the Marylebone but this was exquisite and plentiful and in a beautiful setting. I would recommend this hotel for a special and luxurious time without pretentiousness.",5,2022,06,11
123,2 night weekend stay at the Marylebone,I recently stayed at the Marylebone hotel in London with my girlfriend. We arrived early on Saturday morning and were accommodated to check in early which was a huge help. The hotel is very close to tube station so we went out for the day and upon return to the room we had received gifts from duty manager Malachy Flynn in our bedroom. 2 drinks and some nibbles to celebrate our stay in the Marylebone. Wonderful touch. All in all the hotel is unbelievable and oozes class. Cant wait to stay again.,5,2022,06,09
123,Very accommodating staff,"Was in attendance for the boohoo event and would love to give my appreciation to the wonderful melanie who was willing to fit around our needs and provided an outstanding service to my friends I. The food was delicious and she took the time to discuss the contents to those who had allergy’s/ intolerances. Was also a great laugh and great company for the evening! Great experience, thank you",5,2022,06,07
123,fantastic stay,"My favorite hotel in London. It is like home. The staff is excellent, very kind and always helpful. Rooms are very comfortable and we had a great set up with 2 adjacent rooms. Location is perfect to discover London. Special thanks to Malachy for all the small intention during our stay .",5,2022,06,07
123,PHENOMENAL PLACE,"Rooms awesome. Staff exceptional!!!
Special Kudos to Faruk and Stan (my niece says it was Stu....either way he was amazing).
I have stayed here 3 times over the last 15 years and I can't wait to return. Location is ideal for exploring many parts of London. The Marylebone Village is a nice slice of 'quaint' London.",5,2022,06,03
123,Convenient location. Closer to centre than you think,"Stayed during a trip to RHS Chelsea. Really nice hotel. Quiet location and helpful staff. But expensive for what was. Told we had been upgraded on arrival which was nice. But not sure how as room could not really have been smaller ! The queen bed was 2 singles pushed together. Maybe the upgrade was pushing the beds together!

I hadn’t specifically booked breakfast. Asked if it was included and told that they were doing complimentary breakfasts. Was excellent actually. We probably didn’t spend enough time in the hotel to do it justice. 
But was I thought really expensive at £400+ for just a room. Not stayed in London for 2 years. Seems to have got very expensive during Covid.",4,2022,06,01
123,"Very nice, but a bit of a mixed bag","This hotel is located in a lovely, and quiet, section of London in easy walking distance to lots of shopping.  The lobby is small, and well appointed.  The doormen, and people at the desk were excellent, as was Alba, the concierge.  A special shoutout to James, the very tall head doorman, who was friendly and kind.  The elevators come very quickly, which is a great perk for a small hotel, and the property is always very clean.  Our room, a double, was small, and not laid out as well as it could be.  There is very little space to hang clothes, and while the bathroom was very nice, the fact that you had to squeeze yourself into it in order to close the door to access the toilet behind the door leaves a bit to be desired.  The hotel restaurant was adequate for breakfast.  The biggest disappointment was the hotel bar, which is often strangely deserted, but that might have something to do with the service.  We went down one night to a very empty bar, and I asked for an Old Fashioned.  The bartender had no idea how to make it, and the confusion that ensued was off putting.  I finally had to insist on changing to a glass of wine.  A second night I went down to have a glass of wine before dinner.  There were some patrons, but again, not busy, and I got sat down on the outside part of the bar, immediately gave the host my order, and then sat there for 10 minutes without the glass of wine, and no server that visited this part of the bar.  I finally walked out, annoyed.  I told the desk, and while they offered to buy me a glass of wine, that wasn't feasible since my trip was coming to an end.  No other sort of compensation was mentioned, or reflected in the bill, which was unfortunate.  So, overall, a nice place, but perhaps overrated.  I think I'd find another hotel on my next trip.",4,2022,05,30
123,"Great, but no so great for disabled guests","Whilst I really enjoyed my stay, as a disabled person I was not able to enjoy the same service as non-disabled guests. My choice of buffet breakfast was limited as most of it was out of reach. It is misleading to state that the hotel is accessible for disabled guests when it clearly is not. ",4,2022,05,25
123,Perfect Location and excellent staff,"Close to restaurants, shops and transport but in a quiet street which makes it the perfect location. The staff go out of their way to assist and even found a charger we left behind a week after we checked out.",5,2022,05,24
123,Top marks for people and welcome,"Location of this hotel is perfect 2 mins from Marylebone High Street.
Floor 3 hotel upgraded us from a Queen deluxe to King. The view was a brick wall. The bathroom space was not functional; one person can step in jam yourself against a bath screen to close the door … it was like a game of jenga.  I only mention this because this is not inline with  a five star hotel.
Workman politely are redecorating currently in rooms across this floor which was very odd. The lifts to the spa are are currently not available because presumably because of the work; so you need to walk around the building to access this facility. 
The main rooms are decorated beautifully and the fragrance around the hotel is exquisite. 
The staff are lovely. They organised a plate of cakes and complementary bubbles as it was my birthday and I really appreciated that unexpected kindness.
So tops marks for people.",3,2022,05,23
123,First night away in three years,"My husband had booked a table in the cocktail bar .. we were on a tight time schedule so couldn’t find anywhere else at such short notice. The gas wasn’t working in the restaurant and so consequently our meals were awful.. chips too hard to eat and salads were disgusting.
Such a shame as we’d looked at the menu prior to eating . Maybe they could have mentioned the lack of cooking availability at check in.",1,2022,05,22
123,Beautiful Hotel,"This is a beautiful property and I'd love to stay here again. The public spaces were gorgeously decorated. Due to the nature of my plans, I stayed in two different London hotels during my visit and only wished I'd stayed longer at the Marlyebone to better experience some of the amenities. The staff were friendly and helpful, especially the doormen. The location is very convenient to a couple prime shopping districts and many great restaurants are nearby. ",5,2022,05,17
123,Excellent stay,"Perfect location: less than 5 min from Oxfort street but calm area, not noisy. All the staff was very kind and gentle: paid attention to each question I had and found solutions even when I asked for a later check-out. Very good sleep: quality bed furniture, clean room and good service. Breakfast was very good and served at the table which I really appreciated. Definitely a great address for a London stay! ",5,2022,05,16
123,5 star anniversary trip!,"I would totally recommend this hotel. We stayed for 1 night to celebrate our anniversary and the hotel made it very special. All the staff were so friendly, proper old fashioned service. We had a room upgrade which was a nice touch and couldn’t fault it. I particularly love the slippers in the room, so thick (unlike most hotels). The breakfast was extensive and we used the hotel bar too which was lovely. The location is very central yet the road itself is so quiet. The hotel was spotlessly clean throughout. Overall a fantastic hotel that ticks all the boxes yet manages to feel homely too.",5,2022,05,15
123,A very special hotel stay,My husband and I have just had a very enjoyable stay here at the Marylebone Hotel. We were greeted  warmly on arrival and received a suprise upgrade which was very welcome along with other nicities. All staff were very friendly and helpful especially Restaurant Manager Musa. Nothing was too much for the staff. We are looking forward to returning again and would highly recommend the hotel.,5,2022,05,15
123,"Stunning, stunning & stunning","From checking in last night throughout to departure the following morning my experience was 5* and faultless throughout, thankyou to all staff for your wonderful hospitality, a real delight in the beautiful neighbourhood of Marylebone. Highly recommended and can’t wait to come back again soon.",5,2022,05,10
123,Great Stay in Marylebone,"Great location for business or leisure. Close to Marylebone's great High Street and Regent Park for walks and exercise. Close to Central line for 20 min. commute to London Financial district. Also close to SOHO for night time entertainment.

Super clean and helpful staff. Good breakfast and cocktail bar onsite as well. Importantly - good individual room climate control. The rooms have A/C - crucial for hot days in London. Many hotels do not have good climate control or A/C. Beware if booking for summer travel. This was excellent.",5,2022,05,08
123,Outstanding,"A complex and stressful corporate event has been a huge success, due in no small part to the incredible service levels at the hotel.  Lia, George, Otto, Peter, Vinod, Stan, Ben and Malachi - many thanks for all your help in making a great success of our event!",5,2022,05,06
123,"Comfy, clean, and quiet","Convenient for Harley St medical procedures, staff were very welcoming and accommodating, room was truly spacious for wheelchair accessibility, housekeeping was excellent, bar and restaurant very good, comfortable variety of seating.

123,Mrs Stavrinou,"A massive thanks you to all the staff at the Marylebone Hotel. Great service while I recovered from minor surgery. Nothing was too much trouble. Nice hotel with a good room.

123,Excellent service,"Always love staying at the Marylebone, with the exceptional service, food, drinks and lovely rooms. The one person who stands out from the crowd and is a big reason we keep coming back to the Marylebone is Stan. He goes the extra mile to make sure we are well looked after and always greets us with a big smile and service out of the ordinary. He is a gem.",5,2022,04,04
123,Superb service and high quality surroundings.,"Our stay was complimentary, having been won in a Daily Telegraph competition and far exceeded all our expectations. In a delightful part of London (Marylebone) which is very much a well kept secret. Although a little way from public transport, it is easy to reach all the major sites and locations.",5,2022,04,04
123,Wow what a hotel!,"This has been our 2nd visit to this amazing hotel. It never fails to impress. Each and everyone of the staff are true credit to the company and service . Nothing is too much trouble and everyone is happy to help. Once you step in the main doors you feel like a star, quick check n, bags taken to your room, maids clean every day, greasy mile upon request, lots of choice of teas in your room.. the bed is glorious, you get the best night sleep. Breakfast is spectacular, the choice just blows your mind, hot service is take from the menu choice and fresh cooked to order. Sets  you up for the day. Our friends booked both rooms in there name. This ment we got to check out later.",5,2022,04,03
123,Best service EVER,"The service was the best we've ever had - huge accolade. Each and every staff member knew us and enhanced our experience. It had  the friendliest vibe, perfect for a boutique hotel experience.  There was really nothing that was too much trouble and our suite was truly spectacular, with fabulous furnishings.

It was a business trip and i recommend it.",5,2022,04,01
123,Engagement weekend,"Service is decent, room service and food is excellent. The room is really disappointing. For a 5 star hotel queen suite paying nearly £600 a night I'd expect one queen mattress rather than 2 pushed together single beds. Would not recommend, can get much better for the money you're spending ",2,2022,03,31
123,Excellence,"My husband and I stayed with you over the weekend. From the minute we arrived we felt really welcomed. The doorman and reception staff were wonderful. 
The room was spotless and although the bathroom a little small was perfect for our overnighter.
We decided to eat a late lunch at the Bistro and again had a wonderful experience. Great food and service. 
The bed was so comfortable and the following breakfast spot on. 
We felt throughout the stay that the staff really make this fantastic hotel. We thought the feeling was that they all enjoyed working there and this really shone. 
The interiors are beautiful!!
We cannot fault the Marylebone and will definitely return.",5,2022,03,29
123,"Amazing stay, great services!","I had a wonderful stay in this hotel, room was spacious, nice swimming pool and restaurant. Service was great, Stan was especially helpful during the whole duration of my stay!
I would definitely come back again!",5,2022,03,27
123,2/10,"Good: staff, location, sheets

Bad: No hot water in my room so a vacant room had to be found for me. I was going for surgery and if I hadn’t been up much earlier that I’d intended to be this would have been stressful. I felt this should have been reflected in my bill and if I wasn’t having the surgery that day I would have raised this. 

The tea and coffee provision in the room was incredibly basic and actually a bit embarrassing - for £300 I would have expected much nicer. It was what you’d expect in a hotel a third of the price. Finally I had noted I was having surgery and feeling nervous and whilst I’m sure that’s a very regular occurrence at this hotel on account of its location, it would have been nice for the hotel to acknowledge this and ask if I had any additional requirements/wish me luck on arrival. 

All in all, if you don’t need to be in that exact location I would recommend much nicer hotels for the same price or head to a holiday inn and enjoy saving £100-£200 ",2,2022,03,25
123,Amazing Stay,"Headed from Dublin for the weekend and stayed in the Marleybone. It was just perfect, ideal location only a short stroll to the shops and restaurant. Staff on checkin were very friendly we got upgraded so was a lovely surprise. Our room was very spacious and spotless. Breakfast on each morning was delicious, a lot of fresh choices and beautiful hot choices. 
On Saturday we went to cocktail bar before dinner, was busy but hostess was excellent. 
I would highly recommend hotel for excellent location, wonderful rooms,  warm and friendly staff.",5,2022,03,22
123,A must stay in London!!!,Myself and my partner eloped to London and we picked the Marylebone Hotel to stay for our trip. I can honestly say we were blown away by the hotel and its staff. Exceptional hotel in everyway. If you are looking for something that extra special this is the hotel for you,5,2022,03,22
123,Couldn’t fault it - amazing staff and location 5*,"Amazing stay at the fabulous Marylebone. Very friendly staff and a nice welcome to the hotel. Checkin was very efficient. Was lucky enough to be upgraded to a King room. The room and bathroom were spotlessly clean and very well appointed. Everything you’d expect from a 5* establishment. The bed and bedding were so comfortable and ensured a great nights sleep. Breakfast each morning was so delicious. Everything was fresh and and top quality. The waiting team on both mornings were very friendly and we left needing nothing. Coffee was great too! We had a quick pre dinner drink in the cocktail bar. Again the staff were amazing. The hostess on Saturday night was just fabulous. Wines were good and reasonably priced, the cocktails looked great too. Staff looked a little under pressure for a busy Saturday night with lots of discerning guests, but they were all excellent! I would advise reserving a table in advance as it seems to be a popular spot. Would highly recommend the Marylebone for all types of traveller, situated in a lovely upmarket area of london with everything you need on your doorstep. Thank you team Marylebone for an excellent stay!!",5,2022,03,20
123,Overpriced not 5 star,"Not a 5 star hotel by any stretch of the imagination. Common areas may be luxurious but rooms do not follow suit. Thread bare carpets, tired bathrooms, yellow over used towels, no mini bar, cheap furniture. Very disappointing for the room rate and apparent star rating.",3,2022,03,17
123,Perfect stay,"Great stay from start to finish. Seamless check- in, lovely room. Bed was like a cloud. Food was delicious. Unbeatable location in Marylebone and Regents Park makes for a lovely morning run. Staff was friendly, efficient, communicative. Nothing was too much trouble, especially Stan, who patiently welcomed commiserating over London’s delicious pastry offerings. I have officially found my new home in London!",5,2022,03,16
123,A wonderful treat,We had a wonderful treat in London for my husband’s birthday. The hotel welcomed us in a friendly efficient way. We enjoyed the pool and steam rooms. The bed was so comfortable. A lovely weekend in a great part of London. ,5,2022,03,14
123,Lovely Hotel,"The hotel is lovely. Cosy armchairs and sofas in a lot of corners. The best location. A few minutes walk  from the tube. A lot of restaurants, cafes nearby. The rooms are comfortable and the staff is excellent ",5,2022,03,07
123,Clockwork,"Was happy to return to the Marylebone. Have stayed there on occasion over the years. Looks like the Covid hiatus did them well. All the positive basics remained (location, breakfast, descent rooms, sensible prices - by London terms).  However, it seems like something has changed in attitude - service was exceptionaly attentive and the team was making an effort to assist. Well done. ",5,2022,03,04
123,Rosie,A great hotel in an excellent central location with comfortable rooms and delightful staff. At check in the staff were very helpful in organising our rooms as we were a party in four rooms. We had drinks in the very comfortable bar pre diner and the bar staff were knowledgable in advising on drinks. The rooms were clean and beds very comfortable and our deluxe suite large with a decent sized bed and large bathroom and a spacious living room.,5,2022,03,03
123,Excellent staff,"We stayed on a Sunday for one night. All interactions with the staff were great and nothing was too much trouble. 

I had a bit of a grumble about our room as it faced about a dozen noisy a/c units and we were upgraded to different room which was a bonus. 

The room we stayed in must have had the bathroom grouting recently painted black as the towels on the floor got terrible black stains on them. That was the only downside hence the 4 star review instead of 5 stars. If we had our clothes stained then I would have been very unhappy but as it was we enjoyed our brief stay and the breakfast was a real highlight.",4,2022,02,22
123,"Great location, would return!","Myself and my partner stayed for 2 x nights in a Deluxe Suite- the room was really clean and had all the amenities we needed including a coffee pod machine, iron, hairdryer and Malin+Goetz toiletries. Bed was really comfortable!

Hotel has a real 5 star feel to it and the staff were all so friendly and helpful! Oxford street was a 5/10 min walk for shopping! & Oxford Circus and Bond Street underground 10/15 min walk so really accessible to get to on train or around London whilst staying.

Breakfast options were great- really fresh and huge portions.

Would stay again without a doubt",5,2022,02,12
123,Amazing hotel,Myself and my girlfriend stayed in the Marlybone for two nights last December. The hotel was amazing and the staff were so helpful and friendly. Malachy checked us in and was very helpful. The service is second to none. Will definitely be back.,5,2022,02,12

123,10/10,"My partner and I thoroughly enjoyed our recent stay at the Marylebone hotel. From the minute we landed at the hotel everyone was a pleasure to deal with.

Special shout out to Malachy who was so welcoming and helpful with any questions we had. It was really nice arriving to the room to be greeted with drinks, fruit, a handwritten note etc. for my partners birthday. 

Small things like this really help the hotel live up to its 5 star reputation. 

The room was beautiful and the breakfast was top class. Would definitely recommend.",5,2022,02,08
123,wonderful staff,"love the art deco decor of this place, and all the staff are just lovely and helpful.  My room was immaculate.  cocktail bar has a great atmosphere and the table service breakfast was fabulous, beautifully cooked and a good menu.",5,2022,02,02
123,Beautiful hotel + incredible service,"Luxury all the way. Lovely rooms, restaurant and amazing service. Thoughtful welcome details, great turn down service and pristine cleanliness.

123,Great weekend away,"The team catered for our need, very friendly staff in all areas of the hotel.
Tatiana looked after our daughters by providing gifts and teddy’s in the room and Stan was always greeting us with a warm welcome and a smile. Great atmosphere and fab location.",5,2022,01,23
123,Wow wow wow wow wow,"Arrived at this absolutely stunning hotel with my beautiful daughter Sophia for my 50th birthday, was greeted by Alex the concierge, we was also greeted by Irish man who gave us a free birthday breakfast, was so overwhelmed with his kind generosity, all the decor throughout this beautiful hotel was so beautiful, everything was absolutely spotless, hats off to all staff who had great customer service and was so kind to us, we had a great nights sleep in such beautiful crisp linen and our room was outstanding, OMG the breakfast was amazing and all team was amazing,we then went for a swim and sauna and I couldn’t believe how you had everything that was needed in your changing rooms, attention to detail was spot on and I will definitely be returning, Thankyou so much to each and everyone of you xxx",5,2022,01,22
123,Amazing! ,"It as been a great experience, we enjoyed every single moment

We will surely come back again! ",5,2022,01,03

",5,2021,12,27
123,A hip gem,"We came to London for our daughter’s graduation and decided to stay at the Marylebone to be close to our daughter apartment. It did not disappoint! It is a neighborhood gem, very stylish and on top of it a very professionally run hotel. We loved everything from the decor to the attentiveness of the staff to the perfect location close to shopping, dining and sightseeing. Only thing is: it is pricey, especially if you are not using all the amenities. Other than that, I would def recommend it!!",5,2021,12,22
123,5 star service,Had a fabulous stay my with my fiancé last weekend. We stayed on the 7th floor in the most amazing room. Tom from front desk was amazing and looked after us so well. Would definitely be back and definitely recommend for anyone wanting 5 star service!,5,2021,12,17
123,Wonderful Welcome and Stay,"Had an amazing stay here recently, just a quality feel, pictures and website does not do it justice! The team here go out of their way to welcome you and check on you without being over bearing. This is how hotels should be like, it has character and clearly lives by the motto, people buy people.",5,2021,12,13
123,Great service from front desk,"First time staying here, service at check in and throughout our stay (4th/5th Dec 21) was excellent, very attentive from both the day and night front desk teams. Health spa seems to be going through a makeover so it was like a building site and unstaffed which seemed strange as it was open",5,2021,12,10
123,First Trip Back Since Covid,"Still one of the best hotels to stay at within the area.
Excellent location, next to Oxford Street , Bond Street, and Regent Street as well as the  Subway.
While some changes were made due to COVID and staff shortages, still had an excellent experience.
Highly Recommend this hotel as well as the neighbourhood.
",4,2021,12,06
123,Excellent Stay - very relaxing,"This hotel is my favourite in central London. It is in a fabulous location - it is quiet yet in the heart of things. The hotel itself is a 5* but is not at all stuffy. The room decor was excellent, very comfy bed, and great sound proofing. Bathroom was lovely. However, it is premium pricing, but you get what you pay for.",5,2021,12,04
123,"Great place to stay, staff very attentive.",Just finished a short weekend break and would recommend The Marylebone with its excellent location and delicious fresh breakfasts.  Staff were superb both early morning and late at night when we returned.,5,2021,12,02
123,Great location and friendly staff,Just had another amazing visit to this hotel. Once again we had a very friendly welcome by Angie on reception. She couldn’t have been more helpful and found us a room before the check in time. We were very grateful. The beds are so comfortable and the hotel is situated in a great location.,5,2021,11,30
123,The perfect London hotel,"This was my first stay at The Marylebone Hotel and it's the perfect hotel for a short leisure break in the capital. The location can't be beaten, just off Marylebone High Street with its host of charming independent stores, cafes and restaurants, yet a couple of minutes walk to Oxford Street and to Mayfair and Soho beyond. From the moment we checked in the staff were super friendly with efficient and genuine service. Our room was spacious, recently renovated, comfortable with all the expected facilities. Although we did not use, there is a spa and pool too. The bars and restaurant very stylish with an interesting cocktail list and a tasty selection of menu items for lunch and dinner. I would highly recommend a stay, a well run and perfectly located hotel.",5,2021,11,30
123,Amazing boutique hotel,"We loved our stay at the Marylebone Hotel. The customer service was phenomenal, the rooms were clean and well-appointed and surprisingly big by London standards. They even surprised us on Thanksgiving by having pumpkin pie delivered to our rooms, which was such a thoughtful touch. I would DEFINITELY stay there again, the neighborhood is also incredibly charming and close to Tube stations.  ",5,2021,11,29
123,Business Trip,"Lovely hotel, the staff were all very professional and friendly. My room was very pleasant, and spotlessly clean. I had room service and the food was amazing - I would definitely recommend the cauliflower grating - compliments to the chef!!",5,2021,11,28
123,Design Launch Event @ The Marylebone,"We chose The Marylebone hotel primarily due to it's central location, but also the interior design aesthetics of the public and function spaces, which has a variety of options so suit all budgets, requirements, tastes.

For our event, launching via live webinar to design clients, retailers and manufactures across Scandinavia, we were looking for an intimate function space that had a unique design aesthetic with contemporary, curated furnishings and interiors.

As our event was all about design & forecasting, we found the prefect location in the Courtyard & Library rooms in which to showcase our works and ideas in a cool and tasteful setting.

The service, functionality and tech support was equally good.

I can't recommend this hotel and it's facilities highly enough.

123,Not the best experience...,"Generally a poor experience - very underwhelmed. Poor room, too hot, bar and restaurants closed, and shabby and very expensive! Staff look frazzled and not really engaged. Great location though. Would not visit again.",2,2021,11,25
123,Fantastic hotel,"We had a fantastic stay at the Marylebone Hotel in London. It is a beautiful hotel with a great location. The hotel is very atmospheric and the rooms are nice and clean. We enjoyed all our morning breakfasts at the hotel, where the food was great and the surroundings beautiful. The staff was also so nice and friendly. They made is feel welcome and were happy to help with all our questions and needs. We had the pleasure of Stan handling our luggage both at arrival and check-out. He handled our luggage with care and also stored it for us, as we had a couple of hours between check-out and our flight. He was such a nice guy and gave us tips from personal experience, on how to reach the airport the easiest way. All in all we would love to stay at the Marylebone Hotel another time.",5,2021,11,23
123,Super comfy hotel in great location!,"Beautiful room on 7th floor. Cool, stylish, recently refurbished. Super comfortable, spacious and well thought out.  Excellent service, very friendly team and a lovely welcome and farewell. I will happily return. Love the location with great restaurants and local shops are a delight.",5,2021,11,23
123,Fabulous Hotel amazing service,"The service at the hotel is personal, friendly and attentive. The decor is beautifully done and luxurious and it couldn’t be in a more perfect location just away from the shops on Oxford street but in the beautiful Marylebone area. The bar 108 staff were very friendly and professional.",5,2021,11,21
123,Outstanding,"An exceptional venue to host a business event.  Service, food and support were all exactly as requested.  Our event was complex, requiring accommodation, meeting room spaces, break-out areas, catering and various other support element.  All excellent.",5,2021,11,19
123,PlayStation Events,"the whole team at The Marylebone were excellent and so friendly. Cristina Giudice who is the Meeting & Events Sales Executive was brilliant with helping us with one of our events, the whole event was seamless. 

Thank you 

Sam",5,2021,11,17
123,Great location,"Check in was a slow process not helped by the guy checking us in taking a phone call at the same time.  The bedroom was clean but for a 5 star hotel too small, a 4ft 6in bed is not big enough.  However the room was well furnished and all team members we interacted with were friendly and helpful.  Breakfast was excellent with a nice atmosphere in the restaurant.

I was surprised when checking out that yet again the receptionist took a call whilst managing our booking .  The first and last impressions of the hotel were not great.",4,2021,11,14
123,"Monica, Dublin.",This hotel is in an excellent location for sight seeing or shopping. The hotel's staff were warm and friendly and always ready to help. Very pleasant and professional. Rooms spotlessly clean and beds very comfortable. We had a wonderful stay. Would definitely return.,5,2021,11,12
123,Not as good as it used to be but the staff we’re trying hard.,"I have stayed many times but the firstly time post lockdown.
Check in was fine, it was the smallest room I have been given at this hotel.
Getting the pool open was difficult even though was supposed to be accessible at 6.30 am.
There seem S to be some alliterations going on and parts of the property out of bounds.
Breakfast was a little haphazard but maybe it’s because of new staff bedding in, but you could tell they were trying. For the price would really expect service to be back to its previous level.",4,2021,11,10
123,Not as Expected,"Lots of attention to detail require, no atmosphere upon arrival, cocktail bar looked very empty and uninviting especially on the Monday we arrived. Besides the location being ideal for the purpose of our visit we were not really impressed.",2,2021,11,04
123,Superb ambiance and service,"Staff at the hotel were excellent. Communication between teams meant that any requests were followed up flawlessly. The bar service was impeccable and food amazing. Every need was met and exceeded with style. 
",5,2021,10,27
123,A pleasure to stay at,"My sister and I have enjoyed two recent stays at the hotel, and were suitably impressed on both occasions. We booked the first stay as a treat to ourselves and it was a really great experience. We know London well as residents, but rarely stay over in the city, but The Marylebone was an excellent choice.

The bar is also a highlight with some delicious cocktails and fantastic service. Very attentive staff and the refreshed rooms are both stylish and practical. We look forward to staying again soon - special thanks to Assistant Guest Relations Manager, Malachy for his great assistance too!",5,2021,10,26
123,Excellent,"Extraordinary front desk and management staff in a beautiful hotel centrally located. Highly highly recommend. 
Tell Tom and Fransesca that Kim and Doris sent you. Not either old fashioned and stuffy or overly trendy. It is well appointed, light, clean and beautiful. But their strength is in the extraordinary staff who is there and friendly with your every question and request. ",5,2021,10,26
123,Perfect hotel for intimate and cozy wedding,"We would like to extend a big thank you to Bianca from Events team for creating our memorable wedding. Your help in organizing and assisting with our queries throughout the process was seamless.
 
A big compliments to the chefs on the outstanding quality of the food. We received numerous compliments for our wedding as a whole.
 
Thank you George and the rest of the banqueting team for smooth and faultless service.
 
Last but not least, the Marylebone hotel is such a beautiful hotel and perfect for hosting weddings in the blue room and courtyard. We would highly recommend to our friends and family who wish to host any celebration in the future.

From stephanie & Mark",5,2021,10,17
123,Very disappointing!!!,"The hotel failed to deliver on a 4/5 star level and is not worth the price. My check-in experience was positive, but it went downhill from there. I was given an upgraded room that was very narrow and adjacent to the elevator shaft, which I heard all night long. At breakfast, there was confusion with the staff and management about the dollar value that we were entitled to towards our breakfast. We also witnessed two servers arguing about who was responsible for not bringing my colleague her cafe order. The property has no concierge and struggled to get assistance to arrange for a proper lunch recommendation. At this point, we decided to cut our losses and check out after our first night of a four-night trip!",1,2021,10,16
123,Amazing stay,This hotel is in an fantastic central london location in the heart of Marylebone. The hotel is warm and welcoming with extremely helpful and caring staff who look after you like a part of the family. The internal decor of the hotel is elegant and luxurious and has a homely feel throughout. Overall a fantastic hotel that I would highly recommend ,5,2021,10,15
123,Staycation,I have recently stayed at the Marylebone after a night out in town as I didn’t want to rush for the train head back to the suburbs. The hotel is located in the heart of Marylebone easily accessible to soho and west end. If you are town for a shopping trip also a great spot to be in as all the shops are within walking distance. The only feedback would be to have a proper full English vegetarian breakfast option available.,5,2021,10,10
123,Excellent home in London,"The Marylebone is an extremely nice hotel. Warm hospitality and genuine efficient service and attitude.
Excellent location, 5 minutes walk from Bond street tube, but quiet in country town Marylebone feeling.
Very comfortable and cosy rooms. Excellent breakfast, and characterful public areas. Definitely to recommend",5,2021,10,05
123,"Great location, homely atmosphere and service",We spent three nights at The Marylebone while attending a conference in London and were very impressed with friendly service and cosy decor of the hotel. Great location for easy access to the tube and good selection of eateries nearby if you get the chance. Our only regret was not having time to visit the pool and spa but that gives us an ideal exceuse to return for non-business stay.,5,2021,09,30
123,Service goes above & beyond!,"I stayed here for almost a week as was having surgery at a nearby hospital and was required to isolate both before and after my operation.

Leading up to my reservation I contacted reservations and they were absolutely fantastic, reassured me that everything would be arranged for me to ensure I didn’t come into contact with anyone. My son then travelled down on the day of my surgery so that he could help me afterwards and they even upgraded his room to ensure he was in an adjoining room and could come and go with his own key. It was such a thoughtful gesture of the hotel, I really appreciated this!

On arrival I could not have been more impressed - despite arriving early, they had already ensured my room was ready, I then had a visit from the housekeeping manager who checked to see what housekeeping I might need in isolation and said to call her at any time if I needed anything. She then came back with a gorgeous bouquet of flowers in a vase and then sent up some nuts and olives. So kind! 

Room service was absolutely wonderful, delivering breakfast, lunch and dinner to my room each day and the food was delicious! 

I’m pleased to say that the hotel really did go above and beyond for me and I was able to relax before and after my surgery. I would highly recommend staying here for anyone having surgery nearby or having to isolate for any reason.

As I like to give a balanced review - The only slight inconvenience was on the day I came back from my surgery as a lady from housekeeping knocked on my door at 6 different times asking to clean and telling me to leave the room and my son had to tell her each time that I couldn’t get out of bed as had just had an operation and that I was also still isolating until Monday. I had also said ‘no thank you’ on each occasion so it did become rather frustrating.  The only other negative I can give is that the walls do appear to be thin. I stayed in a lovely luxury suite but on one of the nights I could hear every word of someone’s TV blaring through the floor or the wall and my suite overlooked a pub which got quite noisy at times. Quite bizarre as you can’t usually hear anything through the walls in London hotels. 

Those points were very minor though in contrast to the rest of the absolutely wonderful experience and fantastic, friendly and helpful service I experienced so they don’t warrant me knocking a star off!

Thank you to all the staff for making something that could have been exceptionally stressful, so relaxing and easy! Will definitely return!",5,2021,09,27
123,Understated Luxury in Fantastic Location,"From front of house, through the social areas, bars and restaurants,to the service staff,  the staff were excellent. Helpful friendly and relaxed.

The Marylebone hotel has an excellent location being handy for all the attractions of the West End and in particular shopping.
We look forward to a return visit.",5,2021,09,24
123,wonderful staff,"the room was fairly ordinary, but the staff everywhere were so kind and courteous.  the Brasserie made for lovely inside breakfast and outside afternoon cuppa and evening meal.

Its evident the entire team work extremely hard to keep up these amazing standards.

123,Perfect intimate wedding breakfast,"We hosted our wedding reception and breakfast in the Blue Room and it was perfect. We were actually upgraded to this room the day before the wedding as it was not in use which was a lovely surprise. 

We had welcome drinks and a meal for 20 people with a handful of evening guests joining later for canapés. Bianca and Otto made sure everything went to plan, kept our drinks topped up and kept us informed of the bar tab which was really helpful too. Nothing was too much trouble. The decor of the table surpassed our expectations entirely, given it was included in the price it really did look great. 

Thank you to a great team!",5,2021,09,19

Above all though, the staff were without exception fantastic -super helpful, friendly and focussed on the needs of their guests. Especially notable was Gunther who took extremely good care of us, including rescuing a lost and much loved Teddy bear for our eldest daughter! You really saved the day there Gunther :) We'll definitely be back!",5,2021,09,08

123,A truly hospitable experience.,"I am currently here having undergone a surgical treatment at nearby Harley Street. This is my 9th day and I feel compelled write how fantastically well I’ve been treated by Gunter specifically and his incredible team. 

From the time of booking my stay a month or so ago requesting a room which I would be happy with (and it’s beautiful) and every single day of my stay, it truly has been utterly incredible. 

I’ve felt safe, understood and spoilt all at the same time. Staying alone especially after a surgical procedure is daunting, however I’ve honestly never felt isolated because the staff are so helpful and warm, my every need has been taken care of by every single member of staff from the door man to the house maids. Reception/front of house staff are keen to help always. 

I travel to London regularly, this is my new go-to hotel and I’ll be sure to tell everyone to experience the magic for themselves. 

Thank you Gunter for your precise attention to detail and care and top class service during my stay. 

I will be back very soon.

123,A perfect short stay in London,"We returned to The Marylebone Hotel after a few years for a weekend in mid July. The hotel was as good as ever (not to mention new elements; all tastefully completed since our last visit, notably in the foyer, adjoining bar and dining area)...Our stay was greatly added to by the welcome and helpfulness of the staff. The hotel is in a terrific location near Marylebone High Street with its restaurants and retail outlets, including the great Daunt Bookshop.  Particularly impressive was the cleanliness of our room and effective implementation of Covid protocols throughout the hotel.",5,2021,08,27
123,Nice but not amazing,"We always enjoy visiting London and try to stay in different places each time.  The Marlborough is very handy for Harley Street and the nearby shopping is right up my alley so it had been on my radar for a while. 
We enjoyed our stay.  Staff were delightful.  Room (junior suite) was smallish but it is London and newly renovated so more than fine. 
But did it have the X Factor?   Well no not really.  Just a pretty nice offering with no bells or whistles.  
I might still have given it five stars but the breakfast service in the cocktail bar area (a temporary arrangement while renovations are going on) was very hit and miss so I couldn’t bring myself to.
However great location, nice hotel and good people so no problem in recommending.",4,2021,08,25

A huge mention to the bar staff at the The Cocktail bar, Malik, Davide and Greg!! They are very well versed in cocktail making and their cocktails were truly incredible!

We were personally shown around the hotel by Benjamin and he was very informative and accommodating to our needs pre and post surgery (extra pillows, ice etc).  I couldn’t have wished for a better experience, and would not hesitate in recommending this hotel to anyone. 

Where do I even begin with the beds!… so, so comfy, I’m even considering changing our mattress and pillows now after staying at the Marylebone! 

The location is amazing, just perfect for being so close to the centre but far out enough to be nice and quiet. 

My father also stayed in this hotel following my surgery and he was absolutely thrilled with the location and the amazing service from the staff. Since our visit we have already spoken about returning to the Marylebone for our next London visit, and we will be using this hotel for all our visits from now on. 

Thank you so much to all the wonderful staff at the Marylebone hotel. I’m blown away by the outstanding service and will absolutely be returning! (My father also!).

",5,2021,08,09
123,The perfect venue for a conference or course,"We held a course in The Palm room over the weekend. 
The venue couldn't have been better, we were so well looked after and catered for. We had looked around for a venue that didn't have that cold corporate feel but more of a chilled, sophisticated vibe and we certainly got just that. All of the delegates agreed the food was the best of any course they'd been to. We would like to thank Gergo and his team in particular for their brilliant service and attention to detail over the two days and Cristina for helping us with numerous admin requests etc. 
10/10.",5,2021,08,09

They went above and beyond every step of the way. Particular mentions to the Irish gentleman at reception, the lovely gentleman with a beard at the cocktail bar and both door men that I came into contact with. I didn’t catch their names but they definitely deserve a special mention. After such a difficult time for the hospitality industry, it is lovely to see people with such a drive and passion for such an important industry.

123,A five star experience visiting the bar.,"My wife and I had a lovey time visiting the bar at the hotel.  The bar manager Greg was extremely helpful in giving us some advice on various cocktails and recommendations.  He has compiled an extremely good and interesting collection to choose from which are predominantly his own unique conceptions.
You can tell Greg is very passionate about his cocktails and infusions and hearing him talk about them made the visit just so much more special and memorable.  The credit goes beyond just his efforts to make our visit pleasurable as all of the staff there were polite, friendly and attentive.
The hotel bar is extremely well laid out and decorated.  It really felt like a quiet oasis where we could retreat and rest after a busy day exploring the nearby area.",5,2021,07,30

As newlyweds, our booked room was upgraded and two glasses of champagne were delivered to our room. Rooms have recently been refurbished; they look stunning, with comfy beds and Malin and Goetz products.

123,Splendid Hotel,"A splendid hotel ticking every box for the frequent traveller.
We would highly recommend this hotel on every level.
Excellent communication from staff in the run up to our stay dealt with all the issues that were important to me. It’s essential that hotel staff quickly pick up on what the guest priorities are and this is a particular strong point here. 
Complete flexibility and an eagerness to please are evident from the get go and throughout our stay. Nothing is too much for them and no request was left unfulfilled. Extraordinary service. 
A particular mention goes to Gunter and Stan front of house and to Tatiana who patiently made everything possible.
There’s a lovely Brasserie which although quite understated would compete with the best and has one of those menus where you could eat just about anything ..
For me, the refreshing lack of coronafuss on the brink of the ending of legal restrictions made the atmosphere particularly enjoyable. 
Well done and thanks to everyone concerned!",5,2021,07,18
123,Back after the lock down,"Stayed for one night after a gap of eighteen months, great welcome, staff still very helpful, room very comfortable.

Its in a perfect location not too busy but accessible to all the site and best places to eat and drink. I know its been a challenging year but the staff in the hotel were just fantastic! Nothing seems to be a problem always helpful and friendly. The moment I entered the hotel I knew it was going to be a friendly and welcoming place to stay. Alisdair at the reception was extremely welcoming and helpful! I was in the hotel for a meeting and we had hired a board room Otto was looking after us. Otto was professional all day making sure we had everything we needed and nothing was too much for Otto what a lovely human being!!

123,Overnight stay for wedding anniversary,"One night stay for wedding anniversary. Super staff and service as usual even with well observed covid restrictions. Felt safe throughout and still had an excellent stay there. Good to see Gunther and Lia again. Alasdair was also very helpful. 

No breakfast buffet due to covid, but the table service was excellent and don't think we missed out of any calories of the top notch breakfast. Was also able to use the adjacent third space gym. The hotel is handling the necessary restrictions very well without impinging on the usual excellent ambience and service.",5,2021,07,05

Gunther is extremely professional, knowledgeable and attentive - upgraded us to a nice Junior Suite, showed us around, booked a restaurant for us for dinner at 2 Veneti, which we loved! As it was our anniversary he organised bottle of prosecco with a lovely welcome card on arrival at our room. Nothing is too much trouble for Gunther! You can tell he loves what he does with passion.

Thank you Gunther Schildwachter (Guest Relationship Manager) and all the rest of the staff for an amazing stay.",5,2021,07,03
123,A Marylebone Marvel!,"The Marylebone is a cracking hotel, beautifully appointed, superb food and all supported by attentive and highly professional management and staff. The fantastic location is set among chic boutiques and atmospheric restaurants (note: try the amazing “Caldesi” for fab seasonal Italian fare). The hotel is walking distance to everything and yet you don’t have buses/underground rumbling around you which is a great added extra! We’ve stayed at the Bloomsbury and Westbury in the Doyle collection before which were also excellent - no hesitations recommending the Marylebone, we’ll be back!",5,2021,06,30
123,Wonderful hotel,"I can’t praise this hotel highly enough.  From the moment we checked in to the morning we left we couldn’t have wished for a better weekend. The hotel itself is beautifu, extremely clean l and tastefully decorated but that counts for nothing if the staff aren’t up to much. And the Marylebone staff are amazing! We had an issue with our room, (through no fault of the hotel) and Katerina immediately upgraded us and did her best to make sure we were happy. The breakfast was beyond our expectations and again, the staff could not be faulted.  Will absolutely stay there again on our next trip.",5,2021,06,29
123,Amazing Hotel for Business Event!,"I made the booking through Cristina and she was incredibly helpful throughout the whole process and efficiently answered all of my queries.

123,Thanks for everything!,"Rockstar service at The Marylebone, where we stayed during our micro wedding, will stand out in our memories for life. The team went above and beyond to make everything special during our big day and made us feel like nothing was too much to ask -  from cocktails in the intimate but spacious lounge the night before, to smooth a checkout and departure.  The views over the rooftops of quaint Marylebone from our window were evocative of old London whilst the suite was fabulously well appointed - we couldn't have asked for more. 

We will definitely be back and would recommend the bar as a destination in it's own right for an evening on the town.

Thanks for everything, Gunther!",5,2021,06,22
123,Impeccable service and hospitality,"A huge thank you to the wonderful staff at the Marylebone Hotel. We stayed for two nights at the weekend to celebrate my husband's birthday and it was wonderful from start to finish. We arrived to complimentary upgrade for my husband's birthday, which was a great surprise. The room was a King Deluxe and had everything you need for a comfy stay. Giant bed - it felt like sleeping on a cloud - with crisp sheets and fluffy bedding. The view of the street below was lovely and our corner room was very quiet. The room was equipped with everything we needed. Our only minor qualm was the shower - it was  tricky to get onto the desired temperature and the water came out in all different directions. Also the swimming pool was out of action which was a small disappointment. However, this really was not a big problem at all. We had a fabulous dinner in the 108 Brasserie where we were brought a complimentary petit fours birthday plate, as well as enjoying some cocktails at the beautiful Cocktail Bar. Would absolutely recommend this hotel - perfectly situated for a weekend getaway, away from the hustle and bustle but very close to everything you need, but the service is absolutely what makes this",5,2021,06,22
123,Incredible service for an incredible hotel,"We stayed at The Marylebone Hotel for 2 nights and hosted our intimate wedding dinner here. We could not recommend this hotel more. Firstly the hotel is stunning with a remarkable finish in interior design, which extends among the communal spaces into the bedrooms. Secondly the location is unrivalled to visit Central London, with Regents Park, Oxford Street etc but a stone's throw away. Thirdly the food was exceptional, both our wedding dinner and the breakfasts which were included; Fresh pain-au-chocolats made on site! But really what makes the hotel stand out is the staff and service. I have truly never received such attention to detail and care go into our stay. Gunther, Tom, Lia (in the events team) and many more of the wonderful staff here helped us celebrate our wedding in absolute style - for us and the whole family who stayed as well. Yes we received an incredible room upgrade to help us celebrate, but that was the cherry on the cake of a wonderful stay! Thank you Marylebone Hotel for all your hard work and we can't wait to stay again.",5,2021,06,19
123,Delightful Gem of a Hotel,"We have recently celebrated my husband's 60th birthday at the Marylebone. We have visited once previously, pre-Covid and had a wonderful short weekend break, so decided to treat ourselves to a luxury suite this time. The hotel treated us so wonderfully from check-in to departure, it was a truly exceptional experience. Covid regulations were all adhered to and well managed by the hotel staff and you should feel utterly assured this is not only a safe place to stay, but a true oasis in Marylebone. We will return again soon hopefully. Thank you to all the lovely staff & management.",5,2021,06,18
123,Marvellous Marylebone,"Just wanted to say thanks for a wonderful break, your hotel was fantastic, all staff worked very hard to make us feel pampered and aspecial mention to Stan ( he asked me 😜)  . Great location to explore the area, delicious food and service. Look forward to seeing you again.",5,2021,06,18
123,Fabulous outside space,"It was so nice that the waitress offered before we asked, if the dog wanted water . Good selection at typical west prices but good portions. I even got the coffee as I asked . Normally if I ask for 1 shot and decaf I get what they fancy . My burger was yummy in a brioche bun . Felt safe and welcomed",4,2021,06,18
123,An Amazing Stay with Great Staff,"My wife and I stayed at the Marylebone on our wedding day and enjoyed every moment. The front desk staff & the bar staff all worked to make the day incredible, from an amazing room and a great breakfast to great drinks and food at the bar. The rooms are beautiful and in an amazingly convenient location for central London & Marylebone. 

The staff were all friendly and super helpful. The bar has a great selection of drinks and Greg and his team made sure to talk about all that was available. I'd recommend anyone thinking about staying there for either a normal trip or a special day like ours to do so.",5,2021,06,17
123,Best experience great location amazing staff,The Marylebone hotel stuff a specially Gunther was incredible! They have done beyond expectations to make our stay fenomenal!

The staff were so helpful and friendly, nothing was too much trouble, we felt very looked after and will definitely return again. ",5,2021,06,14
123,10/19 we’ll stay here again,"As this was our first trip after the most recent lockdown lifted I was tentative of what to expect but we had a fantastic stay. We will 100% return and stay at The Marylebone again. 

All of the reception and door staff were extremely welcoming and friendly, they always stopped to say hello. Some of the bar staff and breakfast staff (mainly the staff who greeted you when you entered either area) were less so which is my only negative feedback.

Our room was extremely clean, the bed was unbelievably comfortable and the breakfast was good. The room was also beautiful in terms of design and our standard room was surprisingly spacious. There was no hotel ‘manual’ in the room due to covid so more information at check in about room service, the gym, breakfast and check out would be beneficial. 

A great stay and we would 100% recommend.",5,2021,06,13
123,A great choice in Marylebone London - Great service,"I came with my wife and son to visit London for a week in June 2021.
I had few things to do in Marylebone area so I picked The Marylebone Hotel.
A very welcoming surprise 😊 . The hotel is very nice . Rooms are good and the overall experience with the Hotel is very good.
What really made the change with my stay there is the service.
I met Gunther Schildwachter the guest relations manager .He was amazing !
Gunther was doing everything possible to make our stay TOP stay !!
From booking restaurants arranging transportation , advise on where to go , doing some office work for me- printing, scanning and more.

123,Just what we needed!,"What a fantastic hotel!  Perfect in its location a few minutes walk from Bond Street Tube and the endless shopping possibilities!  This was a long overdue couple of nights away for my belated big b'day and an opportunity for my 12 year to fleece me as a result of working non stop since February 2020!  We were welcomed with not just a room upgrade but a super early check in (having just thought we'd be able to drop off our bags).  The reception staff couldn't have been nicer and the room was perfect.  Unbelievably comfortable bed, crisp sheets, soft towels and a window that could open - so not at all stuffy.  Over 2 nights / 3 days we walked 52,263 steps most of which weighed down with bags... so the comfortable room was essential!  Breakfast was fine, nothing super special but perfectly nice.  We were very kindly given a complimentary couple of drinks and such a nice bar manager put us into a different lounge area in order for my daughter to be able to enjoy the mocktail without being made to feel awkward about her not being in the bar area.  We ate one night in the hotel's restaurant which was very nice - lots to choose from and a nice atmosphere.  Overall the staff were the real bonus to the whole experience - we were so well looked after and everyone was so friendly and kind especially to my daughter.  We will absolutely return, its a fabulous hotel and its position in the heart of London couldn't be better - especially for a girls trip!!",5,2021,06,06
123,Mr and Mrs Hembrow,"I have just ended a couple of nights stay at the beautiful Marylebone hotel. Of course our rooms were fantastic but what really stood out was the exception service.

We will certainly be visiting again soon.",5,2021,06,05
123,Memorable stay,"Couldn’t fault the Marylebone Hotel, the location is excellent .

The hotel is very conveniently located in central London, near nice restaurants. We will be staying here again for future staycations and recommend to visiting family and friends!",5,2021,06,01

Staff were friendly, warm and accommodating. Can’t recommend enough!",5,2021,05,30
123,Enjoyable and relaxing stay,The hotel staff were very accommodating. They anticipated about the weather when we were going out even providing us an umbrella in case it rained which happened 3 minutes after walking out given London’s very unpredictable weather. Hotel is located in the heart of London and is in very close proximity to shops and restaurants. We enjoyed our drinks at their cocktail bar but you have to book for an earlier time if you wanna stay longer as they close at 11pm. ,5,2021,05,28
123,A few well needed days away!,"We have been staying here for well over 15 years and were so please to see the hotels doors open again. Everyone was so welcoming and could not do any more to make our stay exceptional, from Stan on the front door, to the receptionists and Tom the front of house manager.

",5,2021,05,22
123,Exceptional from before arrival to the moment I left.,"A really lovely stay from start to finish. What a wonderful way to be welcomed back to London for the first time since the world changed. 

From first phone contact before I arrived with Anjy to correct a duplicate booking to the meal that was delivered to my room when I arrived late to Katerina getting me organised with the gym and Gunther being so lovely at check out I can’t speak highly enough of the staff. Welcoming, friendly and just couldn’t do enough!

The hotel is chic and stylish but warm and comfy. The fire in The Cocktail Bar made my day!

The gum is cool and we’ll appointed with good kit. 

I felt very safe with the rigorous adherence to Covid safety measures and frankly it’s been a pleasure. I can’t wait to come back!",5,2021,05,21

123,Weekend Stay in September,"We stayed here in September to celebrate my wife's birthday. We had a great time. The hotel was lovely and great location. Obviously things are difficult at the moment with Covid, but everything was clean. Loads of notices and information on how things had been cleaned etc. Even got a welcome pack with mask/ hand sanitiser. We felt very safe during our stay.

Staff were super friendly, always willing and wanting to help.

Would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone coming to London. You won't be disappointed.",5,2020,11,30

123,A great London staycation spot,"The great thing about The Marylebone beside the location is the no hassle transaction. Book-CheckIn-Enjoy-CheckOut. No over and unnecessary steps that most hotels tend to do most especially during the pandemic. The hotel staff were courteous and the restaurant staff were very friendly. The room is decent and relaxing. It could do with a little bit more essential things (toothpaste, toothbrush, combs) that other high end hotels automatically offer in the room but overall, a pleasing and satisfying stay is guaranteed here. Thank you The Marylebone!",4,2020,10,27
123,We will return,"The hotel has a very nice frontage with a designated car space to set down & gather your luggage.  The door staff are immediately attentive, well groomed & polite as were the reception staff. 
The hotel has a very clean & large  reception area, umbrella stands, central seating near to the lifts. Covid measures were immediately visible & well displayed & signed. 
Room 589 was large, clean, appointed with all that we needed, ironing board, Iron, tea/coffee making facilities, hair dryer, bath robes, safe, bottled water, good wardrobe, drawer spaces, sockets etc writing desk, telephone, table with swivel chair. The Bathroom was again very spacious, with heated solid floor tiles, quality towels and products, good lighting, shaver point, a large mirror, a good bath with over head shower & separate handle hose shower attachment. The TV on the main wall is very large with most channels available. 
The room overall is carpeted very nicely, the bed was a 'king' size, very very comfortable, very clean bed linen & deep pillows. The voile curtains were a bonus, the black out main curtains were a good quality. The main windows is operated on a 'tilt/slide' mechanism. The  room overall offers great value for money without doubt, I would not hesitate in booking this specific room again. We ate in the downstairs 108 Brasserie, again very good food/drink choices, covid measures in sight, very good staff and a breakfast menu with many choices and attentive waiting staff. Very pleased for a 1st visit.",5,2020,10,04
123,The Best People and service in London,"I was staying at the Marylebone for work before, and will surely stay there once my job starts back up, the COVID- 19 Pandemic.
I have had the absolute best experience I could have had staying at any hotel, at the Marylebone!

The people working there are tireless in their pursuit to help make anyone's stay that bit better. I could name everyone at the Hotel. Olga, Gunther, Stan, Masi and everyone else at the hotel are absolutely incredible. Will stay there when I can in London. 

Highly advise! Great Hotel, and GREAT PEOPLE working there!",5,2020,04,14
123,Favorite Hotel in London - THE MARYLEBONE,We had the most wonderful stay at the Marylebone earlier in March.  Gunther and his team made us truly feel like we were at home.  Everytime we walked through the door we were greeted with smiling faces and wonderful conversations.  The hotel itself is well decorated and we enjoyed all the cozy spaces including the 108 Bar.  Loved sitting having a drink there as well as outside watching people walk by.  Thank you GUNTHER and your team for always making us feel special when staying at The Marylebone. We will be back soon once this pandemic is over.  Stay healthy and safe !,5,2020,03,30
123,A quick getaway,"My wife and I decided to visit London for a long weekend (from the US).  We were not familiar with the Marylebone Hotel, but we know the neighborhood.

123,Excellent Hotel!,"I have written about The Marylebone before, since I frequently stay in London, but this trip I stayed for 7 weeks!  Seven weeks in a hotel room could present real challenges, but I must single out Housekeeping in this review, because Elena and Alessandra -- the heads of housekeeping -- made my stay effortless and exceptional. My schedule changed from day to day, and I spent more time in my room than one would normally do, as the trip was long, and it became my real ""home"". I could phone them each day and arrange any cleaning time (or none if I wished!) that suited my schedule. They followed my requests to the letter, and I even had a hotel engineer in my room at one point -- because he had pliers to fix the clasps on a jacket! The laundry is delivered promptly and beautifully, room service is super prompt, so friendly and accommodating...I could compliment every single department in the hotel, as I consider them all close to perfect. Once again, I recognize Gunther Schildwachter, who takes care of my reservations and is always delighted to be of any assistance, whatsoever.  I can honestly say I have never had one single problem in all the times I have stayed here -- from the friendly, engaged doormen to the kitchens to the unseen staff!",5,2020,03,18
123,Amazing Engagement Party,"Thank you so much to Bianca, Cristina, Otto and the whole events team for a truly unforgettable engagement party in February!

Its like being back home. I missed the familiar buzz of the hotel, the welcoming smells that you get coming through the door and the excellent staff service. What was FANTASTIC to see was that one key Front of House team member.... GUNTHER!!! 

So glad to see you return to the Marylebone. You were missed! He's a loved and valued employee who always did the most for me at my previous stays. Nothing was ever too much trouble. 

Last time I was in for business meetings, he went out of his way to ensure we were looked after, and we were not even overnight guests at the hotel.

An excellent place to stay, conduct meetings or just grab cocktails or coffee.",5,2020,03,13

123,The Best Choice in London,"I was in London last week for business purposes, and found the Hotel a gem in the heart of London. The location is superb, but what I regretted for the first time in many years was not taking some more time to enjoy the premises. The Restaurant is out of the question, but the Gym is also incredible, and my room had a view that helped me relax after long working hours.
Moreover,  I would like to take a minute to thank especially Mr. Gunther, who excelled in every possible manner when asked for help. Always willing to solve every issue in a timely manner. I will  go back to The Marylebone for sure as soon as I can. Thanks for making me feel at home.",5,2020,03,12

123,"A ""5-star"" boutique hotel in the heart of London","The Marylebone is an upscale hotel in the heart of Marylebone Village in London.  Walking distance to all the London highlights.  It has the 5-star services of a large hotel but retains the charm and intimacy of a small boutique hotel.  From the moment you are greeted upon arrival by Antje and her superb front desk team, to the personal service of Gunther, head of guest relations, your visit will be seamless.  We previously lived in London.   The Marylebone has now become our new home.  We visit London often for work and pleasure and think of going nowhere else.  While dining in the hotel is amazing, there are countless top restaurants within a short walk, as well as shopping.  We return often and highly recommend it to all who are looking for a charming hotel with top notch service located in one of the trendiest neighborhoods in London.  You can't go wrong.",5,2020,03,10
123,Exceptional,"I was only in contact with the front desk at this hotel due to my mothers stay here during her 60th birthday.
And I cannot thank the staff here enough. They were incredible and they really know how to take care of their guests and the guest relation.
It was above and beyond in every way. I'm so so thankful. And my mother was so surprised and grateful.
And of course next time I'm in London myself. I know where to go!",5,2020,03,10

Food was superb and commented upon by so many guests. Everything is beautifully and professionally carried out. We also stayed and the room was superb. A huge shout out to Gunther on Guest Relations who looked after us so well and who some of the other 5 star hotels in London could and should learn from. Also Cristina in events and the lady (whose name slips my mind) on the night itself who made sure everything happened seamlessly. The overall quality is so good throughout that, living locally, it is a pleasure to continue to pop in regularly for drinks in the beautiful bar or in the 108 Brasserie which continues to offer some of the highest quality restaurant food in London with comfortable seating and with loads of atmosphere.

My wife loved it.   The room was perfect and the staff was unobtrusive but always helpful.   We were pleasantly surprised on day 2 with complimentary gin and tonics delivered to our room.

Thank you Gunther and guys
See you all soon.",5,2020,02,15
123,"Excelent hotel, great location","Hotel was excellent and staff exceptional.  Only reason that it's not a 5 is that the kitchens in the Brasserie and restaurant had some problems (no gas I think) so menu was very limited.  Food we had was very good though. 

Rooms were a little 'cosy' for the price - good enough for one though",4,2020,02,14
123,Fab evening ,I have just come from the Marylebone Hotel where my friend and I had a lovely meal in their restaurant. This was made an even more enjoyable experience by our wonderful server Evelina how could not have been nicer or more attentive to us. Thank you Evelina. We will certainly be back... ,5,2020,02,13

123,Outstanding hotel,"Every member of staff in the Marylebone is of the highest calibre; cheerful, helpful and keen to help. Internally, the hotel is very well designed, maintained and spotlessly clean. The location is perfect, (for those of you that know London, Marylebone is a lovely, charming place within a 5 minute walk of the bustle of Oxford Street and a 10 minute walk to the British Museum). The only weakness is that the building from the outside is modern and soulless. But, it looks out into some lovely streets, and these are what you see when you look out.",5,2020,02,10
123,The Marylebone Hotel,"Set in Westminster and smart bit of London this hotel fails to deliver.  Small but not particularly friendly although bar staff did their best.  Room was actually quite nice and bed comfy, large TV but breakfast appalling and at £10.00 cost (not included in overnight stay) just juice, cereal/yoghurt and a round of toast offered.  No hot cooked breakfast and no choice despite the cost.  On the menu this is all costed separately- why when both traditional and European breakfasts should be offered inclusive.  After what passed as breakfast returned to room and card had already been cancelled as unable to get in to room to get my overnight bag so had to go down to reception to get this sorted out - no real apology/explanation.  For an overnight stay ok to a point plenty of hot water but you need to eat out, hardly anyone in hotel dining area which was no surprise.  This hotel is in a fairly prime location but could do so much better.  No entertainment at hotel or any information offered about what was on nearby (theatre/shows etc).  Taxis are nearly always present outside.  No offer of newspaper or any special requirements.  Would I stay here again - no.",1,2020,02,09
123,Fun hotel in an excellent location ,"I was pleasantly surprised by the helpful, energetic staff at the hotel. Service is quite good and the location in Marylebone is excellent. The two restaurants are also better than most. Rooms are comfortable, clean and modern, although the shower doors are strange. I will definitely return when I visit London again.",5,2020,02,09
123,The Marylebone Rooms - Conference,"We came back again for a week-long training in The Library and it has been an absolute delight to be back. Great service by Peter and Pau and of course, great organisation by Bianca. It is classy, comfortable and the food is amazing - to feed our brain cells. Highly recommend the experience.",5,2020,02,07
123,Great hotel!,"My favorite hotel in London. It is very central but away from the busy streets and therefore very quiet. The members of the hotel staff are really kind, helpful and welcoming.

The hotel also offers great facilities and the breakfast is definitely one of the best I have experienced in all my traveling. Great place to stay!",5,2020,02,04

123,Great stay!,"We had a great weekend at the Marylebone! We were upgraded to a large room with great views where chocolates and wine were waiting for us at arrival. Having stayed here before, we knew that the Marylebone would be a great choice and we were not disappointed. The location and service level is great. The hotel is undergoing renovation, but this was not bothersome - the facilities are still nice. We especially enjoyed the gym and spa. A special thanks to guest relations manager Gunther, who went out of his way to make sure we had everything we needed. We hope to be back soon!",5,2020,02,03
123,Miss Phelan,"I absolutely love staying here on the occasion I’m in London for an event or meeting with friends and want to remain in town for shopping and a treat of an overnight stay.

It’s my perfect choice for location and service!",5,2020,02,02
123,Keeping the same high level,"My last stay at the Marylebone, again for business reasons, was back on mid September, about four months ago. Still I wanted to post a review because I enjoyed my stay to the fullest and mainly due to the usual professionalism and care of all the staff and particularly the ladies on the breakfast pantry (sorry I don't remember the name) and also Gunther from the reception, always trying to over deliver and make your stay really a special one. Keep up the good work guys!",5,2020,02,02
123,Stay at The Marylebone,"We chose this hotel as it was in close proximity to a clinic my husband was attending.
All the desk staff were so friendly and helpful. The young lady who booked us in also was at our departure and remembered my husband was having an operation and wished him luck !
We booked a classic twin room which although wasn’t huge was extremely comfortable and clean. The bathroom was spotless (a massive plus in my eyes )Well stocked with beautiful thick towels ,toiletries,and wonderful comfortable slippers and dressing gown . 
I chose the room service breakfast which I thought at first sounded quite expensive but I was very surprised at the amount and choice I was provided . Considering it was for one it was an extremely generous portion.
The hotel is well situated for Oxford Street.
I would definitely stay here again .",5,2020,02,01
123,Excellent vegan food and friendly staff,"Stayed at the hotel for 2 nights as part of a training course. The in house restaurant serving the lunch for the training were informed about me being vegan. Chef James from day 1 served some fab vegan food on all 3 days. He ensured that I was not left out, be it lunch, dessert or tea time, serving the most delectable brownies, cakes or vegan yoghurt dessert pots. There were specific vegan snacks and desserts served everyday. Big shout out also to the staff (front office, room cleaning, food servers at breakfast and lunch) as they all did their job with a smile. The hotel is a bit old and the rooms small, but the staff make up for it. Definitely recommended. :-)",4,2020,01,30

Absolutely fantastic location, good rooms (the refurbished ones are an improvement on what was already a very good standard), and most importantly - amazing staff. Gunther and the team, be it receptionists, door-men, duty managers, and/or bar staff - all are highly professional, flexible and always ready to go out of their way to help whenever possible. Highly recommended for both business or pleasure - I'll certainly be going there many more times before the end of 2020!!! Thank you!!",5,2020,01,29

123,Friends get together ,"My favourite hotel for location, decor and bars. Rooms are excellent but small unless you upgrade to luxury or above.  The location is fantastic. In a pretty spot just off Marylebone High Street and a few steps for The Ivy Brasserie. Five minutes walk from Selfridges and so close to Marylebone station. ",5,2020,01,27
123,The Gem of London,"I’ve been coming for 10 years and the hotel keeps getting better. With the updates especially over the last few years it’s a warm, inviting place, tastefully decorated.

123,Wonderful start of 2020,"It’s not my first stay and definitely not the last, Compared to other five-stars hotels in the same location, I find The Marylebone Hotel is super perfect for me. Just a walk distance to Oxford Street, Selfridges, Hyde Park. Great facilities, and elegant lobby. 

This time, I stayed in room 722, was super spacious, I liked the bathroom, specially the under heated floor and over-head shower. I probably had the best sleep in a very long time. 

From my experience, I always find the bed at The Marylebone Hotel very comfy, fluffy towels, nice toiletries, and neat bedding. Turn-down service is amazing, in general rooms are superbly clean.

Very friendly and welcoming staff, I would like to thank Gunther - Guest Relations Manager for making this stay exceptional by giving special attention to my preferences. 

In short, I had a lovely stay. Definitely will come again. ",5,2020,01,20

123,London 2020,"Just returned from a fantastic few days in London staying at the Marylebone Hotel. Travelled with my wife and 3 children aged 21, 19 & 15 - We wanted for nothing in the rooms, mini bar, tea & coffee facilities, hairdryer, robes & slippers, iron, toiletries, safe, huge tv, turn down service all you would expect from a 4 star hotel but seemed better here. The food available all day in the 108 was really good. Complimentary papers at breakfast. The kids loved the swimming pool & gym - such a bonus to have this amazing facility on site.

123,Perfect Spot,"We were visiting London  for a long weekend for some shopping and needed a hotel that was central to the shops in Mayfair. We could not have chosen a better spot. The hotel is about a 7 minute walk away from Debenhams on Oxford St. It is also situated in the most gorgeous little suburb of Marylebone which has lots of little shops, restaurants and cafes all around. It is really a gem. We stayed in a Studio Suite (as it is more roomy) which appeared to be newly furnished and it was lovely. I especially loved the bathroom which was modern and spacious with a seperate bath and shower which is not typical by London standards. The one morning we woke up to no water in the hotel. That evening when we returned to the hotel, we arrived to a bottle of complimentary gin from the hotel's bar and some nuts, with an apology note for the inconvenience - a nice touch I thought. We also celebrated our 10 year anniversary during our stay and we were presented with a lovely bottle of prosecco and cake which we really enjoyed. Overall, this is a lovely property in a stunning location. We will definitely return.",4,2020,01,15
123,Perfect Location,"I recommend the Hotel it's a very good quality/price deal.

The staff are friendly and accommodating. Gunther in guest relations is amazing, and so are the entire concierge team and front desk. The Brassiere is also amazing and has a great vibe.

We give it five stars. ⭐️",5,2020,01,13

123,Merry Marylebone,"Decided to take a last minute trip to London right before the holidays. We have visited London several times and stayed in some beautiful hotels such as The Dorchester, The Goring and The Rosewood. This was our first stay at The Marylebone, but certainly not our last.

Although the Classic and Deluxe King rooms are smaller .. the King Studio Suite offered great space. The hotel is spotlessly clean, food and drinks are wonderful and service all around is outstanding. Location of the hotel is perfect for anyone wanting to walk the city. Cute shops and great restaurants are just steps from the hotel and it is within easy walking distance to major sites.

We had a small complaint about our room location regarding outside noise the first night and Ms. Theano Karathanasopoulou, Head of Guest Relations, went above and beyond in her response and care for our comfort. Her kindness and compassion for her guests was obvious along with her attention to detail. It is because of Theano, and the entire staff at The Marylebone hotel, that will have us returning to stay there the next time we are in London.",5,2020,01,11
123,A home away from home,"Our recent visit to London was made more special because of the staff of the Marylebone Hotel.

The Hotel really has it all - a gym, sauna, pool, spa treatments, great options for meals, close to Oxford and Regent streets and a huge menu of cocktails! From the very first day I felt it was a home away from home. Thanks to the wonderful staff at the Marylebone Hotel.",5,2020,01,10
123,Party time did not disappoint!,A private party in the Long Room - great venue and great organisation by Bianca Dias ably assisted by Otto and their colleagues.  Wonderful food and drink and if you're booking the Long Room it is a great excuse to have cocktails and the best canapés you will ever taste - fantastico!,5,2020,01,09
123,Outstanding Stay!,"With so many hotels to chose from in London I am so glad we picked this one on the off chance! From the word go the staff were wonderful and made us feel so welcomed. They were helpful, knowledgable and kind - nothing was ever too much! We stayed here for my partners birthday and Theano and the rest of the team made every effort to make it special for him. It's a hidden gem and not only is the hotel beautiful, the rooms are lovely and spacious and have everything you would need. It's conveniently located and is close to St Christopher's Place which is great. I will definitely be staying here again when I return to London. 5 star service!",5,2020,01,07
123,Welcome Home,"When having arrived I was already greeted as if I was a regular, even though I have stayed at the Marylebone just once before. All of the staff were friendly and happy to help. The room had a slightly larger than normal size for London standards, though a bit more space would still be appreciated. Everything in the room was very modern and the furniture was tastefully chosen. Even the dental kit that I received from the reception early in the morning was luxury quality which I have rarely experienced even at much higher priced hotels. I cannot comment on the breakfast, since- thanks to a free late check-out- I slept longer than planned. The check-out was easy and I was even offered to use the gym afterwards- impressive service, will surely come back!",5,2020,01,07
123,The Marylebone Hotel,"Incredible all round service and gym facilities. Room was clean and comfortable with great amenities.
The gym was amazing and the pool plus steam room and sauna facilities were a real treat. I can see why its considered the best hotel gym in London. Great machines and equipment. All the staff were amazing. Its by far my favourite hotel in London I've stayed in. I highly recommend.",5,2020,01,03
123,5 Star Service At the Marylebone,"Our stay at the Marylebone was absolutely fantastic. What truly made the difference was the staff! They were always so helpful, kind, and efficient. Some of the best service I have ever experienced at a five star hotel. Michele at the bar was especially helpful, he even gave us wonderful recommendations of places to visit around the city. If you’re looking to be treated above expectations then look no further than the Marylebone when booking your stay in London!",5,2020,01,02
123,Family visit,"Me, my wife and our five daughters enjoyed our stay in the hotel very much! Especially the doormen Stan and Carlos were very friendly. One of my daughters especially liked the tall handsome guy that was working in the restaurant at the new years breakfast! ;-)",5,2020,01,02
123,A VERY Merry Christmas!,"My friends at The Marylebone led by Customer Service Manager Gunther Schildwachter made this past Christmas a very special one,indeed, with the warmest of welcomes and many, many special treats. What is so remarkable to me is how the hotel is always improving it’s physical plant while maintaining a staff that is so consistent in it’s outstanding service - always professional and personal at the same time. 
Special thanks to Gunther, Rahim, Daniel, Angie, Masi, Chalita, Ouana, Nikita, Andre and Veruchka in addition to Ruth Tulip, the charming restaurant consultant the hotel has retained to surpass it’s always high standards!
Happy 2020 to all at The Marylebone! I hope to see you again soon and often in the new year.",5,2019,12,31
123,Tiny Bathrooms/Big Service,"Loved our stay at the Marylebone London. Incredible staff provided excellent service. Masi is a honey of an oat and was always very helpful. Because of the service, beautifully appointed rooms and location I would stay here again and again. Next time I would upgrade to a room with a larger bath.",5,2019,12,31
123,"Amazing Property, Location and Service",Stayed at the Marylebone with 3 kids and received 2 very comfortable inter leading rooms. Interior of rooms is stylish and classy. Gym and Pool is Heaven and Best In Class. Service overall is Superb. Godwin and Stav were amazing. Location is the best if you want to be close (5 min) to the action on Oxford but not where it’s noisy. Would recommend to anyone. It’s now my favorite hotel to stay at in London,5,2019,12,31
123,Weekend,"Very nice hotel with very friendly people! Especially Masi from the repection-service.
A very central location in a quiet environement. Breakfast was nice and we had a lot of choice. We will come back someday :)!",5,2019,12,31
123,First Experience : Excelllent!,"First experience at this hotel, the service for all during my journey was very excellent : five stars service, great location, great breakfast; wonderfull room and commodity, very english special atmosphére",5,2019,12,31
123,"Good stay, very good service, fantastic location","Overall initial impressions were good.  The lobby and common areas have some great spaces to explore.  The service went from good to great to mediocre, but overall impression of the entire team was very good.

The rooms are painfully small and bathrooms even more so. Ok, typical London? Sure, but still painful.
Overall comfort despite size was good.

The location of the hotel is amazing. The Marylebone area and streets are ritzy and nice, eclectic and cool and a little touch of mainstream and mass appeal...but still in a cool hip way. Would stay just for the location again.

Breakfast was good each day and the main restaurant and service, excellent. The room service left a bit to be desired, but shame on us for doing room service.

The attached gym is very good. A third party gym with way more to offer than a typical hotel gym...well done with that partnership!

If the rooms and bathrooms were a bit more comfortable in size, I could see a rating of a 5, but instead offer a solid 4...good job to the team",4,2019,12,30
123,Fabulous stay,Had a fab stay at this hotel over the festive period. Rooms lovely. Had drinks in the bar and staff were great. Special thanks to masi who organised our luggage and taxis during our stay. Nothing was too much trouble. Would highly recommend ,5,2019,12,30

I would recommend this place and in-fact we have already booked to return.",5,2019,12,28
123,Turn it to an amazing experience ...,"The start of our experience was not that brilliant hence why we approached reception to speak to senior team member. After great talk with Guests relations manager who made us feel valuable and listen to us patiently, he made our stay memorable and tailored to our needs as we spent Christmas away from home.

In particular, I was extremely impressed by the fantastic service of one of their staff members - Mr Gunther Schildwatcher.

Lovely friendly staff who were very helpful throughout. Even went out and bought the child we were staying with Christmas presents to open. Would highly recommend.",5,2019,12,25
123,Sarah Welsh,"We have just spent Christmas Eve and Christmas Day together at this wonderful hotel - Theano and Gunther were utterly fantastic - the environment was wonderful, warm and they spoilt us and our children!

123,lovely ambience but a tad hyperefficient,stayed here 3 times or more. Stopped off for a drink and bite to eat. Service was good if a tad impersonal and hyperefficient. Downstairs bar was not busy but we felt 'hustled' out the door and staff were more interested in themselves than the customers despite 12.5% included service charge. Perhaps if they had discretionary tip they might be more customer focused.,4,2019,12,24
123,The Marylebone in central London deserves mention,"I normally don’t comment on the hotels I stay in but The Marylebone in central London deserves mention. This hotel has been managing to provide many features which has been making my stay comfortable and enjoyable. It’s not only the convenient location for shopping and visiting doctors, it is mainly the excellent services offered. From arrival until departure the personnel are always smiling and the response to any request is immediate and efficient. You may start with Theano, Guest Relations Manager, who arranges the accommodation and is happily greeting you on arrival, Masi and Michael who take care of your luggage, Chalita, who escorts you to your table for breakfast and of course many others. Finally there is plenty of space in the newly redecorated lounges to relax or conduct business.
Dimitri Kyriazis",5,2019,12,24
123,Amazing hotel,"We stayed, my wife and me, at The Marylebone for 4 nights just before Christmas. The is our second visit to this hotel, and it keeps improving!
Everything was perfect: the location (5 minutes from Oxford Street and Bond station) the facilities, the room (spacious and comfortable), the bar, the restaurant (we had breakfast and it was excellent) and the lobby.
But, above all, was the staff - helpful, attentive and friendly. They made us feel they really want to help, they really want you to feel at home. 
I have to mention especially Mr. Gunther Schildwachter, who did his outmost to meet our needs, and was there for us throughout our stay.
We shall definitely return to The Marylebone, and we will surely recommend this hotel to all our friends.
Osnat & Danny Inbal",5,2019,12,24
123,Absolutely amazing,"I stayed here as a special thank you gift to my mum and the staff went above and beyond every expectation I could possibly have had. Beautiful hotel, great location but by far the best thing about this his hotel is the staff, their service, attention to detail and how they literally go above and beyond at every opportunity for you! Couldn’t recommend this hotel enough to anyone looking to stay in London. From the bottom of my heart thank you for everything you did and making our stay a magical and very special one.",5,2019,12,24
123,Excellent hotel in the perfect London location,"We stay frequently at the Marylebone. The staff are amazingly caring and considerate, and always make us feel at home. The restaurant and lounges are lovely, and the location in the heart of Marylebone puts us close to shopping, theater, parks, and the very best of London. Many thanks to the Guest Relations Manager Gunther Shildwachter for being so accommodating and making our recent stay so pleasant. ",5,2019,12,23
123,Top quality hotel and staff,My wife and I are regular visitors to London for business and pleasure.  During our most recent visit for a long pre Christmas weekend we booked The Marylebone Hotel.  It was our third visit there and it was a great experience from start to finish.  The location is excellent.  In the heart of Marylebone with several good restaurants and bars within minutes walking distance.  Around 15 minute walk to Oxford Street/Great Portland Street.  The staff are ultra helpful and friendly.  The hotel itself is nicely designed and the main bar has a real buzz whichever time of day you are there. It’s worth paying a bit more for a larger room as some of the standard rooms are on the small size.  Definitely on a par with The Langham and London’s Firmdale hotels.,5,2019,12,23
123,Top Notch Service,"The Marylebone is a high quality hotel with all of the amenities that one would expect. The room is quite comfortable and clean which is always a must, and the hotel offers many amenities including bar, restaurant, and fitness. However, what stood out to me most was the level of service. We were always greeted by members of the staff who were very willing to assist in any way possible.  Stan was very helpful upon our early morning departure and immediately took our bags and found us a reputable taxi service for our departure. The location of the hotel is quite convenient as well, and I would highly recommend the Marylebone to others.",5,2019,12,23
123,Tottenham's match,"The room was great, everythingyou needed, we had a standard room but this was very comfortable and refurbished. The kingsize bed was very comfortable and the bathroom soaps and shampoos are excellent. The really great thing about the hotel is the service. Nothing was to much trouble for the Theano the manager and Godwin.
Definitely I ll be back!",5,2019,12,21
123,Very nice,"Wonderful trip, very very nice personal; always welcoming, helping ... . Bad luck we got woke up by the fire alarm. All good otherwise ! 
Laundry and amenities with a very affordable price compared to other equivalent levels.",5,2019,12,21
123,Check in staff is ever so friendly,"Hotel is great, nice cosy rooms.  The reception staff is very friendly. Gunther is very helpful and polite.  Definitely a recommendation for business travelers stayed here in December 2019 and will come back",5,2019,12,20
123,As good as usual,"The Marylebone  is excellent as usual. The wonderful Gunther Schildwatchter is the epitome of charm and helpfulness. Even when alone I feel totally at home in the public rooms 
Well done Marylebone, keep it up
Sandra Jones",5,2019,12,20
123,Special Thanks,"We would like to thank to Guther, guest relations manager for being very helpful and result oriented. We had a small problem with the size of the room. Thanks to Guther, our stay became very comfortable. This is our first time in this hotel but for sure we will stay again!",5,2019,12,19
123,Perfect solo stay,"I stayed at the Marylebone earlier this year on a solo trip, and I was deeply impressed by the level of care that was given to me for my entire stay. From the doorman who asked how I was every day, to the guest relations manager who made sure all of my requests were fulfilled swiftly, to my room where I had everything I needed for a comfortable stay, and to the delicious room service options, the pampered vacation I was seeking for a week of self care was more than fulfilled. The Marylebone clearly caters well to families, solo travelers, as well as business travelers, and everyone is made to feel warmly welcome. It is located near so many wonderful shops, both independent and well known, as well as a wide selection of restaurants. Tube station is maybe a 6 minute walk. I will stay here again, and I would recommend it to friends and family",5,2019,12,19
123,Stellar service and stay as always,"My family and I enjoy coming to London from abroad a couple times a year, and I make it a point to book at The Marylebone for the consistently friendly faces and stellar service. I always feel welcomed from the moment I arrive, and this visit has been no different. My son has been showered with smiles and special amenities for his birthday, the front desk staff has been knowledgeable about my various inquiries, and the manager, Gunther S, has gone above and beyond to make sure our stay has been enjoyable and memorable. If you enjoy boutique hotels because of their more personalized attention, and if you enjoy a well run, modern hotel set amidst the thoroughly charming & central neighborhood that is Marylebone, I’d highly recommend this hotel .",5,2019,12,19
123,Amazing Stay in the Marylbone,"we just return from the Marylebone hotel we had an amazing stay this is the best hotel in London .
the location the rooms the service I have to mention
Theano Karathanasopoulou 
she helped us with everything we needed and made our stay unforgettable she is the reason we back again and again

123,London Christmas shopping,"Very accommodating staff for breakfast and dinner.great location with lively bar.thanks to Andrei for looking after my car. I would highly recommend this hotel for couples or families.   Great location close to the shops,  really needed to stay two nights instead of one.   Gym, pool and spa were fantastic the only downside was set times for children to swim.",5,2019,12,18
123,Fantastic dining experience at the Marylebone,"I have visited the 108 Brasserie of The Marylebone Hotel on a Saturday night and I was absolutely thrilled by the excellent service and the quality of food. Staff team, led by the very experienced manager, Emre, were all very knowledgeable and courteous while assisting us with our cocktails and menu decisions. It was wonderful night which was massively due to the staff and their willingness to go the extra mile to enhance our dining experience. I will be definitely going back!",5,2019,12,18
123,Home from Home,"When staying in the city, this is by far the Best hotel. The staff are so helpful, especially Gunther. They do some amazing cocktails and a wonderful restaurant. 
The gym holds the latest equipment and location means a stones throw away from Selfridges. What more could you want.",5,2019,12,18
123,Amazing in every way!,"Staying at the Marylebone Hotel is always great but this time was amazing. This has been our favorite hotel in London for many years and is an essential part of travelling and enjoy London. The entire hotel has be redesigned in a beautiful way with a twist of great art deco feeling and the music and sound together with comfortable furniture makes you feel good wherever you are in the hotel. Our room with the nice shower and bed was extremely comfortable with great details and Nespresso coffee   

The location is perfect, quite area but in few minutes walk to all major shopping streets like Bond Street and Oxford Street and also in a short way to Selfridges. However my favorite the Marylebone High Street is on next corner which is the most charming shopping street of London in my eyes. 

The hotel bars and restaurants has a great atmosphere and crowd and the staff is extremely nice and helpful. 

If you want to stay at a hotel which makes you feel good and relaxing then choose this hotel. We love it and look forward to stay there again and again.",5,2019,12,17
123,My go-to hotel in London,"I visit London several times a year and am so thrilled I found The Marylebone. The hotel itself is a quiet jewel box; the design is sleek without being cold, and modern without being impersonal. The staff, from the front desk to the concierge to the doormen to the housekeepers to the management, is all first rate. The Marylebone is located close to all the action of vibrant London, but is tucked away on a peaceful street, so you get the best of both worlds.  It’s my retreat from hectic London life, and I wouldn’t stay anywhere else!",5,2019,12,17
123,Great location!,"Our staying was beyond our expectations.

We had also the pleasure to met Theano , who made sure we were well taken care of the entire time and made us feel very special !
We would love to stay there again !",5,2019,12,16
123,Fantastic Venue for a Party!,"We needed a venue for a Christmas party/Anniversary meal.  I viewed many hotels in Marylebone but none were as lovely as The Marylebone Hotel and Bianca was just amazing to work with.  She is so friendly and organised and you immediately feel at ease.  Our party started at 6.30pm and Bianca stayed late to see me on the night and to ensure everything was to my liking (the table looked fabulous) and she then introduced me to Otto who would look after us during the night.

He too was fabulous and went out of his way to ensure everything ran smoothly, which it did.

We all agreed the party was fantastic and i can only put it down to the beautiful room and the great service we received from Bianca and Otto.

Thank you All! I cannot wait for the next one!",5,2019,12,16
123,Client Party,"Wonderful location and venue for our event - but most importantly quite outstanding staff.

It is very well located and near to all of the main attractions of Central London 
An excellent venue for a weekend in London",5,2019,12,11
123,"Great Location, beautiful modern rooms!",This was my third stay at the Marylebone hotel. The rooms are beautiful and kept spotless! The hotel staff is very friendly and willing to help with anything. During my stay I ship merchandise back home and they cannot be more accommodating and helpful during the process (I have stayed at other hotels in the area and this has not always been the case at other hotels) ,5,2019,12,10
123,Christmas Dinner Venue,We had a wonderful Christmas dinner here (The Blue Room) for 25 people.  Cristina was fantastic to deal with regarding booking the venue and all the changes to attendee numbers/menu choices etc and nothing was too much trouble.  Otto and Alessio attended to us magnificently on the evening of the dinner.  A great time was had by all and we would definitely use this venue again.  Many thanks to everyone at The Marylebone.,5,2019,12,10
123,Great venue for a corporate seminar,"We hosted a client seminar in the Blue Room of the Marylebone hotel. The space was beautiful and easily transitioned into a cocktail reception. The staff was amazingly helpful in making sure we had everything we needed for the event, food was awesome. Cristina especially went above and beyond to make sure everything was accommodated. Great experience, would definitely do another event here in the future.",5,2019,12,10
123,Amazing Service ,"I don’t say this lightly!  I’ve stayed at The Marylebone a few times before, always pleased with the rooms, service and location, I was originally recommended the hotel by a friend.

However on this instance when I arrived, Gunther Schildwachter, did an amazing job at sorting a big problem I had, and I must say he really put the hotel up there with some of the best in London.

10/10 great service, the hotel went above and far beyond what they needed to.",5,2019,12,10
123,Great location and value,"We stayed in this hotel on our recent visit to London and loved the location. The restaurants and shops in the area as well as being able to walk to Bond street and other parts of London from here were a huge bonus. The lobby doesn't have a great ambiance but the bar has a great vibe and wonderful service and seems to be a hot spot for locals to come and spend time for lunch or evening. Facilities are great in the hotel. Ask for a room as far from a staff elevator as possible. We got a nice suite but next to that elevator and could only sleep from midnight to 7 am. After that it was quite loud and hearing it was not great. Hotel was very understanding about our problem and tried to do their best to fix it. Service is wonderful, great for business travellers as well.",4,2019,12,09
123,A good but problematic stay in a beautiful hotel,"I stayed in the Marleybone with my wife at the end of November .
The hotel is set in a good location just a short walk away from Bond Street tube station. The service levels are excellent from the moment that you check in at reception, during your stay (including dining in the restaurant) and when you check out.
A special mention for Masi who was extremely helpful in sorting out our luggage when we checked out and arranging taxis.
The hotel itself is beautiful and smells amazing (they have a wonderful sent that is circulated through the vents which welcomes you as soon as you come through the doors).

We booked the most basic room which is very small with no views and I would say is only tolerable for a short stay. It is quite expensive for what it is but very standard pricing for high quality London hotels such as the Marleybone. Apart from its size the room itself was pleasantly decorated with modern furnishings and all the room amenities and facilities were of a high standard. The biggest problem that we had with our stay is that the air conditioning unit was leaking badly onto the carpet and was not working properly. We were out for most of the day and when we returned to the room we found a technician had left a roll of silver electrical tape as a legacy of an unsuccessful attempt to rectify the problem. We called down to reception and to the credit of the hotel they immediately sent somebody up to try and rectify the problem and offered to move us to another room. It was too late for us to do so as we just wanted to go to sleep at that stage. A bucket was positioned under the dripping air conditioning unit with a towel in it which did mitigate the inconvenience. The hotel gave us a free breakfast in the morning in recognition of the inconvenience we had suffered which was a kind gesture which we appreciated.
We would definitely stay in the hotel again but would book a bigger room and make sure that there were no problems with the air-conditioning unit this time!",4,2019,12,09
123,"Fantastic location, service, breakfast, tea and cocktails. Cost-effective choice","The Marylebone grows on you. The location is fantastic, and the staff are very helpful (a special mention to Gunther, of whom we are number 1 fans). I love all the places to hang out, including the restaurant and breakfast parlour. Great choice of breakfasts, cocktails and great cream tea.",5,2019,12,09
123,Exceptional service!!,"Gunther and the team at The Marylebone Hotel provide a level of service which is above and beyond.  We found all the staff to be friendly and accommodating.

Tremendous service and staff! Will certainly be returning in future.

123,Wonderful Winter Break,"We have just been fortunate enough to spend a weekend at The Marylebone Hotel. 

What a treat. 

As frequent visitors to London for both business and pleasure my son and I were looking for something that offered boutique luxury at a great price. 

From the experience at check in, which was quick, efficient & friendly, to the wonderful bar manager who encouraged us to end our Saturday evening with a nightcap, the staff were excellent. 

The bar area was particularly lovely, decorated for Christmas, a real fire and great cocktails. 

On Sunday morning we made the mistake of arriving for breakfast a few minutes after it had officially closed. 

However, we were still accommodated and made to feel it was no trouble. 

After a long day on Saturday, mainly shopping, it was most welcome to be able to use the pool and spa area to relax and refresh before heading out for dinner. 

Nothing has been too much trouble. 

I would have no hesitation about staying here again and would like to thank Gunther and his team for making our stay very special. ",5,2019,12,08
123,Hospitality,"Gunter Schildwachter Guest relations.

123,Your best home in London,"The perfect home to enjoy London. 
A boutique hotel that feels like a good home.
I stayed nine perfect days. Many thanks to each person who served us so well.
I am leaving now and want to return on our next vacation!",5,2019,12,08

The service from the hosts at the front desk was fantastic.Specifically Theano gave us some great tips for our London tour, that helped us a lot!!The breakfast was also great and the waiters were very polite! I would definitely stay in that hotel again !!",5,2019,12,06
123,Amazing hotel,"A wonderful hotel in an excellent location (5 minutes walk from Oxford Street). Great costumer Service, staff just can’t do enough for you. Nice refurbished rooms. We and our friends stayed in Deluxe rooms, they were spacious enough and nicely decorated. Lovely and warm sitting areas in the lobby. The 108 Brassiere is a must for lunch or dinner. A special thanks to Gunther, the guest relations manager, who took special care of us. It’s not our first time and definitely not the last time in this very welcoming 
hotel. Can’t wait to come back.

The top highlight is the POOL...!!!! Very clean and comfortable atmosphere..!!
Also the staff was very friendly and helpful, especially ms Theano who helped us a lot with everything.!!!! 
",5,2019,12,06
123,A nice experience once you get your room.,"I have stayed at the Marylebone for many years, but will not be going back. It is a nice facility with clean, comfortable rooms, generally pleasant, good service and a restaurant with good foo. The amenities are fine and I have frequently used the affiliated gym. On this occasion my room was not ready despite the fact that I told them I had just travelled transatlantic overnight and was a 10-year repeat guest. Also, the internet connection was down for several hours.",3,2019,12,04
123,Mazzerati ,"Mr Gunther, relationship mgr, went over and beyond his duties to make sure guests are happy and feel very much at home! Recommend this hotel a thousand times! No better hotel in London. The bar is amazing and the location is hidden yet few minutes walk to oxford street. ",5,2019,12,04
123,Annual General Mtg at the Marylebone ,This year we conducted our AGM at the Marylebone - due to shareholders logging in and watching the meeting online from anywhere in the world we used one of the excellent suites at the Hotel. Bianca Dias was our event Manager and everything was managed perfectly. Before and after the event we conducted meetings and dined in the various restaurants in the establishment. There are many spots to choose in the hotel and the food was exemplary. Our Executives participating in the AGM stayed in-house and enjoyed the rooms and service. We have no hesitation recommending this great hotel and of course returning in due-course. ,5,2019,12,04
123,Exceptional Service,"From the friendly greeting upon arrival to the express checkout, my experience at the Marylebone was top notch. I appreciated the onsite gym, with a wide variety of not just equipment, but classes as well. Food at the hotel restaurant was great, probably the best fish & chips I've had. ",5,2019,12,04
123,Super chic,"I was here for 3nights for a conference (held on premises) and coming in from LA. The sales manager had helped me out with a good deal on the room as part of the conference as well so we were off to a good start already!

From the moment I pulled up in the taxi I knew I had made a good choice! Reception was super friendly and efficient; room was ready at around 3pm. To be honest the room was a little small but this is London and being a work trip I had a budget to adhere too. I had the classic room. It was fine for just me, but had I been there with someone else, a slightly larger room would have been better. Everything about the room was very high quality though. 
The deal included breakfast and this was of a high quality in terms of service, food and atmosphere. Very well looked after in there. 
The attached restaurant was also very pleasant and well attended judging by the beautiful '60s Ferrari parked outside. The hotel bar was well staffed and they knew how to make a good ""old fashioned"" - a good judge of any bar.

One great feature is the hotel's partnership with a gym located in the basement of the hotel - perhaps one of the best I have ever used. Not your typical hotel gym, but a full on cross fit / spin & cardio studio / free weight type. 
Location is ideal too, just a few mins walk from Oxford street, 10mins to Hyde Park (I  was running around it) and close to nearby tubes. There are some great bars and restaurants nearby too. 

Super happy with the stay there. It made the next hotel on my trip seem a little lame...",5,2019,12,03
123,Sophisticated Pick in a Charming Location,"Sophisticated designed-hotel in a very charming, quiet location, steps from Marylebone High Street.  When approaching the building, I was a bit put off by the modern office-like architecture; that was allayed once entering the front door, where you are welcomed by a very intimate, well-appointed decor.  From the inviting bar and living room area to the outstanding 108 Brasserie restaurant the atmosphere is clubby without being stuffy. Loved the fireplace in the living room adjoining the bar area.  The rooms are very comfortable and the bed and linens are top notch.  I was looking for a place that had a fitness center and this did not disappoint.  Access to a full-service, high-end fitness center within the building was a huge plus.  Will definitely stay again on my next trip to London.",5,2019,12,03
123,Always feels like home,"I stopped in London on my way to India and was so glad I did. Staying at the Marylebone after some time made me realize why this is my absolutely favorite hotel anywhere. The upgrades to the rooms are spectacular and the improved amenities truly make this a world class location. The staff did whatever it could to welcome me back, especially Gunther, Maxi and Micheal.  I feel like they are becoming old Friends at this point. I highly recommend the Marylebone for business travel or even a personal trip. ",5,2019,12,02
123,Hotel,"I like the hotel and the staff they are friendly , and we are almost daily because we feel home and happy when we are here , and ( michele ) he is so kind and friendly we like talking with him because he has a good vibe 👍🏻",5,2019,12,02

Hotel was excellent !breakfast had a lot of choices that weren’t just allocated to a buffet !!staff was very friendly and helpful ! Fantastic location ! Especially thanks to theano!!",5,2019,12,02
123,Fantastic hotel for business,"Definitely one of the best hotels in and around Portman Square. The Marylebone is perfect for business travelers due to its location, ideal room size and the bathroom facilities exceeds expectations. It is a short distance away from Oxford Street, Hyde Park and very near as well from Christopher's Place, famous for its concentration of fantastic food outlets.",5,2019,12,02
123,Amazing,"Amazing hotel in one of the best areas in London.
Five minutes away on foot from Oxford street and Bond street underground.!!
Specially thanks to the manager Theano who was very helpful and kind with us ..!!!!",5,2019,12,02
123,Perfect start to London Christmas trip,"We arrived at the Marylebone today 12/1. Exhausted from a long haul flight from USA west coast (on BA first so could be worse!). 
On check in we asked about room upgrades as we reached Discovery black level which offers double upgrade status -on availability. Well this is is a super popular property so it’s of course sold out at a busy time like this, so no rooms to upgrade to. 
The staff has bent over backwards to do whatever possible to make our stay as special as possible in any case. We were placed in the best available room in the class we reserved. Newly remodeled, top floor, an upgrade in my book. 
Shortly after we entered our room, a complimentary bottle of wine arrived!
After freshening up, we stepped outside to see the London Christmas lights coming on and wandered the neighborhood.
This hotel is smack dab in the middle of a fantastic shopping and dining neighborhood. Tons of little shops, classic pubs and diverse fine dining. Never seen such high density of restaurants, competition must be brutal. Not to mention the 108 restaurant in the hotel itself (but that’s another review). 
And surprisingly just a block away is Bond street and there was major Dept. Store shopping at Selfridges etc. 
So just a day in and we’re in love with this hotel, which is saying a lot as our first loves in London have been other Doyle properties - namely the Kensington (where we will be in a few days). And also the Bloomsbury. 
The room is very comfortable, large for London, quiet, and well appointed. 
Staff have all been super polite and helpful. Can’t recommend enough. Stay here!

123,Always a perfect stay,"I look forward to each stay at Marylebone Hotel. I have been a regular guest for past 10 years returning because of great service and hospitality at all levels. The lobby, the bar and restaurant are very inviting and warm. Perfect to grab a drink. Location is perfect , close to all shopping on Oxford street , central but not on a busy street . Close to the hotel, there is many great restaurants to choose . Rooms are classic and inviting with comfy beds.

123,Recovery after surgery,"We were there for a week, following my husband's knee surgery, which was performed just round the corner, and having to do a follow up with the consultant a few days later. It was a convalescent stay. Everyone was very helpful and that made the stay ""enjoyable"" for us. Godwin deserves special mention. Nothing was too much for him. Housekeeping was very helpful too. 
 Many thanks to them and everyone there. 
It's a great hotel in a very convenient location. Next time we hope to see more of London and the shopping!",5,2019,11,29
123,Welcoming stay ,"Having stayed here 4-5 times over the last few years the service seems to get better and better. The newly refurbished rooms are refreshing and vibrant, and the quality of service is always so personal. Gunther and the whole team are always so welcoming. ",5,2019,11,28
123,Always fantastic service,"I stay here every time I visit London, some 5-7 times a year and have done so for more than 5 years. The team are always attentive and Gunther, the Guest Services Manager  is always on hand to help with any needs. It’s a great hotel in such a central part of a London village that so many don’t even know exists. Highly recommended.",5,2019,11,28
123,Over rated on Trip Advisor,"This is an average hotel very well located next to Bond Street. I booked it due to the great reviews on trip advisor but felt a bit let down.

The rooms are too small (we had booked a king room) and the bathrooms are of extremely small size. Furniture and fittings are good in the room but the size is too small for the room to be comfortable - they may as well get rid of some of the furniture in the room so that theres some space.

Staff are friendly; gym is well equipped & pool is very average.",3,2019,11,27
123,Amazing place,I’ve been coming here for a while and everyone is very welcoming here. The bartender Michele is one of the best people working there offering us what we need always with a smile. I’d always recommend this place for people to stay at for a drink or a coffee,5,2019,11,27
123,"Charming, cosy & in the heart of London",A really nice place to stay. The room's are very spacious & comfortable. Entertainment system is quite up to date and modern with chrome cast and big flat screen's in the rooms. The decor throughout the hotel is authentic to the area and inspires a level of class. The real charm is not only in it's location and the aesthetic look of the hotel but the wonderful staff who provide excellent service throughout. It really induced a sense of comfort and relaxation while I was on a five day business trip. ,5,2019,11,27
123,This hotel is next level,"We started our 2 week Europe trip in London at the Marylebone.  After a 10 hour flight, we were exhausted and ready to get our room when we arrived shortly after check-in time.  Our room wasn't quite ready, but the Front Office Manager let us know it would only be 10 - 15 minutes and offered to comp our first round of drinks at the bar which we were very appreciative of.  

The bar in itself is a reason to stay at this hotel.  The staff are all amazing, and the cocktail selection is so good! The atmosphere is also great and makes you feel at home.  

The location is also perfect.  Very close to a few Tube stations, and easy walking distance to so much!  We never had to worry about finding a cab if needed as well as they were always out front.  

I can't say enough good things about this hotel.  Be sure to stay here next time you're in London!",5,2019,11,26
123,What a hotel,"100% will be back. Fabulous hotel, attention to detail from start to finish.

Highly recommended. 

Fabulous location so near Bond Street tube so you’re in the thick of it all too.

Prebooked quite early so £240 bed only.
",5,2019,11,25
123,Outstanding,"On arrival, and throughout my stay at the hotel, the staff members made sure that everything was as comforting and as convenient as possible! From the room service to the exceptional restaurant, the Marylebone deserves all five stars of which they acquired.",5,2019,11,24
123,Great hotel. I liked everything. ,"I liked everything about this hotel. It is quiet, clean and comfortable. The hotel has a cozy atmosphere. Rooms are a bit small, but this is London.  Corridors need a bit of a facelift with a fresh and brighter coat of paint and a new carpet. 

The staff are friendly and hospitable, and try to be helpful. Breakfast is excellent and quite reasonably priced for London. Wifi connectivity was great. The concierge can arrange airport pickup and drop off for £70-80, which is much cheaper than via regular cabs. 

The hotel itself is a 10 -15 minute walk to Oxford Street and Regent Street, and is very conveniently located. 

One small incident- there was no hot water one morning. The hotel made up for it with complimentary breakfast which I thought was great. 

So overall a very good experience.  ",5,2019,11,24
123,Great hotel bar! ,Been visiting the hotel bar for some time now and is definitely one of my go-to places in the area. Great for some drinks and a chilled night out. The service is always great from Michele and the rest of the bartenders. Highly recommend!,5,2019,11,23
123,Hotel really understands hospitality,"The Marylebone Hotel really achieves an overall  level of service and hospitality not found very often in a big city.

123,Great property and wonderful beds (no matter where you are)!,"Good spot in the NW not too far from the City Airport just 5 min walk after the Bond drop off. Got in a bit late on a Sunday so were thrilled that their restaurant was open late - because NOBODY else's was. 

It isn't the cheapest, but nothing really is in London.

Nice spot all around.",4,2019,11,18
123,Weekend retreat,"Our boiler had packed in. In need of respite from the cold my girlfriend booked a room for us both to spend a Saturday night here. It was great. 
The cocktail bar is wonderfully staffed and beautifully put together. The menu of available drinks is wide and solid. 
We had dinner in the 108 brasserie and weren't disappointed. Really enjoyable fillet steak, perfectly cooked. Very good staff, neither in your face or overly attentive. A great balance of politeness and charisma",5,2019,11,17
123,Wonderful Stay,"Lovely hotel in the heart of Marylebone. Rooms are plush which elegant furnishings and the beds are super comfortable. The service in the hotel was very good and the breakfast was stunning - great choices on the buffet and the main menu. Also there are some very nice spaces to lounge over  evening drinks. 
There is access to a state of the art health club with excellent gym, pool, sauna and stream. Quite busy at peak times, but worth a visit. 
We will most certainly return to the hotel in the near future. Thank you again. ",5,2019,11,17
123,The week in London,"The Marylebone was amazing. The location was perfect, the breakfast was delicious, and the staff was so attentive. Loved the doorman. It was everything I had dreamed of dor my first visit to London!!!",5,2019,11,16
123,Best hotel ,My Mum and I have just got back from staying at the Marylebone hotel celebrating my birthday. The minute we arrived we were greeted with a warm welcome and got handed umbrellas as it was raining outside. The doormen were so incredibly friendly and always willing to help throughout our stay. Breakfast was lovely and we were both very pleased with the service. Third Space facility which includes a swimming pool was very useful and came in handy a great destination to wind down after a long day. What made our stay so memorable and special was the treats and a bottle of Prosecco that got sent up to our room on the evening we arrived which we both were very appreciative for and the doormen who went out their way and made sure we were looked after. Overall I would highly recommend this hotel for anyone who’s looking to stay in London and will definitely be back! ,5,2019,11,14
123,It’s Xmas at The Marylebone Hotel,"Arrived this afternoon, Thelma, Victoria and Antje gave me a lovely warm greeting, placed me in a fabulous room (recently beautifully upgraded, new everything) and were all smiles as the Xmas tree has arrived in reception!

Thank you for upgraded us and for the welcome board in our room was a lovely touch.
We had a small issue in the room and when we called the reception Ms.Theano K.was very prompted to resolved it, we are very thankfulled with her.
The next day we asked if we can visit the terrace suite as in our first time the 7th floor was in refurbishment , so Gunther S. Without doubts accompanied us also he remembered us from our last visit (very good memory:) ). He explained every detail of this room ,in addition he recommended when is the best time to enjoy the terrace!
Thank you to all the staff specially to the porters Masi & the Hungarian guy(don't remember his name) they make you feel very welcome since they open door!",5,2019,11,12

123,Great service!,"We checked in late at night and they were happy to see us!
Andrei the doorman was the nicest and always had a smile.
He was willing to do anything for us!
The room was small, but the service was huge!",4,2019,11,10
123,Perfect Location,Stayed in marylebone for a weekend it was the perfect location within walking distance to everything. Lovely hotel staff were especially helpful at the desk. The room would be spotless the cleaners do a fantastic job even folding clothes that had been left out. The only thing that could do with improvement would be the breakfast. We ordered eggs benedict and eggs florentine the first day and struggled to eat it. It had clearly been sitting out for a while before we got it and the bread was very dissapointing Other than that had a great stay.,4,2019,11,10
123,Another fabulous stay!,"This was our second visit to The Marylebone Hotel with our two small children. We all had a great time. Everything is taken care of by the wonderful staff who really make you feel at home in a lovely accessible part of London. The rooms were immaculate, food and drink absolutely delicious and the service is super - special thanks to Masi and Andre who were so welcoming to the little ones. Hopefully we will have an opportunity to go back.",5,2019,11,09
123,Nice hotel but hit or miss on quality.,"I stayed at this hotel in October and wrote a bad review. They were kind enough to offer a complimentary night to make up for the poor conditions of the first room. So last night I took them up on their offer and the room was much better. Interestingly it was the same room in the picture that I thought I was renting the first time. Never the less the service was superb, as it was the first time. and there is a good chance that I will stay there again in the future.
If you want quiet ask for an inside room. If you want a view then ask for an outside room. Our second room was at the front of the hotel overlooking the street, but in this neighborhood that is not a problem. It was also on the 7th floor so had views of more than just the buildings opposite.",5,2019,11,06
123,Great Service Hotel Porter,Andrei was very attentive and provided great service. Checked in with us to make sure our stay was going well because our water was not very hot in the room. The back bar had an amazing waiter/bartender that created special drinks just for us. Didn't get his name but we was super nice. Even provided a small gift when we left. Thank you,4,2019,11,06
123,Cocktails made with love!,"Me and my friends went there to have a few birthday cocktails and had the best time! 
Michele the bartender gave us great advice for the choice of our drinks and even tailored most of mine!  Lovely atmosphere and great service! We had a blast ! Thank you 😊",5,2019,11,05
123,Perfect business trip,"Very cosy, boutiqish hotel in the center of Marylebone. Once there, the stuff knows you by heart and the welcome is warm and friendly. There interior is a blast.
Some of the rooms are rather small, and cornered so take care. However, the Level 3 fitness, bar and near by amenities are unique",4,2019,11,05
123,Laughable Marylebone London Welbeck Astrolog.,"It’s November. At 3 am I figure out AC is not working in my room. I call reception desk, phone was not working. I go down. “Yes sir we’ll do our best”. 
At 4pm my room it’s still freezing and they still are doing it’s best. Laughable.",1,2019,11,05
123,Great experience,"I really recommend the Marylebone Hotel specially the bar called Lobby Bar it was really mesmerising, we spent the whole afternoon there with my partner, the staff were really nice, specially the waitress called Ildiko she was super professional, she was really funny, respectful I really enjoyed being served by her! I can only recommend it!",5,2019,11,05
123,Perfect location for a weekend in london,"Perfect location - luxurious recently refurbished rooms - staff could not have been more helpful during the stay- lovely Lobby bar and a stunning restaurant /bar at back of hotel with outdoor terrace onto cobbled pedestrian streets - perfect location for shopping,dining etc etc!",5,2019,11,04
123,Staying at the Marylebone,I use the hotel regularly when visiting London. The rooms are very well appointed and the service is excellent throughout. The location is excellent for both Marylebone and the wider West End and the hotel has a swimming pool and avery popular wine bar.,5,2019,11,04
123,Superb Location and Staff Amazing,We  returned to the Marylebone and got an amazing welcome from the Doorman and Toby at the front desk. Caroline and the team do a fantastic job at welcoming guests as they arrive. The follow up service during our stay was equally impressive from the breakfast staff to Andrei at the entrance. Having a gym and pool of the quality that they have is an excellent bonus for such a central location. Breakfast was top class and hard to beat for quality. Toby did an amazing job at making sure we were looked after from start to finish - again !! We will be back....,5,2019,11,04
123,Prime location,"It was the first time that I stayed in this hotel. Although it was very short, I simply enjoyed it, especially the bed and the pillows, so comfortable. The only watch-out is that there was a long queue at the breakfast area in the morning, all of us waited to be seated by the hotel staff. Anyway, all was compensated by the excellent location of the hotel and easy access to all important sites in London. ",5,2019,11,03
123,Underwhelming for a seasoned traveler......,"Maybe I'm spoiled having stayed in hotels on business trips all over the world but after the initial delight of the hotel's little cosy public spaces - the bar, restaurants, lounge etc the rest of the hotel is a poorly lit warren of little rooms with uninspired decor where one can barely swing a cat and even tinier bathrooms. After all the hype from this site I actually burst out laughing when i entered my room. This hotel's rooms are designed for just for sleeping - this is not a place where you hole up and luxuriate in your room - unless claustrophobia is your thing. Based on reviews i seen I'm inclined to believe London travelers just have really low expectations. For a little bit more I'd advise Hotel Cafe Royal - similar location, lovely large standard rooms that you really want to spend time in",3,2019,11,02
123,Wonderful hotel,"Wonderful hotel with great location, very kind and professional staff with excellent service. Amazing amenities (spa and pool !), cosy cocktail bar with beautiful interior design. Definitely a gem in the middle of the charming Marylebone. ",5,2019,11,01
123,Drinks,"I’ve been there with my friends having a few drinks and they were  amazing, and Aurelian was even better than the drinks.  
 We will come back for sure just because of the amazing staff in there.
Very good job guys",5,2019,11,01
123,"Excellent hotel in lovely ""village"" neighbourhood","Lovely property with incredibly large spa / gym / swimming pool.
Great restaurant and public areas to relax in.
Stylish and highly recommended.
Marylebone is a great area to walk around with individual stores/boutiques but still only a few minutes walk to Oxford Street.",5,2019,11,01
123,Marvellous Marylebone,"Would highly recommend a stay at this fabulous hotel. Every time we visit it gets better and better. From the exceptional welcome the moment you arrive through the door (special mention to Gunther who went out of his way to ensure we had an amazing stay), to the gorgeous bedrooms with views of beautiful London streets. The beds are so comfy that I had to check the mattress brand (Kaymed). All the rooms have irons and ironing boards (essential for me) and a little Nespresso machine and kettle. The bathrooms are well stocked with high end products. Breakfast is a highlight especially as so many courses are served. The breakfast room is a warm and inviting space to relax in first thing in the morning. There are a number of different bar options and they seem to serve a little bit later than in the past which is great for a nitecap after dinner. Other highlights include the spa, pool and gym areas with extended opening hours. 

The location is second to none. So convenient for exploring the city. Walking distance to Regents Park, Hyde Park, Bond St, Regent St etc. Close to Mayfair for dinner and not too far from a number of Tube Stations (Bond, Baker St). 

All in all, I can’t say enough good things about this hotel, but if I was to pick one thing it is the friendly staff. They make all the difference. Thank you so much Gunther and team. We can’t wait to come back! ",5,2019,10,31

123,Best Hotel of My Life,"I'm writing this review a year later, mostly because I forgot, but also because it was that good I couldn't let it go without giving them a shoutout. Truly excellent service, beautiful rooms, and a perfect location to explore lots of London. 

I was there for a work trip and my fiance came at the end - the hotel set her up nicely in the attached bar and was exceptionally polite and accommodating, even taking her luggage up to the room while I was still stuck on my way back in traffic. 

If you're a fellow American, you will be blown over by the level of service and warmth here. 

HUGE shout to Godwin, who was helping out and working the door most of my stay - he is truly a ray of sunshine and was incredibly helpful.",5,2019,10,30
123,Super location ,"This hotel is in a super location with easy access to shopping, restaurants, transport links. Examples : Selfridges is a 10 minute walk, Bond Street tube station also 10 mins away and if you fancy a walk you’ll get to Harrods in 45 mins. 

Lots of super shops and restaurants ( ivy cafe for breakfast/ locando Locatelli for dinner ) on the doorstep. 

Rooms are small but the location is a winner. Staffed by super helpful people who are happy to help with directions, taxis etc.

Happily recommend.",4,2019,10,30
123,Another exceptional stay at this wonderful hotel,"Our hotel of choice whenever we visit London. Service is exceptional- warm, friendly & personal. Staff are a pleasure everywhere in the hotel. Know some on 1st name terms. Guest relations manager Gunther in particular couldn’t be more helpful. Nothing is too much trouble. New bar at the front of the hotel is really nice and makes for a cozy pre/post dinner drink or cocktail not to mention the fabulous outdoor heated terrace and lively bar downstairs. Breakfast is a highlight. Rooms recently refurbished are great, beds beyond comfy. Marble bathrooms. Malin & Goetz toiletries. Evening turndown (a big thing for me) with water & chocolates. Signature scent amazing. Cannot recommend this hotel highly enough. It brings service & hospitality to another level. Already looking forward to  our next stay. ",5,2019,10,29
123,Service Above expectations,"We arrived early morning and expecting to hear we can keep your bags until the room is ready at 2 pm ,instead the friendly receptionist Toby told us that our room is not ready but we can give another room until your luxury room Is ready and after traveling for 17 hours on the Dreamliner that was music to our ears ,that night we went to the 108 brassiere the food and service was amazing .We finished with cocktails in the hotel bar which we were greeted by MIchele he recommended some cocktails which were the best highly  recommended  .",5,2019,10,29
123,"Perfect Location, Cozy Hotel","This hotel is perfectly placed to enjoy Marylebone - feels like a village in London - but also a stroll away from Regent street, Soho and Mayfair. Rooms are great, comfy beds, marble bathrooms with Malin Goetz toiletries [I've since purchased the shampoo & conditioner!].  The highlight for us is the bar - so cozy at night or the gorgeous terrace on a sunny day.  Service is exemplary - we decided to stay put one evening and worked our way through their snack menu.  Breakfast is great - huge choice.  Really can't go wrong if  you stay here.  Feels more personal than a lot of the bigger hotels - that's something we like a lot!  We've been back!",5,2019,10,29
123,An oasis of charm and superb service,"We recently booked The Marylebone for our 25th anniversary of being partnered together. It was a terrible day's weather when we arrived; but from the moment the doormen greeted us warmly to the moment we left, we were given excellent service and hospitality at this delightful, stylish contemporary hotel. We chose it as it was so conveniently located in Marylebone and to the lovely villagey feel of the area. The hotel noted our special anniversary celebration and a bottle of fizz had been left chilling in our 5th floor room. for us to enjoy later. We were made to feel like VIP guests and all the staff were extremely friendly and very sociable. Breakfast the following day was delicious, freshly cooked and plentiful.It was a delight to stay here and we shall definitely chose this as our overnight hotel of choice, when staying in Central London from now on. Cannot recommend it highly enough.",5,2019,10,29
123,Great stay,"We had a great day at the Marley bone, the staff is super friendly and the location is amazing just a couple blocks off Oxford Street. We could walk pretty much anywhere. The rooms were clean and bright the bathroom is really lovely. My room happen to be next to the staff elevator which wasn’t perfect but I wasn’t in the room too much and I slept through it at night anyway.

All in all a perfectly great stay and I will definitely be back!",5,2019,10,28
123,Excellent Hotel,"This hotel was exceptional.  Every aspect of the hotel was wonderful and exceeded my expectations throughout my stay.  The full staff couldn't have been more kind and accommodating from check-in to check-out; specifically noting the Concierge, Michal Lebek, who's insight and guidance helped plan many aspects of my trip.  I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone.  ",5,2019,10,27
123,Wonderful night at the Marylebone,"We had a wonderful stay at the Marylebone hotel,
 the food was very nice.
Andrei the door guy was especially helpful and made us feel so welcome. Would definitely stay again the staff at this hotel where all amazing",5,2019,10,27
123,Exceptional experience at The Marylebone,"I stayed with my family at The Marylebone for an extended weekend. Great hotel experience, wonderful staff, great atmosphere and everything around the hotel exceeded all expectations. Looking forward visiting again as soon as possible. Will surely recommend The Marylebone to everyone. ",5,2019,10,26
123,Regular visitor here,"Lovely hotel, great location, great specs. Clean and well decorated. Smells amazing always. 
But the best thing about this hotel is the boutique feel, with staff that greet you from the moment you enter, to checkout. I am even on first name terms with many staff! Evening turn down service with water and chocolates. Nothing is ever too much trouble. I also stay here with my family by choice when I’m not on business. Highly recommended.",5,2019,10,26
123,Fantastic Venue for my Birthday celebrations,"I love the Marylebone Hotel with it's boutique style and variety of bars and lounges along with it's great atmosphere.  I booked Number Six, the beautiful private dining room and bar for a special Birthday celebration with 40 friends - the team looked after us extremely well and it was a great success.  From Cristina in the Meetings & Events team whose planning prior to the event was excellent.  To Gergo, the Banqueting Manager, and his team, in particular Poh, for looking after us so well on the day - attentive and efficient service.  The venue, food and service were all excellent and I would highly recommend.",5,2019,10,25
123,From the moment I arived to the moment I left,"Everything was exceptional, thank you so much. As soon as I arrived at the lobby, nothing was too much trouble. The staff would always greet me with a smile and say hello, the food was fantastic and the services were first class. Thank You!",5,2019,10,25
123,Continuing Excellence -- Another Great Stay,"I have written before about my London ""home away from home"", which is The Marylebone. I have just spent another month at the hotel, and, as always, it was as close to perfection as one could expect.

The staff is the ""jewel in the crown"" of this lovely, centrally located, incredibly well run property. I was in the hotel business for a decade, which makes me quite particular about rooms, amenities and the like -- but I remain convinced the attitude of staff underpins everything. All the ""bells and whistles"" on earth cannot compensate for poor service or a surly attitude, and we all know even one poor encounter can color one's view of a hotel. Once again, in an entire month, when I must be been in contact with someone from every department, I never encountered a Marylebone staffer who was not polite, helpful and cheerful. This means everything.",5,2019,10,24
123,My stay at the Marylebone Hotel,"Just got back from London and stayed at the Marylebone Hotel.   We received a warm welcome.  Upon checking in, they immediately advised me of an upgrade to one of their larger rooms at no extra cost to me.  We arrived early and were allowed to access the room right away, which was really nice since we had been up about 24 hours.

Our stay was exceptional.  The staff is simple incredible.  Polite, friendly, helpful, courteous and utmost professional and caring.   A special thanks to Gunther, who made sure we were extremely satisfied.   Andrei, who greets everyone at the front door is fantastic.  What a perfect fit for the hotel to have somebody like Andrei be the person that makes the initial first impression.

Every evening, we would have a nightcap at the bar.  The bar is unique in that just a few seats at the bar, but then cozy areas surround the bar, so if one is with their significant other, or those that need can conduct business can do so in more of a private setting.  The bartenders and bar manager were simply fantastic and entertaining and indulged our questions as we watched them do their magic.  They make cocktails as if they were doctors performing surgery.   ""Mr Grumpy"" and ""Mr. Smiley"" were off the charts in entertaining us.

The hotel is in one of the best locations in London.  There are literally hundreds of great places to dine or have a pint within minutes of the hotel.  Oxford and Regent Street are literally a few minute walk away.

A thanks to the entire staff of the Marylebone for making our special trip(my son got married) one of the best experiences of my life.",5,2019,10,24
123,Business and pleasure,This is a really comfortable hotel in a great area.  The staff are helpful and the food delicious.  The Marylebone is an excellent choice for business in the city while being close to the shopping districts and easy access to the train stations.  Would highly recommend it!,5,2019,10,22
123,A stylisch hotel in a trendy area that will fit you like a glove,"Stayed here for the second time, so my review is based on more stays. Welcoming check-in, a very nice hotel bar and restaurant where they service you in every possible way. The rooms are spacious for the London area, very comfortable and come with everything you need and more. Minibar serves you with instant needs, bathroom is warm and comfortable and the breakfast is great. I can recommend this hotel for sure.",5,2019,10,21
123,Fabulous,"Absolutely fabulous hotel, couldn’t fault it. Amazing service. All the staff couldn’t of been more helpful. The doorman andrei definitely made the stay for us though  ❤️ Definitely one of top highlights of our stay even the trip I’d go as far to say lovely guy! Couldn’t of done more for us, give us great advice on best places to go and takes a great photograph 😂",5,2019,10,20
123,Wonderful Hotel 💛,"I spent 10 days here for work and looked forward to coming back each day. The room was very cosy and staff were very helpful to assist with my bag each time I returned. The location is perfect. Very central as I was able to walk everywhere. If you don’t want to go out, there is a great breakfast cafe, lunch and or dinner/drinks right in the hotel are very nice. I loved the cosy fireplaces they had throughout the bar area. I didn’t use the gym but from what I saw it looked amazing. Room service was also prompt and delicious. Everyone in the US told me that the food in England was terrible. The food and drinks at the Marylebone were delicious! My only drawback was the shower, the door would push water all over the floor which was a bit annoying, but I didn’t spend much time in the bathroom so it didn’t ruin my stay. I’d be happy to stay here again when I return to London. 🇬🇧😋",5,2019,10,20
123,Great stay!,"We had a wonderful 4 night stay at the Marleybone Hotel. While we are sad we didn't take advantage of the spa or gym amenities or even ever make it to the rooftop for a cocktail, we had a wonderful sleep in our room, as well as great meals at 108 Brasserie & definitely enjoyed being able to walk to so many places as this hotel is a GREAT location to explore the many sights London has to offer. 

The staff was awesome - not over the top, but attentive to your needs if you requested something. The turn down service was our favorite part of the day as we received different little surprises each night from a sleeping kit with an eye mask & lavender sleep balm to a Gin cocktail kit for 2. 

We ordered room service a few times during our stay and the efficiency & accuracy was by far the best I've had in a long time. 

The only issue we ran into, which I can probably blame on user error, was the lighting system in the room. We could not figure out how to turn lights on in different zones of our room. It was either all or nothing, which made it interesting when my husband was still sleeping in the morning and I was getting up & starting my day. 

Overall, great experience, great location, & great atmosphere & staff. I am actually a travel agent, so I make my way around the world spending time at different hotels of various ratings to have my ""go-to's"" in cities all around the globe. For a client that is not looking to spend $700+ a night in London for a standard room like they would at Claridges or the Connaught, the Marleybone is a centrally-located, beautiful alternative. ",5,2019,10,20
123,Very enjoyable!,"Very friendly and helpful staff. The cocktail bar staff were very friendly and helpful - made me feel welcomed
The location is great - right in the heart of Marylebone and close to many good restaurants.
My room, although a bit small, it was well furnished and clean, with all you really need.
",5,2019,10,20
123,Great hotel and service,"Very friendly and attentive staff and great quality hotel. Masi and his colleagues went the extra mile :)  

I see that tripadvisor now require at least 200 letters for writing a review which doesnt make sense when doing it on the fly on your phone.",5,2019,10,20
123,Ammazing place,"Cosy atmosphere ,the staff are very friendly and professional esspecialy in the lobby bar Andras the bar tender who makes my day.
 One place you must to try if you visit this beautiful city.
 I'll bring my friends here If I visit London again.",5,2019,10,20
123,Andrei was awesome! ,"My boyfriend and I stayed at the Marylebone hotel from Tuesday the 15th to today the 20th and everyone was extremely nice and hospitable, especially Andrei the bell man. He remembered us each day and always helped out with everything, from bags to getting into Uber or taxi to telling us where we should go visit and he was just really nice to talk to!! He made our stay so easy. Thanks Andrei we will surely be back! ",5,2019,10,20
123,Home from Home,"I stayed here with my partner last weekend as a last minute stay and I have never been so delighted to write a review about a hotel. The service was absolutely impeccable, down to the amazing doormen at the front, to the welcome desk, and the waitresses and waiters in the 108 brasserie, they were all amazing. I have stayed in the Burj al Arab in Dubai many times and this hotel topped it by a mile...That much that we stayed the night again 5 days later (Thursday night). The beds are heaven, when I got home I hated my own bed. The room service, food, drinks, even the scented candles throughout the hotel. Me and my partner will be staying here more often, in fact we will be only staying here when we come to London! Bathrooms are a little on the small side, but that’s my only critique. Also thanks for the room upgrade, very sweet of you! I can’t wait to be ‘welcomed home’ again! ",5,2019,10,19
123,Horrible ,"First the nice part:
Area is pleasant and central 
Pool is clean and good sized 
Nice bar and restaurant 

Everything else is a joke - and an expensive one at that 
Shoebox sized room not particularly clean 
For usd 300 per night?
Outdated 1980s accessories - no US outlet etc 
Microscopic bath room 
Pool and gym close at 7pm on the weekend?
Unmotivated personnel 
Feels like some private equity shop 
If you can pop a few hundred I suggest you get yourself a real place next time 
",1,2019,10,19
123,Great spot,"Wonderful hotel with excellent service. Ask for Andras at the bar, he personally will make sure you have a special stay. Great attention to detail and friendly, Andras knew my order by heart on day 2. Thanks again.",5,2019,10,19
123,Mummy and Daughter stay,"My 7 year old daughter and I had a wonderful stay at the hotel! We were made to feel very welcome by all the staff. They went above and beyond with all the treats provided  for my daughter in our room and we will definitely be returning for our annual mummy daughter day! We made use of the lovely pool which allowed children to use between 10-12. We also had dinner within the hotel at the brasserie which was very tasty and also had a children’s menu. The turn down service was a nice touch providing milk and cookies which my daughter was very excited about! 
The hotel is in a lovely part of town and I would highly recommended staying here with children.",5,2019,10,19
123,Just a great hotel with great staff,"This hotel continues to impress every time I stay. The staff aim to make the experience personal, remember your name and personal likes. The atmosphere is great and it is just a relaxing place to be after busy days at work. The breakfast is also amazing.",5,2019,10,18
123,Friends wedding in London ,"Booked this hotel and expected a lot more than I got. I arrived with my husband only to be kept at reception for 30 minutes while three staff members tried to process my reservation. I had a company discount to use at the hotel and it wasn't difficult to understand yet for some reason three staff members couldn't comprehend the information on my reservation form. Finally one of the staff members approached me and said that he'll ""do me a favour"" and honour my discount which I found insulting because my discount was genuine and valid. Another staff member took 3+ times to process the charge for the room and at one point she tried to charge me 1200 pound for a 200 pound reservation. When I finally got to our room I was not impressed. It was small, cramped and not what I've come to expect from a 4 star hotel. The decor was dated and definitely in need of an upgrade. I certainly won't return and I will NOT recommend to anyone. And, I will not choose this hotel again for company use, given the way I was treated at front desk. ",3,2019,10,18
123,Exceptional service from lounge bar staff,"The lounge bar staff seem to always be able to make your day a little better whether it be with simple smile or a little banter to start your day right . The professionalism of the waiting staff Andras in particular is always above bar, very attentive and diligent. Thank you Marylebone!",5,2019,10,18
123,In a league of their own,"After a very early flight to London and a long day of meetings, I checked in at reception late in the evening only to discover I was booked in for the wrong dates. Cue panic and horror!

Guest relations manager Gunther saved the day and was calm, reassuring and delivered the most incredible customer service I’ve ever experienced in hospitality. A true five star service. Gunther not only found me a room in the inn but generously upgraded me to an available suite. I don’t know how I’ll ever go back!

As a regular guest in this hotel I’ve always been impressed with my stays at The Marleybone. From corporate bookings via the reservation team, the warm welcome on arrival by concierge and guest relations, all round friendly service; but this stay was in a league of its own. As was the suite! 

Thank you Gunther and the marvellous Marleybone team for exceeding all of my expectations and making this a memorable stay. 

Looking forward to my trip back next week already!

All my thanks,
Sandra",5,2019,10,16
123,Great bar,"I heard lots of good review from Lobby bar from my friends, so We went there to try it with my girlfriend. We had an amazing afternoon in the bar, because our waitress Ildiko gave us excellent service and she was very friendly and professional. The bar is really nice and the food is great. We will come back next time and I recommend for everyone who want to spend great time there.",5,2019,10,16
123,"Clean, well located hotel.","Stayed here as going to a show nearby.  Very attentive staff who couldn’t do enough for us. Great bar and comfortable room. My only disappointment was the size of the bathroom, it was tiny. You couldn’t get two people in the bathroom at the same time. The room was also small compared to other London hotels I’ve stayed in. Value wise I think a Premier Inn would give you more space and the bathroom is twice the size. Would I stay again? For the price probably not,  for the service definitely.",4,2019,10,16
123,Excellent Hotel,"I've been staying at the Marylebone every year for the past 6 years for business.  The hotel is clean and in a great location next to 3 good restaurants.  The 108 restaurant in the hotel has great food as well.  Lobby bar upgraded over past couple years.  The staff is friendly and accommodating - ask for Gunther, he's the man!  I stay for business but I would definitely bring my family here for a personal trip.",5,2019,10,15
123,No complaints whatsoever! Perfect place to stay at in London. ,"Everything about this hotel is as good as the reviews report. The staff are the gem that make it a great place. Everyone is friendly and very professional. The rooms very clean. The location is also perfect to reach many attractions and places to see around town. The small things too were the cherry on top. Loved it, would definitely stay at the Marylebone again and again. ",5,2019,10,15
123,Fabulous Hotel,"I cannot recommend this hotel enough. The location is ideal for central London, it's a short ten minute walk from Bond Street tube station. We were a family of four , the family room was a great size, the kids loved the swimming pool. The food was wonderful. Every single member of staff made us feel welcome, they were all friendly, professional and incredibly helpful. We will definitely be back.",5,2019,10,15
123,Hidden treasure,"We have stayed here several times in the last few months. The rooms have always come up to expectation and all the staff we have met are both charming and very friendly. Housekeeping very good.
There was a small problem with the air conditioning in our room on the last visit but the Guest Relations manager managed to move us to an upgrade room with a basket of fruit and a bottle of wine! That's called great service.",5,2019,10,15
123,-,"Perfect venue for a Saturday night in London. Super-friendly service from all the staff we met, particularly the Guest Relations Manager, Gunther, who checked us in. There was an issue with a request made with our reservation which Gunther dealt with practically and gave us a very nice room as a result. We would definitely stay here again.",5,2019,10,15
123,Fantastic hotel in the heart of Marylebone!,"We have previously stayed at one of the ""grand"" hotels in London. My wife stumbled upon the Marylebone in a search online, and we decided to give it a try on our recent visit. We are SO happy we did! From the moment we were greeted at the curb by a smiling bellman looking smart in his tweed suit and overcoat, to the equally smart and friendly front desk staff, to the beautiful lobby, and up to the beautifully-appointed rooms, everything is in perfect order here! This may be down to the capable leadership of Gunther, the friendly and charming guest relations manager whom we had a chance to meet early in our 3-day stay. Gunther makes one feel like family, and his staff, from the curbside to the restaurants to the housekeepers and everywhere in between, were superb. Don't miss the beautiful Brasserie for breakfast, lunch, dinner or afternoon tea; sitting outside watching ""London"" go by was a real treat. Location is wonderful; quiet, yet within a few blocks of the High Street and it's fantastic pubs, restaurants, and shops. 5 Stars for sure, and we can't wait to return next year!",5,2019,10,14
123,Hotel Revisited,"Met with Gunter Guest relations manager and showed the excellent refurbishment program at the hotel 
Gunter has put my wife and I into an excellent room 
So thank you all at The Marylebone for what I’m sure will be a great stay

123,"Great hotel and location, better staff!","On my 25th day of 28 abroad, I checked into the Marylebone. This was my 10th hotel and while I have no complaints about any of them, the people at The Marylebone made it stand out for me. 

The room itself was great, a junior suite with plenty of room to relax and a nice view  of the neighboring skyline. The location is fantastic with so many directions you can walk and eat or shop. 

All of that is secondary to being made to feel important upon contact with any staff member, no matter their job. I want to single out Godwin on the bell desk (not sure what they call it here) who helped me square away my bags and Gunther who I felt like was a manager of reception. He could tell I was beat up and went out of his way to take care of me and got me into my room early. Andrei at the door was the best in all my travels. He had fantastic suggestions and somehow remembered my name several hours later and for the entire trip. He took good care of my lady when she needed help with her bags later and somehow gave her impression I was important! Winning. 

I realize most of this sounds like nice hotel and good people and I didn’t need all the words. But these 3 guys and everyone else made me feel like I personally mattered to them and it wasn’t just part of their job. And for that I will definitely be back. ",5,2019,10,14
123,Beautiful events space with absolutely incredible staff!,"I recently organised a private dinner at The Marylebone, and everybody was absolutely thrilled with the space and overall experience. It's a beautiful art deco venue that manages to feel incredibly special without being too fussy.

The Courtyard and Blue rooms are stunning, and the team looked after us so well. Huge thanks to Cristina for helping us from start to finish, and for Otto and Gergo for their amazing help on the night. So professional, friendly and just the right balance. 

Thanks again!

Good location, close to important sights of the city , in quite area.",5,2019,10,14
123,Fabulous Wedding Venue,"We stayed at this hotel and then had our wedding reception here on Saturday. It was fantastic.  A lovely hotel in a great location but the staff made this an exceptional visit.  Everyone from the events team to the waiters looking after us at our meal in the Long Room were friendly, helpful and marvellous.  They made us feel special.  Management went to great lengths to ensure a happy time.  Very attentive.  Food excellent and drinks reasonably priced for London.  Would totally recommend this venue for an occasion. Thank you x",5,2019,10,13
123,Fabulous stay at the Marylebone!,"My wife and I stayed at the Marylebone for a long-weekend, and absolutely loved our stay! Great location of course but the hotel also really delivered. Our queen room was larger than most in this part of town, bed comfortable with all amenities. The hotel bar was really cozy with a good selection of cocktails. But best of all were the staff that were super attentive - from the doormen handing out umbrellas with a smile (yes it did rain in London), to the receptionists that provided complimentary bottles of water, to the concierge that got us a table at a favorite restaurant that was supposedly full, to the guest relations manager who went to get us a handful of chocolates when we had inadvertently said no to the turn-down service. All in all a really great experience!",5,2019,10,13
123,Fab,"Another fabulous stay at this amazing hotel. I’ve not known a hotel in London where the staff go completely out of their way to make your stay as comfortable as possible. Even if you are not a guest I’d recommend the bar. Great mixologists at relatively 
reasonable prices (By London standards) 
A must visit.",5,2019,10,13
123,Our favourite hotel in London,"We stayed at The Marylebone Hotel for a second time this summer at the end of September to treat ourself for a romantic weekend away. We’ve been lucky to stay at one of the suites which was beautifully decorated and had a very luxurious yet cosy feel. The hotel has fantastic brasserie, breakfast room, several bars and loads of beautifully decorated spaces to enjoy a cup of coffee or a glass of wine. The hotel is in a beautiful Marylebone area, full of fantastic pubs, bars, restaurants and shops and minutes from Fitzrovia or Mayfair.  Gunter, Guest relations manager at the hotel looked after us during both of our stays and made us feel very welcome. Thank you for making our trip so lovely!",5,2019,10,13
123,Highly Recommend,"This is a fantastic hotel in a great location for shops, restaurants and bars. It’s beautifully designed and the rooms are quiet and very comfortable. The best thing about it is the staff. Some London hotels lack great customer service but not The Marylebone, staff are outstanding in their professionalism warm welcome, attention to detail and genuine effort to make your stay the best it can be. The door staff were particularly helpful with getting us cabs, moving luggage and keeping us dry from the rain. A special thank you to Andrei for his help. Highly recommended! ",5,2019,10,13
123,Great experience,"I had a really lovely experience with my fiancé I came to the bar for a couple of G&T’s and I was served by two friendly guys “Michele” I guess the bar manager and “Davide” the waiter.

123,Thank you Marylebone!,"I had such a nice stay at the Marylebone hotel this week. My hosts at the door, at the front desk, at the bar, and those taking care of my room were all extremely polite, respectful, and friendly. A special thanks to Andrei for his kindness, help, and hospitality!",5,2019,10,12
123,Beautiful and gracious hotel,"Our stay at the Marylebone Hotel couldn’t have been better. The suite was beautiful and well appointed. The staff were friendly, gracious and extremely helpful. Housekeeping was very efficient and our laundry was handled with care. The food in the hotel was excellent. The neighborhood was clean, charming and very walkable. I just can not say enough about how much my husband and I enjoyed our stay. ",5,2019,10,11
123,Excellent service,"Would thoroughly recommend the Marylebone for their excellent customer services. Were been kind and diligent throughout the booking process, and attentive to our every need upon checking. A special thanks to Gunther !",5,2019,10,09
123,The Best hotel in Marylebone,"This hotel is in excellent location for Marylebone High St, Bond St and the West End. Very clean and comfortable beds. Really friendly staff and excellent decor and facilities, including two very nice cocktail bars. Use of the Third Space gym and swimming pool below the hotel is a real treat.",5,2019,10,09
123,Excellent short stay,"My wife and I stayed for one night for my wife's birthday. Excellent hotel standard, great staff, excellent food. Third Space Gym was a bonus and nice to have a pool in the city. Would definitely return.",5,2019,10,08
123,Marvelous Cream Tea,"My friend and I discovered The Marylebone and 108 Brasserie online listed as one of the Top 10 best places for Cream Tea in London. It has really left an impression. 

From the moment we arrived we were treated wonderfully. The staff was always looking out if we needed anything and their cream tea specialities were scrumptious. 

We had the pleasure of being waited by Evelina. My friend is gluten-intolerant and Evelina checked every plate with the kitchen to care every scone and cake followed our limitations. She also greeted us with a smile on her face and great disposition, she made us feel just like home. 

This will become one of my regular spots in London everytime I visit.

123,Home away from home,This is definitely the only hotel I ever stay in London and I call it our home away from home. Excellent service from the moment you walk in the door. I like to say Gunther your Guest Relations Manager is superb. I highly recommend the 108 Brasserie that also has a full bar with a great atmosphere. I give it a 10 out 10! ,5,2019,10,07
123,Quality hotel and 1st class staff,"Just a one night stay, but a great find. We had booked a classic room only and were fortunate to get an early check in. Unfortunately, upon entering our room, it was not ""made up"", so we had to return to the front desk. At this point the staff individually and collectively demonstrated a faultless master class in retrieving the situation with flying colours. The duty senior manager personally getting involved. Firstly, she upgraded us to a deluxe room on a higher floor, which was generous. After 10 minutes in the room, she called us and noted to us that we were a ""room only"" booking, which we confirmed. She then advised us that they were offering us the top line breakfast free of charge. This was more than generous. Later that evening, when we returned to our room, a very nice half bottle of wine was waiting for us along with a bowl of fruit. This ethos is so rare and we felt so well looked after, bravo to all.
Anyway, the hotel common areas were lovely. Sadly we had no chance to try the pool and spa. Our room was lovely too, with a comfy bed and heated bathroom floor. The breakfast was very good indeed. If there was even the slightest negative, it would only be that the towels and linen did not smell very fresh. But such a small point. I would thoroughly recommend this hotel and would not hesitate to return here upon my next stay in Central London.",5,2019,10,06
123,Wedding party in the Courtyard/Library Room,"We split the marriage and the party dates. The hotel did a great job with a private family dinner in the Long room II in June on the marriage day. Lia again organised the reception party in September. The Courtyard /library is a beautiful atmospheric venue within this stylish hotel. With the bar and Blue room it is a separate stand alone area in the hotel. 

The foliage decorating the Courtyard gives it a distinct look and if the weather is good can have the roof open. Separate bar area just for the courtyard which worked well. Used the adjacent Blue room as a cloakroom. Had approx 120 guests, about the max for this space. Think can have more if the Blue room is utilised.  

Lia again made the process painless and was a pleasure to work with and she kept it all stress free. We were content with the food and drink ordered from the selection as we knew it was going to be good after our experience of the marriage dinner in June. Lia suggested a tasting in advance of the party which turned out to be useful (and fun) finalising the selection of food and drinks and working out how much to order - and was a nice couple of hours as in the restaurant and skipped dinner that evening. 

On the night the staff bring out platters of finger foods and bowl food selections directly to the guests which worked really well. The timetable for the various dishes also went off seamlessly. The hotel can source a DJ, though we used our own one. Also had a dressing up photo booth - Wackybooths. Lia liaised with both outside companies in advance and the set up etc all went smoothly. 

Gunther from guest relations was helpful to us and the guests that arrived in the day to stay overnight. Hannah was on hand in the evening to unflappably run the event on the night.  Otto was on the staff again as at the dinner and he and the other bar and waiting staff were all spot on, smoothly circulating amongst the guests with food and drink. 

The party went off flawlessly. There were no hitches or hiccups in the planning or on the night.  Our friends all had a great evening, which was the main aim. The hotel itself is stylish and impressive, but the professionalism and competence of the staff across the board really stands out. We couldn’t have asked for a better venue, or an event organiser in Lia for our do.",5,2019,10,06
123,Wonderful stay,"Traveling from the US were were so pleased to stay at the Marylebone.  The service , cleanliness and amenities of this hotel surpassed all other hotels on our two week three city holiday.  The hotel staff could not be more helpful or friendly.

123,Beautiful Interiors + Amazing Staff,"We recently hosted an event in The Palm Room at Number Six and had an amazing time. Our guests were blown away by the incredible interiors, the delicious canapes and wine and did not want to leave! Thank you to the brilliant team (Cristina, Ottó, Erasmia, Andreea, Alessio & Gergo) who made the evening run so smoothly and were so helpful, attentive and friendly to our guests.

We cannot wait to host another event here - I cannot compliment the team more for thier incredible work.",5,2019,10,03
123,Just so kind.....,"I wanted to say a huge thank you to the concierge, Andre! I didn’t actually stay at the hotel, I was a patient across the road at The Wellbeck Hospital. Our taxi had parked in front of the hotel and I had to cross the street with some difficulty after a lengthy operation. Andre was just so kind and took it upon himself to help me, along with my husband .. into the taxi and then offered us a bottle of water. We drove away saying what a lovely man he was, as he really didn’t need to help me as I wasn’t staying at the hotel. It just reminds us that there are some lovely people around, so thank you Andre, your kindness was so appreciated.",5,2019,10,03
123,"Great location, comfortable rooms.","Really, really good location off Marylebone High Street. Good value for money .  Updated rooms that are modern and well appointed . Great power showers. Comfortable beds.  Warm efficient check in and check out.  Room service a delight. A hotel that has been designed with lots of comfortable bar and restaurant space. Should give it 5 but breakfast was chaotic and doormen have that disinterested ' I don't really work here attitude' which isn't helpful when you need a cab in the rain. Will try it again in the hope these niggles were one offs..",4,2019,10,03
123,great service at the lounge bar,The location is great and hotel is lovely. This is a great place to meet co-workers for drinks and snacks.  Our server AURELIEN was extremely attentive and professional.  His cocktail and food recommendations were spot on.  We will definitely be back!,5,2019,09,30
123," Unbelievably positive experience ","Just departing this hotel after my recent stay and felt compelled to write a review. From the moment we arrived to when we left, the service and experience was exceptional! 

I travel extensively for business and rarely do I find such a positive experience in all areas of a hotel. The team are trained exceptionally high and every single one provided the same attentive friendly service. We ate in all areas. 

The hotel decor is warm and inviting with many areas to relax and be quiet. 

I will be back again and again each time I am in London. This is now my go to place and as I travel a lot on my own I felt safe and truly relaxed after my stay. 

Thank you! As a hotelier myself, it is truly refreshing to experience what you have created at the Marylebone hotel 
",5,2019,09,30
123,Perfect little cocktail bar,"I have visited London with my friends for a few days, we stayed in another Hotel, but one of the rainy day we wanted to pop into a nice bar just chill with some drinks. We found the Marylebone after seeing some really good ratings about it, and I have to admit it is TRUE!
The cocktail bar is so lovely and comfy and the  staff are also incredible. Special thanks to Andras who made us feel welcome and didn't get tired of all our annoying questions about the cocktails. This is what I call perfect service.",5,2019,09,29

123,Corporate Event at The Marylebone,"Our company held a cocktail event at The Marylebone this month.  It was a huge success.  We hired The Courtyard, which was airy and light.  If it had not been raining we could have opened the roof.  Not that anyone noticed as the service, food and drink was excellent.  Special shout out to Otto who could not do enough for us.  He even fixed our printer!  Will definitely be back",5,2019,09,27
123,Great hotel in London,"I spent two nights here and was very impressed with the food, the speed of room service, and Andrei at the front door has got your back. The staff are friendly and understand how to treat a busy traveler. Would happily stay here again. ",5,2019,09,27

Loved our English breakfast, as well as the traditional tea and scones in the afternoon. Get a massage at the Spa! Definitely going back!",5,2019,09,27
123,Andrei!,"Hotel was good. Stayed in a spacious suite. Breakfast was excellent and good was quite good in general. There’s access to a gym/pool/sauna though it’s open to the public. The hallways on the room floors were quite low ceiling-ed with tired carpet. Not a big deal. 

GREAT bellman. Andrei in particular was extremely accommodating, with directions, umbrellas and setting up a great car service on my behalf. Thank you Andrei!",4,2019,09,26
123,"Beautiful location, excellent service","Recently I visited this beautiful hotel with a couple of friends. We also had a few drinks at the lobby bar. Ildiko, our waitress has been excellent.

123,Incredible staff and perfect for meetings,"I've visited the Marylebone for over two years now to make use of their fantastic cafe/bar area for meetings, as I work in the area but have minimal meeting space within our business premises. Every visit is a treat, as the surroundings are beautiful and the staff are incredible. Particular praise goes to Andras, who is always welcoming and friendly, even when the area he is covering is incredibly busy. He always goes out of his way to assist me, and it's a pleasure to talk to him each day. His colleagues in the cafe are equally welcoming, and the service is always first rate. Well done Andras and co, you're one of the main reasons I keep coming back!",5,2019,09,25
123,Great weekend in Marylebone ,"We heard this neighborhood was awesome, and it is! The Marylebone Hotel is in a fantastic, quiet location, and the hotel staff went out of their way to help us with a very early check in and a late departure, given our flight times. Stan the bellhop was especially helpful! And don’t miss having a house-made gin the the 108 Brasserie connected to the hotel - fantastic. - Joanne T. ",5,2019,09,24
123,Attention to detail is excellent-,"We had a wonderful stay recently at this hotel. Right from our request for an early check- in, as we were attending a family wedding,which was sorted out by the very helpful ,Malachy. The hotel was beautifully appointed and very friendly staff looked after our every need.The food was excellent quality, from breakfast to a wonderful dinner, the second evening,in their restaurant/ brasserie. The bedrooms and bathroom had everything you could ask for, beautiful linens and gorgeous pillows.So close to shopping and all the usual attractions.Can't wait to go back.",5,2019,09,24

The staff were all very friendly and genuinely wanted to ensure we had the best stay possible.  Everyone we spoke to was so helpful and and amiable, the reception team, the restaurant hostess, manager and serving team and bar staff.  Malachy especially was lovely with his Irish whit and charm!  Gunther was so helpful in recommending bars and restaurants to visit.  Our room had everything we could need, thank you to Caroline for the thoughtful amenities.  Breakfast was delicious and the restaurant lovely.  The location is fantastic being a very short walk to Oxford and Bond streets but in such a calm little area.  Marylebone high street is so pretty and quaint.  I can't wait to return.",5,2019,09,24
123,Amazing facilities and service - The Doyle Collection (Marylebone),"We run a 5-day booking, 8.30 to 5.30 at The Library. We had an amazing experience. The staff are super attentive, you feel the luxury: from the service, advice, care, etc. The cakes, treats and food were amazing and nothing was too much trouble for Paul. I highly recommend it for businesses, the premises and the service will not let you down.",5,2019,09,24
123,Dissapointed,"My husband and I booked the hotel to stay after a long day at work and dinner so we can relax and have dinner with a friend and rest. After we had dinner in central London, we came back to the hotel and invited our friend to have some drinks in the hotel bar. The bar looks great and we thought we will just chill with some nice drinks before bed. We asked the waitress if we could have some cocktails. She very rudely reply that no, they don't serve cocktails after certain time of the night, which is fine. But the way she said it was not friendly at all, but very abrupt and rude. So we ordered some other drinks. When it came to paying the bill, we said we are going to pay cash. The waitress seemed to be very displeased and showed her unhappiness! She told us they preferred card, again in a very rude manner! Just grabbed the cash and went. If it's a 5 star hotel, I expect a little bit of respect, especially after paying through the nose for it. I never mind paying for food service, and do so all the time, and give generous tips. I have stayed in luxury hotels all over the world and UK, but never had such rude and disrespectful treatment. This is not the way to treat your guests! She might have had a bad day, but come on, this is her job to be nice with guests and to serve them. That was quite stressful to be honest. The manager has spoken to us as we raised concerns of what has happened. He was very polite and professional about it ,so that was end of it.
Unfortunately next early morning(Saturday!) I was woken up by drilling from the building site right in front of our room window. I have specifically asked for a quiet room, as I knew we will go to bed late. That was the whole point of staying over in this hotel, so we can get some rest. If they couldn't provide it, they should have warned me that there will be noise and offer an upgrade( I didn't mind paying for it), but nothing was said about building works next door. 
The room was nice, bathroom a bit shabby and not very good water pressure in the shower. It took ages for water to heat up.
We used the swimming pool and sauna the next day, which was nice, and the SPA staff was very nice, polite and helpful. 
I have no problem with any other members of staff, apart from that waitress( didn't get her name unfortunately).
Small details like that can really ruin your stay though. It could have been superb, but it just was ruined unfortunately.",1,2019,09,23
123,Nice friendly guy on door called Andrei,Stayed in this hotel in March and Writing a review on one member of staff as he was lovely and very friendly! There were some things that weren’t great but Nice door staff guy made a big effort to make you feel welcome andrei,5,2019,09,23
123,"Great service,highly recommend","I visited the Marylebone hotel, to go for a few drinks with a friend so we decided to visit the cocktail bar. Uppn arrival the atmosphere was great, but what really stood out was the exceptional service, the staff were proffessional, friendly, welcoming and just exceptional overall.

Additionally, our room was wonderfully quiet, no traffic noise as the hotel is on a side street, away from the noisy main roads. Quite a haven of tranquility. The staff were fantastically helpful. Housekeeping staff made our weekend by, having found out that we were celebrating my daughter’s birthday,  putting a surprise bottle of Prosecco, a beautifully decorated dessert and a small gift in our room. My daughter wasn’t even a guest at the hotel - just visiting. The hotel is in a great central London location within a minute’s walk from Marylebone High Street which is incredibly charming - lovely shops and restaurants. We couldn’t have asked for a lovelier weekend. ",5,2019,09,18
123,Another GREAT Stay at The Marylebone Hotel,I have stayed at the Marylebone Hotel many times over the years and am never disappointed - visit for both business and pleasure.  The staff is superb and always welcoming.  The location of the hotel is excellent and the renovations are a significant improvement to both public areas and sleeping rooms.  Keep Up the EXCELLENT Work!!,5,2019,09,18
123,If a hotel is judged in the merits of their bar...,"This one would be a five star.  Excellent, carefully crafted cocktails were consistently superb.   I visited several nights during my stay and Aurelien, Nicolas and Davide were simply amazing.  Very attentive, professional but fun.  I loved the neighborhood which offered a village like feel.  This place made a challenging business trip a lot of fun!  If you like a small but cool hotel, this is your place.  Highly recommended!",5,2019,09,17
123,Retirement party at the Marylebone," I had my retirement party at the Courtyard and stayed one night at the Marylebone. The room was spacious, quiet and comfortable with a complimentary bowl of fruit and bottle of wine. Staff were very courteous and helpful. Best of all was the event space. The decor and sliding roof give it an outdoor, spacious feel but it still managed to feel cosy and warm, helped by the fairy lights imbedded in the foliage and the open fire. Staff at the event were excellent and attentive. My guests loved it and the evening was one I will remember for many years. ",5,2019,09,17

The hotel is beautiful and well-designed throughout, and the rooms are always clean and provided with a good range of amenities, large flat screen televisions, climate control and lovely comfortable beds. 
The breakfast (especially the scrambled eggs and smoked salmon) and the juices are delicious, so should definitely be tried.
The bar and 108 restaurant are also very impressive with cosy corners and heated outdoor spaces, again, with a great menu and experienced and friendly staff.
The gym and swimming pool match the hotel's high end feel and are extremely well equipped.",5,2019,09,12

123,Highly recommended!,"Our family stayed here for almost 2 weeks and we could not be happier with the way we were taken care of. The Hotel Manager, Gunther, went out of his way to ensure we were comfortable and to ensure all our little whims were taken care of. The kids were greeted with the cutest little teddies which serve as the perfect souvenirs for their first London trip. The breakfast was delicious, the concierge went out of his way to help us secure tickets to go see a show that was pretty much sold out! The rooms were spacious and the service was always perfect! They were even accommodating we asked for late check out, (we had a flight in the evening) and actually offered us a small room where we could store our luggage and rest in till the evening, after we checked out!) Needless to say, everyone, from the doorman (offering us endless bottles of water each time we ventured out) to the managers - everyone was extremely courteous and made our trip quite memorable !

The restaurant is fabulous and the staff is extremely patient and professional with every dietary request (and believe me - I have plenty!!!).
The hotel is located on a quiet side street , but still very close to to Oxford Street, Regent's Park (great for a run/walk), restaurants, bars, etc.  The neighborhood is lovley.

We also hosted a private dinner and large drinks party at the hotel and I cannot say enough good things about the Catering Dept (Cristina had great attention to details and was endlessly patient with my changes of plan). The service on the night of our dinner and drinks parties was perfect from start to finish, and the food was delicious. Po and Hannah made sure we had everything we needed but were unobtrusive as they sorted everything behind the scenes. The hotel itself was a great headquarters for our guests and allowed them to easily explore charming Marylebone and the Oxford/Bond St areas, as well as Regents Park, Madame Tussauds, etc. We are so grateful to the staff and would happily host an event at the hotel again. Thanks so all of you the weekend was a terrific success!",5,2019,09,07

Nice cozy bars and a brilliant location in the center of London. Highly recommend this place,5,2019,09,04
123,GREAT,"Excellent hotel. At every opportunity I come to this hotel. I have already visited 3 times and of course I will return. Friendly and caring staff, quality food, great location, close to Oxford Street and public transport",5,2019,09,04
123,Cocktail bar,We are here filming a movie.  Every night went to the lobby bar for a drink. The barman Christian was the reason we kept coming back!   Such a positive and knowlegable guy who always remembered my order. Lovely atmosphere in a great part of town.,5,2019,09,03
123,always the best,"Checked in at the Marylebone ,and as always Gunther from the reception was very helpful ,one of the best hotels in London in my opinion .
there is a great bar and restaurant and the hotel is right in the centre of London .",5,2019,09,03
123,Mr. Will,"I stayed at The Marylebone for a couple of days, the hotel is fantastic. The person that was able to help me was
Gunther Schildwachter. I had an amazing time in England and I can’t wait to get back next year!
Thank you for the hospitality!",5,2019,09,02
123,Great hotel and bar,"Stayed for two nights in August. Small room but very comfortable bed. The lobby and bar area are fantastic and the bar staff was very accommodating, particularly Aurelien who made sure I was well taken care of. Definitely recommended and will certainly return.",5,2019,09,02
123,Great Family Stay,"We stayed for 2 nights with our son, and all the hotel staff couldn't do enough to help us during our stay.  A particular thanks to Gunther who made sure we didn't want for anything. The room was spacious and comfortable. We really enjoyed the little extras including wine in our room, fruit platter, and milk and cookies for our 7 year old. The breakfast selection was excellent and we enjoyed both the continental and cooked options. 

The hotel is in a great location for exploring the west end, close to oxford circus, and the lovely shops and restaurants in Marylebone. We will be coming back on our next visit to London.",5,2019,09,02
123,First Class stay,"After an initial hiccup on our adjoining rooms not being ready when we got there, Gunther the guest relations manager took care of it before we unpacked, and the rest of the stay was smooth as butter.  

Hotel is low key and boutique-feeling, with a first class gym.  Restaurant and bar are excellent at the hotel, and the Marylebone neighborhood itself is a great location filled with more restaurants and shopping (and close to transportation).  You can't go wrong staying here location-wise, particularly if you don't have a master plan for your trip.   

We used the hotel as a base of operations for a week-long London vacation.  My family of 4 voyaged out of the hotel to do touristy stuff all day (after sleeping late most days), came back to hotel to shower and change, went out again for whatever evening activity we had planned, and then came back again.  Every day the room was made up twice for us, even though we never had the same schedule.  Can't do that if your hotel isn't centrally located AND on their game service wise.

So would highly recommend.   
",5,2019,09,01
123,Exceptional Hotel,"We experience exceptional service from all staff . The rooms are very comfortable . The Hotels location was ideal for us . Busy area but not to busy .

123,"Location, Location, Location!","I loved the intimacy of the Hotel and its through block connection - the little sunny covered terraces off the Bar on Welbeck Street and the Elfresco dining area at the rear.
I stayed for more than a week and it was always a pleasure to 'come home' at the end of the day - nothing was too much trouble for Theano and her hospitality team including sourcing a printer for some bespoke gift cards for me which miraculously appeared in my room within hours!",5,2019,08,29
123,The amazing Jonny Ortega,"Love this place so much. Best bar staff ever! Jonny Ortega. Probably the most industrious Barman I have ever seen. The whole team...David, Jonny

123,Lovely hotel in excellent location ,"The cosy room is too small for two so we upgraded to a refurbished classic room which was very comfortable & well-equipped. Excellent breakfast with plenty of healthy options. Good for vegans. Staff were extremely helpful. It was a heat wave & reception offered us bottles of water to take with on several occasions during our stay. Didn’t use the pool, gym or spa. Excellent location. Great shopping, cafes & restaurants within close walking distance including Bond Street & Marylebone High St. Look forward to returning & staying there again. ",5,2019,08,27
123,Excellent Location,"With a great location score from trip advisor we selected this hotel, really amazing location can't even list the nearby areas and attractions, shopping, parks and great restaurants.

Staff are amazing and very pleasant and helpful
Very clean
Rooms and lobby are smaller to what you expect in a 5 stars hotel 
Excellent food
Good size indoor swimming pool and gym 

Only bad thing I can say is the AC our luck London was very hot during our stay and the AC I guess can't keep up with the heat. 

Also we wanted to extend for 4 more days but we were informed that we have to leave due to room availability even though many hotel reservation sites showed availability , because of that we decided to leave.   ",4,2019,08,27
123,We wouldn’t stay anywhere else in London!,"This hotel is by far the best hotel around. The service is second to none and it’s just the most amazing hotel to stay at. We have stayed as a couple around 15 times and having just got back have just booked our next stay. Nestled in the heart of marylebone the location couldn’t be better. We would highly recommend, you won’t be disappointed!",5,2019,08,26

123,"Wonderful hotel in a great location, service is excellent.","We stayed here for 6 nights.  Check in and check out was so quick and easy.  They are so friendly and made us feel so welcome.  
I am really picky about small hotel rooms and this hotel was very spacious.  The rooms are large and comfortable.  
We LOVED the location.  It is such a nice and quaint area, but really close to Bond street and easy to get anywhere you need to go.
The service was top notch.  The staff goes out of their way to do whatever you need.  
I would recommend this hotel and would stay here again.",5,2019,08,23
123,Wonderful hotel,"The Marylebone hotel is perfectly located on a small quiet street at the center of London.

We will definitely come back!",5,2019,08,23
123,Amazing Hotel & Superb Location ❤,"We have stayed at The Marylebone for 10 nights in Aug 2019. The location is just a 5 minute walk to Oxford Street and the Bond Street Station,  and the Marylebone High Street is very close to the hotel. 
Our classic rooms located in the 2nd floor had been recently renovated, but it was too small than expected, Ms.Theano helped us so much and had upgrade us to very nice deluxe rooms and give us a complemintary fruit baskets and juices...I would highly recommend The Marylebone to anyone looking for a best hotel location with excellent service.",5,2019,08,21
123,A Fab Stay,"We are nearing the end of our nine day stay at The Marylebone Room 134 facing Welbeck Street with no street nor adjoining room noise.

Read a dozen or so of the other reviews to get a sense of the great customer satisfaction with the hotel, all I think so richly deserved!  

Upon checking in, find and introduce yourself to Gunther, Guest Relations Manager.  He will be invaluable for matters about the hotel and London’s sights and services. 

If you are here on Friday do inquire about the complimentary walking tour of the Marylebone area with a professional guide.

The dining room and bars are not to be missed!  The service, cuisine, and value are tops.

Our bed was super comfy, a luxurious pillow top mattress in a handsomely appointed room.

A heated mirror in the bathroom, a superior quite air conditioning. 

We have been extra spoiled by the chocolates and flavored lemonades arriving mysteriously in the room.

For such a busy hotel, I have been surprised repeatedly by the attention paid by staff, Daniel at the front desk, Godwin in the lobby area, Karina in the dinning room—it is almost as if one is recognized as family.

We shall be hugely sad to checkout and will long remember our stay at The Marylebone!",5,2019,08,21
123,Excellent,"My first impression was made as I walked into the Marylebone Hotel by a man called Gunther at the front desk who so efficiently and professionally welcomed me on my arrival, making sure all my needs were taken care of in such a professional manner.
When I asked him to help me with something I did not think that anyone could resolve, he magically came up with an excellent solution. Gunther is a person that every hotel should have, who genuinely cares about his guests, and treats them as if they were his own.
I would say my stay at the hotel was exceptional. everyday I was greeted by very good front dest staff, but I always looked for Gunther, who made sure all my questions were answered, accurate directions given, and wonderful recommendations all around.
Thank you Gunther for all your excellent help. I do not remember your last name but I know it began with an S.
To the manager of 108 Brasserie, Loren Mecca, you are a class act and run one of the finest restaurants in London. Your attention to detail as I watch you commanding a large staff is exceptional and professional. thank you for making sure my needs for food were so well taken care of
I would highly recommend this hotel, make sure to ask for Gunther in guest relations, and Loren in the 108 Brasserie, then you will for sure know that all your needs will be taken care of",5,2019,08,20
123,Great Hotel in the Center of London,"I am there on a regular basis. Great hotel, great service. 
Easy access to the sports club. Good bar. Like the food.

Really well-trained and friendly staff. 

A real highlight is the hospitality mindset of Ivo from the housekeeping team
         ",5,2019,08,20
123,Great hotel in superb location,"We have stayed at The Marylebone many times before and after our recent say, it remains our first choice in London. The location is superb, just a 5 minute walk to Oxford Street and the Bond Street Station, and also, walking in the other direction just 3 minutes the Marylebone High Street. It is also totally walkable to most prime tourist attractions. Our top floor Junior Suite had been recently renovated, but it was smaller than the usual Junior Suite we have previously had and we were moved to a larger suite the next day. An added perk is the superb gym, one of the best that I have seen anywhere. The hotel is perhaps less of a tourist hotel but as tourists it was perfect for us. Our welcome was great and service was laways impeccable. I would highly recommend The Marylebone to anyone looking for a hotel in a convenient location and offering excellent service.",5,2019,08,19
123,Excellent,"Stayed at the Marylebone for our anniversary night. We chose the hotel due it's location (being close to Carnaby, Regent and Oxford Street), and close to Euston Station. Also, we wanted a hotel that included a extensive spa.

We loved the stay. The doorman was incredibly polite, the check in desk clerk was friendly and accommodating, and the baggage help was just as friendly. 

We arrived early, so the reception kept our bags for the afternoon while we spent the day in the spa, which was fantastic. If you are into gyms, the gyms is fully equipped, from Olympic squat racks, to battle ropes. They have a steam room PLUS a sauna, and pool to cool off afterwards.

Once we got into the room (2pm was literal), we received a bottle of prosecco, chocolate strawberries and brownies for our anniversary which was a nice touch.

After the spa we spent the day around Carnaby, and returned to the hotel bar which is the only regret of my stay; and that is that we didn't spend more of the night in there. Their barmen are professional barmen making any cocktail you name. They were awesome. I would go back just for the drinks.

The breakfast buffet doesn't include hot meals. That would probably be the only real downer. So you order al le carte.

We would 100% go back. Loved our short stay.",5,2019,08,19
123,All you need,"We were given one of their newly refurbished rooms with everything required, plenty of spare linen but not to many unnecessary environmentally unfriendly toiletries. |ideally located to allow access to central London on foot.",5,2019,08,19
123,Let me tell you about my experience!,"I stay in London each summer and on a friend’s recommendation, I stayed at The Marylebone.  Cannot beat the location as this is what I love about London:  the shopping. 

It’s just a short walk to Oxford Street and a little more to Regents Street.  The tube is Bond Street and that is close as well. 

The front desk staff is well-staffed and very friendly.  I really enjoyed the breakfast buffet so don’t be cheap and skimp on this. Dinners are pretty good too.

Getting a cab to a play was a breeze from this location - as well as to LHR.

I recommend getting a room near the elevator, it took us two days to figure out where our room was as the long and winding halls were so confusing.   But I noticed my room that was farther away was actually larger than the one closer to the elevator - as we checked back into the hotel after exploring Scotland.  I think I’ll take a smaller room over the long walk!

The coffee machine (Nespresso) was excellent and really held me over until breakfast or woke me up for more shopping in the afternoon.   We had so much stuff (purchased goodies) in our room I’m surprised housekeeping made it in, but they were great!

During this trip, I was eating at a restaurant around the corner (Italian) and was robbed.  My wallet was taken and all my credit cards.   I was able to use my daughter’s credit card but I had no cash.  The doormen, especially Dimitaz was so wonderful and told me not to worry about tips that last day.  He was so helpful in getting me a private car that last day to LHR - so I was really appreciative.  He is someone they need to keep close!  Very helpful.

I will be back.  It’s a perfect place and location and can’t wait to go back and shop. See you next summer.",5,2019,08,18
123,Home from home,Staff were so helpful and went the extra mile to make sure we were comfortable. Will definitely be staying here again. Convenient for all central London amenities yet without the noise we feared from an inner city stay,5,2019,08,18
123,"Superb staff, excellent hospitality","We needed to be in Marylebone for an emergency visit and chose yhenhotel because of proximity to medical facilities. The staff was extraordinarily courteous, the restaurant service was wonderful and overall we were made to comfortable and cared for during an otherwise stressful visit. ",5,2019,08,18
123,This is all about Gunther,"I want to thank Gunther Schildwachter at the front desk for his extraordinary customer service during my stay .
I might mention I am a black card member of the Doyle collection, and am a regular at the Marylebone Hotel.
Gunther is a team leader who is one of the reasons I return to the Marylebone Hotel.
one never has to ask him for anything as he always anticipates ones needs and always goes over and above to make sure that his guests are happy.
I can for sure say that this wonderful hotel would never be the same without this friendly professional Gunther.
Marylebone Hotel you are so fortunate to have such an incredible front desk representative who sets the standard for your hotels.
I might add I travel the world stay mostly at Mandarin Oriental hotels and have seldom experienced such good customer service as offered by Gunther. thank you for another fabulous trip
",5,2019,08,17
123,Wonderful Stay,"I stayed at the Marylebone on a recent trip to London with my niece.  I prefer boutique hotels and found the service, amenities and location to be wonderful.  We shared a two twin room and, as expected, the room was compact but it had everything we needed.  We arrived early on an overnight flight and since our room wasn't ready we were given access to the spa where we were able to shower and change.  By the time we got back to the hotel, our bags had been taken up to the room.  The hotel provides access to the Third Space gym which is attached - its fully equipped and offers a range of equipment as well as classes.  Housekeeping was excellent and the staff was attentive and helpful.   The hotel is just a short walk from the Central and Jubilee lines which made it very convenient, but it was also nice to come ""home"" to a quieter neighborhood after a long day of sightseeing.  I would highly recommend this hotel.",5,2019,08,17
123,Fabulous Stay,"I cannot say enough good things about our stay at the Marylebone! We loved everything about it. Our family of 5 stayed in a family room, which was spacious for our family. The staff was so so very kind to all of us, including our 3 boys. One morning I wasn't feeling well, and before I knew it, the staff had sent up some ginger tea to make me feel better. That is just one example of the extra steps that the staff at he Marylebone take to insure that your stay is lovely. I loved the location of the hotel, and really do hope to go back again sometime! ",5,2019,08,15
123,Cozy Hotel in Heart of London,"I had a pleasant stay at the Marylebone Hotel, my room was so clean and cozy and the location is amazing.

I recommend this hotel and I will return for sure.",5,2019,08,14
123,Great weekend stay at the Marylebone,"We booked the hotel at short notice, arrived at 9:00, the room they gave us was not I as expected, because the allocated refurbished room was still occupied. So, I advised the hotel reception of my displeasure, and straight away I had the Duty Guest Relationship Manager on the phone working on changing the room to make sure our weekend was not ruined and within an hour another room was found and we got moved. The room was refurbished and front facing, the manager was efficient and supportive during our stay. Actually the hotel staff were very helpful and pleasant, breakfast had great selection and the bar staff were very nice and accommodating. We will definitely return back to the Marylebone and recommend it to friends.",5,2019,08,14

123,Superb stay at The Marylebone ,"Our recent stay at the Marylebone in London was just great! My family and I were staying in a newly renovated deluxe bedroom and a studio suite. The rooms were both nice, spacious and very well lit. The amenities are just as described and seen in the pictures. As for breakfast, it was also very good. Housekeeping was immaculate on a daily basis and Gunther, the guest relations manager, was extremely helpful. He managed to resolve all our issues swiftly and with complete ease. We loved how he was always present and ready to help with anything. Gunther really knows how to make guests feel special. He even gave my little brother a cute little teddy bear. And a shoutout to Sergio, a very sweet and pleasant gentleman! He always has a smile on his face. 
Special thanks to the Marylebone and the staff for our pleasant stay. 10 stars! We will definitely be staying here again.

123,An amazing hotel with a wonderful guest relations leader!,"I love the quiet village-like neighborhood in which the hotel is located - a short walk from all the hustle and bustle. Large comfortable rooms and great breakfast make this even better. 

What I loved most however, was how Gunther Schildwachter tended to our needs. I have never experienced this level of client focus before and it was much appreciated! Gunther is the reason we will come back and stay at the Marylebone hotel each time we're in London.",5,2019,08,12

As soon as I arrived they sent me a box of chocolates. Special thanks to Gunther who gave me this sweet bear for my nephew, and Alistair who I drove crazy while helping me decide between the lion king or mama Mia. And thank you to jojo who always greeted me on my way in and out. Very sweet hotel, cosy and clean. Perfect location, walking distance from everything. If work sent me back, this would be my first choice.",4,2019,08,10
123,Lovely hotel,We stayed at the Marylebone Hotel for our anniversary last month. The room was very clean and cozy and the location was amazing. We stayed for 2 days and the experience was definitely value for money. The hotel is very central with plenty of brasseries around. For example 108 brassiere has excellent food and service. The stuff was very friendly especially Theano from Guest Relations who made these 2 days special with her positive attitude. I would recommend this hotel for such special occasions and I would come back for sure.,5,2019,08,10

From the minute we arrived the staff were incredibly friendly, the lovely young man on reception was very chatty and then we met the lovely Theano head of guest relations, she arranged a surprise as it was a special occasion and was super friendly!

Our room was smart and clean, the bed was very comfy and the TV was massive. The tea and coffee inside a little cupboard made the room neat and tidy. 
We had a drink in the bar, lovely cocktail and even given snacks for free! Again the staff were great and the decor was really special. 

We went for a swim in the pool, the staff on reception at the gym were not very helpful, she didnt even tell us how to get to the pool but the facilities were fantastic. Had the pool to ourselves and the changing rooms had everything you could ever need to get ready from hair bubbles go razors! 

We will definitely be returning! ",5,2019,08,10

I went back to Heathrow and didn't miss the flight!",5,2019,08,09
123,Great Luxury Hotel - will visit agsin,"We had a delightful 3 night stay at The Marylebone. It was the first time staying at this hotel and we were impressed enough to add it our list of go to hotels for our frequent London trips. The hotel is stylish with a lovely bar and lounge area. The room was relatively large for London standards and was very comfortable. The staff were all courteous and most helpful. 
The one slight quibble was that we were left rather underwhelmed by the a la Carte breakfast in the brassiere. We only had breakfast there on the last day having been out with friends in the lovely local eateries on the other mornings. The breakfast they served seem more buffet fare rather than direct from the kitchen. Anyway given the multitude of restaurants and cafes nearby it certainly has not out off staying here again in the near future. 

",4,2019,08,09
123,Superbly located and excellently staffed,"I spent a very comfortable 4 days at the Marylebone. During my stay I was able to enjoy the hotel's many amenities - an excellent gym and pool, a good restaurant popular with locals and the help of very knowledgeable staff. My particular thanks to Jacopo and Rakhim for their help.
Just minutes away from shopping, museums and nightlife this is a great base while in London on business or holiday.",5,2019,08,09
123,The best bar lounge,"What a pleasant evening yesterday at Marylebone hotel bar lounge. Stunning venue, supper luxury but cosy atmosphere and first class customer service.

123,Lovely Hotel in the Heart of London,"The Marylebone was the perfect hotel for our weekend stay in London to kick off our babymoon. The location is outstanding, walkable to everything, and the staff was very hospitable with lots of great recommendations in the neighborhood for meals and shopping. They even welcomed our nephews with Marylebone hotel teddy bears when they came to visit us. I am only sad I didnt get one for myself when we were checking out. ",5,2019,08,08
123,A Needle In A Haystack....Found!,"A very rushed trip materialized overnight to London, UK, in time for the Cricket World Cup!
We stuck a pin in the very central to everything- Marylebone District and got last minute reservations for The Marylebone Hotel.

An elegant hotel, the restaurant, bar and cafe on the ground floor also serves as a rather popular watering hole for various fine folk of London and we found them scattered in various nooks & crannies & at The 108, lunching & supping & meeting for teas et al!

Our room was bright, spacious and well appointed. 
The beds & linens are quality with Malin + Goetz making an appearance in Bathroom amenities.

All this was fine & dandy for such a hotel but what was outstanding absolutely all around were the people that work here at TM! 
There is a uniform level of cheerful attentiveness from the Front Desk checking us in,to the Bell Hops, to the Guest Relations Manager & actually every server in the Guest Lounge, where we found ourselves for a few times between dash ins & dash outs.
It became a home away from home for us very quickly.
TMH also has an indoor pool, a gym & spa & I believe, a roof top bar though we did not get to any of these 3 due to so much to do outside.

Making an excellent impression on us was the efficient  yet very warm F.O. Manager, Gunter S, as well as the affable Sergio & Stan.
I highly recommend TMH!
Good Guest Relations makes all the difference in world class city like London.",5,2019,08,07
123,Magnificent,"I had an amazing stay here recently for my partners birthday weekend. The hotel and location was perfect with Oxford street in very close proximity. Upon arrival we met a man who introduced himself as Gunther. He asked us what we had planned during our time in London and advised us on numerous things he thought might fit in with what we were planning on doing. He then arranged to have our bags brought to our room once we had checked in and called us once we had settled in to make sure everything was ok. This is all very standard stuff at a hotel of this calibre but as the saying goes it’s not what you do it’s the way you do it and Gunther most certainly has a way about him that makes him top tier in any hotel anywhere in the world. I had remarked to my partner than he’s so good he should be guest relations manager. After we got ourselves together in the room we were leaving to take a walk ,Gunther was in the lobby and gave us his card and again assured us if there was anything at all we needed not to hesitate to ask. Low and behold on his card, “Guest relations manager”. I wasn’t one bit surprised as he really is the most pleasant and personable man I’ve encountered in a long time. To know that the guest relations manager was on the floor meeting and greeting customers upon arrival gave me faith in the Marylebone that they weren’t messing around when it came to the customer experience. I’ve stayed in many hotels in London of this calibre over the years but none where I felt that customer service mattered more. Gunther you’re a gentleman and a credit to the Marylebone. You’ve set an incredible standard for those working around you and I hope to see you and the rest of the staff very soon. 

Kind regards,

123,Best hotel in London,"I have travelled around the world
Lots of hotels are beautiful, lots of hotels have a fantastic level of service.

The Marylebone is simply the best hotel in London
Best possible location, quiet but central 
The rooms are elegant, beautiful, comfortable, great furniture, best bedding
The service is exceptional
Gunther Schildwachter is an expert, the best, an eye everywhere, immediate solution to any request supporting his team, total efficiency and aiming to please in any circumstance. It really makes a difference. Guest Relations Manager takes all its meaning with Gunther.

123,Superb hotel excellent location high standards ,"This was our second time staying at the Marylebone hotel and as expected we weren’t disappointed. 
Check in and check out were quick and efficient. Room was matriculate and clean. Every night they came to prepare the room for the night. Gym is great  and the whole attitude from hotel staff is aiming to please and make you enjoy. Highly recommend it. Will definitely stay again ",5,2019,08,04
123,Definitely a Five Star Experience,"The Marylebone Hotel is a wonderful hotel in the heart of Marylebone district.   The room was comfortable and afforded very nice amenities such as espresso and robes.   The staff were all incredibly helpful as well.  I had to have an emergency dental procedure and they scheduled the appointment with a local dentist for the very next morning.  The staff kept us amply supplied with whatever we needed while we were there - room service food deliveries, ice, extra towels, etc.   Jacopo was most helpful when we checked out.   ",5,2019,08,03
123,London stay,"The Marylebone Hotel was absolutely top notch! Everything from the minute you walk in the front door, ti the welcoming staff, to the cleanliness, to the quality of the rooms, everything-exceeded our expectations. Theano, the head of guest relations went out of her way to make sure that our stay was exceptional, and memorable. I highly recommend this hotel for anyone staying in London that is looking for a first class hotel in a very convenient location. Thanks for the great memories.",5,2019,08,03
123,Perfect spot to feel like a local,"Handy location in a quiet neighborhood. Multi-national staff members in all departments were helpful and personable with special kudos to the staff in the 108 pantry (actually a cafe) who made me feel at home during my week there. The room and bath were plenty big and the two times that I had a maintenance issue, it was handled promptly. I’d go back anytime!",5,2019,08,01
123,Marylebone as excellent as always,"Can't fault this hotel, professional, friendly, all needs catered for. Lovely location too. Plus, on a very hot couple of nights in London, the air conditioning in the room was quiet and efficient and wonderfully cool.",5,2019,07,30
123,Amazing,"I have never written a review before but the service at The Marylebone compelled me to share my experience. Theono and her team were exceptional and went above and beyond to make our stay comfortable and to attend to every detail. I can’t thank all of them, especially Theono, enough. I have never experienced that level of attention at any hotel. The friendly, attentive staff always had welcoming smiles. I am very much looking forward to returning to The Marylebone at my next opportunity.",5,2019,07,29
123,Finally found a home in London :)),"Can’t begin to describe how great this hotel was. Rooms are large enough for London standards, location is perfect close to everything you could need, plenty of restaurants and shops nearby. 
Super clean, amazing beds and overall great amenities.
The staff was exceptional and everyone made sure my friend and I had the greatest time. Everyone from reception to cleaning staff went above and beyond, making this stay truly memorable. 
Shoutout to Rodane, best keycard exchanger ever! :))))

The bar and restaurant are also great with a wonderful selection and service is impeccable. 

Really looking forward to coming back, my friend and I are already planning that for November. ",5,2019,07,29
123,"Luxurious place, location + ambiance. Great for Family.","I took a trip to London with my sister, my 15-month old nephew, my mother and aunt who are in their seventies with mobility challenges.

This was a difficult trip to navigate, but as soon as we arrived we were extraordinarily well attended.

Arrival - fresh infused water, fresh fruit, and welcoming staff at 9 pm. Doormen and bellman were ready to assist with bags immediately. The baby was greeted with a Marylbone bear (which he adored).

During the Stay- room service was fantastic (i.e. from 108 brasseries), huge television screens and central air. The central air was actually a key reason for a stay because of the extreme heat

108 Brasserie Restaurant - while our experience certainly merits an additional review - the food was excellent. The staff doted on the two babies we had at our table (we met with friends) and were nothing but welcoming and accommodating to the little ones.

Parlour and Bar - I had the 'million reasons' which was beautiful on the terrace which was a much-needed break from a hectic trip.

Exit - also flawless. My Mum accidentally futzed with the mini-bar fridge, but they adjusted the bill promptly. They helped my Aunt and Mum check out with a rental car that was about 30 pounds cheaper than a cab to Gatwick.

Overall, it was a fantastic hotel, in a brilliant location, excellent service, and fantastic food. JOJO RAMOS was a fantastic help to my Mum as were the rest of the crew. Rajeen (spelling?) who helped coordinate the car was fabulous. The cleaning crew- also fantastic. Actually, there isn't a staff member I encountered that was less than delightful.

This may become a regular London haunt :) 

TIPS:

1. Open the drawers! I didn't know about the extensive spa services and I sadly didn't have time to try the spa. There was also a discount booklet for some local shops. There were some places I would have definitely popped by had I known.

2. There are outlets in the Terrace - there are working outlets on the terrace for those of you that desire a place to plop your laptop. 

3. Floor 3 compared to Floor 6 - my fam and I were in two separate rooms, so there were incremental differences. However, Room 322 was a nice size with a bit of room and a chair and a tub. Beautiful shower on Floor 6. The view of Welbeck street was a bit more unobstructed from the third floor -- though there was plenty of light in both rooms. The 6th floor also had an older a/c unit (but in all fairness, the room was plenty cold).

4. Malin + Goetz shampoo- it's mint. Leave it on for a minute.

5. In case this matters, the television screens are the largest I've seen in any London hotel. This is my seventh trip to London and have stayed at many hotels.

6. The Ivy Cafe around the corner is fantastic and was recommended by the staff.

7. Bond Street is a skip, and if you blink you'll miss St. Christophe's Place.",5,2019,07,29
123,the Best hotel in London,"i have just return from 3 nights at this hotel and this is the best hotel in London ,the breakfast was so amazing the rooms are very clean and  well design and the service is the best . Theano from the guest relations  is so amazing and made our stay! she was so helpful and took care of everything we needed!!!can't wait to come back again .the location is the best close to everything!! ...the hotel is much above all expectation!!!",5,2019,07,28
123,Great Hotel in an Amazing Location,"The Marylebone is a really stylish, well maintained hotel in the centre of London, close to everything that London has to offer.  It's about 10 minutes from Oxford Street shopping and very close to many amazing restaurants and shops in the Marylebone area and to all the major sites.  The staff at the hotel are very friendly and accommodating and the restaurant at the hotel is excellent for any meal.  They have complimentary fruit infused water in the lobby which is a nice touch!

The only thing to be careful about is choosing a room.  The cozy room is just that.  The room itself is ok for max two people but the bathroom is barely big enough for one.  It is very poorly designed and is difficult for even one person to get into.  It would be advisable to install a sliding door to get into the bathroom since otherwise, it's hard to get in without touching the toilet.  We were fortunate that we were able to move up into a somewhat larger room, that was extremely well furnished, spacious and recently renovated.  We loved our stay at the Marylebone and would definitely return again and recommend it.",5,2019,07,27
123,Amazing hotel in an ideal location ,"This Hotel is in an amazing location, close to shops/ restaurants and public transport.
Caroline Maloney and Malachy the Duty Manager we’re extremely welcoming and helpful during our stay. Birthday treats were a fabulous touch.
Breakfast the second morning was an absolute delight being serviced by Oana, she was so helpful and informative and really made us feel comfortable and at home. 
Concierge team at the door we’re amazing, we stayed during extreme temperatures  in London and every time we came in or out they were on hand with cool water to keep us comfortable in the heat. 
All in all a great hotel, thoroughly enjoyed our stay! Thank you. ",5,2019,07,27
123,Superb ,"Great location close to everything. 
Clean , cosy and welcoming hotel which feels like home . 
Very friendly staff but very professional same time . From the first minute  Gunther made us feel very special, and took care of all our requests .
We stayed only 2 nights and it was my first time but definitely coming back as soon as possible. 

",5,2019,07,26
123,"Cannot fault the hotel or staff, stunning stylish & dapper","The view from our room was like a scene from Mary Poppins - it was just missing Dick Van Dyke! The short walk to Oxford street is via the prettiest streets I have seen in London, lots of varying period styles all sitting together beautifully.

The interior of the hotel is a feast for the eyes, if you like interior design. It is also practical, inviting and extremely comfortable. Gunther & the other staff we had the pleasure of interacting with were so very welcoming and helped some friends have a truly enjoyable catch up.

Thank you all at the Marylebone",5,2019,07,26
123,Most Recently,"My most recent stay at the Marylebone was a great experience. The staff was excellent, friendly and accommodating. This will be my preferred hotel the next time that I visit London, UK. 

PS - Jojo Ramos did a phenomenal job at communicating with guests and making them feel welcome.",5,2019,07,24
123,Incredible property in comfortable oasis,"Truly enjoyed our stay at the Marylebone. The hotel is spotless, the furniture seems new, the service is friendly and approachable and never haughty. It's a nice pair of jeans, nice shoes, t-shirt or sweater kind of place that feels like home, and never stuffy. The terrace suite was incredible, with peaceful views above the rooftops. The room service was probably the fastest I've ever encountered, and the food is quality. I would stay here again for sure.",5,2019,07,23
123,Home from home!,"I spend over 250 days a year away from home but have never written a travel review before. But after staying at The Marylebone (formerly The Clifton Ford) for over 30 years, I feel I owe it to them and myself. This home from home and although I have seen staff come and go, the people who work there are consistently welcoming and accommodating; some have even become 'friends'. I have stayed on every floor and sampled every type of room on offer there, including the one in the above photo. They are all consistently well furnished and comfortable to the point of cosy. I can also recommend its 108 brasserie and restaurant, well above the usual hotel restaurant with its compact but consistently good menu ranging from salads to a hard-to-resist fish n'chips - diet or no diet. The associate gym has a great pool. This is a medium sized hotel with a boutique feeling, a look of its own and super nice staff with endless patience. Truly a 'bijou' location perfect for business, with its comfortable and intimate lounge, and perfect for shopping nearby Marylebone High St and Selfridges. I can truly recommend this hotel.",5,2019,07,23
123,"Excellent, friendly hotel","Stayed here just one night in a newly refurbished room that was comfortable, clean and had every  amenity that you would need. We had lunch at the 108 Brasserie which was so delicious that we ate here the following day before heading back home. The crispy fingerling potatoes are very addictive! But the best thing about this hotel is the staff. Everyone from the doormen, reception staff, restaurant staff and management were professional, friendly and welcoming. Thank you, we will be back.",5,2019,07,22
123,Fantastic reception and warm and friendly staff,"We stayed here with our two toddlers aged 4 and 2 and our nanny. The hotel staff could not have been more accommodating. The children were welcomed with teddy bears and gifts, fruit juices, and the brilliant reservations team found us two adjoining rooms on the top floor. They prepared the beds for the children including an additional cot.

We stay in many hotels but the front desk team and the porters at the Marylebone really are outstanding.

We also dined in the 108 Brasserie which is really a treat in every sense. The breakfasts are also world class and not be missed.

A special shout out to Gunther who went out of his way to make our trip really memorable.

Looking forward to returning!",5,2019,07,22
123,I Loved It Here,"The Marylebone made me happy every step of the way!
An American relative who's lived in London for 3 years gave me a strong recommendation after she & her husband stayed here following a late-evening event.  She said ""It's a gem & you will love it.""
I'm so glad I took her advice, but it was the Marylebone staff that really convinced me. I called a few times to get information on sight seeing, distance to landmarks etc. (My first trip to London) & every single interaction was so incredibly helpful.
And once I arrived, the staff here has been so gracious & welcoming.  I loved the location, but when you're out of your own element, you really want people to make you feel cared for & warm.  They do that here.",5,2019,07,22
123,"Amazingly stylish, comfortable & central hotel. ","From check in to check out every part of our stay was fabulous. Gunther and staff at front desk were so helpful. We received a beautifully modeled room with views to die for! The location is without fault, a mere stroll from Oxford Circus. 

",5,2019,07,21
123,Love staying at The Marylebone - great staff,"One of my favourite places to stay - the staff are so friendly and helpful and as a frequent guest at the hotel I'm a familiar face to many of them. Gunther in particular always goes out of his way to make my stay as enjoyable as possible, and is great at remembering my preferences. He's a fantastic ambassador for The Marylebone!",5,2019,07,20
123,"Lovely stay, lovely neighborhood","We had a wonderful four-night stay at the Marylebone Hotel.  Our family had two adjoining rooms, both well-appointed and comfortable.  The hotel is in a healthy and vibrant neighborhood, and there’s certainly a cost attached to that (but I do not know enough about London to speak of cost comparison).  The daily breakfast with full service was an excellent option for our family and there was plenty from which to choose for both the meal and for coffee and tea.  The fitness center was beyond anything I’ve ever seen before in my travels—definitely a full-functioning business that Marylebone guests have the privilege to use.  Service is obviously a first priority at the Marylebone Hotel, and our stay in London was lovely because of the staff’s time and attention towards its guests.

Definitely take advantage of the afternoon tea at least once--especially if you're traveling from a place where tea is not a tradition.",5,2019,07,20
123,Sparkling Gem of a Hotel w/ a GREAT Location!,"My husband and I spent three summer nights at The Marylebone and loved everything about this modern, well-situated, full-service boutique hotel. From the moment we arrived, we were made to feel at ease with light refreshments and assistance with early check-in. Our room was a good size, bed so comfortable and the bathroom quite ample for our needs. We loved the restaurant, 108 Brasserie, especially the patio dining and the room service - excellent midnight desserts! The neighborhood is absolutely fantastic, so many things nearby - the Wallace Collection, the Sunday Farmer's Market, Selfridges, Soho, and Mayfair. What really makes this hotel special is the ever attentive staff. Finally, while few boutique hotels have taxis waiting, but I noticed there were always 1 or 2 right outside the hotel door at all hours of the day, which is really convenient when needed.  We are so glad we stayed at The Marylebone, we will definitely be back!",5,2019,07,19
123,Charming Boutique Hotel in Fantastic Location,"Recently, I've tried quite a few boutique hotels both in London and NY and the Marylebone certainly met my expectations.  I decided to the Marylebone due to its location (I love the area) and due to its Tripadvisor rating.  I had previously stayed at its sister hotel in May (The Bloomsbury) but was extremely disappointed as the room was tiny and dark and the service was poor.  However, the service at the Marylebone has been excellent, including Rodane at check in, who was very gracious.  While my cosy room was small, it was adequate for 3 nights and still bigger than the room that I had at its sister hotel and much bigger than my recent room in NY at The Evelyn Hotel.  The two best things about this hotel is its location to shopping/cafes in Marylebone AND that it is connected to a fantastic gym.  Most boutique hotels have sad little gyms with 1-2 old treadmills but in the basement of The Marylebone is a professional gym with state of the art equipment and professional classes.  There is also a fantastic salad shop (The Good Life) across the street.  This will definitely be my London hotel for business trips.",5,2019,07,19
123,"Great Hotel, Location and Amenities","A very nice room in a lovely hotel in a great location. The rooms are clean and well maintained. We enjoyed the breakfast, included with our room, which was extensive and delicious. The staff is helpful particularly, Gunther who enhanced our week by recommending several excellent reasonably priced restaurants for dinner.",5,2019,07,18
123,A well located hotel.,The Marylebone Hotel is well situated in Welbeck Street off Oxford Street. You can walk to most sights from here.  The rooms are on the small side but there is plenty of storage space and they are clean and the beds comfortable.  The turndown service with chocolates and water is a nice touch.  The continental buffet breakfast is adequate.,5,2019,07,17
123,Great Hotel for a Family Trip to London,"Spent a long weekend in London with the misses and three kids - Gunther, the hotel manager, couldn’t have been a better host!  He knew all of the kids names on arrival and even had gifts tailored to each’s interests.   Would highly recommend this hotel for anyone traveling with children. ",5,2019,07,17
123,Marylebone hotel stay,"The hotel is very welcoming and well managed. The size already makes it feel like home and I've rarely been so impressed by the staff, from the 1st steps out of the cab (thanks again Andrei) to the front desk and the cleaning personnel. Each greats you with a smile and a nice word. They are also very helpful in solving issues. The hotel is super clean on top of that. I highly recommend. ",5,2019,07,17
123,"I can't say enough great things about this hotel! BEST place to stay in London. Staff amazing, gorgeous, great local.","I adore this hotel. The hotel public spaces (of which there are many) are GORGEOUS. The staff is kind, attentive, generous and helpful. They accommodate anything you could want with a smile, an offer to assist and generally making you feel at home. All the gents at the front door were so lovely & helpful to me and my young son. I stay for work and not only can the location not be beat, the bar & public space are great for meetings. The breakfast is terrific in a sunlight brasserie. Rooms appointed and quiet. Good fitness option, you can take a quick elevator ride to Third Space gym in the same building with free entry and a gorgeous pool. Close by is Pscyle for spin classes. I have high standards for hotels for sure as I travel a lot for work and fun. This hotel meets every possible bar and higher. I give a special shout out to Toby Brown in Guest Relations, what a lovely person who truly assisted me in a bind recently. I have stayed in a quite few hotels in London, from the famed Langham to hip hotels like Sanderson and this is still my favorite of all. Mostly because of the staff, but also because of the lovely restaurant and the stunning Art Deco decor of all the public spaces. And again, the location is just fab as it is walkable to incredible restaurants (Delamina and Ivy two favs), a great high-street for shopping and just about anything you could want. It is the best of London wrapped up in one location and one terrific hotel. ",5,2019,07,16
123,Business Meeting went off without a hitch,"When in London we like to meet at the Marylebone.  The location, staff and service are first rate.  Biana, Otto and Po went above and beyond to insure our meeting went off without a hitch. Thank you. The Marylebone is our go to London hotel.  Great location with the professional service we appreciate.  We'll be back ... again and again.",5,2019,07,16
123,"Amazing bar, very attentive and friendly ","This was a casual business meeting and, as usual, ticks every box; a hushed but pleasant atmosphere with well-spaced tables allowing conversation to be had. Art Deco and top quality service from Demitry.",5,2019,07,15
123,Birthday dinner venue - amazing organisation and service,"We picked the 108 Snug private room thanks to Adlen whom we were lucky enough to bump into when we were looking for places to celebrate my husband’s birthday. From the get go Adlen was professional, welcoming and genuinely interested in what we were looking for.  Importantly for me, she and her team (including Sara on the evening) had high attention to detail, were incredibly organised and were utterly charming throughout.  Nothing was too much effort and she and the team went out of their way to accommodate flower requests, my late pre-ordering (!) and cake questions.  Our guests had a fantastic evening, in no small part thanks to Adlen and team. We wouldn’t hesitate to recommend The Marylebone!!",5,2019,07,15
123,Looking forward to a return stay!,"Our experience at The Marleybone and its restaurant 108 Brasserie was a real joy. The room accommodations were fabulous, the location was great, and the restaurant had wonderful food.  Most of all, the service was unsurpassed.  Upon our arrival, Denis at reception went out of his way to show us around the hotel essentials; and when we needed advice on museum exhibitions, restaurants and the Underground, Michael the concierge was very patient and provided helpful insights.  We enjoyed nice cocktails at the end of the day; Aurelien at the hotel bar served up expert vodka martinis, and Sandija at the restaurant was extremely friendly and responsive to our needs at a moment’s notice.  Those whose names we did not get at the restaurant were all very professional – it was a real pleasure to be recognized as hotel guests after the first night and be treated well by them.   The well above average fitness center helped us work all this off in the morning. Definitely will be returning! ",5,2019,07,15
123,Making you feel special,"The staff from arrival at the door thru check in, bars, restaurants and just generally all exceptionally friendly and nothing too much trouble even though it was a really busy weekend in London with tennis, cricket, concerts etc.

Gunther and Toby treat the guests with 10 star treatment 
The Marylebone is our home from home!....",5,2019,07,14
123,A Gem!,"The Marylebone is my home away from home.  I have been going there every year, for several years.  

The staff is exceptional and truly goes above and beyond to make sure that their service far exceeds any expectation I could possibly have.  The very first staff member I met upon my initial arrival several years ago was Gunther.  He took it upon himself to oversee every single detail of my one month trip.  Gunther is easily one of the most customer-centric professionals in the hospitality business.  He is beyond spectacular!   When Gunther left London for a couple of years (although rumor has it that he is now back in London and at the Marylebone!), many of the wonderful Marylebone staff stepped in to ensure the best possible experience for me during each stay over the years.  Daniel is amazing -- always super knowledgeable and exceedingly helpful;  Brendan, who was stellar at anticipating and handling my many requests;  Rahim, Sujan, and so many other staff members who are always  extremely helpful, friendly, and exceedingly polite.    

The food at The Marylebone is excellent and room service is fantastic.  Esther and Ivo are total stars!  They always make the best suggestions and go out of their way to make sure the food and wine is always spot-on delicious and ensure super prompt and cheerful room service. 

It is no surprise that the staff is so exceptional, given that the GM, Garreth, and his assistant, Alicia, are top-notch and set the standard of perfection for the entire hotel.

123,Marleybone in July 2019,"We had a wonderful stay - beautiful suite - helpful and genial staff - breakfast was fantastic.Excellent location. It was a bit expensive - but it was a busy weekend in London - Pride Parade and Wimbledon - and when I checked the website just now the prices were more reasonable by about 100 pounds a night for the suite. Jacopo at reception and checkout was lovely, as were the bartenders and servers at breakfast and at the brasserie. My husband really enjoyed the pool and sauna. They also gave us another 2 hours to checkout as soon as we asked, which was very helpful to us. All the staff were friendly - on leaving one of the staff who was helping us into the cab ran back into the hotel to bring us bottles of water for the trip. We would definetely go back.",5,2019,07,14
123,Wonderful location and service,"Me and my family are utterly happy with our last visit at the Marylebone Hotel. We would especially like to thank Jacopo for his kind service and help at the reception. We will be back soon!
Highly recommend this hotel - never been disappointed.",5,2019,07,14
123,Lovely,"I stayed two nights at the beginning of a week in London and The Marylebone is absolutely lovely. It's not a budget option, but you get the accommodation and service you would expect with the price. The room was spacious, spotless, and perfectly equipped. The bed was probably the most comfortable I've ever had in a hotel. Service is exceptional in every way. And I was actually surprised by how quiet it was inside the hotel. I'm very noise sensitive and often have difficulty sleeping in hotels, especially in cities. That was not the case here. It was perfectly quiet and lovely!",5,2019,07,12

123,Always a great place to stay,"Recent refurbishments to some floors have made already good rooms even better. Sure, some rooms are a little on the small side, but this is central London.

123,Excellent experience ,"My daughter and I stayed here twice- at the start of our 3 week trip and then again at the end. It was truly the best hotel we experienced.

123,Terrific location and well run,"The hotel is in a terrific neighborhood, room was recently updated, lobby lounges and restaurant vibrant all day long.  The people who work there are very good at providing efficient and friendly hospitality.  Shout out to the manager Daniel who was exceptionally gracious in making sure our stay was good.  When booking room keep in mind some of them can be small, especially the bathroom.  Overall well run hotel in terrific neighborhood, great place for a stay in London while touring.",4,2019,07,10
123,Great position,"From the moment you arrive at The Marylebone you are impressed by the friendly, helpful staff.

123,LOVED IT!,The people and the service here are the BEST! Gunther Schildwachter is outstanding and personally attends to every detail. He thinks of everything and everyone and truly goes above and beyond. His Guest Relations team - Alasdair and Daniel - are terrific. Concierge Rahim is extremely professional and everyone from Godwin the doorman to room service to all those in the breakfast room /restaurant/bar gives a smile with genuine warmth. I had previously stayed in a very famous hotel in Mayfair for many years but switched to the Marylebone for its Staff and service which is above and beyond. Truly a gem.,5,2019,07,09
123,My (always sunny and warm) UK home-away-from-home,"I regret writing this review as I feel that all of Mayfair will now defect to Marylebone, but here goes...the best kept secret: For years I frequented the Connaught. And the Dorchester, too.  And then Mayfair changed.  The tone changed.  Carlos Way and the surrounding streets saw the disappearance of the butcher, the baker and the quaint restaurants as designer labels moved in.  An unexpected 'chill' to the people moved in, too.

Then I discovered the Marylebone by pure accident when my publisher put me up at the Bloomsbury hotel (also wonderful) and I learned that the Marylebone was their 'sister' hotel.  Since then I have come to rely on its warm and inviting feel, it's contemporary/funky interior as well as it's well-appointed rooms.  If you can sneak a night in the rooftop suite/penthouse it's to die for.  The outside terrace overlooks the city.  

Toby Brown and  his colleague, Gunther, make me feel at home after a long journey on a red eye flight.  They're everything and more that a hotel would want to represent them.  Bespoke, elegant and somehow timeless despite being young and energized.  And btw, Jacob under-pressure-and-handling-desk-check-ins is kind, and comical and well, Italian. Everything is a happy occasion for Jacob. Even at 6 in the morning.  Together the team makes every visit at UK home away from home all that any American (or European) could ask for.    I only hope after this review they will still have a vacancy for me. ",5,2019,07,09
123,Wonderful family stay,"Wonderful family stay that we had experienced a week ago! Staff was very helpful en friendly. They went the extra mile, We would definitely return as the location, value for money and friendlyness was well appreciated. The location was superb and we felt super safe walking around. ",5,2019,07,09
123,Great friendly service @ The Marylebone Hotel,"Gunter the guest relations manager goes above and beyond to make guests feel welcome and happy! He is all customer centric in his approach. The staff at the front bar and even the doormen are super helpful. Hotel is well appointed and in a great central location near good shopping and restaurants.  Will definitely return for great service!
",5,2019,07,09
123,One night stay.,"The staff could not have been more courteous. At 2.30am, Carlos the Night porter, went above and beyond the call of duty, he confirmed that the nut mix that was being consumed by the group, was gluten free. Go Carlos. All the staff are extremely friendly and the hotel is spotless, food tip top and the drinks plentiful.",5,2019,07,09
123,Outstanding Service,"My husband and I along with our 2 young children recently stayed one night at the Marylebone London.
Theano Karathanasopoulou and her friendly staff made every effort to go above and beyond to make our stay comfortable, memorable and family friendly. My eldest daughter was having so much fun she didn’t want to leave. We cannot wait to go back!",5,2019,07,08
123,Excellent Stay,"My husband and I spent 7 nights at The Marylebone.  We had a great stay. The neighborhood has good restaurants and pubs, and the hotel is in walking distance to the Bond St underground. But what made it special was after a long day of sightseeing we stopped each night at the cocktail bar for a drink before we went to bed. Thanks to Csaba for making sure we got something to eat that first night (food was delicious) and to Nicolas for creating wonderful bourbon drinks and rum drinks for us. Both Csaba and Nicolas were wonderful to talk to each night, and later in the week Aurelien took over as bartender and added his touch to the specialty drinks. I highly recommend to visit them for a drink or two. ",5,2019,07,07
123,Warm welcome to London,"This was my first trip to London and it was wonderful. Was so relaxing and welcoming and the hotel staff were the best. Shoutout to Jojo Ramos and the man with the pretty eyes, Andrei. My family loved our stay!",5,2019,07,07
123,Wonderful stay,"My husband and I stayed three nights over our July 4th holiday weekend. We were so blown away by the hotel's decor, our delicious late lunch at one of the restaurants, but we were most impressed with the service. There are so many thoughtful touches -- from the neighborhood walking tours and other room snacks -- to the room switch that was provided, we were cared for quite thoughtfully. Thank you to Theano and her team.",5,2019,07,07
123,Wonderful hotel & bar,"We loved this hotel.  The staff was very friendly and it was conveniently located to everywhere we wanted to go in London.

Room was small but well appointed.  Our bathroom was really (!!!) small -hard to get in and close the door without smashing into the toilet - or something.  I would definitely stay there again but I would get a larger room.

We went to the bar(s).  The one in the back was more of a scene.  Hard to get the bartender's attention but the drinks were great.  The front bar, across from reception, was a more laid back, chill environment and the drinks were just as good and the waiters were MUCH friendlier and attentive.",5,2019,07,07
123,Marylebone stay,"Another great stay at Marylebone hotel. I have to admit when I visit the hotel it doesn't seem as if I have left home. Everyone at the hotel is so helpful and all your requirements are taken care of with great ease. I would never consider staying elsewhere in London. Mr Gunther, thank you again for taking excellent care of us and see again in Sept. 

Regards 
Ahsan",5,2019,07,06
123,One night stay,"We only stayed one night in a cosy room, but absolutely loved it! It was a better experience than the bigger hotels. Bed was awesome, breakfast was delish and plenty of options, staff were down to earth friendly and helpful! Shout out too andrei assisting us with luggage to our car and around nice guy! Location is spot on walking distance to restaurants and shops. Definitely worth the stay!!!",5,2019,07,06
123,Lovely hotel in cute neighborhood,"We had a very nice stay at The Marylebone Hotel.  We found the staff to be friendly, helpful and courteous.  The hotel is pretty, has a nice lobby, and ample space downstairs for lounging, drinks, waiting, etc. (including some outdoor space).  The bistro was nice with more lovely outdoor space, and the food was decent (not amazing but worth it if you have a food & beverage credit).

The room was nice, well-appointed and bright.  Bed was comfortable.  The big complaint we had was the comically inefficient set-up of the tiny bathroom.  It's a REALLY small bathroom, which is not unexpected in Europe, but the killer is that (at least for our room), the door opens INTO the tiny bathroom.  This meant if either of us wanted the use the sink while the other was showering, we needed to either keep the door all the way open (which effectively trapped the person in the shower) or all the way closed (which made the bathroom hot and steamy).  It would have been VASTLY improved by an outward opening door or a pocket door or barn door style.  Us bumping into each other both trying to get ready to go out was quite silly.

Housekeeping was slightly less attentive than we would have liked (left used coffee glass in our room for the entire stay), but the downstairs staff was great.  Had a small maintenance issue which was dealt with promptly and courteously.  All in all, definitely satisfied.

I would definitely recommend the neighborhood.  I have been to London half a dozen or so times before, but not stayed in Marylebone before.  Lots of lovely shops and restaurants nearby.  Not too far a walk to the Bond Street tube.

All in all, a solid hotel for a reasonable price in a cute neighborhood in London.  We would strongly consider staying here again the next time we are in town.",4,2019,07,05
123,Extraordinary service!,"This is my third stay at the Marylebone, and I wasn't
disappointed! Although the hotel was crowded, Gunther (ask for him, he is the best!) came to the bar while I was having one of their exquisite cocktails to check in about my room and make sure I was comfortable! The service was unbelievable, everyone was so polite and helpful and of course, the place itself is charming as ever. My room was one of the newly renovated ones and I had the best night of sleep in ages! I can't recommend this hotel or Gunther more highly!",5,2019,07,04
123,Beautiful Hotel,I stayed here with my daughter while we were visiting London and we both absolutely loved the hotel.  Our room was bigger than many others in London and was clean and comfortable.  After a day of shopping and visiting Wembley stadium for a concert this was an absolutely welcome sanctuary.  Breakfast on the pavement at the Brassiere and cocktails at the bar are a must.  The only slight negative (and I mean slight) was that the reception area was very busy on arrival and didn't feel organised but it was the hottest day of the year so far and there were plenty of ice cold water available.,5,2019,07,04
123,Very stylish,"We spent two nights here as a couple.
The room was small but it was the public areas which were so charming.
This area is a lovely spot in London.
Marylebone high st is great for shopping. It’s a central area but feels quite residential. Which gives it a more intimate feel.
The decor is so stylish . Delightful velvet covered chairs and couches with soft lighting make you feel cosy and comfortable.
The included breakfast is good with the full English breakfast very substantial.
We visited the nearby Chiltern Firehouse for a fabulous meal.
Quite pricey but recommended.
",4,2019,07,02
123,Great stay,"The hotel is in a very good location being a short walk from oxford street. We came for a short break but had a great time at the hotel, the staff were lovely and very attentive and the ambience of the hotel was fantastic. We will be returning.",5,2019,07,02
123,Private dining Long room II,"Wedding dinner for family: Thank you to Lia and the team for making this such a wonderful evening. There was quite a lot to sort in advance and Lia made it all painless. Everything went perfectly. 

The menu was agreed ahead of time. There were lots of small thoughtful personal touches that all added up. The food was great. All the guests were complimentary about the whole experience,  dining and staying at the hotel. Thanks also to Otto who kept everything running smoothly on the night. A great venue for this type of event with brilliant people on the staff.",5,2019,07,02
123,10/10,"I have visited the bar recently, and it went through a lot of changes since my last visit. I live nearby and from now on it is one of my favourite places to visit. Friend of mine was visiting me for a couple of days, and he was absolutely delighted with service provided, exceptional drinks and general atmosphere. Dmitry and the team made us feel very welcome, we couldn’t find cocktails we normally would drink, but Dmitry has made a few suggestions, and all of the drinks were fantastic. We tried some twist on an old fashioned with rum, and then he made an amazing tropical drink off the menu, and it was a pure joy. I will be visiting the bar again, as an impression made was absolutely fantastic.",5,2019,07,02
123,Always first cabin -- not a thing to improve!,"I have been staying at The Marylebone for years, and it goes from strength to strength!

The staff -- from the bellmen at the front door, to the front desk, to room service, maid service, restaurants, gym, concierge --it's all perfect. The always friendly, helpful, ""I love my job and want you to be happy/ can-do"" attitude is pervasive, and I have never encountered a single staffer who did not attend to me in this positive manner. It means everything.
 
The restaurants (tea room, 108 Brasserie, front bar/lounge) are all superbly run and offer excellent food and beverages.
 
The rooms are marvelous and well planned -- I wish ALL hotels would think to put a switch reading light right above the pillows, so one need not fumble about in the dark in a new place!
 
The gym is clean, bright, welcoming and beautifully equipped, and I have never seen such a luxurious ""locker room"" for women, with every amenity one could ask for.

 All in all, I consider the hotel my ""home away from home"", and I cannot imagine staying anywhere else. The location is superb, and the ""pitch perfect"" ambiance -- never stuffy, but never crowded/noisy -- is what I call the very best.
 
I read these words by Jeffries Blackerby, Editor-in-Chief of Departures Magazine, in the latest issue, which said, ""The smallest thoughtful gesture takes on huge significance when you've entrusted much of your well-being to people you don't really know. They become a kind of temporary surrogate family, a kind of home. And like home, a hotel does much more than provide comfort: It's a place from which you can launch yourself into the unknown, a space that prepares you to take on the world."" This perfectly sums up how I feel about the staff of this remarkable hotel!

I must also thank Gunther Schildwachter and Long Voong, who assisted me with my reservations this trip.",5,2019,06,30
123,Anniversary,"We have just returned home, after having a fabulous weekend. I can't recommend the Marylebone enough, and the staff were amazing, and so friendly. Jacob on reception, was very attentive, upgraded our room, and we had a lovely suprise of champagne and chocolates, it made for a perfect weekend. Looking forward to a return visit in the Autumn",5,2019,06,30
123,Still terrific after 20 years,We have stayed here every 1-2 years for nearly 20 years and it never disappoints. The staff (everyone from the doormen to housekeeping) are unfailingly friendly and polite. They were particularly helpful when we needed documents scanned and printed.  I'd like to give a special shout-out to Gunther who always welcomes us like old friends and makes us feel like we really are home.,5,2019,06,30
123,June trip to London,"Always a great pleasure staying at the Merylbone whenever in London

Feels like home.
Always clean, trustworthy staff. 
Great neighborhood that is just few minutes away from major attractions. 
Gunther Schildwachter is always there to help by going above and beyond !",5,2019,06,29
123,Perfect stay in my favourite city,"I had a wonderful four nights here on my way to South Africa; being that London is one of my very favourite places it made sense to stop here to break the long journey.
Upon check in I was upgraded to a bigger room - always a very pleasant surprise!
Friends also stayed at the hotel for my last 2 nights and had the same favourable opinion.

Location could not be better, staff were unfailingly friendly and helpful. I especially enjoyed Godwin the doorman who greeted me each day and had a little chat.
Breakfast in the 108 Pantry was very good and I also enjoyed a decadent and beautifully presented afternoon tea in this cozy space.
I had dinner at the bar in the 108 Brasserie one night and can recommend the Pear, stilton, fennel salad and the yummy fish and chips!
My room was comfy and had everything I needed.
I can't wait to return!",5,2019,06,29
123,Exceptional service!,"I have stayed several times in The Marylebone hotel. It's always a pleasure. This time we had a nice family room. The staff is service minded and Gunther is always doing all in his power to meet any needs or inquires. 

The children love the chromecast tv for netflix. The swimming pool and gym is of highest quality, and the food is fresh and tasty. The Marylebone is high quality all over. I am looking forward to my next stay.",5,2019,06,29
123,Helpful folks,"The Marylebone is a great place to stay because it is located near lots of shops and eateries and medical services which we require during our annual visits.  The folks who work at the restaurant and bar are attentive and the front desk is very helpful.  Maria and Agochie at the Third Space spa gave great advice and relaxing treatments while Jojo at the front door gave us a warm reception.  I think her name is Mrs. Chat, the Thai lady at the 108 Pantry, who gives us the friendliest welcome and remembers us each time we return.  She is the best asset of the hotel!",5,2019,06,28
123,Great location,"The rooms are a little small, but overall a great hotel, friendly, helpful and a great location.
The bars are very busy at night and a fun atmosphere. We were traveling with our 10 year old granddaughter and she enjoyed her stay there also.",5,2019,06,28
123,Always a great visit!,"I just love pass through the Marylebone hotel at the end of my day. It is a perfect ending to a busy day. The relaxing experience starts with the entrance hallway. It has an amazing perfume and ambience. And if I am lucky, Gunther is there with a wonderful warm smile to say a quick hello. The cocktails at the 108 are just something out of this world. The bartenders always have very good suggestions and I really enjoy trying the drink of the month. At the lobby bar I always have the Ruinart. I deeply recommend the mini burgers! Or the beautiful tomato salad.",5,2019,06,27
123,Great Hotel!,"The hotel is renovated, the rooms are nice and very clean. The location is superb! They have a juice bar and an amazing bar with good appetizers. The restaurant is also very good, and they offer 24h room service, with good selection of food. I originally went for work and decided to extend my stay for a couple more days on pleasure. The amenities are really a plus, with a Nespresso machine in room, yoga class at gym, the spa... They have all I needed. The service is impeccable, from the door holders (that offered umbrellas and always had a smile on their faces) to the bartenders! A special thanks to the guest relations manager Gunther. I will definitely go back to this hotel, which became my place to stay in London!",5,2019,06,27

great service. Would like to recommend the concierge manager Gunther Schildwatcher he have us so much help. Great patience.

123,As usual service impeccable,"Booked a room for my wife and daughter and as usual they were treated with special care with an excellent room availability and personal service from Gunther the Guest Relations Manager. He made sure everything was perfect and made the stay effortless.
Check in, door staff as usual efficient and nothing too much trouble. I always comment about the bar and the brasserie but again didn't let them down and a great time to be in this ""oasis"".",5,2019,06,26
123,The Marylebone Hotel,"Very much enjoyed our 3 night stay in June. Breakfast (Full English and smoked salmon & scrambled eggs) and lunch (Steak & Tiger prawn curry) were both great. Our room was neat and tidy. Smart tv in the room to sync your devices and a whole load of channels. The gym is exceptional; fully loaded with all the gear. I had a tour of the hotel and the Terrace suites are pretty spectacular. Was very happy with the F&B outlets. Location is spot on, a short walk to Bond Street station & Oxford Street but a safe distance to enjoy a village type feel. Would certainly stay again.",5,2019,06,26
123,Amazing Guest Relations Manager,"I made a reservation at this hotel for 4 nights for the Deluxe Room. Upon arriving at the hotel at 4 pm to check-in, I experienced a frustrating delay of 40-45 minutes due to a problem with their system and the booking. I explained my concerns to Theano, the acting Guest Relations Manager at the time. 

Theano was very professional in handling the situation and was very kind throughout the entire experience I had with her. I was quite impressed with the level of professionalism she showed in understanding the initial experience I had with their hotel and did everything in her power to make sure I have the upmost positive experience during my stay. She made it her duty to ensure I enjoyed everything about my stay from the upgraded room, to the complimentary breakfast, and all the way to the room service dinner I ordered by providing some deserts and adding a pleasant letter!

Unlike other hotels where you would speak to the manager once and that's all you heard from them. Theano kept in touch with me throughout the entire stay and showed her importance of keeping guests happy. Her attention to detail is what sets her apart and really is the best part of this hotel if you're fortunate to meet her.

The staff here are nice and the breakfast was pleasant. The Deluxe room is actually quite nice even though Theano provided an upgrade for the trouble I experienced. 

It's the way Theano handled the situation that makes this a 5/5 star hotel.",5,2019,06,25
123,Perfect stay,"We stayed with my wife over a weekend for a break. The hotel is a gem in the heart of London. The staff is of exceptional kindness and happy to fulfill your every wish. 
From the minute they welcome you at check in to the moment you check out their main concern is to keep you happy. The Guest Relationship Manager, Ms  Theano Karathanasopoulou, that welcomed us was very warm and concerning in providing us our room and to cater our every need. 
The room we stayed was brand new , spacious and very nicely decorated with huge TV  and amenities . 
Would stay there every time we are in London. ",5,2019,06,24
123,Summer holiday in London ,"I stayed at the Marylebone hotel for 10 days in June 2019. My stay was not only comfortable but rather simply wonderful. Gunther and his team ensured that we had a superb 10 days with them. We were also gifted a prosecco on our anniversary. That was pretty much like icing on the cake :) the staff at the marylebone is really hospitable and helpful. They also give great local advice and suggestions. Hey are located in Central London which is a very comfortable walk to most of the famous eateries and shops. Besides, The Marylebone themselves boasts of a really lively brassiere and bar called 108 marylebone. Now that I’ve stayed here, I. Sng imagine living anywhere else on my next visit to London. ",5,2019,06,24
123,Superb spot!,We enjoyed a gorgeous stay at this fabulous and very welcoming hotel! Our Suite was extremely comfortable and very well appointed whilst the cocktail bar and breakfast was superb. Highly recommended. If you are looking for an elegant and luxurious location for a stay in central London - look no further than The Marylebone!,5,2019,06,23
123,Superb!!!*****,"We travelled to London for family vacations and we booked at The Marylebone for 4 stays. It was an exceptional experience. From the beginning it is evident that the stuff is making everything possible to make your stay comfortable and easy. Everybody was polite and hospitable. Theano (guest relations) is exceptional!!!! Instantly you realize that she is genuinely hospitable. 
The mattresses were excellent, the rooms are renovated and super clean. The breakfast has an offering of many different dishes covering all tastes. The location is close to everything (3 minutes walk to Oxford) making it ideal for either business or holiday stays. 
I undoubtedly recommend the hotel and when I’m back to London I’ll choose The Marylebone for my stay. Thanks The Marylebone team (and Theano, of course!) for everything!!!",5,2019,06,23
123,Perfect London vacation,"The difference between a great hotel and an amazing hotel is the staff. The Marleybone exceeded our expectations in every way possible. From the moment we arrived for our week long vacation we were always treated like the most important guests in the hotel. After arriving off a 12 hour flight from Argentina early in the morning we were giving key card to access the gym and spa to shower and start our day. When we arrived back in the afternoon at check in time our room was unfortunately not ready. Though the delay was only 40 mins past check in .. Gunther, the guest relations manager, was there to great us and offer his apologies as well as a glass of wine at the bar. Through out the week Gunther made sure we had reservations for dinner or just simply to ask how our day was going.
It was the warm welcome of Gunther and the entire staff the the Marylebone that made our vacation so perfect. We will certainly be back again!",5,2019,06,22
123,Last minute check in ...,I'm a travel agency based in the USA and came to London last minute without a reservation.

Enjoyed the entire experience and the location is fantastic..,5,2019,06,22
123,Can’t decide between a city or resort vacation?,"If you want both a city and a resort vacation, The Marylebone London is your solution. Gunther will welcome you warmly and organize your stay in this city hotel with all the amenities of a resort set in one of London’s most charming neighborhoods.

Having stayed here for many years I am always impressed on how the physical facilities are constantly being improved while the personnel remain fresh and eager to please. This is London’s best hotel find.",5,2019,06,21
123,Better every time,"I've stayed at ""The Marylebone"" many times, and every time had a thing or two to complain about...

This time , I stayed 10 days and everything was perfect , and I'm so happy about it, because I  intend to stay many more times there!

I just love this Hotel, location, rooms and staff, regarding staff I must mention Guest Relation manager Gunther Schildwachter, he's excellent and I'm quite sure  the improvements on service and details are due to him.

I also would like to mention Juan on maintenance who helped a lot when I need it.

Coming back next October.",5,2019,06,20

123,Lovely ,"Centrally located in Marylebone within walking distance of a wide range of shops and restaurant.

I thought the rooms were small and it can get a little stuffy if the A/C is not running (which has an automatic shutoff) Keeping the window open was the simplest solution bearing with the outside noise.

The furniture provided is the least practical given the size of the room. For instance, the television should be mounted on the wall to free the desk space. 

The navigation system on the television is rather slow which  can be a somewhat frustrating.

The restroom is also quite cozy and the bathtub should be removed to allow for a more spacious shower.

The bed are too soft in my opinion (that’s a personal preference) and a range of pillow options would be nice.

The access to the gym is definitely a plus. The gym features a pool and a spa. 

The lobby bar is decent and the staff quite friendly. The same can be said for the 108 pantry restaurant although I find the evening staff to be less friendly and/or disgruntled. 

The room service is usually quick with a few 24hour options including a fantastic club sandwich.

Overall, I think it is a great hotel minus a few details.",4,2019,06,15
123,Another top quality meeting,"This hotel is quickly becoming our go-to venue in London. The booking process through Cristina was straight forward and user-friendly, whilst the event itself was delivered to a high standards. The waiters Otto and Gergo were great, and really looked after our staff and customers. We look forward to our next event there!",5,2019,06,14
123,Everything from entrance greeting room and meal A1,"It is refreshing to have an experience from A to Z where people care. The meal in the Brasserie amazing and the staff outstanding. Bravo.
The greeting was across the street to get our bags, then recommendations for dinner. They said they had a famous chef and I said sure you do.
I never met the chef but the food was outstanding.",4,2019,06,13
123,"Great location, nice room, some hiccups","The Marylebone's location can't be beat, and though it's not cheap, it's definitely a bargain for the level of design, comfort and service in the area. Rooms are city-sized but well-designed. Public spaces are nice, though service is hit or miss. The gym is an independent fitness club, so the facilities are much more extensive than most hotel gyms. But we had an issue with the air conditioning in our room (yes, I know--sweaty Americans--but shouldn't we be able to alleviate our sweatiness?), and it was a constant struggle to get it fixed--some nights it was so warm in our room that we couldn't sleep. Opening the window didn't help--it was warm in London, and the street noise (from the hotel's own restaurant in part) was a problem. Cleaning staff opened all the windows every afternoon, so when we came back the room was often hot and humid. There are also some weird quirks--our room was down an incredibly long, narrow, weirdly designed hallway, for example; we found it difficult to get the room really dark, given window lights, automated night lights etc. So a mixed bag, but still a find for central London.",3,2019,06,13
123,A wonderful London hotel,We had a wonderful stay The Marylebone. Everything was top notch from the inviting scent when we walked through the door to the extremely helpful staff. The rooms are very comfortable and Gunther at the front desk couldn’t have been more helpful—managing to find rooms for us at the last minute when we inadvertently booked for the wrong night and then helping us get reservations for a wonderful dinner. A great experience all around!,5,2019,06,13
123,"The right mix of modern, luxury, and cozy.","The style and amenities of this place are dialed in, but the service is what makes it a true 5 star establishment. Gunther and his team know how to make any guest feel special. The rooms are well appointed and make a great use of space.",5,2019,06,13
123,Up and above from what I was expecting,"From the time of booking I got special attention and care from Mr. Gunther the guest relations manager. Gunther made sure that I got all the information I needed and his communication was easy and kind. 
The whole team was extremely accommodating. The room was clean and very comfortable. 
As far as dining goes, the breakfast was splendid. 

I will definitely be recommending this hotel to friends and family.

I would like once again to thank Mr. Gunther for going above and beyond for all my needs and making sure my stay here was the best it can be.

123,An amazing stay for our wedding guests!,The Marylebone is a hip and lovely hotel in the most charming neighborhood.  Great shopping and restaurants nearby and the bar and restaurant at the hotel is fabulous.  The service we received from Gunther was unparalleled as he made all of our guests feel welcome and special.  The health club is a huge benefit for a hotel in this area and even includes a lap pool.  We recommend the Marylebone to anyone for a special stay.,5,2019,06,10
123,June trip to UK,"This is my 2nd stay at the marylebone hotel. Again, they surpassed my expectations. Its a chic and cozy hotel just a short walk to oxford street. Its a quiet residential neighborhood. I would like to commend Jojo Ramos and all the staff of the hotel on taking care of my needs.  I would surely come and stay again. Cheers",5,2019,06,10
123,Wedding week at the Marylebone,We had a large group of guests who stayed at the Marylebone for several nights while participating in wedding activities around London. The Marylebone is a great location with great shopping and pubs nearby. The health club attached to the hotel is 1st class. The rooms are updated and hip. And the staff are professional and very welcoming. This is a great hotel at very competitive prices. Everyone one our guests were happy with their Marylebone experience with no complaints.,5,2019,06,10
123,Staycation at the Marylebone,"We are Londoners who thought of doing a staycation at a hotel in Marylebone, this was definitely the perfect choice. Intimate little hotel with great attention to service. Unfortunately, slight issues with the Chromecast function with the TV in the room which did not get resolved, which was a bit disappointing as we had planned to stay in the room for the majority of the afternoon for a movie marathon of sorts. But otherwise, great hotel located in the heart of Marylebone - a great part of London to discover even for Londoners who've been here a long time!",5,2019,06,10
123,Elegant hotel with wonderful service,"This is a very stylish and tastefully decorated hotel which is in a great location. There are plenty of cool places to eat, drink and shop in the vicinity. We took breakfast here which was good value with plenty of choice including lovely breads, freshly squeezed juice and fresh fruit. Our room was quite small but beautifully appointed. 

However the best part of our stay were the staff who were unfailingly polite and helpful. They anticipated our every need. Highly recommended. ",5,2019,06,10
123,Business meeting ,"I wasn’t here to stay the night, but I attended for a business meeting. The service was outstanding, both Otto and Petr gave excellent customer service, attended to everyone’s needs and ensured everything was in place for a smooth morning. The food was lovely and all freshly baked; they even packed some biscuits for me to take away. Such pleasant and friendly staff, made it a great morning. Thank you ! ",5,2019,06,10
123,"Marylebone Hotel, Welbeck Street, London","My wife and I have been regular guests at the Marylebone Hotel, Welbeck Street for many years.   Set in chic Marylebone village, this hotel is ideally located for the shopper as much as for the businessman, being a short walk from Oxford Street and a direct underground ride to the City and short bus ride to West End theatres. 
The rooms are spacious and comfortable and well equipped with firm and relaxing beds.   The hotel combines luxury and elegance and at the same time,  being relatively small in size, a friendly and intimate atmosphere. 
Breakfasts are lavish and the restaurant serves consistently good and interesting food.   The bar area known as 108 offers a vibrant and exciting ambience every day of the week as, apart from it being used by hotel guests, it seems to be the favourite meeting point for young professional and business people in the area. 
The Marylebone offers guests the use of a first class gym with its own 25 meter pool adjacent to the hotel. 
The staff at all levels are friendly and helpful and it is a joy being so genuinely assisted by them.    Without detracting from anyone, I want to make special mention of one of the managers, Gunther, who always seems to be on duty and ready at hand to assist with a smile. 
In a world where the lowest common denominator increasingly seems to prevail in many areas of life, it is encouraging and welcome to see the high quality of guests being maintained at the Marylebone. 
For us, coming to London and not staying at the Marylebone is inconceivable. 
I have no hesitation whatsoever in recommending the Marylebone to discerning travellers.   Taking all factors into account, I have no doubt that the Marylebone must rank amongst the very best hotels in London and offering guests much more than top household name hotels.

123,Quick drink after lunch,"We popped in here on the way home after lunch. We sat outside as it was busy inside and they weather was relatively good. They did have heaters outside to take the chill of it which was nice. The service was good and the toilet facilities were lovely. The only reason I gave it 4/5 was the price. 2 glasses of sauvignon, 1 glass of Rioja and a large bottle of still mineral water = £40.22",5,2019,06,09
123,Service second to none,"Beautiful hotel in a convenient location, but what really makes this hotel special is the staff. We were well looked after by Otto, Petr and Po, who really went the extra mile to make our event truly special. For that reason, I would highly recommend The Marylebone, especially for private events",5,2019,06,09
123,Excellent ,"Had 5 nights at the Marylebone Hotel. The staff were so helpful  It is very conveniently located

123,A great time at The Marylebone,"This is our second visit to The Marylebone Hotel and surely not our last one. This is the perfect place to stay in London. Excellent and very attentive service. The staff and especially Gunther, was very helpful, polite and fulfilled our every wish. the rooms are clean, modernly designed and very well equipped. They have a great gim, spa and pool. Excellent breakfast, bar and restaurant. We enjoyed every minute.

123,"Fabulous room, outstanding service, nice food and great work-out!","When I'm in London and have the chance I stay in the Marylebone hotel. Excellent location, relaxed atmosphere, great service and nice food are the trademarks of this London style hotel. Also this week's stay was a wonderful experience. Starting the day with a work-out in the gym and wonderful pool made this business trip a great and literately refreshing experience. If I've had the time I would have gone for a run in London finest Regency park but had to save that for the next time.",5,2019,06,07
123,The best quality/price option at the heart of London,I travel often to London for business reasons and have stayed at several hotels around the Marylebone and Oxford areas. This week again I've had the pleasure to stay for three nights at the Marylebone Hotel and it's been another fantastic experience. My good friend and excellent professional Gunther has helped on everything I've needed during my stay. But also all the staff from the reception to the waiters at the Pantry are always amazing at making you feel like being home. Another ten points for this amazing hotel.,5,2019,06,05
123,EXCELLENT HOTEL!!,"The Marylebone is a great hotel: service, people, facilities, decor, food, drinks, special location close to nice shopping area, restaurants and Regent Park.
Gunther is a very good guest relations manager.
This has now become our Hotel in London.",5,2019,06,04
123,Best time,"My husband and I have spent three nights at this hotel and I honestly couldn’t fault it. The rooms were spotless clean and so so comfortable. Breakfast was lovely and plenty of it. But the best part of our stay was the Staff. They were amazing. Everything about them was about us . To the lady who looked after our room to the lovely guy who checked us in and out of the hotel. Then there was the lovely Jo Jo on the main door in his lovely three piece suit couldn’t ask for a better staff. I would be back in a heartbeat, thank you all so much for giving so much of yourselves to us. Each and everyone of you are wonder Loraine and Martin Durran 💙",5,2019,06,04
123,Luxury with affordability,The location is one you only see on TV if your not from London. This Hotel is stunning from the first step inside the front door you straight away feel like royalty. The staff were very polite and attentive and the hotel bar serviced divine cocktails.,5,2019,06,03
123,Nice hotel in lovely area,"The hotel was very pleasant and staff were excellent. The size of the classic rooms is small but this is stated on the website (16sqm) and they are well equipped. The classic rooms are all being refurbished at present so it is worth requesting one of these when booking. 

The reception area, restaurant and bar are all very stylish in their interior design. The staff were all very helpful and followed up on all feedback. The area around the hotel is really lovely with a quiet village feel with plenty of nice cafes and restaurants. Hotel recommended. ",5,2019,06,02
123,Amazing afternoon tea in 108 Brasserie,We went for afternoon tea and it was unbelievable. They did a gluten free and vegan option for me which was delicious and our waiter Ali was so helpful and made our experience even better. Well worth it!,5,2019,06,02

123,Excellent Hotel,"The doorman, Andrei, was so nice. The staff at the Marylebone were helpful and kind. This was a great hotel to stay in. The hotel was clean. The lobby and the hotel rooms were very fragrant and smelled nice.",5,2019,05,31
123,Hotel Stay,"This turned out to be the best hotel my mom and I could've stayed in. Everyone was warm and friendly and super helpful. The doorman, Andrei, was always friendly and on our last day there he remembered us because of our positive attitude. Great service and great people!",5,2019,05,31
123,Excellent!,"Visited in April 2019 as part of my husband's birthday celebrations, absolutely brilliant. Gunter and the team looked after us so well (thanks for the room upgrade)! Very comfortable room in a fantastic area - so handy for Mayfair. 

If I had to criticise something, I'd say the poached eggs at breakfast were a little watery, but that's very much it.",5,2019,05,30
123,Great event spaces!,"Used one of the event spaces for a two day event and had such amazing service from the onsite staff- Hannah, Po & Peter! The room was beautiful and catering very impressive. The booking process was very easy and accommodating and I enjoyed working with Lia the Sales executive. 
Lovely bar onsite.
Such a beautiful hotel and would use again for events.
The bedrooms were small but average for London and I have been told they are refurbishing them this year.",4,2019,05,30
123,Absolutely awesome experience.,"The hotel itself is absolutely beautiful, you can see they've been in every single detail. Very good taste and fantastic swimming pool as well as spa service! 
The personnel is amazing, they make you feel at home at every moment, with their outstanding customer service and attention to detail. 
As a business travel agent, I will definitely recommend the hotel to my clients!",5,2019,05,30
123,Perfect Stay,"Stayed for 5 nights for a mom and daughter trip and couldn't be happier! The team at the hotel is incredible - friendly and will go out of their way to make you feel at home. We booked a basic room and were upgraded to a suite and were greeted with pastries, prosecco and cold pressed juices when we entered the room. Really appreciated the thoughtful gesture and the extra space. Location is ideal, rooms are clean and bright and the service was excellent. Wouldn't look anywhere else for a stay in London!",5,2019,05,29
123,Lovely hotel in charming part of London,"I stayed here in 2013 when it was charming and delightful with a very old-fashioned Grand Budapest Hotel feel. Visiting now in 2019, I found it to be just as charming and delightful but with a decidedly modern feel. The rooms are bright and updated with accommodations for modern technology and space (in central London!) to relax. The Friday morning walking tour for guests with Janice the blue badge guide is a NOT TO BE MISSED treat. The location could not be better, The neighborhood is wonderful and sights, bites and public transport are all within steps. The staff is exceptionally welcoming, too. ",5,2019,05,28
123,very central,"Location location location
the hotel is very central , is going under rooms refurbishment .
some rooms are very small so i recommend you book a wider room on high floors as there's few bar close to the hotel and you can hear them .
the good thing is that everyone is very kind, rooms are clean and done 2 a day.
breakfast is good and the hotel location is excelllent",4,2019,05,27
123,Our Daughter's Wedding,"We stayed in a studio suite for 2 nights for our daughter's wedding. The reception was in the adjoining Courtyard & Blue Rooms of the Marylebone Rooms (highly recommended). The room was spacious and the King size bed was very comfortable. The bathroom was fine but shower was slightly underpowered with moderate pressure. Toiletries were nice. The included breakfast was excellent although on both mornings the cafe staff tried to charge us. Overall though the staff were superb, extremely polite, well trained and efficient. The surrounding area is famously chic and elegant.",4,2019,05,27
123,Great Location/Comfortable Vibe,"I had a great time at Marylebone as always; Friendly but sophisticated at the same time. Very contemporary with a gym at the basement. Its 4 star but you felt like its 5 star with everything you need. I love the gym is partnering with the third space so it creates the motivation too with lots of ""Gym users"" instead of the usually QUIET HOTEL GYM. Staff are amazing at the hotel, Masi and Robinson are the name I could remember but there are many more !",5,2019,05,27
123,Quality London hotel in great location,"I stayed at the Marylebone at the recommendation of a colleague. I had an event at Wigmore Hall and this was just down the street. However the entire area is delightful, and very close to Regents Park, among the nicest in London.
The hotel has all of the amenities one might need, with multiple eating options and several sitting areas around the lobby for passing the time. The staff is very attentive and helpful. It's not a small hotel, but it isn't at all impersonal. I highly recommend. ",5,2019,05,26
123,The Marylebone,"My visit was a perfect low key chic meet and greet...enjoyed stunning freshly pressed health drinks in cool and soothing surroundings, attentive and discreet service...could have stayed for hours. Really nice actually",5,2019,05,24
123,Great hotel,"I travel for work a lot and it is nice to know I have a hotel that is just as cozy as being at home. The rooms are very clean and newly re-done.  Everyone who works at the hotel is very nice and helpful. The hotel is in a great location with great restaurants and great shops. 
I would definitely recommend staying here.",5,2019,05,23
123,Top Notch,"I travel to London regularly for business and have stayed at a number of hotels.  None compare to the experience at The Marylebone.  The rooms are comfortable and modern.  The team is accommodating and service oriented.  They are welcoming and do everything in their power to make your stay comfortable and convenient. They have a beautiful gym (which is hard to find in London) and an upscale cocktail bar.  The restaurant attached, 108 Brasserie, is always bustling and delicious!   The neighborhood itself is one of the best in London, tons of wonderful shops and restaurants, and is a quick walk to Oxford High Street.  I would HIGHLY recommend everyone to consider this hotel when in London.",5,2019,05,23
123,Best location and excellent service,"It was my second stay at The Marylebone and i second my first impression! Warm service , starting from Porter - Concierge, front office, bar and all throughout! Relaxed atmosphere but quality whether food, drinks and room. 
Small details make the difference as was upon my departure, grabbing a quick coffee while taxi was waiting for my airport transfer, a lady offered me a quick breakfast box for take away! First and last impression and all in between, felt welcome and at home !",5,2019,05,22
123,"""Great hotel in fantastic location"" Sheila",I stayed at The Marylebone for two nights and from check in until departure the service was excellent. I had the best breakfast ever from room service including HOT porridge and HOT toast. The room was beautifully decorated. I will certainly stay at this hotel again.,5,2019,05,21
123,"Excellent breakfasts, but...........................................","We stayed at this hotel, with a couple of friends, for 3 nights.
The location is good.
The room we were offered, nr 321, was rather small for a single, let alone for a couple.
Realizing the awkwardness of the situation, we were  offered another room, nr 436, which was slightly bigger.
The bathroom was too small and had  only a douche from above, (in contrast to the telephone type device which today is a common standard and much more practical).
The TV set was huge, with excellent resolution.
The safe was impossible to operate. (Our friends could not operate theirs either, and there were more guests complaining about theirs too)!)
The staff was very helpful and friendly, but the best thing of the hotel is its excellent breakfast both in terms of variety of choices and quality of food offered.
In short we did not feel that we got value for our money.",3,2019,05,21
123,No-where better to stay in central London,"This hotel is perfect if you're looking for somewhere to stay in a central London location, that won't cost a fortune! The service is excellent and the staff are helpful and friendly. The rooms are always extremely clean and comfortable ",5,2019,05,20
123,Great boutique hotel in chic neighborhood,"We came here from Los Angeles for a wedding and arrived several days early. By the time we departed, we felt like family guests (but not too intrusive at all). The hotel is a boutique type of hotel in a very low key chic neighborhood that is small enough to be friendly and personal but large enough to have excellent staff, accommodations and services). The hotel is contemporary in a classic way and not trendy. It is well maintained and clean, as are the rooms. Staff and management are very nice, friendly and accommodating and respond to requests promptly. Housekeeping is very efficient and thorough. Commendations to: Paulius and Andrei in reception; Michael and Rahim the concierges; Gunther and Caroline (guest relations manager and assistant guest relations manager, respectively) and to everyone else we did not specifically mention. 
Would definitely return here. David and Ana K.",5,2019,05,20
123,"Comfortable room, nice gym and good quality food",Stayed for 2 nights recently. Rooms were quiet and comfortable. Well equipped gym in basement although did get a little busy at peak times. Quality of food in the cafe was fantastic for breakfast and dinner . Would definitely stay again,4,2019,05,19
123,An excellent space to work and an excellent bar,"I find the Marylebone Hotel a wonderfully peaceful place to work and relax.

123,Great experience.,"Fantastic hotel, super location, clean, cosy and great ambience. Staff is super friendly, specially JoJo😍. 

If you are booking a double bed, check the bed size. Our doble bedroom had a extremely small bed (1m30) and we needed to transfer to a 2 beds room. (and pay +60£)",4,2019,05,18
123,"Amazing staff, amazing facilities.","The hotel is in a superb location about a 5 minute walk from Oxford Street. We arrived soaked through due to heavy rain but no one batted an eyelid. We were taken into reception, relieved of our very wet luggage and quickly signed in by Gunther who is one of the nicest people you could meet. Our suite was superb, and after a hot shower we were ready to hit the town only my husband had forgotten his cufflinks. The amazing Gunther came to the rescue and lent my husband a pair. We found the hotel to be incredibly quiet at night, no sirens disturbing the slumbers. We enjoyed breakfast and lunch at the hotel which were both sublime but the standout feature is the staff. Without exception they were all so friendly, helpful and nothing was too much trouble. We can highly recommend this hotel and will certainly be returning.",5,2019,05,16
123,Marylebone Hotel as an Event Venue,"We recently held an event in the Long Rooms at the Marylebone Hotel and were absolutely blown away by the hotel itself, the venue space, the atmosphere and the wonderful service provided by the staff members helping us on the ground, in particular Otto, Kosta and Alessio. Lia did a fantastic job of guiding us through the planning and details leading up to our event. We couldn't have asked for a better experience!",5,2019,05,16

123,Pleasent stay in London,We stayed 3 nights at the Marylebone and we had a really pleasant stay. The room was very comfortable and clean with an excellent king size bed. The whole team was very kindful. We went few times into the lobby bar to have a drink or coffee where Andras the waiter was always nice and helpful.,5,2019,05,15
123,Fabulous,"I’ve been coming to London on business for almost a decade, but until I stayed at the Marylebone I can’t say I ever stayed at a hotel I would recommend. 

The Marylebone is all about service, and they actually have the staff to back it up. From the handwritten note and warm towel at check in to my in room personal gin & tonic bar I’ve always felt catered to. Not to mention a hotel bar I would  actually enjoy patronizing. 

The amenities are incomparable, from the gym to the bar to the spa you won’t want to leave. It is truly a full service hotel in the best sense. So few hotels in London prioritize service that when you experience it you are reminded of what you actually deserve. 

Thank you Marylebone for always making me feel welcome and that I never have to leave. ",5,2019,05,14
123,Very special wellcom,"Stay at The Marylebone is always a right choice . All the people are so polite and friendly that make you feel at home. I love the smell in the lobby that give you a warm welcome just you get in. This last time I tried the breakfast and it was really yummy and very varied. Special thanks to the people in the reception, special mr Gunther , always ready to help you and give you tips for the city , a nice offer the visit to know the neighbourhood.",5,2019,05,14
123,Fantastic Hotel,"This time I had to visit London for a couple of days for work and the Marylebone had the best location... The price was great for such a well located hotel and when I arrived, the level of service from Andrei and the reception staff, the room and breakfast quality were outstanding! I definitely recommend for any business travelers or for a romantic getaway. I will have to return and use the amazing pool. 
",5,2019,05,14
123,Highly Recommend,"My wife and I recently stayed at this hotel and loved it. The hotel itself is beautiful and the staff is extremely friendly and helpful. 

The best part is the location. Marylebone is a beautiful neighborhood that is centrally located and walking distance from everything (5-10 minutes from the tube), but doesn’t feel touristy at all. The area has a ton of restaurants/cafes/stores nearby.

We recommend this hotel to everyone, but please note some of the rooms are very small so take that into consideration when choosing which room type!",5,2019,05,13
123,Wonderful Hotel,"Had a fabulous stay at this hotel. The Location, the service and amenities are all first class. I found the rooms to be a decent size for the West End and spotlessly clean. The bar, managed by Greg is a great place to unwind after a busy day. Aurel, the mixologist, is a master of his trade. I would recommend The Marylebone to anyone.",5,2019,05,12
123,Terrific Hotel Property in quaint Marylebone,"My experience at the Marylebone Hotel includes numerous stays (+25 nights) since 2013. The hotel property has been significantly upgraded over that period, including the hotel rooms, public spaces (which are simply stunning and well designed), Brasserie 108 restaurant which, IMO, has one of the best breakfasts in the world.

Hotel management, led by Garreth Walsh, GM along with Gunther SchIldwachter, Guest Relations Mgr., is top shelf. Always responsive and deliver all resources necessary to make each stay, whether business or pleasure, a true delight. 

I always look forward to visiting London, in large measure due to the Marylebone Hotel,as I feel most at home at the property.",5,2019,05,11
123,Αmazing Hotel!,"The staff of the hotel was very attentive, especially Theano Karathanasopoulou, the guest relations manager. She was there whenever we needed her and she kept surprising us with treats and gifts in our room during our stay. She was very sweet. The location is very convenient and there are a lot of things to do around the area. We will be back for sure!",5,2019,05,10
123,Reasonable hotel- but rooms too small for a couple,"The public areas in the hotel are smart, but the rooms need some love.

Our room was not spotlessly clean (wine on the curtains?!) and we had a real issue with the space.

Overall the hotel feels quite small with narrow dark corridors.

There was so much stuff everywhere- marketing brochures and leaflets and items on every single surface, which made the small area feel worse.

The bathroom you literally couldn't swing a cat in. You need to rotate yourself 360 degrees to get to anything. I hit my head on the sink when drying off after stepping out the shower. 

The beds were comfortable, linens nice and the products and water provided were also good. The hotel was quiet, and we had a good nights sleep.

It was a reasonable overall 4 star hotel.",3,2019,05,07
123,amazing staff,"we spent our civil wedding night at the marylebone hotel and the staff was just amazing. They were so kind and attentive and have done absolutely everything to make our night special.

123,Amazing service and clean!!!,"What a delightful hotel, the biggest thing for me was that it is clean. Breakfast was good (even though it was not included in our price) but I didn’t Mind as they made up for the rest of it.

Valet staff was polite and overall a pleasant stay! ",5,2019,05,06
123,"Swift easy check in, clean rooms, lovely decor and great location","There's nothing not to like about the Marylebone Hotel. It's a good looking, well designed hotel in a great little spot and on a quiet street, set back perfectly yet within spitting distance of everywhere you would want to visit.
The interior design is good and the bed was incredibly comfortable - I had an amazing nights sleep. The only thing that let the room down enormously was the bathroom. The shower over the bath is crap, with no real pressure and when I wanted to have a bath, the water wasn't hot enough. Sometimes it's the small things when you are away from home!
I'd book here again if in London for sure. It's a decent hotel and didn't cost the absolute earth like many of it's competitors.",4,2019,05,05
123,Super cute hotel! Loved our stay,"A friend had recommended the area, and I found the hotel online. It was so cute, great ambience and decor. The staff was friendly, we enjoyed our room with street views and excellent lighting. We only stayed one night, and had cocktails at the lounge in an indoor/outdoor room with a plant wall. Great cocktails and again the ambience was excellent. I would highly recommend. ",5,2019,05,02
123,Fantastic hotel in great location ,"The Marylebone is a fantastic hotel, just minutes walk away from the shops on Oxford & Regent Street and a very quick walk to Bond Street tube station. We received a warm and friendly welcome from all the staff with the doormen in particular taking kind care of us. The room was big, spotless and bed very comfortable. It amazed me how quiet our room was given how central the hotel is. We didn’t get to use the spa this trip but it looks amazing. Breakfast was delicious as was lunch in the 108 restaurant (try the Guinness bread!) The bar was lovely and relaxing for a post dinner drink. I would highly recommended this hotel for business or pleasure. ",5,2019,05,01
123,A lovely hotel in a beautiful part of London but also amazingly central.,"I love this hotel. It has charming public spaces, bar, restaurant and brasserie and is in a lovely neighbourhood about 3 blocks behind Oxford street. The neighbourhood itself has lovely boutique shops, restaurants and cafes and  beautiful buildings.
The staff in the hotel work very hard to create a home from home personalised atmosphere. I could not recommend them highly enough, including Gunther the guest relations manager who was just really great. The front desk staff, including Malachy from Dungarvan and the restaurant staff at breakfast including the maître d and his co-worker- I didn't get her name were just so nice. The day we were checking the front desk were working hard to accommodate guests who had to stay on due to an airline strike. Gunther was incredibly helpful to my husband and me in relation to two separate issues we had to deal with. Thank you so much..would love to stay again soon!",5,2019,04,30
123,Outstanding stay,"From the moment we arrived the staff was welcoming and couldn’t have been more accommodating. We arrived early and our rooms were not ready but the front desk staff suggested we have breakfast. When we discovered that the only way to get to breakfast this day was to either go outside or do stairs, they suggested we sit in the bar area and they would serve us there.  Breakfast was delicious. The concierge at the hotel could not have been better.  He suggested places to eat, showed us the menus to help us decide and even helped me fix my phone after I had a problem closing out the Uber app.  Would we stay in this charming hotel again. We certainly will,",5,2019,04,28
123,Great Hotel with an excellent service!,"I came in London for few days and I went for the first time in this hotel. It has an excellent service and the position is perfect. Furthermore, Andrei (the concierge) is really very professional, kind and a great advisor for restaurants and  places to visit! Chapeau",5,2019,04,28
123,EXCELLENT. Highly recommended. Love to come again.,"It was my first visit to The Marylebone Hotel.
I came back from Manchester  to see the football game between Arsenal Vs. Napoli.
Close to the Bond Street underground station, its easy to reach.
The service is great and the staff do their best to help you in every way (In my case – getting the tickets to the game)
The room was new and modern, and VERY CLEAN.
Its seemed that the staff cleaned the room in every opportunity that they had. 
AROUND THE CLOCK WITHOUT DISTURBING ME.
Location is GREAT . Just two blocks from Oxford Street and Bond Street. Great for Shoping.
Love to come again.",5,2019,04,26
123,Very nice hotel with great service!,"We enjoyed our stay with our Children at the Hotel. the service is great and the rooms looks new. the classic room was too small for us so we upgraded to deluxe room which was very comfortable. our kids stayed at the classic room and enjoyed it. the vibe at the hotel is great. Breakfast is really good and the service is wonderful. the location is the best you can find In London. walking distance from Oxford street and very close to the Tube.
Highly recommended!",4,2019,04,25
123,excellent!,"It's already more than ten years that i frequently stay at the Marylebone, which i had originally chose mainly on it;s location which combines an elegant area, shopping facilities near by (not far from Oxford Street as well) and medical treatment (Harley St. in walking distance). i continued staying at the hotel, which is providing all the facilities for post-operation situations (walk-in showers, convenient toilets, necessary for recovering from hip operations), but to my pleasant surprise i found the hotel's main assets were excellent service provided. In particular the service remains at the highest possible level. I was welcomed always with a smile and my requests were accepted and handled at a very sort notice, room service and refreshing our bedroom twice a day was always available without delays etc. I don't wish in such a multinational  environment to start throwing names, but Angie and Toby at the reception, Theano on guest relations are always available, the ladies at the front desk for breakfast and Michelle as the initial contact when booking and arranging my stay and finally the whole team of house keeping are very professional and respond quickly. I am looking forward to my next visit!",5,2019,04,25
123,Amazing experience ,"Hello , I went there for a couple of hours to see the place for the first time .  I went to the bar and I had one of the most beautiful experience in my life . The French bartender Aurelian is been amazing with me and he did  one of the most good twist of old fashioned that I tried in my life .
I’m gonna come back soon for sure and I gonna raccomended to all friend of mine to join in this amazing hotel to have a drink !",5,2019,04,24
123,What a treat!,"We visited this weekend with our family, two kids, two parents and one Granny! We booked a suite with an interconnecting room and we had a great time with extra special service! Our customer relations lady Theana was fabulous. Easter eggs and Easter themed gifts were there for the children on arrival, shortly followed by evening milk and cookies and a special treat for the grown ups too.  This happened everyday in some form or another for our 3 night visit. We were super impressed with all the facilities. We used the pool with the children for an afternoon swim, samples fabulous ‘fare’ at the 108 brasserie, delicious cocktails at the cocktail bar and wonderful breakfast at the Pantry. We really couldn’t have been looked after better.  Thank You especially to Theana who went above and beyond. We will be back.",5,2019,04,24
123,Amazing place.,"I stayed in this hotel with my family for 3 days. Amazing design and nice very comfortable room and clean. It was our first time in London. Great customer service from Concierge Michal who is knowledgeable and helped us to plan our visit organise for us restaurants, places to see, bus tours and great historical tips about London. We also enjoyed 108 restaurants especially cocktails. Really nice place for break.",5,2019,04,24
123,Wonderful,Stayed here twice in the space of 2 weeks for a short business trip - staff are incredibly welcoming and the hotel is lovely. Food is expensive but worth the price as it is delicious and I would recommend their cocktails. ,5,2019,04,23
123,Wonderful Easter weekend stay at the beautiful Marylebone!,"This was my second time staying at the Marylebone and it once again exceeded all expectations. My first trip was with friends and the second was with my husband and two young sons, aged 7 and 10. The hotel is perfect for anyone wishing to have a five star experience in a really central, chic, and safe location in London. The staff are incredibly welcoming and they were wonderful with the children, leaving lovely Easter treats in our room each evening. A special word of thanks to Theano and to Raheem who were most friendly and helpful. We loved the restaurant for both breakfast and dinner. The pool is a great bonus, especially when travelling with children but also great for a relaxing swim during the childfree hours. The hotel is very close to Oxford St and Regent St - perfect for shopping. It's also very close to Bond St Tube Station and Marble Arch - ideal for sightseeing. There are also lovely restaurants and shops within a few minutes walk of the hotel. We travel a lot and are quite fussy about where we stay and I can honestly say that this hotel is perfect in every way. I would have no hesitation in recommending The Marylebone and hope to visit it again very soon.",5,2019,04,22
123,Wonderful service,"A wonderful stay. The staff and service was first class from the moment we arrived. The rooms and accommodation were exceptionally clean and well appointed. A gem in the centre of London, close to all the attractions with nice bars and restaurants very close, yet in a quiet area that allows you to get away from the crowds.
A special mention to Toby and Aurelien for exceptional service and making our anniversary all the more special.",5,2019,04,21
123,Excellent service,"The service we received was impeccable. Guest relations manager Theano Karathanasopoulou treated us as if we were the most special of guests. When she found out my sister was getting married and was researching for her wedding dress, a stack of bridal magazines awaited us in our bedroom, along with a very sweet note, wine and fruit (the first night) and gin, tonic water, ice and nuts and chocolate (the second night)... 

Between my mother, my sister and I, we travel a lot. The way we were treated at the Marylebone Hotel will remain unforgettable to us. Until the next time!

More on the hotel: Location is more than ideal. Rooms are bright, comfortable and clean. Bar and lounge area are lovely, with an art deco feel and lots of different corners to nest in and enjoy a coffee or a drink.

",5,2019,04,21
123,"Incredible hotel, best service!","Honestly, takes a lot for me to write a hotel review. This place is A+++. From the moment our cab door opened to the second we departed incredible service all around. The bell staff were courteous attentive and extremely helpful, the front desk and concierge same. All the restaurants and bars on site are great and the room-service was impeccable. I cannot wait to come stay here again.",5,2019,04,18
123,Great experience,"I’m usually in London on Business, but this was my first time staying at the Marylebone. 
I have to say, I wish I’d found this place sooner! From start to finish the experience was perfect. The checking in process was quick and easy and the Irish receptionist (sorry can’t remember the name) was happy to talk to me about the hotels restaurant.
The room was looking out over the street, but it was decently sized and the teas / coffees in the room were a nice touch. 
Down in the lobby, Joe and Dimitry were the best doormen I’ve encountered in London. I’d had a long and very difficult journey, and their welcoming attitude and willingness to help made all the difference in the world. The professionalism I experienced was second to none. 
The hotel is located very close to Bond Street station which makes access easy to Waterloo, where I was working. 
Overall, 10/10 and I will be choosing this hotel for my future London expeditions.
Thank you to all for making it a pleasant stay!",5,2019,04,18
123,A wonderful hotel in London,"We stayed at the hotel for 4 nights. The experience was amazing. We received excellent service, the room was always clean and equipped with a Nespresso coffee machine, capsules and everything that is needed also in the bathroom. The location of the hotel is excellent and the area is pleasant, quiet and well lit at night. We highly recommend this hotel.",5,2019,04,17
123,Superb hotel experience ,Beautiful hotel with the most fantastic staff. Breakfast is delicious and the welcome is unbeatable. Highly highly recommend. I’ve stayed here on a couple break and also with our children on a family London break and they looked after us so well each time. We’ll be back. ,5,2019,04,16
123,Lovely hotel in beautiful neighborhood,I plan on staying at the Marylebone Hotel the next time I am in London.  The rooms are comfortable and well appointed and the staff could not be more helpful.  The location is near to major shopping but in a neighborhood setting so you feel removed from the busy streets.  ,5,2019,04,16
123,Outstanding!,"Absolutely lived up to the excellent reviews I saw before booking. I had my two little boys with me and at check-in they were given a little teddy bear each which they loved. The room service dinner and breakfast were excellent and the room perfect.
I have been lucky enough to stay at a number of high-end hotels around the world but now consider the Marylebone to be right up there. Definitely recommend!",5,2019,04,15
123,Excellent Staff,The Marylebone hotel is a beautiful space with incredible staff. Each team member went out of their way to make sure I was comfortable (including remembering my name) and the event staff was delightful to work with. I would highly recommend this location as incredible space to stay and also to host events. ,5,2019,04,15
123,"Unpretentious, great service","Staying at a hotel regularly you can tired and blasé. Not so the Marylebone - well situated in the hear of Marylebone with a stunning, engaging front of house team led by Gunther. How they remember all the guests names I have no idea. Cozy bar and a great gym and healthy room service when work ties you to the desk. I keep coming back for more!",5,2019,04,15
123,A fantastic hotel with proper service in a wonderful location. ,"Just back from 2 nights / 3 days in London staying at the Marylebone. 

My expectations were good as I’d heard from friends it was a hotel worth staying at but I was really bowled over. From the scented reception offering chilled water and hot towels on arrival to the lovely and helpful staff at all levels. I felt relaxed pretty much immediately as I sensed this hotel was going to be exactly what I was looking for and also expected for the price. 

Our room was spacious and really well appointed with lovely Aromatherapy Associates toiletries in the marble bathroom. Great shower, beautiful white cotton bed linen and a comfy bed. The common areas of the hotel are beautiful and I’d say very recently decorated with original art, beautiful books and lighting. It doesn’t feel like any other hotel I’ve stayed in and certainly the opposite of a chain hotel. 

The surrounding area of Marylebone village is absolutely stunning with plenty of places to eat, shop and mooch. Selfridges is a 5 minute walk away but I felt I was miles away from the hustle of Oxford Street. 

All in all I’d highly recommend this hotel and area of London. 

Gunther was especially helpful when he overheard me looking for some advice at reception and took a personal interest in our family and enjoyment of our trip. 

Thank you for a memorable weekend.

123,World class service!,"We are currently staying at The Marylebone and the service is by far the best we have experienced. The wonderful Head Concierge Rahim Ismail went above and beyond to ensure our great stay. We had planned on attending the Tottenham game and got a bit stressed when it was moved to earlier in the day due to our arriving flight the same morning.  This was perfectly handled by the hotel and Mr. Ismail met us directly at Paddington with our tickets and a delicious lunch box. Back at the hotel after the game, the check-in was smooth and we arrived in our nice room to discover a personal greeting from Mr.Ismail. This is truly amazing and something we will never forget. 
We highly reccomend The Marylebone for your next trip to London!",5,2019,04,13
123,Good choice,"Only a brief stay at the Marylebone, but only good things to say. The room was spacious and far from the lift as requested, so we were not disturbed. The staff were very attentive and Joe was particularly helpful giving us some recommendations of local restaurants. We ended up going to the Ivy around the corner which was lovely and only a stones throw away. We will definitely stay here again next time we are in London!",5,2019,04,13
123,"Great hotel, great location, amazing staff!","I stayed at the Marylebone hotel for 11 nights for a work trip. Great hotel, great room, wonderful accommodations. As a vegan, there were plenty of options in the restaurant and room service, and they went above and beyond to accommodate. Also, the staff were very friendly and helpful, especially Andrei who was great with offering directions and answering general questions. 

Must visit the gym while you’re here, it’s so great. And they also offer many classes everyday. 

And one last thing, gotta mention the cocktails... they are just incredible. At the bar right when you come in and at the restaurant in the back, the cocktails are just to die for.",5,2019,04,12
123,Hope to visit again,"The Marylebone in London is excellent.  You will feel very comfortable and close to all personnel because they will treat you like you are VIP.  My wife is very particular about cleanliness, she had no issues at all (even in well known hotels she finds something, not in this one).
We were extremely pleased, we will recommend to all who are thinking to visit London",5,2019,04,12
123,Fabulous service and cosy atmosphere,"We have a wonderful stay at Marylebone Hotel. The service level is very high.
The hotel have more sitting and bar areas which makes it very cosy.

Perfect area in London ",5,2019,04,12
123,Great hotel in central location,"Good hotel upscale hotel  in great location. Friendly staff and nice ambiance. Great design. Loved the bar. 
Only negative issue was a very slow check in. It probably took us 30 min to check in a group of 6. ",5,2019,04,11
123,Always a great stay!,"Perfect location, great design and decor, friendly and efficient staff, overall great hotel! I've stayed here a few times now, and each time there is something new to enjoy. The renovated guest rooms have boutiquey decor, though I'll warn that the carpet smells odd at first (they were just put in, so in time that will fade). But everything else was wonderful on this stay, and as an elite DISCOVERY member they really took care of me with local amenities and little surprises each day.",5,2019,04,10
123,Home from Home,Ideally located for Oxford street. Very comfortable hotel. Excellent staff everyone was very helpful and all staff had smiles on their faces and bent over backwards to make our stay a happy one.

123,Best hotel in London!,"We've have stayed at The Marylebone a couple times and each time we have had a great experience! Gunther Schildwachter went out of his way to make sure our room was perfect and we were enjoying our time at the hotel.  THANK YOU! The beds are super comfortable and the room beautifully decorated.  108 Bar and restaurant have great food and service! The location of the hotel is perfect - out of the hustle and bustle of the tourist areas, but close enough to walk.  Marylebone is a cute little neighborhood filled with lovely shops, restaurants and parks.  Highly suggest staying here - you won't be disappointed!",5,2019,04,08
123,One of my favorites in London,"I frequently stay here for work in London. The staff (particularly Anja at the front desk and the bar staff) are welcoming and professional. The rooms are clean and well appointed (and even better after the renovations). The small rooms are quite small but the suites are great. The combination of the 108 restaurant, the lounge bar, and the third space gym make it a home away from home in a great neighborhood. Looking forward to my next trip.",5,2019,04,07
123,My First Choice For London Stay,"Great location, staff and amenities!  I have stayed at The Marylebone many times and it never disappoints.  The staff go out of their way to make you feel welcome and assist with any need you may have.  It is like returning ""home"" - I have recommended The Marylebone to a number of friends and all have raved about their stays.  Keep up the excellent work!",5,2019,04,07
123,"Top location, great family hotel","We have just returned from a family few days away, and could not recommend enough. 

Theano and his team were excellent from arrival to departure, especially with the kids. The cookies, milk and toys left for them went down a treat! 

Interconnecting rooms were spacious and clean, 108 Marylebone (hotel bar/restaurant) had a great atmosphere, good food and wide selection of drinks. 
Not just used by hotel guests, but also by locals which positively added to the appeal!

Having use of Third Space gym also ticked the boxes, proper gym full of good kit. 

Great location, surrounded by laid back neighbourhood cafes, bars and shops....but only minutes away from Oxford St, Mayfair etc. 
We will definitely return!",5,2019,04,07

Thank you everyone, stay like this and thank you to Katerina Sulcova for being nice to me and my mum ! 
See you next time ! ",5,2019,04,07
123,Perfection,"I cannot express how much I enjoy staying in this hotel. I’ve been a regular guest for almost 10 years and wouldn’t dream of staying elsewhere. I spend about 400k miles traveling globally each year and the Marylebone continues to be my favorite place. As usual, Gunther made sure every detail was covered and Michal the concierge had a list of exhibits for me to see. I would strongly recommend spending time at the lobby bar and ask Csaba to make you one of his signature drinks. If you want to feel as though you’re always the most important guest, this is your place. ",5,2019,04,07
123,Lindberg view,"The reception is magnificent thanks to Angie who treats every guest as a very welcome guest. She is helpful and funny. Always a smil and a cheerful remark.

The hotel is in a fantastic position close to shops restaurants and Theatre land you can walk everywhere in 30 minutes.

Our stay was enhanced by the warmth of the welcome we received on arrival and the pleasant and efficient service we enjoyed throughout our time there.

Special thank you to Joe on the door for his help with our equipment and recommending the local pub for our afters.
see you again soon Marylebone!",5,2019,03,28

123,Never fails to impress,I have stayed four nights in recent months at this little gem of a hotel hidden away in the hustle and bustle of London. The staff really do go that extra mile to make all aspects of your stay relaxing. The front cocktail bar is a great place to start your evening off and also to finish. Late lunch after checkout in the Brassiere was also 1st class. We are booked again for two nights in September and with a bit of luck we can squeeze in a long weekend before then. Thanks to all the Marylebone team.,5,2019,03,27
123,"Amazing experience, even more amazing staff!","I recently visited the Marylebone hotel for work - weeklong meetings which we booked many rooms and used the meeting rooms. The rooms were nice, beds cozy, and meeting venues elevated in design and clean, the real winners here were the staff members we dealt with. The planning process was incredibly easy (and even enjoyable) due to hotel reps Lia and Hannah. The front desk members and concierge could not have been more helpful, energetic and kind. During the week, we were assisted by Otto, Petr, and Paul in the meeting rooms. I cannot put into words how helpful these men were. They had permanent smiles on their faces, were eager to help and were not phased by any request. We were sad to leave! I have never had such royal treatment. THANK YOU Otto, Petr and Paul - amazing!!",5,2019,03,27
123,Great Hotel for Business Meetings,"I have stayed in this hotel for a week as we have organized a business event here. We had a lot of rooms booked for our customers. During the week, I personally have had a chance to use:
- meeting rooms (The Blue Room, The Library)
- 108 Brasserie/Pantry for Afternoon Tea
- The Long Room for private dinner
- The Courtyard for lunches

I can say that the rooms/services are costly but we really had a great service provided (especially big Thank you to wonderful Otto and Petr), food was lovely and if there were any issues, they were solved very quickly. The meetings rooms are charming, not just ordinary boring ones which was well-received by our attendees. The Courtyard is superb! The location of the Hotel is perfect as well!
",5,2019,03,27
123,"Beautiful hotel, great location","I did a group booking + meeting through Cristina, who helped me in all possible ways. The whole process went smoothly, and all our requirements were met. The meeting room facilities were great, and the hotel feels very modern, contemporary and still charismatic. Check-in and check-out was handled by Otto, who provided me with great service and who was very cheerful. A great welcome when entering the hotel!
The only drawback is that the room feels a bit outdated compared to the rest of the hotel, so hopefully the rooms will have a makeover soon?",4,2019,03,27
123,Calm expertise and exceptional service,"We held an event at the Marylebone last week. The event pre-planning work on behalf of the Hotel was done brilliantly by Lia who answered all our questions and implemented everything extremely efficiently even when plans changed at the last minute. We were ably helped by Otto and Gergo on the day, who again were friendly, helpful and efficient in looking after us during the lunch and subsequent breaks during the meeting.Nothing was too much trouble. The venue itself was beautifully presented, (smells wonderful) and had everything we needed to transition from a formal meeting, a more informal drinks event and then a sit down dinner. We are incredibly thankful to everyone at The Marylebone for their exceptional service.",5,2019,03,25
123,Excellent response,"Despite some problems with the reservations things were handled promptly, courteously and efficiently. When problems do occur then you look for a reaction and in our case this was excellent by all departments.
The bar, restaurant for breakfasts, lunches and dinner were superb as usual.
Location is great and the whole feel of the hotel fits in with the area.",5,2019,03,25
123,Amazing location and service,Super friendly staff. Always smiling. Great location for shopping and dining. Only took a cab once the entire trip. Helped burn off all the good food we were eating. The chocolates they left at turn down service were also amazing,5,2019,03,25

123,Excellent hotel,"We stayed for one night in a cozy/classic room which was absolutely fine. Modern, clean and very comfortable.

We had light bites and drinks in the brassiere which were very nice.

Great breakfast.

Pool and facilities very good.

Management even put a bottle of prosecco and cakes etc in our room complementary as it was my wife’s birthday.

All in all I would highly recommend.

123,A truly superb hotel which delivers a polished consistently high level of service and treats guests as individuals - you,"I stay quite often at the Marylebone and have become accustomed to the high quality of the service, food and accommodation but this stay was stellar and made so due to the care and attention of the whole team under the leadership of Gunther the guest services manager. I stayed with my wife and daughter. My daughter had surgery at a nearby hospital where she stayed over for a night before we brought her back the Marylebone - Gunther sorted the whole thing out personally, showed discreet concern for us all and took away any worry about our stay due to his attention to detail. The whole team were on point at all times. The room service staff were amazing and the chefs accommodated all our needs. The housekeepers were all thorough, responsive and the supervisors diligent. I can truly say this is the most authentic hotel in London with the best staff ever!",5,2019,03,23
123,"Great cozy hotel, great staff","I stayed at this hotel for three days during my work trip to London, I was really impressed with the cleanliness of the hotel, the cleaning service of the rooms, and the kindness of the staff and I would definitely go back again.",5,2019,03,20

123,Superior hotel,"Super friendly staff. Great ambience. Very classy hotel. I work in the area and it is my go to place for meetings and often it is just a nice place to chill. I am always made to feel welcome. The bar is also a cool place to hang out. Historically, the restaurant was not to the standard of the rest of the hotel but that has now changed. I don't believe I could recommend a better hotel in Central London to stay. ",5,2019,03,20
123,Super service as usual. ,"I visit about once a month and I am always welcomed back. The staff are all very friendly but also very professional.

123,Impeccable service by a charming man named Gunther at the reception!,"The service at The Marylebone always has the highest standards. 
I checked-in at the front desk and met Gunther, one of the friendliest, most hospitable and forthcoming people I have ever had the pleasure to meet. He helped me find a lovely room, keeping my personal wishes in mind. 
I travel a lot and have been to many great hotels but the staff isn't always as helpful and amiable as in The Marylebone, which is why I was delighted to be back!",5,2019,03,18
123,Memorable accommodation with a private care experience!,"I had  a wonderful experience during my stay at Marylebone last week in London.
A unique and warm personal care especially by the kind approach of Theano/Guest Relations Manager, who made my stay exceptional and enjoyable.
Even though on a business trip, Theano created for me a hospitality journey; I have appreciated her friendly advice for some quick shopping around and I was wonderfully surprised upon return to my room by the tasteful treats she had arranged for me.
It was even amazing when Theano personally cared to find and complementary offer to me the gift I wanted for my husband (his favorite drink).
This lady is a true asset for the Hotel. Need to mention that all staff was exceptional and welcoming from the smiling doormen and the reception team, up to the waiting staff in all areas.
I strongly recommend this Hotel for business and recreation traveling and looking forward to visit again this 'warm' place.",5,2019,03,17
123,Great service from a lovely lady at the front desk called Theano.,"Theano went out of her way to make my stay as comfortable as possible, she was just delightful and is a credit to the hotel. 
The location is great, and the hotel has a great variety of bars and restaurants. I'd highly recommend the juices! ",5,2019,03,16
123,First class all round!,"I am a little late in posting this however, I must leave a review to say how amazing the Marylebone hotel coordinated my corporate Christmas event. From enquiry and booking with Elena to coordination with Cristina and fantastic execution with Hannah, I am truly very happy with the service and experience provided. Please also extend my thanks to the waiting staff, chef and all who contributed to the evening. Sending a heartfelt thank you to you all for an amazing evening. My colleagues, myself and in particular my MD were extremely pleased with everything! 

I thoroughly recommend this hotel and will be returning to host future events at this hotel.",5,2019,03,15
123,Staff its the best asset here. Simply stunning,"From the incredibly smiley doormen, to the responsiveness of the Senior reception team, the staff here will go to the extra extra extra mile to please you. I’m a light sleeper and I asked for a quiet room away from the lift. After a junior mistake of giving me the wrong room right in front of the staff lift, a lovely lady came to give me another one, quite tiny, but extremely quiet, and sent me a bottle of wine and peanuts to comprnsate. At checkout the managet specifically came out to apologise. I will keep coming back for sure. So recommended. Also the hotel its beautiful.",5,2019,03,13
123,Top choice for London!,"Everything about the experience we had over the last week has been excellent. Top location, top service and a special thanks to Theano, who contributed to make everything right for our staying and really went the extra mile for us to stay 100% satisfied! I strongly recommend this hotel and for sure will come again, perfect for couples, friends or... solo!",5,2019,03,13
123,Top class hotel. Wonderful staff.,"We spent two nights at the Marleybone recently and were so impressed by it. It is chic without being pretentious with fabulous amenities and great food. It is a 15 minute walk from Oxford circus so central to everything but located in a lovely quiet street.
The Brasserie food was excellent and the atmosphere in the bar was lively. It  appeared to very popular with non-guests also.
However, the stand out feature of our stay was the staff. Marina and her team at reception were so friendly and welcoming as was Godwin who couldn't have been more helpful with luggage and an umbrella when we ventured out in inclement weather! Gunther in customer relations was efficient and helpful in forwarding an item left behind.
When next in London, I won't stay anywhere else!",5,2019,03,13
123,Wonderful hotel with amazing staff,"Highly recommended! 
We had such a wonderful time right from the start.
We are a couple with a toddler, the room was ready when we arrived with cot, a teddy bear and a wonderful cake for our toddler who was about to become 2 years old.
Thanks to the amazing staff and Theano the guest relations manager I felt relaxed and at ease from the moment we arrived.  
The rooms are being cleaned and organized 2-3 times a day. Very comfortable and beautiful.
The location was perfect, just next to Oxford street.
We would definitely go back! :)",5,2019,03,12
123,Great hotel ,"This is a great hotel, very well localized in Marylebone and with one of the best value for what you get in the city. 
Special mention to Gunther, the manager while we were there. He stepped out of his way to help us and even gave us a nice teddy bear for our unborn son. 
Will definitely stay there again.  ",5,2019,03,12

123,Excellent and easy stay at the Marylebone!,"Our stay at the Marylebone was great and just what we were looking for during a long weekend in London. The hotel has a very trendy feel but is unpretentious. The location is unbeatable for what we were looking for- located on a quiet street but close to bars, restaurants and shopping. 

The staff was also top-notch. The doorman, Andrei, was excellent and seemed like he really wanted us to have an enjoyable visit to London. He provided directions and was very attentive while we were checking in and out of the hotel. He also remembered my name after one interaction, a skill that seems to be non-existent in hotels these days.",5,2019,03,11
123,Stunning Meeting & Events Space,"We are beyond pleased with the outcome of our conference. Our event manager, Cristina G, was always available in the run-up to our meeting and her communication was top notch. I couldn't have asked for a better contact through out.
Otto was helpful and attentive to our needs during our conference, and understood the importance of a seamless execution as we were hosting very important clients.
Overall the meeting and events team performed above expectation and The Marylebone will now become our go-to for all external meetings as Senior Management was extremely impressed by the level of service provided and the elegance and aesthetics of the space.",5,2019,03,11
123,Best Hotel In London,"Home from Home in heart of the City. Great service, the facilities are amazing and food and cocktails, well simply try them !.

",5,2019,03,10
123,Great location. Great value for money,"Highly recommended. The staff are wonderful, especially Jojo and the Guest Relations Manager. The rooms are very comfortable with good amenities. Perfect location as well - so central yet not noisy. Great restaurants and shops around",5,2019,03,08
123,Perfect for London,"An all-round perfect place to stay in London. You cannot get any more central; the location is convenient for pretty much everything.  The hotel seems small and initimate; staff are incredibly kind, helpful and genuinely interested in making your stay the best possible experience. I ate out a couple of times and was sorely disappointed when comparing it to the food at 108 Brasserie!",5,2019,03,07
123,Wonderful hotel in lovely neighborhood ,"We recently visited the Marylebone Hotel based on its location and reviews, and we were not disappointed. Located in a trendy but quiet neighborhood, the Marylebone Hotel combines great service with charm. The rooms are comfortably appointed with excellent linens, a comfortable bed, and marble bath. We chose a junior suite to get a bit more space and were happy to have done so. While the closets are a bit small, there is plenty of drawer space. The windows even open a bit so you can freshen the air! The Marylebone does high end without pretense. 

The fantastic multicultural guest services team, especially Theano, deserve a special shout out. From arranging a car service from the airport, to securing hard to get theatre tickets to dinner recommendations, the guest services team handled our requests efficiently and with a smile. I simply cannot say enough good things about how we were treated: greeted by name, follow up to ensure everything was going well.... thank you!!

The on-site restaurant has the feeling of a neighborhood meeting place. The food is excellent at all meal times (and even sometimes in between). The breakfast wait staff even remembered our coffee preferences day to day! In the evening you can find conversations in many languages going on as people linger at the bar after dinner. 

The Marylebone is close enough to walk to the shopping hubbub of Oxford Street, yet it feels worlds away. We will be back soon!",5,2019,03,05
123,Thank you to Otto and the Banqueting Team!,Many thanks to Otto and the Banqueting Team for the fantastic service they provided during our event last month. They were extremely helpful and went above and beyond to make our event run as smooth as possible. It was a pleasure working with you!,5,2019,03,05
123,My home away from home,"I have stayed at The Marylebone 30-40 nights per year for the past six years, and would not trade it for any other.  Excellent location in the village of Marylebone, numerous high quality restaurants within a four block radius, close to Bond Street Underground, all make for a comfortable stay.  Staff is welcoming, from the doormen to the reception to the concierge, all willing to help and with great attitudes.  The front and rear bars offer a plethora of drinks in two very different settings.  Brasserie 108 offers excellent meals, either in the bar or proper dining room.  The actual hotel rooms provide an array of options, but the decor and amenities are consistent and help you feel at home.  Housekeeping has always been responsive, and never an issue with same day laundry service.  I have the option to stay at bigger, more expensive brand name hotels, but I prefer to always come back to The Marylebone!

",5,2019,03,04
123,Superb,"This hotel was an amazing experience for me. It's got absolutely stunning interior, with loads of facilities including 2 bars, restaurant and a gym. The staff within the hotel is professional, exceptionally friendly, and always ready to help. The staff within the lobby bar is superb. I wanted to highlight Dmitry at the bar for his exceptional service an great chat. Until next time my friend! Thanks to all of the Marylebone staff for making it so special for me. I'll be coming back.",5,2019,03,04
123,Amazing stay!,"This hotel is perfect in every way. Starting by the doorman, the reception, the design of the whole hotel, the staff, the rooms etc. My husband and I stayed at the hotel for 3 nights. It was a birthday present from me to him.We heard about this hotel from our freinds who live in London and they recommended it to us. Two other couples friends also have been to The Marylebone and also were excited. Same as we! The hotel has a modern and stylish design and is directly near the Bond Street, Oxford Street and many more. We really enjpyed our stay and didn't want to leave actually. Especially we would like to thank Mr. Andrei and Mr. Masi. Both were very freindly, polite, helpful and talkative. No mather what we asked for, we never heard a ""no, thats not possible!"" Tahnk you!",5,2019,03,04
123,Cannot recommend this hotel enough,This hotel beats all expectations and ticks all the boxes. I brought my boyfriend for a weekend away for his birthday and this hotel just made the weekend for us. We ate at the Brassiere which was exquisite!!! I would also like to mention that Godwin was absolutely wonderful. he was so helpful and welcoming. A true gentleman! ,5,2019,03,04
123,Summary and detail,"Our second visit this year in this hotel.Best location,excellent service and amenities,gym,spa,108 Bar,lively with fantastic food.Staff very friendly and happy to help.Special thanks to relations manager Theano doing everything for our pleasant stay.",5,2019,03,03
123,The attentive and personable Staff makes all the difference!!,"I'm an American who recently stayed at the Marylebone for several days and had a fantastic experience. The Hotel staff were always friendly, helpful and knowledgeable. Andrei, the doorman, was especially helpful and friendly.  He provided several restaurant and local attractions that were exactly what I was looking for. It was a genuine pleasure meeting him.

The rooms were great, turn down service executed every night as well.
The best amenity for me was the gym, Third Space Marylbone.  It is a full fitness center accessible via the hotel.  Hotel guests get complimentary access. Remember to bring your wallet if you want to purchase any pre or post workout drinks or snacks, as you cannot charge things to your room.",5,2019,03,01
123,Best Staffed Hotel in all of London!!,"I have travelled to many wonderful hotels and countries so when my friend recommended ""The Marylebone"" to me - I was game. She knew that I love a good pool and a good gym is a must.  I was not disappointed!!!  From the moment that I arrived I was treated with fantastic service.  The front desk host (Lucas from Prague) was The best!!!! He upgraded me, and sent me lovely wine and chocolates to my room.  Any question I had he was always there to help.  Alasdair, at The front desk was also so helpful, printing out my train ticket and an itinerary for me to ensure I made it to my flight home to Canada in a timely manner.  The manager of this hotel should be commended for having such a lovely trained and hired staff.  The pool and gym were an added bonus but they do need to devise a better way to access them, without having to go through the spa area or the actual gym while wearing a robe with my bathing suit from my room. 
The location to Oxford Street and to Bond St shops and restaurants is just 5 min away. m I suggest the hop on hop off bus that travels all around London (24 hour open ticket) to get your sense of where everything is located in this multifaceted city.  Thank-you Marylebone and a shout out to Lucas, Godwin and Alasdair on a job well done!!!  The only thing I would try to improve on is the bar staff at The 108 as they were not nearly as friendly as the hotel staff.  Many thanks and I hope to see you again soon.",5,2019,02,27
123,Amazing private rooms with five star service,"I hired out the Long Room for a 21st Dinner party for 12 guests. The service was five star. When preparing for the night Cristina was on the ball and was able to cater for any request I desired. On the day Gergo was very attentive to our needs and our glasses were always full! The food itself was stunning, everyone could not stop talking about the scallops. Would highly recommend this hotel for any occasion.",5,2019,02,27
123,Charming hotel in Marlebone,"Came here with my husband and two teen daughters. Location is perfect. Loved the cosy feel and the warm welcome of this chic but casual hotel. Rooms were comfortable. Amenities were great. Restaurant and bar were fantastic, great food and atmosphere.",5,2019,02,27
123,Thank you for great time,"I can’t rate this hotel highly enough. It has everything you could possibly think of. A very well equipped gym, breakfast lunch and diner in the restaurant area, and an amazing lobby bar. All of the staff of the hotel are very friendly, professional and always happy to help. Rooms are exceptional, spacious and very bright. We enjoyed couple of evenings in the lobby bar, and thought it was a great addition to the hotel. Dmitry at the bar is really nice, friendly and professional young man. He had a long conversation about Japanese whiskey with me and my husband which was really interesting. He also makes amazing cocktails, with choices to suit anyone. We also wanted to thank Gunter at the front desk. He’s one of the friendliest person you can meet, so helpful and makes you feel like home. We can’t wait to come back.",5,2019,02,26
123,Lovely Weekend,"We had a lovely stay here, it was just my husband and I. Definitely five star service, we were well looked after! Godwin the doorman was very welcoming and helpfull and so were the rest of the staff.  The location was perfect around the corner from shops and restaurants.We will be back again!",5,2019,02,24
123,The Marylebone is our favoritehotel,"We were welcomed on the most romantic way on the Valentines day! The very kind Dorottya in the front desk made us feel av home at the very first step inside the hotel, we got the favourite floor (the 4th) with our favourite view though our wish came the arrivalday. And  on the top of it, in our room waited a bottle of proseco and strawberries were waiting for us with a handwritten card from the Guest relation. We liked The Marylebone from earlier stays, now we LOVE it and can`t wait to go back!",5,2019,02,20
123,Perfect City Visit!,"Excellent hotel in a great location near to Bond street and Oxford street. Hotel is meticulous in every sense. Staff are genuinely attentive, helpful and friendly. Rooms are very comfortable, very quiet and incredibly relaxing. Breakfast and the food in 108 Brasserie was delicious. leisure facilities with pool are an extra bonus! Excellently well managed hotel! Bravo!!Definitely will be back!",5,2019,02,20
123,Outstanding Service,"We had an extended weekend stay at The Marylebone and used it as the base for our Daughter’s wedding in London.
From the moment we arrived with the Bride to be and were greeted warmly by Gunther, to the time we left three days later and were escorted to our car, accompanied by Roberto with an umbrella to avoid the rain, we had an assured feeling that nothing was too much trouble for the whole team at The Marylebone.
Everyone seemed to know our names, wanted to know how the wedding went, and Gunther and his team were even on hand to arrange repairs to the cracked icing on the wedding cake that had occurred in transit from home!
Gunther’s preparation of the Bride and Groom’s suite was absolute perfection, with rose petals, champagne and chocolates awaiting the arrival of the happy couple, provided them with a memorable moment.
Our experience of staying at many fine hotels around the world is that The Marylebone is definitely amongst that category, and must certainly rank as one of London’s friendliest hotels, providing clients with outstanding personalised service. 
Our sincerest thanks to all the team at The Marylebone for helping make our Daughters wedding such a stress free and perfect weekend.",5,2019,02,19
123,Ideal location & wonderful staff,"A lovely boutique hotel with well appointed rooms.  Great location just steps away from pubs, great restaurants and shopping!

Working in hospitality myself I can say I was very impressed.",5,2019,02,18
123,Perfect location and great customer service,"Concierge was so helpful. They were willing to do anything/everything to accommodate us. I really appreciated that they made everything easy for us and helped us will all favors (whether it was printing papers for work or making my husband's birthday celebration extra special). They were quick to respond via email as I was traveling from the US and had many questions about reservations, etc. beforehand. Would definitely recommend! Also, bar/tea area was great. Drinks/food were delicious.",4,2019,02,18

123,My stay at the Marylebone,"I had a great time at Marylebone last weekend. 
I love coming here, the atmosphere is great and very beautiful hotel. Gunther made us feel really welcome and took real good care of us.

I will totally visit again ",5,2019,02,03
123,Just lovely,"I stayed in their “cozy” room.   It had everything that I needed. The service and attention are excellent. In addition, the surrounding area had many small shops and became alive  at night with people out shopping and eating. It is expensive but I splurged for this stay  because I had not been to London for 10 years and wanted some pampering and a nice place to stay and sleep. ",5,2019,02,03
123,"Good as ever, getting better!","Great location, helpful staff--especially Gunther at the front desk, and good-sized rooms. Plus a great swimming pool, a big gym, and a nice restaurant. I've stayed at this hotel many times. In my last stay, in December, I was pleased to see the reception areas/lounges/bars on the ground floor had been improved and somewhat separated so the room for people who want coffee or tea and a quiet chat is separate from several other areas that cater to a drinks crowd that may be a bit louder.",5,2019,02,03
123,Always a relaxing stay,"I have been staying at The Marylebone since relocating abroad from London. I always look forward to my return stay. As soon as you arrive the doormen are extremely welcoming. On our last visit we arrived very stressed with a toddler and an 8 week old. The staff couldn’t have been more helpful and accommodating. 

When travelling with children I’d recommend a suite on a higher floor. They have plenty of space for cribs and our double stroller without feeling cramped. 

The breakfast offering is delicious with plenty of choices. I also highly recommend their juices! 

All public areas of the hotel are immaculate and are kept to an excellent standard. Hopefully in the near future the rooms will start to have some renovations as they are a little tired but still incredibly comfortable and the housekeeping standards are extremely high. 

On our last visit we had a slight noise issue ( it was the week before Xmas so we have to make some allowances) Management couldn’t have resolved it any better and I’d like to extend a special thanks to Gunther. 

I cannot wait for my next visit!",5,2019,01,30
123,Home away from home,"This is the Hotel we always stay in London for past four years. Service is really great, breakfast is amazing, junior suite is the best option to stay with a baby so there is plenty of room for everyone. Each room is a bit different. Doorman Roberto already knows our babys name and always greats us like we're there every week. Rooms have everything you would need, even baby amenities and plush teddys wait in the room. If you need something it will be done ASAP and roomservice is excellent. There is also a great bar you can go down to in the evening.",5,2019,01,30
123,Fantastic Venue for Corporate Dinner,"I was organising a corporate dinner for our company with 35 guests to be held at The Marylebone. I liaised with Cristina Giudice in the events team to arrange and she was nothing but extremely helpful throughout the entire process! Taking into account that we were short on time and there were a few changes to be made along the way, Cristina and the team were more than happy to accommodate and very quick to respond to any queries. The guests were very impressed with the dinner and the stunning venue starting with drinks on the terrace and then dinner in The Blue Room. The staff were extremely attentive and made the evening a huge success!",5,2019,01,28
123,Fantastic venue and wonderfull staff,"I organised a meeting of physicians from across the UK, booking a drinks reception, dinner, B&B and meeting facilities. In the run up to the event, Cristina was always on hand, providing information and support as needed, making the whole process straightforward. Both the physicians and our staff found the venue and the catering to be of high quality, and the onsite staff (Gergo, in particular) to be extremely helpful and friendly. The hotel played a large role in ensuring the success of our event, and I will gladly book again.",5,2019,01,28
123,Amazing staff!!!,"I work very close to The Marylebone, so very often I have lunch, dinner or just a few (sometimes not so few!) drinks at the hotel. This place has the most amazing people working there that I ever met in a hotel. The staff is extremely friendly and I really enjoy my time and feel welcome when I am there. The manager Gunther is so polite and such a warm person. When a family I know was staying at the hotel, I've heard Gunther goes out of his way to make sure they were getting the best experience at the hotel. The doormen are amazing and we really feel welcome when we arrive at the Marylebone. Roberto is always happy and always available for a quick chat in Italian! Andrew last time I was drinking at the bar he kept eye on my time to the airport so I could relax! Godwin is a very kind person and very attentive. Alasdair always have a beautiful smile and he is so lovely, I always enjoy a quick chat with him while I wait for my taxi. The food at the restaurant and at the bar is delicious, fresh and very well prepared. I just wish the bar served mini desserts!  Overall the place is really nice, but all the staff truly makes the place very special!!",5,2019,01,25
123,Pleasant,"I went there, at the bar several times and its always pleasant.
I always order my drink with Nicolas(the bartender).
He did all my drinks and they were all good.
He knows his job and does not show off like orhers in this industry. He is kind and I like to talk with him.

I will come back for sure.

Thanks Nicolas",5,2019,01,25
123,Excellent hotel but our room was too small,"My fiancé and I stayed here for two nights on the basis of the location, the excellent reviews we had read and the hotel’s membership of the Discovery loyalty scheme. I had requested early check-in which the hotel provided which was very helpful. The first room we checked into upon arrival was still being refurbished and a maintenance worker in the room told me there had been a mistake so I had to go back to reception to ask for another room. The second room which we were allocated was too small for two people and had no space for us to store our suitcases. The bathroom was also very small. Possibly because of its small size, the room tended to become very hot (both day and night) which required us to leave on the very noisy and outdated air conditioning unit whenever we were in the room. Hopefully these air conditioning units will be replaced as they look out of place next to the very modern TV and other smart furnishings.

As for the positives, the staff (especially the doormen and reception staff) were very attentive and friendly. The location of the hotel was excellent. The lounge area and restaurant are very smart and the daily breakfast and dinner in the restaurant were excellent. Dinner was reasonably good value for money. The gym was very good (the Third Space Gym is part of the hotel building and I was very impressed by this). The WiFi was very good. 

I would stay at the hotel again but only after booking one of the larger rooms. ",4,2019,01,25
123,Great hotel!,"This is our third time here and we love it. Staff is great and helpful. Rooms nice and clean. Location is awesome. We will return. Breakfast is a good option to the deal. Overall, excellent hotel and value.",5,2019,01,24
123,"Amazing Stay, Great Location and even better service :)","I stayed in the Marylebone for 4 nights with my boyfriend just last weekend. I really cannot recommend this Hotel enough. From the second we arrived we were treated like Royalty. We arrived at around 10.30am and although check in wasn't until 3pm, we were brought to our room straight away which was great. The staff from the managers, to waiters/waitresses at breakfast, and the very kind doormen could not have been nicer. The breakfast was sooo delicious, pancakes and eggs were so tasty. We were very kindly treated to a bottle of champagne and chocolates in our room compliments of Mo which was such a nice surprise. Location is perfect, just off oxford street and access to the underground. We will be back as soon as we can, thank you to all the staff :)",5,2019,01,24
123,Short trip to London,"Very nice Hotel, warm and welcoming at reception. The room was very spacious with the bed very comfortable. 
Unfortunately I didn't stay long enough to use the gym or pool but will certainly try them on my next stay. 
Thank you to the hotel receptionists Brigita & Gunther for organising the changes to the room required for my stay.",5,2019,01,23
123,Satisfied with the staying there,"I really appreciated to be there.
Nice hospitality, great staff and my special tanks for Ghunter who helped me to so many things, personal and profissional to. The hotel is close to everything you need when you are in London . And I really love the GYM the  swimming pool is lovely .",5,2019,01,21
123,Great from every angle,"A short, yet nonetheless, enjoyable experience. From doorman, to concierge, to tea-room, bar and private room, hospitality and party. It's the attentive service and the little touches of detail. Plus the layout is experiential in that it is intriguing and satisfied my natural curiosity. Will return to savour and discovered more.",5,2019,01,20
123,Excellent Service & Facilities,"We've stayed at this hotel on 4 separate occasions and this has become a home away from home for us. The staff are excellent, in particular Gunther, Marianna, Klaudia, Sergio and Massi. The hotel is ideally located for a tourist or business person with the amenities of Oxford Street & Bond Street only 10 minutes away. I especially like the cosy nooks on the ground floor and boutique feel of the hotel. I would highly recommend.",5,2019,01,20
123,"Beautiful, comfortable, delicious breakfast and delightful staff!","I stayed in the Marylebone hotel during Christmas and it was a lovely experience! What a great vibe, beautiful decoration, delicious breakfast. The highest point of the experience was, however, the staff. I am especially thankful to Andrew, who was really lovely and helpful all the time. I am pregnant and he was really attentive in all situations, he even went to the tube station to get me a baby on board pin. I have no words to express how lovely he was! I'm living in Bath and I'm decided to always stay there when I'm in London.",5,2019,01,20
123,mrs r,"I'm always met with exceptionally attentive, helpful and friendly staff, especially Andrew and the staff at the bar. Lovely ambience in the evening at the various cocktail lounges;a perfect location for  either a casual or more formal meeting.",5,2019,01,19
123,We love Gunther!,"The Marylebone Hotel is gorgeous. Incredible gym, pool, and bar— along with great aromatherapy bath supplies. Talk to Gunther if you are staying at the hotel, he is such a sweet and helpful guest relations manager. He really went out of his way to make sure both me and my colleagues were as comfortable as possible. He helped ensure we had the best rooms for our stay and also had great suggestions for things to do in London. I can’t say enough about how great Gunther is! If back in London we will definitely stay here again since the experience has been fabulous!",5,2019,01,19
123,Extremely accomodating,This hotel was great and the staff are extremely accomodating. Gunther was extremely helpful in getting me the room that I wanted and gave amazing recommendations for places to go and sights to see. I would definitely stay here again!,5,2019,01,19
123,Cracking Bar,"Fantastic bar at The Marylebone, with lovely drinks and professional service. 

Spoke with the guest relations manager Gunther, who couldn’t have been more helpful, a credit to the hotel. 

I would recommend coming to the bar with friends for a good night out or even a cheeky day time drink.",5,2019,01,19
123,Mrs Rupinder Nastor,"Beautiful Hotel, service was brilliant! From the doorman Roberto and everyone else in concierge. I stayed for 4 nights and was welcomed every day with the warmest smile. 

The food is amazing here too. Very warm and cozy surroundings. I would definitely stay here again. 

If you want great service,great food, beautiful surroundings, this is a great place to unwind or have your business meetings. 

Thank you for an amazing time! ❤️",5,2019,01,18
123,Great hotel but food can be better,"A great upscale hotel located near Oxford circus and bond street underground station, around 10mins walk. Lifts and room kind of small but beds are comfy. The room had a huge 65' TV. The breakfast has a modest offering for self service and also comes with ala carte selection of English Breakfast and more. The banana toast was great. 

But Somehow food standard for room service was not so great. On the first night I ordered a fish and chips and it was bitter. Third night I ordered a club sandwich, the chicken and bacon streaks were downright tough and I can't even bite into it.",4,2019,01,15
123,Excellent event venue,"There’s lots to recommend the meeting rooms at this well located West End hotel. The rooms themselves have a contemporary European feel and are well proportioned. The dedicated staff, today Peter and Otto, were on the ball and very attentive. The salad lunch was perfect and much better than the usual sandwiches. Recommended. ",5,2019,01,15
123,Repeat business at lobby bar,An amazing team and special thanks to the ongoing work of Jami & Fred who have made my frequent visits that much more memorable through excellent customer service and a genuine enthusiasm for their work. ,5,2019,01,15
123,Lovely hotel ion a great location,"We have just had a lovely stay at The Marylebone just off of Oxford street and couldn't of been happier with the hotel, it's staff and the service we were given. The hotel amenities were good, room was excellent and quiet at night and the breakfast was amazing. Will definitely be staying again on our next London weekend.",5,2019,01,15
123,"Lovely hotel, friendly staff and great location","We spend 3 nights last week at the Marylebone.  My first time, but my partner stays their quite a bit.  And I understand why!  Its a stunning location, the staff are super-friendly and the hotel has a lovely feel about it.  Angie and Gunther (front desk) were brilliant.  I will definitely be back.",5,2019,01,15
123,Gunter: he was outstanding. He was an amazing person giving excellent service at all times.,"We arrived at the hotel. We loved the hotel. There were excellent staff members on duty when we arrived.
Gunter gave us excellent, first rate service. He asked us all the time if we needed anything and was happy to help us with anything at any time.
Because of Gunter we will definitely return as soon as possible to enjoy his excellent service.
The suite was excellent, neat and clean and with a beautiful view.
I will certainly recommend this to all my friends all over the world.
I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough.",5,2019,01,15
123,Best service ever and great hotel close to Oxford street.,"We were greeted with a smile the minute we got out of the taxi, the minute our laugage hit the ground, someone was there to cary it in for us.At the reception, we had a warm welcome, and because it was our honeymoon, the hotel send us wine and chocolate. So thoughtfull.Everywhere at the hotel there were smiles and you would feel very welcome.The room is clean(the clean and tidy your bed at least twice a day) and good size.Brilliant bed(and Im pretty picky with beds, but this one was great to sleep in)Its close to the shopping meca Oxford street and in a area with lots og cafe´s, pubs and restaurants.Its our second time there, and we will diffently be back.",5,2019,01,14

123,Great stay at the Marleybone,"The Marleybone is a very nice, comfortable hotel with very kind and helpful staff. I was in London for business and the hotel was in a great location for me for my business and for enjoying myself after work. The rooms are very nice, clean and comfortable. Breakfast was great and the service was also great. I'm sorry I don't recall the names of everyone on the hotel's staff who were so helpful, but Gunther was very helpful at checkout. I'll definitely return to stay at the Marleybone",5,2019,01,13
123,Fantastic Experience,"We stayed at The Marylebone over the Christmas period '18 and had a wonderful time! It's a lovely hotel in terms of room size, amenities and location (just off Marylebone High Street) but what really sets it apart is the welcome and attitude of the staff. We could not have been made to feel more welcome. Michal, the concierge, gave us tonnes of tips on what to do on NYE and Yavor went out of his way to source picnic blankets for us to take to Primrose Hill to watch the fireworks. Nothing we asked for was too much trouble. Like the Westbury in Dublin, a sister hotel, the warmth and friendliness of the staff is out of this world and you're made to feel like family. Everything a stay at a hotel should be. I felt sad leaving-we'll be back! Take care, guys! Bernie",5,2019,01,12
123,Business,"A fantastic hotel with super friendly staff that are very helpful.
Gunther at the front house helped make the stay very enjoyable, Room was very nice and clean with fresh fruit on arrival, world class customer service. Highly recommend if you are staying in London on business or pleasure.",5,2019,01,12
123,First Class Hotel,Always an absolute pleasure to stop at the Marylebone. I wouldn’t stop anywhere else in London. Location and Staff first class. Gunther and team always ensure an enjoyable stay when both traveling for business or leisure. Spin classes at the gym are great as well if away for some time.,5,2019,01,11
123,Meeting and Event Space,"We were very well looked after by Lia and Cristina in arranging a group meeting in one of the Event spaces at the Hotel for a group of 30 people. The Library and The Conservatory are beautiful meeting areas and I would totally recommend this hidden jewel in Marylebone for any team meetings or client events. Hannah and Otto were amazing on the day, helping with AV and setting up the room, The food was delicious and plentiful and they really went to extra effort to make gorgeous food for our attendee with a nut allergy. I would have no hesitation in recommending the Events team here and would use them again as soon as I have a business need.",5,2019,01,11
123,Wonderful afternoon tea ,"Booked a special afternoon tea here with a friend who is an expert on London tea venues. This was something very different... Wonderful welcoming personal professional service from attentive and friendly staff made us feel happy from the beginning.

Excellent food, interesting selection and not the usual boring afternoon tea fayre. Really tasty and fresh... And even offered seconds!

Thanks for a great visit!

123,"Great hotel, great area","I've stayed here for some 4 years, 20-30 nights a year.  Every so often I stay somewhere else to see what the competition is like.  I come back here every time; the place just works, the staff are great and the location is great.  Good to see they have promoted Gunter to run guest relations - well deserved promotion.",5,2019,01,10
123,Amazing hotel with exceptional staff,We stayed here for 2 nights whilst having a procedure nearby. The hotel staff couldn’t do enough for us and where so attentive. The facilities on offer were amazing from the spa to the choice of bar areas were exceptional and designed to a high standard. The adjoining bar called 108 is well worth a visit. Would definitely return to this hotel to stay.,5,2019,01,10
123,"Calm, very clean and nicely decorated","I booked this hotel for my parents over the Christmas Holidays. The Marylebone is a great boutique hotel, calm and decorated with taste. The location is outstanding: walking distance from shops, bars, restaurants and numerous tube and bus options to venture out of the West End. Gareth, the general manager and his team are attentive. I highly recommend this hotel.",5,2019,01,10
123,Great service and best hotel gym,"Marylebone hotel is a great location for business travelers.  They have a nice gym, pool and spa at hotel plus Gunther at Concierge Desk helped with last-minute meeting needs.  I would definitely stay here again for both pleasure and business travel.",5,2019,01,09
123,Christmas Party,"I booked a client Christmas party in the upstairs event space at The Marylebone for December 2018. I have used The Doyle Collection hotels before for other clients and I was very impressed with the service and general communication the was provided by Elena on initial enquiry through to site visit and contract stage. 
My client had the best time at the party and I would like to thank Cristina, Gergo, and Andres including Elena for making my client's experience at the hotel one to remember. Many of her team have actually said they don't know how they will top the venue for 2019.

Well done team and thank you once again - I will be recommending to other clients for sure!!",5,2019,01,09
123,A Pure Joy,"Like I have always said, great Hotels and Cafes, the Great Ones, are like well-fitted gloves to a hand, and the Marylebone Hotel is just one of those! I first found this gem just before Christmas but today I popped in for a well-deserved cup of Kaffee, and how delighted I was with the place.

What I love about this Hotel is the downstairs, the ability to sit in its well-accommodating areas of soft sofas and to sit in front of an open lit fire. The atmosphere is extremely relaxing and the staff is very attentive. I might just stay there one night so that I can enjoy being in its atmosphere all day",5,2019,01,08
123,Our visit to marylebone hotel,"Marylebone hotel is situated on Welbeck st. We again stayed at the hotel for a short visit to London recently and our stay was absolutely great. The hotel is ideally located about 3 min from oxford st. The entire experience from reservation - Mr Gunther who has recently returned back made it very convenient for us. We got the room of our choice having previously stayed here. The staff is very hospitable and Marylebone for me is like "" home away from home"". Even the bell boy - Andrew was very helpful. Breakfast is great and the ambience of the restaurant is amazing. Overall a great experience once again and I have no hesitation in saying that I will only return to Marylebone hotel in London. Well done Gunther and team! Regards Ahsan .",5,2019,01,08
123,A great end to the Christmas holiday,"Mum & Dad with teenage son - who “seriously” did not want not to share a family room..!
So Dad phoned the hotel and they quickly sorted out two interconnecting rooms with differing levels of style (& price point), so M&D still got a more comfortable room but with the confidence of our teenager next door..
On arriving into his room, our son ran through into our room to tell us of his greeting - a champagne bucket with ice filled with Coca-Cola and a plate of chocolate cake.. To say the least, he was thrilled...
M&D’s room received G&Ts later that evening, so everyone very happy...
The service in this hotel is exemplary from the doorman, the check in desk, the room staff & the guys on at breakfast - nothing is too much trouble... 
I also stay here on business - the same level of service also always given...
Thankyou to one and all ",5,2019,01,07
123,Pleasure,"The hotel is very nice. Everything is new, new rooms. 
The staff in hotel is very kind and professional!
Service is the highest level! I was in a lot of hotels, but never get the service like that ever!
I’ll recommend to all my friends this hotel!!!!",5,2019,01,07
123,Really nice cocktails,"I want to say thank you to Nicolas, the bartender for his amazing cockails. Really nice and professional. I tested many cocktails and still as good ! Come on to drink some ! The place is amazing too !",5,2019,01,06
123,post Christmas Shopping and get away.,"I searched for hotels close to Oxford street, so we could find some bargains after Christmas. the Marylebone offered everything I wanted and was cheaper than most other Hotels.
when we arrived our room was not ready and we were given vouchers for the bar and our bags were looked after, the reception staff apologised and said the room will be ready in half an hour.
we found all the staff extremely helpful and attentive with sincerity. we found the hotel in very good decorative order and clean. a very art deco vibe going on throughout the hotel, from the lounge, the cocktail bar, pantry, restaurant and bar area. the room was large enough and the bed was comfy. the bathroom was clean with bath and shower and we had a selection of soap, shampoo, bodywash and body lotion. there was a well stocked mini-bar, wardrobe with enough hangers. the Hotel is about a 10 minute walk from Oxford St. but was extremely quiet as most of the area is residential which made for a peaceful night sleep. the breakfast we opted for was the continental, which was good value for money and the choice was excellent - cereal, croissants, pain o chocolate, muffins, jams, cold cut meats, cheeses, fresh bread and rolls, toast, fruit tea and coffee. you could also order from the menu, what I saw all looked extremely well prepared and all plates were empty. we did eat dinner in the hotel and this was reasonable and the food was great and the choice and quality of wines was excellent",4,2019,01,06
123,Amazing hotel,"We enjoyed pur 3 days at the marylebone hotel. 
The staff is very kind, mostly Toby and Godwin who assisted us in getting the best arrangements. 
The hotel is in a the best location, 5 min walk from oxford street (bond street station). We were urgraded without asking because the hotel was not fully booked. The breakfast is amazing, the 108 brasserie also is. We recommend this hotel and will be back soon for sure !!!",5,2019,01,06
123,"Newly renovated, excellently located. ",I stayed here for three nights over the New Year. The location is excellent for its proximity to Marylebone High Street and Mayfair which are famous for the shopping and wine & dine. The hotel itself has a couple nicely renovated bars and restaurants where I enjoyed a few cocktails. The room was clean and well equipped but small. Definitely would to anyone who targets to stay within W1. ,4,2019,01,06
123,Nice dinner,"Great food and amazing service I had the pleasure to meet a very nice and cool waiter called Tomas
If you’re there order the sweet potato fries you won’t regret it. I will definitely come back! Great atmosphere!",5,2019,01,05
123,"Amazing place, kindful service","I've been there at Christmas, it's a really wonderful place, feels really fancy. We had couple of cocktails in the cocktail bar with my girlfriend. Andras was serving us, he was really kind and professional, made that night joyful, also suggested us couple of really tasty cocktails. Recommended place! I will go back for sure! ",5,2019,01,05

123,In the heart of London at The Marylebone hotel,"Our most magical New Year's Eve:) 
We stayed in the heart of London at The Marylebone hotel. 
The hotel has everything you need and the Marlebone suite is as romantic and stunning as it gets. 

The staff provide a warm and professional service.
We have been here several times and tried different rooms and they are always clean and well-kept.

While our dear three-year-old slept sweetly in the room, we enjoyed a great New Year's dinner from 108 room service in front of the fireplace on our private rooftop terrace overlooking the fireworks.
Thank you so much for the pleasant upgrade Gunther Schildwachter (Guest relations manager). Riyas Kallan (The Assistant head concierge) surprised our little boy with biscuits and milks served to the room. The extra effort from the staff makes the stay remarkable. 

Stress-free luxury travel is possible at this hotel. 

We love to take walks in this safe and beautiful neighbourhood. Also recommend the small shops in The Marylebone High street, located just outside the hotel. The British luxury children's clothing, Rachel Riley is also worth a visit.

Again, we highly recommend this hotel as this is our favourite hotel in London.",5,2019,01,04
123,concierge service excellent,"Andrew and Dimitri, the 2 concierges we dealt with, were super helpful and made our stay so much easier! They helped us with storing luggage and loading heavy luggage into our taxi, thanks so much, really appreciate",4,2019,01,04
123,"Great Location, Poor Service",Great location in the Marylebone area of London.  Perfectly situated near some amazing restaurants and shops.  It's a very short walk (less than 5 minutes) to the Tube.  We loved the vibe in the lobby bar (not the 108 Bar- but that one was fine).  But the front desk service was not up to par.  We arrived several hours after the posted check in time and were told our room was not ready but should be in 15-30 minutes.  We were told we could go to the bar and they would come and find us when it was ready.  Over an hour later we went to the desk to find out what was up with our room (we had dinner plans that we needed to get ready for).  The person who had originally checked us in was gone and the new person didn't know anything about us waiting for a room.  After she called housekeeping to see if they had a room ready for us we were told it still wasn't ready because the safe had been locked by the previous guest and a manager needed to go up an open it if we wanted to use it.  We said we did want to use it during our stay but the manager could come up later and do it.  There were several other interactions like this that didn't meet our expectations.  They may have been overwhelmed during the holidays.  If we went back to London and the price was still comparable to other hotels in this class we would probably stay here again but with lower expectations on customer service.,4,2019,01,04
123,AMAZING,"We had a really pleasant stay at Marylebone hotel, the location is just perfect in London and we were upgraded to the marvellous terrasse suite that was just amazing. The suite of our child was also very pleasant and closed to our as we asked. We will certainely come back there. Special thanks to Gunther who maded our stay so nice.",5,2019,01,04
123,Smallest  bathroom ever,"We had a very enjoyable stay at the Marylebone hotel. The staff were very attentive. The room was very clean. Our only grumble was the size of the bathroom, we have never stayed in a room with such a tiny bathroom ever!  Considering the price of the rooms it wasn't very good. We had upgraded our room prior to arrival as we had read reviews about how small it would be. We actually went to reception and asked if we had been given a room from the original booking but were told no. The receptionist did say they have lots of complaint's  about the size of the bathrooms.",4,2019,01,04
123,first time,"first time I write a review just to congratulate Gunther who was very helpful with us sorting all the issues we had with our booking, he even got us a lovely surprise at our room, thing like that makes you to comeback, next time we have to try the back restaurant",5,2019,01,03
123,Amazing Stay in London,"This Hotel is great. The location is perfect, the rooms are not very big but confortable. The beds are great and you sleep perfectly and the staff is very helpfull. For a trip with friends or family I would highly recommand this hotel.",5,2019,01,03
123,"""Feeling groovy""","The hotel is very well located: near to the Metro station, Regent's Park, Madame Tussauds: we appreciated as we stayed in London with our grandchildren. A nice and comfortable room, efficient chambermaids, people always eager to help us, give information, ask us if everything is OK: we would advise our friends to come here!",5,2019,01,01
123,My stay,Hotel staff was very friendly especially Roberto the doorman! I stayed with my two kids in a studio suite and although it was a bit small for us we managed. The area of the hotel is beautiful i fell in love with London again. ,4,2018,12,30
123,Great find!,The Marylebone does not disappoint. Stayed there this month —on our one night in London — and enjoyed the accommodations very much. Nespresso coffee and a truly comfortable bed. Strong shower. The locations is great — close to shopping and the tube — and the service excellent. Special thanks to Nicolas at the front desk for the warm welcome and send-off and Roberto the doorman who sent us on our way.,5,2018,12,30
123,Nice Stay,"We stayed over at the weekend and were immediately greeted with a smile and made very welcome. This is a nice, boutique style hotel, not too large and in a great location in the heart of Marylebone, yet easy walking distance to the west end shopping areas such as Oxford Street and New Bond Street. 

Our room was available and we were assisted with our luggage to our room and show all the facilities etc. 

We and had a nice lunch in the 108 bar where the staff were also very attentive. The food was good as was the service. 

Our room was small but well appointed with good amenities and a nice sized tv, although the bathroom was very very small. On checkout it was all very efficient and Roberto was very helpful with luggage and taxi’s and a pleasure to meet! 

We would certainly re visit!! ",4,2018,12,29
123,Satisfied,"We came to the 108 bar quite late with a hope to have some food. Toomas offered us late night menu which we found very satisfying. We ordered a pizza and smoked salmon with an amazing Guinness bread.
Nice food! Great service!",5,2018,12,28
123,Mr & Mrs,"We have stayed three nights in Marylebone hotel and everything was excellent. The hotel is nearby the Oxford street, one of the most famous shopping centers in London. The room was spacious and very clean. The personnel especially Ms Theano was very kind and helpful to assist from the very beginning. We have also enjoyed our Christmas Eve at 108 Brasserie and the meal was really delicious. We will stay to Marylebone when we visit London next time.",5,2018,12,27
123,It will not let you down!,The hotel bar (the cosy and quieter side) is the best!!! The waiter Audras was professional and very sweet. The Gin he suggested was FABULOUS! Always enjoying time either on a Sat night or Sunday afternoon tea! Best place!!,5,2018,12,26

We will come back to this venue for future events.",5,2018,12,24

123,"Michal Lebek is the best concierge ever 🤗 
Andrew an amazing doorman that makes you feel at home 😉","I arrived at The Marylebone hotel jet lagged and frustrated that the airline had misplaced my luggage. I had a business meeting in an hour and another one the following day. I went to Michal and he called the airline not once but twice. He made sure that my baggage was located and gave me step directions on how to get to the airport. I am so relieved that he was on hand to walk me through the process. He is service was expeditious, experienced and friendly. While I waited Andrew the door man made sure I knew what time the subways operated and when the bag was confirmed on site brought the tastiest citrus apple cider for us all to celebrate. I am so grateful to them both for their help. So appropriatative words cannot explain. Top quality service 👍👍👍",5,2018,12,21
123,Great customer service,"We held a two day business meeting in the Marylebone Hotel in their meeting room suite in December 2018.
All was satisfactory and the best experience by far was the great customer service from the conference team, in particular Otto and Petr who were outstanding and no request was too difficult and all completed seamlessly.  
We will definitely return for future meetings.",4,2018,12,21

123,Great London hotel,"Great, friendly and super accommodating staff. From Roberto, to Gunther and our personal favorite, Daniel. When they saw that we had a baby, they gave us a bigger room (and bed), without any extra charge. The hotel is located in a fantastic neighborhood, close to shops and all touristy as well as posh areas. I'd stay here again.",5,2018,12,19

123,My stay at The Marylebone Hotel in London,"Great service overall. Staff are truly warm unlike other hotels in London. It goes from reception all the way to concierge/luggage assistance, in room dining etc. Gunther provided a great level of assistance and service during our stay. definitely will stay again there next time in London.",5,2018,12,18
123,Excellent,"Im currently staying at Marylebone hotel for the second time, i feel like a king, decent gym and spa, outstanding location, great brassiere, clean, tidy and cosy rooms and above all; couldnt find any better service ! Superb housekeeping, very professional staff 
Out of more than 10 hotels in London, this is by far my favourite. 
Thank you Marylebone Hotel :-)",5,2018,12,17

123,Corporate Christmas Party in The Courtyard and Blue Room,"We had an absolutely brilliant evening in the Courtyard and Blue Room. Gergo, Andrea and Cristina were extremely efficient and helped make the evening run seamlessly. It was very festive and we had enough space to host our own company's talent show. I would absolutely recommend this venue to anyone looking to host Christmas or any event. Next year we may look at renting the downstairs area. :)  Thanks again to all the staff.",5,2018,12,14
123,"Amazing hotel, fantastic location, great service!","We booked a last minute Saturday evening stay at The Marylebone to celebrate our Anniversary. The only room type available when we booked was a Cosy Room, we were pleasantly surprised on arrival to have been upgraded to a junior suite! 
On entering the hotel we were delighted by the Christmas decor & sweet cinnamon scents in the air. The check in was smooth & the lady on reception was friendly & did well at building rapport with us.
On entering our room we had a bottle of Prosecco, chocolate dipped strawberries & a plate of cakes with Happy Anniversary written on it waiting for us. Again another wonderful start to a romantic weekend. 
The room had a separate seating area, large queen sized bed which was comfortable. There was a good powerful hair dryer (a must for me!), Nespresso machine, iron / ironing board, slippers, bathrobe, nice toiletries and a huge digital smart TV with Casting to your device. 
The hotel has a beautiful modern Art Deco feel to it. There is a gym, swimming pool (which looked lovely) & spa area with treatment rooms. We didn’t get to use all the facilities due to only staying the one night however we did have a massage each which was relaxing. The spa treatments are on the pricey side & was not really a 5* experience. No separate relaxation area or even a drink was offered before or after treatment. Although staff were friendly there is room for improvement. 
We had breakfast in the hotel Pantry area which was lovely. There was a continental breakfast that you could help yourself too & a hot breakfast menu which was made to order. 
Overall we had a fantastic experience & would not hesitate to return.",5,2018,12,14
123,Another lovely stay,"We stayed in the Marylebone hostel for 3 nights last month and as usual it did not disappoint 
The shower was a dribble and I told reception about it and when we came back to the hotel a few hours later the shower head had been replaced and the plumber had left a note with a small box of chocolate ‘tools’. Great PR Marylebone!
When leaving we had a lot of separate bags and the concierge Riyas found my friend a large carrier bag which held most of them, making travelling so much easier",4,2018,12,13
123,Home from home,This is hotel has some of the best staff in London - with special thanks to Godwin on the door who went out of his way to make me feel welcome.The rooms are a reasonable size and very comfortable. It's location is great in west London and the pool and gym complete the picture.,5,2018,12,13
123,Elegant comfort,"The staff at the Marylebone went out of their way to make me feel welcome. From the spiced cider at check in, to the elegant lounge, comfortable bed, and full English breakfast, all of my needs were met. Is also conveniently located to shopping and shows.  I would definitely recommend staying here. ",5,2018,12,12
123,Great location -great staff,"I stayed at the Marylebone and I really loved the area.The rooms are quite small but with comfortable mattresses and nespresso machines.The location is great,quiet but also only5 minutes walking far from Bond Str station.Thanks to all the nice staff who work in Breakfast and to Theano the Greek manager for her customer service.I will definitely be back next year.",5,2018,12,12
123,Highly recommend ,I often stay here when working in London as the office is very close. I have to say the rooms and service is always top notch. The last number of times I’ve checked in I’ve dealt with Malachy at reception. I have to say that he’s always a pleasure to deal with any time I’ve had problems and he really gives the hotel that 5 star service. I will certainly continue to stay here! ,5,2018,12,12
123,Perfect venue for Corporate Christmas Party,"We had our company Christmas party in the Long Room. The venue was lovely and the staff were very friendly and attentive. One of our guests had a special dietary requirement (gluten/alcohol/meat-free!) but she was very well looked after. Portion size of the meal was so huge that I could not finish! We had a strict budget but thanks to Otto who kept close eye on our spending, we kept it within budget.
I would like to thank all the staff - Otto, Petr, Andreea, Alessio who looked after us very well during the evening, and Lia from events who helped me to organise the lovely evening.",5,2018,12,12
123,Nice little Hotel next to the shopping streets,"We were there for one night (Business trip). Nice little room with a clean bathroom. Calm area next to the all the Shops and nice restaurants.
Staff is very commited. Hotel lobby and guest area is nicely decorated.",5,2018,12,12
123,Christmas Party,"We held our annual Christmas Drinks party for family and friends in the Long Room.  We had around 65 people which works really well for the size of room.  The staff did the changeover from the previous working group meeting in super quick time and transformed the room with decorations and candle light. All the staff were super attentive and made sure that the evening ran very smoothly.  The food was served on platters and our guests were topped up with drinks throughout the evening.  A special thanks to Karina, Kosta, and Cristina and the rest of the team.  We look forward to coming back next year.",5,2018,12,12
123,Great London Hotel,We visit The Marylebone about 3 times a year on business. This is a great hotel in central London with fantastic staff. The team that look after the meetings rooms are just amazing particularly Otto and Petr who are just so customer centric. The team are a real credit to the hotel and really make your stay. Well done Marylebone keep up the good work,5,2018,12,12
123,Wedding,"5 star wedding experience through the Marylebone Hotel! 
We stayed in the hotel for our wedding weekend and from the minute we checked in with Gunther we were overwhelmed with the level of service and attention to detail.  The presidential suite was amazing with welcoming champagne and elaborately decorated private terrace overlooking the west London skyline.  Thank you to Cristina Giudice for helping us with booking and all team who looked after us. 
The wedding reception was organised by the Marylebone Rooms and we had the Palm room and adjoining Number 6 bar, which had plenty of space for 70 guests.
We have to say huge thank you to the team who organised our special day reception, especially to Hannah who was exceptional in orchestrating logistics of the day.  The decorations, lighting and general ambience were spectacular.  We would also like to  thank Karina, Andreea, Po, Allesio, Mo and Evelina for making the day run smoothly and keeping our guests glasses full.  
The food was great, as per expectations from tasting day and general coordination and delivery to the guests was without delay.  
We had a magical day which we will always remember and we are looking foreword to celebrating our wedding anniversaries at the Marylebone hotel.  

Mrs and Mr Ralph",5,2018,12,11
123,Fantastic Service & Support!,"We booked the Long Room I for an all day business meeting and the service from the reservation through to the end was fantastic. Cristina ensured that reservation process was simple and clear and everything was taken into account in terms of materials and room layout. On the day itself, Peter and Otto were extremely helpful and were on hand to help and support us with any questions or queries we had. The food was fantastic and catered for everyone. 
We will defintely use this space again for any future meetings we have and I'm sure that the other meeting participants will be sure to note this address for future meetings too as it was fully appreciated by all!",5,2018,12,11
123,Great location and accessability,"Good location, well priced and a great atmosphere. Bathrooms are tiny - be warned. The staff are very helpful, especially guest relations manager Caroline - she was a pleasure to deal with. Great place for a business trip and the service is exemplary in that regard. Bar staff could use some jazzing up and professionalism. ",4,2018,12,10
123,Amazing Property and amazing staff,"I stayed at this property for 5 nights.  It was the most amazing property I have stayed at in London.  The staff was so helpful and friendly.  The property was clean, the food was great, and the location was fantastic.  So much to do right around the corner.  I felt like the entire staff cared and truly made you feel at home.  I highly recommend this property.  Will stay here again when back in London.",5,2018,12,10

123,Excellent experience,"Yet again, another great experience on my recent stay at The Marylebone. I was on a business trip on the area and stayed for two nights last week and I must say everything was perfect. Especially the attention at the reception by Gunther was really welcoming and helpful at all times.",5,2018,12,10
123,Exceptional!,"The Marylebone.has spoiled me for all other hotels...I'll never stay anywhere else again!  The service is beyond exceptional, beautifully appointed rooms and a great social atmosphere in the lobby.  Stayed for business and wish I had extended for pleasure. Had drinks and dinner one night on site and  both were amazing - just love this little gem of a hotel in a quiet little corner of my favorite part of the city...you will want for nothing!",5,2018,12,09
123,Superb in Every Aspect,"As a couple who travels extensively I would like to compliment Mr.Walsh  a most superb general manager of the Marylebone Hotel, of being an incredible and very visible leader of a superb team that in my opinion is unmatched. 
I cannot mention Mr. Walsh without saying the same of Rebecca Colon, an amazing leader of superb staff at the front desk.
Michael, junior concierge, you sure get the job done and so efficiently and fast. Your knowledge of area restaurants and suggestions I have found to be spot on. Riyas and Rahim your amazing help in reservations is superb, of what ever might be required especially the Chelsea Football games. You are two excellent and knowledgeable concierges.
The hotel restaurant called Brasserie 108 has exceptional food served throughout the day, delicious made to order breakfasts and wonderful dinners not to mention superb English afternoon tea. Loren you do such an excellent job of commanding this restaurant, which is always filled to capacity because of your efficiency of your fabulous staff.
Chillata, your friendly greeting and smile is contagious, always a great way to start the day seeing you.
Pre Christmas the Marylebone feels like an oasis away from the huge crowds on Oxford Street but is only a five minute walk from Oxford Street.
one does not need to venture far from the hotel to find some fantastic dining venues close by. do not forget to treat yourself to a dinner in 108, fabulous service and delicious food.
The newly refurbished bar Number 6 is cozy and a great place to relax at night.
Rooms are well appointed with lovely white linen and very comfortable pillows and duvets. Amenities in the bathroom are nice and housekeeping does an excellent job with turndown service offered at night together with chocolates and complimentary water.
For the ladies a good quality hairdryer is in the room.
I love the convenience of having a well equipped gym in the hotel.
Gunther Schildwachter, you are the ultimate guest host ensuring each and every persons comfort, such a difference now that you are back, please do not leave again, and the Pastries you sent me were superb, thank you.
I  might also mention the help and suggestions of Brendon who so kindly is always there to answer any question, thank you.
You will not find a better located and appointed hotel near Oxford Street with such superb staff and I highly recommend this hotel, after many stays and over 100 nights

",5,2018,12,09
123,Worth your time and visit,"I don't usually write reviews for hotels but this entire trip has been awesome from the start to the end. This hotel was the last stop of my honeymoon and they really made it such a welcoming experience for my wife and myself. Location is near to the oxford shopping district. Staff were friendly and always ready to help. Room service was excellent. We were hungry upon arrival, ordered food and it was served promptly and mind you, the food is really good. They also gave us prosecco with strawberry choc dip every night of our stay. It was truly awesome! If there's one thing they can improve, it's perhaps the food they serve. More can be offered that are available to the customer as part of the hotel package instead of purchasing, Otherwise, they still deserve the 5 star rating. ",5,2018,12,08
123,Return trip,"I’ve written reviews of the Marylebone in the past, as I frequent the hotel on a regular basis. My latest trip deserves special mention. First, the lobby bar has finally hit its groove and the crowd and atmosphere are amazing. Drinks are really well done and the bartenders are warm and welcoming. In addition to the bar, Gunther has returned to the hotel and things feels already different. He had always been the “mayor” of the Marylebone, but now is officially responsible for guest services. Something seemed missing when he was gone, but the overall energy is back. I highly recommend this hotel. Location is amazing, service is incredible, and the rooms, charming and stylish. I should also mention the concierge Michal. He knows London so well and can plan the perfect evening for you.  ",5,2018,12,06
123,When in London...,"The Marylebone offers up THE Best location between Oxford St shopping, Mayfair & the City if you like a little ""posh"" during your vacay to Old London Towne. Be warned!!! London is NOT for the feint of pocketbook; $25 bucks for a burger $8 a pint and clothes are double the cost of same brands in Toronto",4,2018,12,06
123,"Great, great, great customer service","Upon arrival I received excellent customer service from Theano K. who guided me to my suite and explained all the amenities as well as offered to coordinate logistical arrangements -- exceptional service. Gunther S. came to my aid when I required to switch rooms as there was a mix-up on the actual booking and sorted it out with the manager on duty (Brandon (sp?)) and also made reservations for our business lunch (he also called numerous restaurants to ensure that they were open) given we had it at an odd time. Lastly Katerina helped obtain guest passes at a local gym as I work out avidly and needed additional equipment that the hotel did not have and followed up on transportation to the airport and other needs. In all, I have not experienced a better concerted level of hospitality at any other property in my 20 years of travel.",5,2018,12,04
123,Absolute awesome for Christmas travel ,"My 2nd year in a row for Christmas time to visit this hotel - charming staff, nice deco, great breakfast, amazing spa - and 5min from Oxford and Regent street. A non-Miss in London and an absolute tip for shopping travelers or West End musical goers, let alone the nearby museums. You feel embraced each time you come there and the winter smell of the candles all around makes you instantly feel Christmas-Kitsch-attracted. If it’s Motown Christmas classics or house by a DJ, the bar offers great moments at night - and you have a great start of the day with Selma and her team for tea and breakfast ... seeya back in 2019 🎄",5,2018,12,03
123,Lovely hotel with excellent staff,"We had a wonderful stay in the Marylebone. The location of the hotel is great. Only a few minutes walk to Oxford street and the underground. 

Staff couldn't have been more helpful throughout our stay, especially Gunther. We arrived early and decided to wait in the bar until our room was ready. Gunther took our bags from us and very kindly came into the bar to find us once our room was ready. He had also already arranged for our bags to be waiting in our room for us. 

We had breakfast in the hotel twice which was also very nice and well organised.

Room was very clean and a turn down service was also done. 

Could not fault anything with the hotel or the staff and we will definitely stay here again.",5,2018,12,03
123,The perfect night away! ,"My partner booked a surprise night away for me to celebrate my birthday. I work in the hotel industry so I usually pick up on little things that I think could be done better. On this occasion there are so few extremely minor things I could pick up on! So minor they are not worth noting (and were a little out of control of the hotel). 

We arrived at The Marylebone just before midday, so our room wasn’t ready yet, but they allowed us to leave our bags with them and would give us a call as soon as the room was ready. We weren’t in a rush to get into the room as we wanted to do a few things first anyway.
The wonderful Irish gentleman that checked us in was great and kept professional even when our booking couldn’t be found initially (sorry I’ve forgotten your name).
We returned just after 5pm to collect the key to our room.
We had been upgraded to a studio suite, the bags were in the room when we arrived and the hotel had placed a plate of cakes, a card from the reception manager, and a bottle of Prosecco in the room to wish me a happy birthday! 
Such wonderful touches that helped to make our stay extra special. 

The turn down staff were ever so polite and agreed to come back to service the room once we were out for dinner later that evening. 

The porters were brilliant. Very courteous and quick to help you with doors/bags if needed.

We decided not to have breakfast at the hotel as we stayed in bed a little long (it was so comfortable) so needed to get out of the hotel to get shopping and meet friends. 
We asked at reception if we could leave our luggage with them for the day which they gracefully accepted, tagged up our bags and we went on our way. 
When we returned to collect our bags the same Irish gentleman was on shift and remembered us from the day before. He was brilliant, asked us if we had a nice weekend and offered us water for our journey. 
Our bags were returned to us quickly and at least two staff asked if there was anything else they could do for us or if we needed a taxi to the train station.

We can’t wait to book a return stay! ",5,2018,12,03
123,"Great  hotel but moreso, wonderful staff and management","One of if not the best, hotel in terms of service and management that I have ever experienced.  I honestly cannot articulate how attentive all of the staff has been to any issue or need.  The location is great but more importantly the staff goes above and beyond.",5,2018,11,30
123,Excellent stay,"Visited the Marylebone hotel for one night only and I wish I could stay longer!
* Excellent location, 5 minutes walk from Oxford Street and Bond Street tube station.
* Very generous stuff! They really go beyond to make your stay memorable.
* Nice rooms, well equipped.
* The hotel has many facilities, which I did not get the chance to use.",5,2018,11,30
123,Marylebone oasis in London madness,"The Marylebone is an absolute oasis in manic London pre Christmas 
It is cool and it works as a hotel which is unusual and the team there have the balance between organisation and cool spot on . The 108 bar / restaurant is on trend and is also quality and value 
Not everyone knows this special hotel just secluded away off Marylebone High street - I am glad we found it 
Special call out has to go to the front desk and especially Gunther the Guest Relations Manager - nothing seams to be too much trouble",5,2018,11,30
123,My favourite for events,"Love staying in this hotel, we have held a few business meetings here now and Hannah is literally the dream to work with! Everything always exactly as i ask and nothing is too much trouble for anyone in this place EVER! Thanks to peter as well for keeping us fed and watered throughout the day, we most certainly will be back.Great location too! Loving all the Christmas decorations also.",5,2018,11,29
123,Event at the Marylebone,"Recently held a small day long event at this hotel and it was a fabulous success! The hotel itself is beautiful, and the staff who were on hand to assist us were wonderfully attentive! Lia was superb at assisting me with all my event planning and Otto, Gergo, Karina & Andreea were really helpful on the day and couldn't do enough to assist me. 
This was such a lovely hotel, we have decided to throw ANOTHER event there! :-) 
Great location as well.",5,2018,11,28
123,"Superb Location ..............This was my first stay,it won't be my last.","I was met at the door by Alistair who welcomed and greeted me like a regular,I was checked in by Marina a delightful receptionist who was efficient yet smiled and made me feel at ease after my long journey. 
There was a minor issue with the room, so the duty manager Gunther Schildwachter came to my assistance and resolved it immediately.
The breakfast other than the continental was cooked fresh not sitting for ages under hot lights to dry out.
My son and his fiance joined me for dinner in the 108 Restaurant on the second night, we had three superbly cooked dishes served by Michael a charming waiter.
The one thing I can say over all on this visit to The Marylebone Hotel, is service, service service a rare treat................... Thank you.",5,2018,11,27
123,Fabulous hotel in great location,My husband and I had a one night stay for our anniversary and were very impressed. We know the location well and it is ideal for visiting London. The staff were very friendly and helpful (as we were leaving the doorman offered to get a taxi and when we said we were walking he gave us 2 bottles of water!) the room was clean and comfortable and we really enjoyed the pool. The hotel had a really cosy feel and was decorated for Christmas which added to this feeling. We ate lunch and breakfast at the hotel and enjoyed both. Overall we could not find fault and hope to find an excuse to visit again soon.,5,2018,11,25
123,Great staff,"My Girlfriend and I came to London to celebrate her birthday. When we arrived at the hotel, All staff was very welcoming and one Particular was extremely helpful and just wanted to go the extra mile for you. His name was ""Godwin"" and if you read this, Thankyou again my friend. 
Room was superb, dinner was probably the only bit I'd say that has room for improvement. 

Thanks for having us, we will be back again!",5,2018,11,25
123,Outstanding Hotel,"My partner and I once again had a wonderful stay at the Marylebone hotel.  The highlight of our stay was the exceptional staff who welcomed us back like family.  We loved our homely room and going down to breakfast each morning was a pleasure.  The pool and gym are second to none, and Marylebone village is a special part of London. ",5,2018,11,24
123,Best location,"Would rather keep this gem to myself, and not flood it with tourists, but this hotel has the best location in London and a friendly, cozy atmosphere. Great food, great people, nice rooms, just a great hotel. ",5,2018,11,24

123,Beautiful hotel with top notch facilities and location,"This hotel is my absolute favourite hotel in London. It has everything you need for a pleasant stay. It is vibrant and beautiful and at the same time it is possible to find a quiet spot if that´s what you need.

The facilities are better than most hotels with a large and luxurious pool, lovely restaurant and bar and the location close to the underground, and the main train stations that take you to the airports.

The location is so that you can just walk out of the door and find everything you need and it is still quiet and comfortable to come back here and relax after a long day.

The beds ar comfortable and soft with large pillows and super soft duvets.

I recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to London for business and pleasure.",5,2018,11,23

123,Another great stay,I walked into the hotel last night at 8:30 pm and suddenly it was Christmas! A very warm welcome and the hotel has a lovely friendly feel to it.

123,Miss z cooper,"Stayed at here for one night Room was very ‘cosy’ but modern and clean and good bathroom complimentary toiletries. Room was so quiet on the 5th floor. 
Upon arrival the front of house staff were very friendly and helpful offering a warm towel for hands a complimentary drink and fruit. I arrived early but the hotel were happy to welcome me in and Held my luggage until the room was ready,  the commissionaire Andre who took my bag and wrote my surname on it welcomed me every time when opening the main entrance door by remembering my name, very impressive and a nice personal touch. 
The breakfast was gorgeous and great value for £10.00 
I had a treatment in the spa the most Fantastic massage from Julie who was a clearly experienced professional, she taylored the massage to my specific needs and went the extra mile, I would go to her more if I lived closer!
All the staff were so friendly and helpful and extremely smart as was the hotel with its luxury festive decorations. 
When we checked out the clerk asked us how we were traveling back home and checked our route for delays
 ( we didn’t ask him to!) 
Unfortunately when I arrived home I noticed I had left my iphone charger in my room, wasn’t pleased myself as it was 2 weeks old, called housekeeping who couldn’t find it but didn’t hesitate in purchasing one and sending it to me, now that’s customer service. 
10 our of 10 we look forward to returning.",5,2018,11,20

123,"Great stay, great staff, best bartender (Dmitry!)","The entire staff was incredible from the very first hello delivered sincerely from an affable gent named Godwin. Everyone seemed to be on the same page: to ensure that each guest enjoys their stay to the utmost. Perhaps my favorite experience was chatting with Dmitry, an incredibly friendly bartender, about our shared love of all things music. He gave me a long list of things to do around London from the best place to see DJs to classics like live jazz at Ronnie Scott's and blues at Ain't Nothin' But. Thank you, Dmitry! Until next time!",5,2018,11,16
123,Amazing hotel!,"We've chosen this hotel after our friends' recommendation. Our room was small and next to the lift, but with the help of the amazing Czech receptionist Lukas, we could get a much nicer and quiet room. For our surprise, when we got to the room, we had a welcome wine and fruits waiting for us. We felt like at home, or even better! Lukas also helped us in everything else a guest needs. We couldn't be happier. We are definitely coming back! Totally recommended.",5,2018,11,15
123,Gorgeous,"What a lovely hotel. Really enjoyed my stay here. The location is terrific; well heeled & pretty, very close to the action, yet away from the hordes. I slept like a log, no noise from the street or within. Loved my room; I’d requested lots of natural light & this 5th floor room had a large picture window. Thank you. Bedrooms are elegantly decorated, fittings high end, linens lux, & products top notch. My bathroom was compact but designed with style. Communal parts are immaculate & chic, I didn’t eat in Brasserie 108 but it looked smart & the bar is fab. Staff were absolutely superb. There is a good gym if you require it.

123,Very enjoyable stay,"Having just returned from a one night stay in the hotel, we would like to say that having stayed in many similar hotels in and around London over the years, this has been one of our best experiences. The location is perfect for shopping, dining etc. Marylebone has a small village atmosphere, albeit within a very large city. The reception staff were very welcoming, particularly Godwin who on several occasions enhanced our experience by ensuring that we had everything we needed. Our very comfortable room was perfect for us with stunning views across the rooftops. We look forward to staying with you again in the future.",5,2018,11,13
123,another great stay,"Just back from another fab stay at the Marylebone. Having stayed here 4 yrs ago, I am happy to report that if anything the hotel has improved!
From the moment we checked in, the staff were ever so helpful. Check in was seemless - we received a room upgrade as we were celebrating an anniversary. On entering the room it was spotlessly clean and spacious (and even had a welcome note with a bottle of prescecco)
Bed was very comfortable.
Breakfast on both mornings was superb - great choice and cooked to order.
Wonderful choice of bars in the hotel - favourite being the cocktail/wine bar at reception  area (Brasserie bar too loud on the sat night - DJ playing tunes which we felt wasnt needed - just not to our taste)
Leisure centre superb.
The location of this hotel alone is enough for us to return anytime we visit London - 5 minute walk from Oxford St in the trendy Marylebone area.
All in all another wonderful experience. 
Will not hesitate to book here again whenever we return",5,2018,11,12

The staff we worked with were hands down quick efficient and super friendly and professional.

123,"Lovely inside, great service and atmosphere ","We really enjoyed our stay last weekend. After only a minor pickle at reception where they couldn't find our second room booking (because we have the surname and not the first name!!), we quickly relaxed into the vibe of this hotel. 

The lobby bar is welcoming and service is brilliant. We could have spent all day there having gorgeous cocktails made for us! 

The rooms are comfortable and whilst our view wasn't great the bed was perfect and we had a good night's sleep.

It doesn't look much from  outside but the art deco, warm welcome and great service definitely make it a place we would revisit.

A great location  to for lovely local boutiques or easy access to Oxford / regent street.",4,2018,11,07

123,Fantastic stay,"This is our second visit to The Marylebone Hotel and it was fantastic. The attention to detail is lovely - I was with my mum and my 5yr old. They made things magical for my daughter - a teepee to sleep in and cookies and milk at bedtime are just a couple of examples of the lovely extra touches. 
The bed was extremely comfortable. We had delicious fresh fruit in our room and the bathroom and bedroom were both very smart and well equipped. 
The staff were very professional and helpful and always with a smile. We ate in the bar and had room service and the food was delicious. Thank you so much to all the staff and I really hope to come back soon. I felt totally refreshed and relaxed after staying. Beautiful hotel and in a great pocket of London.",5,2018,11,05
123,Great Location and Reasonable Value,"My wife and I chose the Marylebone as it is part of an Irish hotel chain.  The staff were friendly and attentive.  The location was perfect, just a short stroll from Oxford Street.  The only slight drawback was the small room and bathroom size for a 4* hotel.  However, despite the size, it was fitted out to a 4* standard.  

I would recommend as a good value well located hotel.",4,2018,11,05

All rooms are well designed and comfortable.  Many of our guests gave positive comments on arrival regarding the venue choice.

Elena originally dealt with the sales enquiry and was extremely professional and helped us bring the event in on budget.

Lia took over the enquiry and organised the finer details for the event.  Lia was very professional and covered every aspect of the event to ensure everything ran smoothly on the night.  We had excellent advice to help design a menu to suit various dietary requirements. 

Gergo ran the event on the evening.  Nothing was too much trouble and I felt confident that if we had a problem - it would be resolved by the team.  Other staff members such as Karina were again extremely helpful and could not do enough to ensure we were happy with the outcome of the evening.  All staff on the night gave us a great service and the quality of food and drink was excellent.  Food was plentiful!

The interior design of the place is very nicely done and the food is good but the best thing is the staff.  No idea where they get them from, if (or how) they train them but they are superb in all respects.  The whole team are great but most recently I'd mention Otto who looked after us during our most recent conference.  Lovely guy, hard working and totally unflappable - just what you need to help you run events.  

The rooms are spotless, comfortable and quiet.  Beds are comfy and the whole place is discretely run at a world class level.  Can't wait to come back again....",5,2018,11,04

123,kind and caring in every detail,"Stayed at The Marylebone for four days with the family and had a wonderful time. There were a few incidents the first day (disinformation about the kids and the pool, the kids in the hotel bar, the price we had first agreed on etc) but the staff was always very polite and service minded and keen to sort things out for us so that we were kept happy.
The breakfast was excellent, but make sure you have the full breakfast included, it's delicious and it would be a shame to miss the cooked dishes. The gym and pool was fantastic, me and my husband used it daily and the kids loved the pool (when allowed to enter).
Very quiet rooms, perfect beds, very good cleaning, nice staff and then of coarse, fantastic location just off Merylebone High Street and minutes from the hustle at Oxford Street. We all loved it!",4,2018,11,01

They were efficient, friendly and very welcoming. We were quite hungry after resolving the situation. Sadly, we were not able to try out their restaurant as it was fully booked! It looked great, we would have loved to dine there. They did however, recommend another restaurant just right next to us which was not bad as well. We hope to stay at the Marylebone in the future and would like to express our appreciation for the kind assistance we received from the staff at The Marylebone Hotel.",5,2018,10,25

The staff were extremely helpful and service-minded.The gym was extraordinary - we have never seen such a well-equipped and large gym in a hotel before. The swimming-pool was exactly that - a pool to swim in, with three lanes (A bit cold for our taste). There was also a turkish bath/sauna which was very nice, and there was a dry sauna adjacent to the showers.The breakfast was of the continental type, with some selection of cold-cuts and cheese, but I am sure we could have asked for anything and gotten it.Located in a quiet area within a five minute walk from Bond Street station/Oxford Street, this is an excellent place to stay in London.",5,2018,10,22

The Marylebone hotel itself on arrival is a very warm welcoming one, and the event spaces we hired were contemporary and just spot on. Even down to the tea/coffee catering for the day events, - there was a great supply of very tasty food and both days were different selections. Such small but clever details. I have to also say that Otto who was in charge of our event on the dates was superb. Always on hand and making sure that any guests with dietary requirements were looked after.

We had our event in the Blue Room, a delicious buffet lunch in the Courtyard and an evening dinner in the Long Room - all of which were great and also broke up the event in such a fantastic way.

Everything went amazingly well and everyone attending really enjoyed it. Thank you - we shall be back!",5,2018,10,22

123,Another great stay!,"Great room, great service from the staff (Antje, Lukas and Daniel, thanks for your help!), and a great location.  The team always make you feel welcome and they always smile! The new bar spaces and lounge are really cool and a great place to meet folk.",5,2018,10,18
123,Business Meeting in Palm 2,"We had 2 wonderful days of business meetings at The Marylebone. The room was perfect for our needs. The food and service was top notch - high quality, delicious food. Attentive and unobtrusive service. A special thank you to the team of Otto, Petr and Po. These gentlemen we great and I highly recommend you ask for them if you are having an event there. 

Thank you to all the Marylebone staff for making our time there productive and memorable. ",5,2018,10,18
123,Cosy and beautiful,"So happy with our visit to this place. A must visit if shopping on oxford street and need a chilling break. Came in for some drinks and lunch/brunch, didn’t expect it to be so busy though. Delicious food, loved the chocolate fondant. Thank you so much to Nikita for recommending us white wine for cod, it was brilliant!",5,2018,10,15
123,Quick weekend away ,"I would just like to say what an excellent stay myself and partner had. All the staff are brilliantly helpful and we received excellent recommendations from Hannah M. The pool and breakfast were an excellent treat too, making this hotel rise above many I have stayed in before. We look forward to our next stay! ",5,2018,10,14
123,We Loved our time at the Marylebone hotel!,"From arrival to our departure we had a great time!  
All of the people that work there have been friendly and took great care of us, especially Theano Karathanasopoulou! (I hope I spelled her name right!🙂)
The breakfast was included in our room rate and was served in the hotel's restaurant.  They had a great choice of breakfast food and plenty of hot egg dishes. 
Practically all the hotels, in London, we had previously stayed at, had extremely small hotel rooms.  We were astonished how nice (not only the size) our studio suite was.
So when we return to London again we will definitely try to stay at the Marylebone again!",5,2018,10,14
123,Mick Jones,"Great stay in the Marylebone Hotel as usual, very welcoming front of house staff when you arrive, looked after really well by Brendan Madden, the new bar in reception is a great addition if you want a quiet few drinks in the front area or a cocktail at the bar, really good barman and cocktail maker Jabba. Look forward to returning very soon. ",5,2018,10,13
123,Great Service,Always perfect food and service. Ashik was extremely helpfull as were all the other personnel. The service was fast. We were not rushed to vacate our table quickly. All in all a great experience as always.,5,2018,10,12
123,Customer service at it’s finest,"Staying in the Marylebone on business was a bit unsure when I approached the hotel but they are doing the front of the hotel up which will look great. Nice spa and gym but the highlight was the private events. Enjoyed 2 dinners in the new event room, service and food was faultless thanks to Esther, Hannah and Po for taking such good care of us. We enjoyed drinks after our meal in SIX till around midnight and slept very well in wonderfully comfy beds.",5,2018,10,11
123,Great private event at the Marylebone,"We had a flawless private event at the Marylebone hotel. We had many elements but nothing proved too much trouble. I was especially impressed with the AV setup- cables and adaptors were all at hand from the venue which made it a very stress free set up! When our clients required extra items the team were also all on hand. Food and drinks were excellent too. Big shout out to George Otto, Andreas and Kosta! Great team!",5,2018,10,11
123,The perfect place for the perfect event!,"We chose the Marylebone Hotel to have the launch party of our platform and we were extremely impressed with the whole team. 

The team assisting the event (Gemma, Po, Otto, Gergo, Hannah, Kosta and Andres) were so organised, responsive and helpful. They made this important night so easy for us and stress free. I usually don’t mention names in my reviews but they deserve the best team award!

The hotel itself is beautiful. The decor, the ambience are just perfect. The gentlemen at the door were also incredible; always smiling and very helpful to us and our guests.",5,2018,10,10
123,"What a great location, walking distance to many restaurants, and five star service.","Andrew at the door set the expectations of feeling like special guests.  He is a star for the hotel!  One of our group had a plumbing issue in their room, and the hotel bent over backwards getting them moved when it seemed totally full.  Everyone was extraordinarily helpful.",5,2018,10,10
123,10 stars for this hotel!!!,We stayed for 3 very good nights at the Marylebone and the rooms are smaller than any room we had had in any hotel but they are very nice and we knew that before chosing this hotel. Location and service all 10 stars. Food very expensive so we did not eat at the hotel so can not speak about food.,5,2018,10,09
123,Great guest experience,"We frequently stay at The Marylebone. During this last trip we had booked 2 separate rooms. On check-in, the lady at front desk recommended that we cancel one room and instead take a family room with an extra bed. This was the cheaper yet more comfortable option for my wife and 2 kids. The service, proactiveness, authority to make decisions and guest-focus were exceptional.

We found all the hotel staff to be professional, friendly and went out of their way to be helpful.

The gym is quite simply THE BEST hotel gym I’ve ever experienced. Location of the hotel is brilliant for central London.

Rooms are comfortable and modern and a decent size for London. Bathroom amenities are excellent. 

The Pantry and hotel restuarant / bar offer great dining options. 

All in all a superb hotel experience.",5,2018,10,09
123,Lovely stay,"Really nice hotel in a great location in the heart of Marylebone. Great rooms, lovely service, super food and a nice buzzy but not to busy atmosphere. Didn’t have a chance to try the spa but the gym is top notch. Special thanks to Andrew for the kind help at departure.",5,2018,10,08
123,Great staff,"Stayed for two nights on a visit to London. The hotel staff were exceptional, and the hotel was generally very nice. Only complaint was that the bathroom was strangely laid out / too small and the water pressure was not functioning properly but I know they had a plumber working on this. Overall a great experience. I would return / recommend. Thank you!",4,2018,10,08
123,"Still a gem, love this place.","This was my fifth or sixth stay here and will not, I hope, be the last. The staff are what makes this hotel special, they are unfailingly welcoming, cheerful, and helpful. The rooms, even the “cozy” (ie. minute) ones are comfortable and well-appointed and the public areas, restaurants etc. excellent. Though it is quite expensive, I believe that it is good value for money given it’s central location.",5,2018,10,05
123,Fond memories,"Another place to stay in my heart exploring London. Since starting my journey around Europe I’ve seen a lot of hotels and some live up to the expectations, some don’t, but this place went beyond all expectations, with great rooms, beautiful design and lovely restaurant. Many thanks to Ivo for great room service and Nikita for serving us exceptional dinner. Greetings from Poland!",5,2018,10,04
123,Perfect stay,Stayed with my wife in September as a surprise for her birthday. They were kind enough to arrange some special birthday amenities. A big thank you to Brendan for arranging everything. We will definitly be back.,5,2018,10,04
123,Wonderful Stay in a Excellent Hotel,A excellent hotel warm friendly and very helpful staff. Close to some amazing restaurants and bars including the ones in the hotel. A close walk to Oxford St where you can shop til you drop. Close to public transport and there's always taxis waiting out the front if needed. Overall a really lovely place to stay.,4,2018,10,02
123,Lovely dinner in Long Room,Held a dinner in the long room a few weeks a ago. Karina who was hosting us was very professional and on the ball. Our waiters for the night dayle and Andrea were always around and made sure we always had everything we needed for the meal. The food was top notch and speedy as we requested and the table beautifully dressed. Thank you to Hannah as well who couldn't have done more and helped manage our ever changing table plan and guest numbers. I would certainly recommend and return to the marylebone.,5,2018,10,02
123,London Hotel,"We recently stayed at The Marlebone and had a wonderful stay.  While the room and bath were small, the staff, he lounge areas, dining and location made up for it.  I would happily stay here the next time I am in London. ",5,2018,10,02
123,Excellent hotel in an amazing zone,"I love staying at The Marylebone. Simply perfect. From Roberto’s warm welcome at the entrance, to all the reception team. Rooms are well prepared and the fitness centre is a top feature. Breakfast and all amenities are top quality. I love it! ",5,2018,10,01
123,Simply outstanding. ,"The Marylebone served as our hotel and social event center for an international aesthetic advisory board. 
Guests from 7 different countries arrived and felt immediately taken care of. 
Special requests? 
Speak to Theano the Guest services manager. 

EVERYTHING that can, will be done. 

The staff went out of their way, the ambiance was great and the location was perfect. 

Excellent!

",5,2018,10,01
123,Another good event,Second time attending an event at the Marylebone and again it was a pleasure. Nice to see the front of the hotel being done up and staff lovely as alwsys. Thank you to the team who took great care of us Otto and Petr and the manager hannah who was very helpful with last minute printing and my dietary needs! See you next Year.,5,2018,09,30
123,Great casual dining.,"What a hidden gem in the Marylebone area this place is. Used to work around here and never realised just how big the place actually is. Very vibrant colours and a beautiful lobby bar by the reception. Thanks to our Waiter Nikita for great dinner service and hotel managers for showing us around.
Planning a stay here at some point.",5,2018,09,30
123,Ms,"We stayed at the Marylebone in June, July, August and September. We loved the location, the food, the Juicery and the politeness and willingness of the staff to help! Customer realtions staff was excellent and in particular Theano, who went out of her way to make us feel comfortable! We will definitely return and we strongly recommend!",5,2018,09,30
123,Amazing! ,"Fabulous room and even more fabulous and pampering bathroom. Wonderful team, frome the front desk to the concierge and the door man! Delicious breakfast and a very nice restaurant inside the hotel. In the picture my mom and the lovely Roberto ",5,2018,09,28
123,Amazing experience,"Me and my mom had a super lovely dinner at the 108 restaurant, great atmosphere and delicious food. Our waiter Nikita was very kind and suggested us great cocktails and served all of our needs very well, which left us extremely satisfied.",5,2018,09,28
123,A spectacular winemaker dinner,"The team at The Marylebone were on top form for our winemaker dinner in September 2018. Gemma's excellent organisation and coordination, Hannah's cool, calm and collected running of the evening and Chef Lindsey's delicious food made the evening run like clockwork and we were looked after superbly by Po, George and Dayle. They let us take over to decant our wines and no question or problem fazed them - including last minute dietary requirements and place name changes. Bravo Team Marylebone!",5,2018,09,27
123,Beautiful and chic,"This hotel is lovely and has everything you need for an extremely “posh” experience. The staff are incredibly kind and helpful, the rooms are comfortable and the amenities are high quality. It’s probably a little too pricey, but it was worth the stay. Even the smaller rooms are well sized and stocked with everything you can think of. ",4,2018,09,26
123,Watch out for additional charges after you leave,"The hotel was booked through a travel agency.  Unfortunately this costs more than booking directly but I had a credit with the agency I had to use.  There were no issues with my check in and the staff was very friendly.  The room was ok sized.  I felt it was expensive for what I received but I figured it was London not a New York and expected the prices to be slightly higher also booking through an agent was about $100 a night more than booking directly.  

Housekeeping did a great job of leaving nice treats many days.  There was also a Nespresso coffee maker in the room.  The hotel is connected to a full gym and I enjoyed that.  English tea was nice as well.  

One elevator was constantly out so be prepared to wait a while for the other one.

I received a bill for breakfast and the tea which was suppose to be included.  They said it would be removed.  When I checked out they indicated there was no bill and no balance due. 

About a day later my card was charged about $1800 for the stay.  I thought it was a mistake and a credit later came in for the amount minus about $35 so I assumed they 
charged me for another breakfast.  I was still on vacation so I thought I would deal with it later.  

When I returned they charged me another $1800.  Dealing with them to get this resolved now.   Fortunately my credit card company is assisting otherwise I would have to try to deal with them myself. 

Make sure you have time and energy to deal with a billing mess.  

.",2,2018,09,26
123,Staff are trying hard to make the stay worth it,"I've stayed on business and at leisure at the Marylebone over the years, since it was the Clifton Forde.
This particular one night stay, a few days ago was similar in nature to previous stays - bathroom on the tiny side, small beds, mid (London scale)tier pricing ,good room service, lounge area downstairs excellent, perfect location - with one difference: the staff this time really were on their game and made a massive difference to us.
We really appreciated the care and genuine service we received in both the lounges on the ground floor where Max and Alessandro, separately were fabulous. Thank you to both for the free cocktail ( Max) and the great conversation ( Alessandro)in Italiano!
 At the front desk, they quickly offered a discount on our bill ( without asking) for there being no hot water for the shower that morning ( the bath was fine) during our stay and we were helped into our taxi  by a helpful head concierge. Very surly taxi driver took us and our 3 suitcases to the nearby  train station ( not the hotel's fault) just a note to fellow travellers to rather call an uber. 
Thanks everyone for your compassion and care for myself and my daughter.
Look forward to the next time on a happier note personally and more time to use the pool and spa. ",4,2018,09,26
123,Great visit ,Our apartment cancelled on us as we were going to it.  It was fashion week so we had a hard time finding a hotel.  We went to the Marylebone and the had one room the first night.  My mother and I shared a room the first night and then had separate rooms.  The lady at the front (guest relations) did a great job helping us out last minute.  The rooms were great and the staff were fantastic.  I will definitely stay here again,5,2018,09,25
123,"Great bar, excellent service","Visited 108 bar on Saturday. Amazing atmosphere, nice tunes from DJ. Friendly staff, fast service. Special thanks to Max for his personalised touches in service, nice recommendations and interesting stories about wine and spirits. Definitely we'll be back..",5,2018,09,25
123,Great conference space and team! 5*,"Stayed in the Marylebone for a 3 day conference. Very impressed with the meeting areas and the team who looked after us, Hannah, Otto, Peter and Po. They looked after us very well from the tech to the delicious lunches every day, I really liked the terrace adjacent to our meeting space aswell which is unusual in London. The bedrooms could do with some upgrading but did not disappoint. Will be back again next year.",5,2018,09,24
123,Excellence personified,"Only stayed one night on this visit but as usual the hotel came up trumps! Arrived late from a long haul flight and received a warm reception from all members of staff.
I must say that the beds at the Marylebone are so comfortable and I was guaranteed a full nights sleep for the first time in nearly a week. For this trip I was alone on business but cannot wait until I visit for a long weekend with my Wife at the end of November.  Keep on delivering this great service and we will keep returning!",5,2018,09,24
123,"B, Grande","Can’t fault this hotel, lovely atmosphere great service, very clean and staff are so friendly  they go out of there way to be helpful special mention to Andrew and Brendan. Easy access for wheelchairs. Good location short distance from Oxford street. ",5,2018,09,24
123,"Good, old fashioned style","This is one of those London hotels that exudes elegance and efficiency. Plenty of staff around to greet you, put you at your ease and answer any questions or problems that you may have. The only thing that slightly took the edge off the ambiance was that there is no double glazing (or there wasn’t in the bedroom) which made the lovely sash windows a little bit rattly and the street noise a bit intrusive.",4,2018,09,24
123,Never Disappoints,"The more I stay at this hotel, the more I fall in love with everything about it! I have stayed for both business and pleasure & it will always be my first choice. The staff are incredibly friendly, the facilities are spotless & the rooms are beautiful! ",5,2018,09,24
123,Excellent experience,"Amazing stay at the Marylebone, central location and the staff were very welcoming and available to answer any questions we had during our stay. Special thanks to Michael on concierge as he was able to get us premium discounted seats for Aladdin on the west end and also recommended some restaurants for us that didn't disappoint. When leaving, Godwin was very informative about how to get to the airport and helped us with our bags during check out. Would definitely stay there again.",5,2018,09,23
123,Great Meeting Facilities & Great Service,"We used the meeting facilities at The Marylebone for one of our board meetings and were very impressed with the space as well as the service. 
We were in contact with Gemma to organise our event, who kindly showed us round the spaces beforehand, and constantly checking we had everything we could possibly need for our meeting. 
On the day, Otto provided outstanding service to us and was always on hand to assist. He could not do enough to make sure our day ran smoothly.
The food served during our meetings was very well presented, and very tasty! 

Overall, a very excellent experience and we will definitely be considering using again for future meetings.",5,2018,09,20
123,Incredible Customer Service,"Last Saturday I checked into this hotel for a much needed night away - my first in over two years without small people. Think of Christmas Eve when you were a child and you might appreciate how excited I was.

For a very short break away i needed somewhere very  well located but also with a nice spa and swimming pool and The Marylebone fit the bill perfectly. 

We were checked in less than one hour when i had a phone call from home to say that there was a sick child on their way to hospital back in Dublin. 
The front desk staff in the hotel, and in particular Marina could not have been more helpful or understanding of our situation. They were fantastic.
The child was already discharged and safely home in bed by the time we landed back in Ireland and i will, without a shadow of doubt be checking back into the Marylebone the next time i get to London. Thank you all so much and see you next time xxx",5,2018,09,20
123,"Awesome hotel, staff and location in London","I can't say enough about the Marylebone Hotel in London!!!  The staff was so friendly and helpful.  The doorman Roberto always greeted us with a smile, the concierge always come through with wonderful suggestions and Brendan, head of guest relations made us feel totally at home in the hotel.  The hotel itself is lovely, the rooms were so comfortable and nice. They have a great restaurant, 108 Brasserie serving breakfast, high tea and dinner with locally sourced food that is amazing.  We also loved the location, it is a very walkable with nice shops and restaurants.  We highly recommend this hotel.",5,2018,09,20
123,Great Location; Great Service; Great Meeting Facilities; Just OK Rooms,"The location is fantastic, and the people are incredibly professional, kind and welcoming.  The service is an A+.  Also, if you have a small meeting, the facilities are top notch and well-serviced.  From my POV, the rooms are just ok.  The hotel gym is also top notch.

Great service from Alasdair, Otto and Petr!  So appreciated.",4,2018,09,16
123,"Nice 4* hotel and location, but not without faults.","The hotel is in the nice neighborhood of Marylebone and is approximately a 7-minute walk from Oxford Street and the Bond tube station. Most of the staff were friendly and knowledgeable. Our room was of a decent size and was quiet, clean and comfortable. 

Few downsides to our stay - sometimes the reception area and lifts can be busy; and unfortunately, during my stay, there was an evacuation (possibly due to a small fire) that last 2-3 hours where we were locked out of the hotel. Upon returning no explanation, apology, or anything to make up for the inconvenience was done. Also, I forgot my phone charger which was plugged into the wall, I called the hotel looking for this a few hours after checking out but they could not help me find this.",4,2018,09,13
123,The personal touch!,"Recently stayed at the hotel. Room was great but the staff were amazing! Nothing was too much trouble! Especially Riyas; assistant head concierge!! He was soooo good! He looked after us every step of the way and gave us the best experience of the hotel! Thank you Riyas, we won’t forget you.",5,2018,09,12
123,You have to be joking,"Stayed at The Marylebone recently with my wife. We had booked a Bed and Breakfast rate some time ago. It's undoubtedly a nice hotel and reasonably priced for this area of London. The room was fine and we enjoyed our stay. On checking out I was asked if I had seen my bill (dutifully slipped under the room door whist we slept) - I had and responded that I was happy with the bill as it was, paid and left. On checking the bill later I noticed that there was an extra charge relating to service at breakfast! I am amazed that a hotel with such a reputation can (a) add a service charge to an agreed B&B rate and (b) proceed to charge me a different amount from that provided during the night without even mentioning this rather strange and unprofessional tactic. Extemely poor service and leaves a really bad taste.",3,2018,09,12
123,Fantastic location,We come here a few times a year with my wife and we are never disappointed. The service is great. The rooms are very nice and modern. Love also their swimming pool especially in winter when it is freezing cold outside! Best I think is its location next to Marylebone high street and Oxford street. Highly recommended,5,2018,09,11
123,Good hotel in general,"The whole stay was pretty good in general, until the check out. Waited 25 mins in line to check out. They said they don't do express check out so we had to wait in line even though we only had to return the room cards. 25 mins later, one of the staff came over and asked if we are checking out, he said he can just take the cards for us and we are good to go. So we just wasted 25 mins in line. 

The Third Space gym is ok, I wouldn't call it a luxury gym. Everything is so cramped together and people aren't particularly friendly (the staff and trainers).

The room is quite clean and the housekeeping staff are nice. ",3,2018,09,09
123,Great hotel! Superb location and staff!!!,"A boutique hotel centraly located in a very quiet and beautiful area. I walked everywhere. I was upgraded to a very spacious double room which was amazing. The service is wonderful. I want to specially thank Andrew and Dimitri for their superb service and help. I would love to stay in that hotel every time i will visit London, no doubt.",5,2018,09,08
123,Two days family visit to London,"I stayed in The Marylebone Hotel with my family during a short visit to London. We arrived late afternoon yet for some reason our rooms were still not ready. Apart from that everything else was great. We requested two deluxe adjacent rooms. I appreciated that the rooms were spacious, clean and almost secluded from other rooms on the floor, which meant more comfort and privacy.  Breakfast was very good and included a buffet plus a la carte option for hot food and beverages. The location is excellent too. The hotel is close to the buzzing Oxford street and very close to the underground. Every staff member was helpful and friendly. The children received a special welcome in the form of two teddy bears. I must put a special word of thank you for the front desk staff. I fell ill during my flight and when I arrived to the hotel, one of the front desk staff or concierge (can't remember his name) was extremely helpful and guided me to the nearest clinic and was kind enough to ask me if I was feeling better the next day. The price was bit on the high end but I guess it is fair given the location and the ameneties. I would give the hotel a fabulous rating except for the delay we faced during check in. I would definitely recommend it to my friends.",4,2018,09,08
123,Good Location and Gym. Rooms too small,"When in London, I choose to stay in The Marylebone for a number of reasons. First of all, it has a very good location. Close to Oxford high street and has a few good restaurants around it. It is a walking distance from Mayfair as well. Second, the hotel hosts a very nice gym (The 3rd Space) which is a happening especially early mornings.

The rooms of the Marylebone tend to be small and can do with refurbishment. The bathrooms are small as well.

A common issue I always face in this hotel is their elevators. They seem to mix up going up or down all the time!

The breakfast is ok but limited in variety despite the fact that it features an a l cart menu for the full breakfast.

I think it is a decent choice for London. But I have stayed in much better hotels for the same price for sure.

",4,2018,09,08
123,Excellent Service,The service was excellent! Every staff member was helpful and friendly. Gabriel and Andrei were especially gracious. The management here has built a great company culture and it reflects in the service. I would recommend The Marylebone whole heartedly. The food here was also excellent. I highly recommend the pan seared chicken!,5,2018,09,06
123,An amazing experience that we never felt before in any other hotel!,The Marylebone hotel was the best we have stayed as of now. The location is great near Oxford Street and very close to the underground. The breakfast was amazing with a lot of options to choose and the manager(Mr. Lorin) and his team was always there to welcome us and offer us the best service. The staff on the reception were also very kind and always with a smile to help us with whatever we wanted. The room was very clean all times and there was a room service more than once per day. We always found our room clean tight with complementary water etc. We have stayed in a lot of hotels in the past but with The Marylebone hotel it was the first time we experience such a great service. We definitely recommend to everyone to stay there for a pleasant time in London!,5,2018,09,04
123,Top Notch Service,"The hotel itself had a great feel and felt very elegant, with beautiful decor. Everyone we passed or spoke too gave us a friendly hello. Everyone was very accommodating from getting us extra toiletries in the room from helping us book theatre tickets.  

It has a bar area in reception which has a range of cocktails and spirits or coffees in the day. The connected restaurant 108 Brasserie is where we had breakfast in the morning and was open for dinner at night.

It was a 5 minute walk from Bond Street station and also very close to high street shopping and so many great cafes and restaurants nearby (Ivy Cafe was delicious). The Friday morning walking tour was also very fun. It was nice to get a tour of the neighborhood and our tour guide was excellent, informative and had great stories. 

My only complaint for the week was when we first arrived our room smelled smokey. It dissipated a bit but the towels and my clothes had a smoke smell. With that being said, the rooms were comfortable and had everything we could have asked for.",4,2018,08,31
123,Great service!,"The service is great! The staff is very friendly and respectful. The rooms are clean and comfortable. The location is great, it’s near a lot of attractions and shopping. I highly recomond this hotel .",5,2018,08,28
123,High quality all the way!,"We stayed here for a single night to celebrate my wife’s birthday. The room was prepared to reflect the occasion with complimentary treats - a lovely touch.

During our stay, we ordered room service (high quality ingredients that made for a delicious meal), used the spa facilities and had what I could only describe as an indulgent breakfast.

Every element of our stay was delivered with the highest service, to compliment the boutique decor and welcoming ambience.",5,2018,08,28
123,PEACEFUL,"I had an extremely pleasant stay in the Marylebone.   I got an exceptional welcome from the guest relations manager, Caroline Moloney.   The room was really comfortable.    I loved the linen and I was amazed at how quiet it was considering I was in the middle of a busy vibrant city.   Great location too! .   I would definitely recommend the hotel. ",5,2018,08,28
123,"Good Hotel, tiny rooms","The overall service was good, the room was clean but extremely tiny. I had an issue with the check in, I paid extremely expensive price to notice that it also excludes breakfast. (around 500 dollars) could be due to high season in London. But overall experience was OK. ",3,2018,08,27
123,Fantastic,"Spent 1 night at The Marylebone hotel and was totally impressed by the whole experience. The staff were so welcoming and friendly, the room was immaculate and the room service was fantastic. Overall a brilliant hotel. Can’t wait for my next trip to London so I can stay here again.",5,2018,08,27
123,"Amazing hotel , friendly and welcoming atmosphere ","My family and I spent 14 days at Marylebone hotel.
The staff were exceptionally friendly and experienced; thus we felt welcomed, from the moment we arrived.

The location of the hotel was perfect in a quiet area, near the shopping centres , and there were  a variety of restaurants and cafes close to it.
The hotel rooms were spacious for London, clean, and comfortable.

The breakfast in the hotel lives up to the excellent standard that the hotel sets; with different varieties of food, friendly staff especially Emma, and Oana .
In addition, the hotel provides Gluten Free options for breakfast with special care . 

Our stay was remarkable and we can credit this to Daniel Worthington  who made every effort to make sure that our stay was comfortable .

 this hotel will stay as one of my favourite in London ",5,2018,08,26
123,Mazen,"Good location....great service....and best staff; especially the concierge staff who literary organized and planned our full stay in London. Thanks a million!!!! 

The rooms could have been a bit bigger, but that’s London",4,2018,08,26
123,Charming Hotel in Marylebone,We stayed at The Marylebone Hotel for the second half of our stay in London and I wish we had stayed for the full duration. The staff was excellent and our room was wonderful. The accommodations were truly comfortable and I would recommend to anyone looking for a great hotel in London.,5,2018,08,24
123,Superb Hotel,"Wow, what and amazing experience.  This is one of the best hotels I’ve ever stayed at.  The staff was amazing and my room was so clean and comfortable.  I can’t wait to be a guest at this hotel in the near future.  Sending a special thank you to the African American Bell man( forgive me for forgetting his name) such a graceful gentleman and extremely helpful.   Thx again Marylebone Hotel x",5,2018,08,23
123,Lovely stay with 2 children,"Staff, facility and pool all terrific for a week long stay at Marylebone Hotel with 2 children ages 9 and 7.  We had a queen size bed and they brought in a roll away.  I thought price included the roll away but they charged separate, nothing crazy but be sure to ask.  Hotel in great location, 5 min walk from bond Street.  Lots of lovely shops and restaurants very close by.  Pool and gym were key.  Real lap pool and nice amenities.  Andrew at front door was exceptional with my daughters.  Chatted with them, and helped us out with luggage, directions and just nice personality.  Look forward to stay next time.",5,2018,08,22
123,"Nice rooms, Irish hospitality and location location location!","Had a great long weekend at the Marylebone, I'm a regular traveler to London and didn't realize how perfect the location is. While it's not on the Piccadilly line with direct Heathrow service, it's not much more than a mile from the Heathrow Express.  And while it was nice and quiet, the hotel is 5 minutes to Oxford street or the top of Regent Street, and within about a 15 minute walk to theaters, Hyde Park, Green Park.  In addition, Marylebone High Street is one of the nicest little streets in London, lots of small shops and restaurants. So barely used the great London Bus and Tube system.

Staff was very friendly, Andrew the doorman was particularly helpful. They were a bit disorganized at checkin and forgot to call when room was ready but while I was expecting the usual london tiny room, ended up with a lovely upgraded room, and a welcome gift of sparkling wine and fruit.  They said they upgrade rooms booked through preferred travel agents when they can, and with the agency rate included a nice free breakfast.  
Rooms are modern but comfortable - nice pillows - and internet worked well. Also  little touches like bottled water at turndown, slippers and robes.  Did take a bit to figure out the bathtub-shower but that's probably because I'm a luddite.  Aromatherapy bath gels/shampoo etc.  They do alas have the electronic minibars where you can't put your own stuff in without setting off the sensors.   Didn't notice when I booked that they had a pool so didn't bring a swimsuit to try it out.  Also didn't notice until the morning I was leaving that there's a coupon book in the room for discounts at a number of Marylebone shops, so shoppers should ask about that. 
Overall a great hotel and great value.",5,2018,08,22
123,Stay Elsewhere!,I was looking forward to staying at The Marylebone based on other TripAdvisor reviews but I was very disappointed in my stay.  1st the rooms are SO SO SO TINY.  I was just one person and had a hard time moving around / putting stuff away in the room.   And don't even start on the bathroom.  I can't even wash my face the sink is so tiny.  2nd the rooms are very run down/dirty.   At one point my AC broke and dirty water was flooding from the ceiling.  3rd the staff is very rude.  I checked in early (as that was when my flight landed) and the front desk staff proceeded to lecture me on why its hard to do an early check in.  Do you think I really cared about being lectured after a 20hour journey.,3,2018,08,20
123,Great hotel,"We’re regular weekend breakers to London and have been using The Millennium Hotel in Mayfair of late. We had a disappointing stay there last time, so thought we’d try The Marylebone having enjoyed cocktails in its 108 brasserie on several occasions. Good move, I don’t think we’ll be back to The Millennium any time soon. Modern, chic, attentive service, well located, The Marylebone has pretty much all we look for in a London hotel. Room TV a bit temperamental but nothing else negative. Would recommend. ",4,2018,08,19
123,"Excellent service, very charming hotel","We’ve stayed at the hotel 2 weeks ago for 7 nights, and we enjoyed very much!
The breakfast- was unique and delight! You can take some food from the nice buffet, and in addition you can order from the menu some eggs (in any shape: poached eggs/ Omelet with vegetables etc...) / a bowl of superfood fruits/ toasts with avocado/ different shakes and many more!

The service we received from the hotel stuff was very very welcome and warm, And thats what makes all the different : Andrey, the bell boy, was so kind and polite :) also the rest of the crew: Nicolas, Dimitry and Roberto the doorman. 

The gym is another big advantage of the hotel. There are very good Pilates/Yoga/Spinning classes- we enjoyed them very much. 

The restaurant in the hotel is very nice as well. 
And the location of the hotel is excellent: very central, and still calm and not noisy. 

Everything was perfect! The only disadvantage was the lighting in our room- at the evening time the lighting wasn’t strong enough, too dimmed.

Thanks for all
Hope to come back,

Debora & Adva",5,2018,08,19
123,Wonderful stay exceptional staff,"it is always exceptional staff that make a hotel so exceptional. of course all the staff need a captain. Rebecca Conlon you do an amazing job of having the most customer orientated front desk staff, who are exceptional, making everyone feel as if this classy hotel is their home away from home.
my must mention are Daniel and Manson. Both of these exceptionally competent people and are what shows exceptional attitude and training towards customers with courtesy , effort and politeness. Thank you to them for their patience in trying to solve the mystery of our hotel room door that would not open.
Rahim, you are one of a kind, an amazing concierge, who is always there to help and answer questions.We always appreciate you friendship and expertise that you show.
look forward to returning to our favorite hotel in London in November, thank you to the excellent staff who make our stay so special",5,2018,08,18
123,Designer,"The staff at the Marylebone Hotel is wonderful. They are always ready to help and accommodate! Telma and Marina at the front desk were fabulous assets to our visit. Donald and Dimitar were always there to greet you with a smile, and assist in any way. The concierge service was very knowledgable and was very eager to share and assist. We will be returning in the near future and we look forward to the same service.",5,2018,08,15
123,"Amazing staff, lovely food and beautiful rooms","I stayed here for my Mothers birthday in June and we went to see a show at the London Palladium. 
I wanted something to impress my mum, but not blow my bank account and this was the perfect combination the staff were SO friendly and accomodating. We even had prosecco and chocolate covered strawberries in the room PLUS cake and a card which was sooooo sweet. The chocolate strawberries are AMAZING. The lounge areas were really nicely decorating, lovely and relaxing ambience and lighting. The perfect weekend away. Thank you!",5,2018,08,12
123,Thanks from Sweden!,"My second time at this beautiful hotel! Wouldn’t consider staying somewhere else to be honest. 
Besides having everything you need from a hotel, great pool, big gym, great service, nice rooms - they have a very special staff! 

Specially Karina, she made my stay very special! 
We hade a big business dinner day one and she made us feel very special. She was super professional and did a fantastic job during the whole dinner, she was also very nice to us and made us feel very welcome! 

Next day she worked in the lounge area and you could tell she had total control. Everyone was treated equally great and she is just the definition of professionalism! 

Thanks to one individual (Karina) i would recommend Marylebone to everyone! 

Thank you!

123,Disappointing Rooms,"Booked a superior room when I went to the room it was so small the double bed was pushed against the wall with minimum room on the side to get out of bed.  When I contacted reception they told me to expect this as rooms in London are small, perhaps they’re thought because I lived in Yorkshire I had never travelled to London before. I was told this was a cosy room, two levels below what I had booked and I could not move because the hotel was full. To had to this the thermostat on the shower was broke and the plug in the bath leaked. I complained twice only to be offered a free cocktail. Honestly there are much better rooms in London than this hotel",1,2018,08,10
123,Weekend wonderland for couples ,"Stayed here with hubby post Xmas for a kid free couple of days. The hotel was beautiful! Bars are stunning, drinks amazing and breakfast plentiful. Staff were attentive and friendly. Perfect location for central London; walking distance to Covent Garden / Oxford Street. Only downside was I wish we’d upgraded our room we went for standard and it was a little on the small side...will push the boat out next time!",4,2018,08,10
123,The Marylebone,"Great location surrounded by an excellent choice of cafes. Going solo I felt comfortable and secure.
Room was sunny and clean. Breakfast was excellent. Plenty of areas to sit and read. Friendly staff.",5,2018,08,09
123,Not a looker from the outside but a gem lies within.....,"My wife and I chose a trip to London to make up for the weeks non holiday we had with the kids in Portugal. Doing some research and looking around at what the capital had to offer we decided on The Marylebone for the location, which is stunning. As you approach the place you are underwhelmed, it must be the ugliest building within half a mile! But as soon as you step through the door you are transported in to 5 star luxury. We ended up in a 6th floor suite that was fantastic, light spacious and well appointed. Prosper brought us a our cases with a great welcome and smile and we were off. Service was top notch throughout, 108 The Brasserie offered a fantastic onsite dinner one night, relaxed, comfortable high quality food with great friendly service. The health club offers stunning multi floor facilities, with a beautiful large pool hiding deep in the basement. Finally that location, minutes walk to Oxford Street or Baker Street to the North and inbetween some classically London streets with everything you could wish for, perfect! 

Don’t judge a book by its cover, open it up and it is a classic.",5,2018,08,07
123,Such a wonderful discovery,"Was trying a new hotel for a change and discovered the Marylebone and it was simply wonderful. The location, the service, the restaurants and the GYM access is AMAZING - I will absolutely return and I rarely stray from hotels that gets me points, but when you discover a gem like this you make exceptions. And lastly a special shout out to Prosper who made the trip extra special - thank you so much for all your kindness.",5,2018,08,06
123,Excellent,"My wife and I have stayed at this hotel many times over the years both for Business and pleasure trips. Very good location, high standard, well maintained, friendly and helpful staff make you feel welcome.",5,2018,08,05
123,Two fabulous nights in London,"What a wonderful hotel! We were arriving from an overnight flight from the states, got to hotel and our gorgeous room was ready. Traveling with our teenage son and the room was perfect for all three of us. Dinner in the restaurant was delicious, fun to sit out on the street and watch the nice neighborhood. We had problems with the A/C the first night and the hotel fixed the problem the next day and gave us a fan to use in the room. Concierge booked visits for us to various sights and were great to work with. And the adorable front door men, Andrew and Donald could not have been nicer. A perfect two night stay in London!",5,2018,08,03
123,Special occasion but especially poor,"I was disappointed to have booked a hotel, after much research, that didn’t meet my expectations. I have stayed in competitor hotels nearby and experience from start to finish wasn’t great here.

The only positive I can give is the breakfasts, being prompt and good range.

What was meant to be a special occasion, even with some efforts made by their team, had the shine taken off it by a small room (supposedly upgraded?) and dismissive team.

For the level that they pitch themselves at as a hotel, I’d rather pay much less and get the same experience elsewhere.

It pains me to give this feedback but I walked away feeling disappointed that it wasn’t the special trip away that I planned, due to the experience I had.",2,2018,08,02
123,Not overly impressed,"We booked a classic queen room, 2 nights. 
On check in we were allocated what can only be described as a small double and it stank of smoke, the bed was certainly not a queen and there was literally only enough room for the double bed that was in there and a small side table, no cats to be swung for sure! We went back to reception and reminded them we had booked a queen room, non smoking and this was swiftly rectified with apologies and a promise of a free drink ( this never materialised). The new room was much better, smart and spacious although the bed wasn't the most comfortable. We ordered room service dinner, it arrived promptly and the food was good. The first nights sleep was a disturbed one, a beeping lift nearby and loud voices in the corridor woke us on several occasions. We had room service breakfast which was a disappointment, over cooked food, weakest coffee ever, no toast or pastries which had been ordered - we had to ring to get the rest delivered. The second day was a joke - we were locked out of our room and had to have the key reset on at least three occasions - we also had our card charged that day and a checkout receipt under the door, they didn't seem to understand the concept of a two night stay, it was quite bizarre. All in all, good location, smart communal areas, good price but let down by too many things to recommend or return.",3,2018,08,02
123,Relaxing weekend break,"I absolutely love this gem of a hotel!

I booked in for a relaxing weekend break two weeks ago, and upon arrival, I was upgraded to a suite (Room 145) as I checked in quite late in the evening and they happened to have availability. In addition to this, I was given a drinks voucher by the lovely receptionist who checked me in (I think she could see that I was a little stressed after my travels). I thought this was a really, really nice gesture. I enjoyed a glass of wine in the front bar and I sat in this beautiful half outdoor/half indoor area which is kind of hidden (it is located to the side of the hotel).

The breakfast was out of this world each morning. I treated myself to breakfast in bed one of the mornings and room service suggested a ""refreshing scoop of vanilla ice cream"" to accompany my breakfast as apparently this makes for a great start to the day. It was a fabulous start to the day!

I ate dinner both nights in the ""108 Brasserie"", and sat outdoors under the heaters. The fish and chips (see photo), and chicken caesar salad were two of the best I've had. 

Thank you very much to all the staff for your kind and warm hospitality as always. It is a genuine pleasure to stay in your hotel. Between the food, the room, the warmth and the location, it was a perfect weekend escape. 

A special thank you to Daniel for his kindness, and to the porter, Dimitir, for providing me with such a warm welcome as i entered and left the hotel.",5,2018,07,31
123,Hotel staff empowered to delight!,"Great location, cool product, upbeat style all very good but what the team have managed to do is allow the staff the permission to delight the customers - even down to the evening chambermaid who could see my wife couldn't enjoy the turndown service because we were getting changed to go out but could see she was delighted with the chocolates so she handed us a few extra - it wasn't the chocolates and it wasn't even the smile, it was the fact she'd personally observed my wife's disappointment at missing out on turndown and personally made a gesture to bridge the gap. This type of thing happened throughout the stay and in a busy city hotel customers are busy so you need to pay attention to the little things to get an interaction - well done Mr Garreth Walsh, General Manager Sir!!",5,2018,07,31
123,Incredible Stay,"This is a great hotel. The staff were wonderful and couldn't do enough for us. The hotel is in an excellent location with Regent St and Oxford St within easy walking distance. 
There are also loads of restaurants in the area and we enjoyed both Italien and Argentinean meals. 
We stayed in a standard room which was a little bit small but was absolutely fine for a weekend stay. 
Breakfast was lovely with lots of choice and a freshly cooked English breakfast. The staff even made changes as I wasn't able to eat all of the cooked options due to  dietary intolerance. The staff just made it really easy for me.
I would definitely recommend this hotel and we'll definitely plan to stay there again.",5,2018,07,30
123,Excellent,"Excellent location near the Oxford shopping district in a quiet environment. The rooms are not alway very spacious, but offers all amenities expected. Good service from the staff. Excellent breakfast available.",5,2018,07,30
123,A gem!,"My family traveled to London in July for holiday. I was very pleased with this hotel. After a long flight we were kindly welcomed by Roberto. He introduced himself, gave us waters and gave my daughters adorable hotel teddy bears. Wonderful first impression. As we checked in a mistake had been made booking our hotel. The staff went above and beyond and bent over backwards to make it right. We were more than pleased with the solution and “no” is not in their vocabulary. The front of the house staff is perfection. If you want a hotel that greats you when you leave and come back and are
Genuinely interested in your day, this is your place. 

The concierge....amazing. I had booked some activities with Rahim before we
Arrived. He was fantastic! The first day we were there he spent more than an hour helping me plan our week. He booked activities, shows, gave dinner recommendations, directions, you name
It! The days he was not at the hotel I was
Worried bc thought no one could be as good as Rahim! Well, then I met Riyas! Equally fantastic! They both went above and beyond to do everything they could to make our holiday enjoyable. My daughters always looked forward to arriving back to the hotel bc they knew Riyas would
Great them with a big hug and ask about there day. The concierge were
Truly like our family for a week. 

If I had to give any complaint at all, it would be the breakfast. The breakfast buffet could use a better bit of improvement, however, it was complimentary. You could order many things off the menu and pay. 

Again, if you are debating on hotels, search  no More. This one is fantastic!!

123,This hotel just gets better and better -- extraordinary service and location,"I have stayed at The Marylebone for years, and I am always surprised at how they manage to get even better! The entire staff is warm, professional and happy to be of any assistance. The rooms (and room service) are great, the lobby bar has been redecorated to be even more lovely and comfortable....plus, the Pantry is a perfect place for tea, lunch or breakfast. Their restaurant, 108, is marvelous, and it now has outside tables on Marylebone Lane. It's the perfect location -- close to New Bond Street,  Oxford Street and Marylebone High Street. I consider it my home away from home and really wouldn't consider staying anywhere else.",5,2018,07,26
123,Very well located - extremely friendly staff,"I stayed 4 nights for a business trip and I really enjoyed the hotel. Everyone is very attentive, courteous and friendly. I was a upgraded to a mini studio room that was pretty spacious and very nicely decorated.
The hotel has a great coffee bar with a lovely terrace and a very nice restaurant called Pantry 108 great for breakfast, brunch, and tea.
The only issue I had was the ac in the room was not cooling enough so the front desk got me a fan...but it was extremely warm outside ",5,2018,07,25
123,Loved it,"Really great hotel! Location was good, a short walk from everything but not in the middle of to much noise and traffic. The staff was really nice and helpful and nothing was to much to ask. The rooms weren’t to big, but had a really nice standard and a great bed! A hotel I would recommend to others no doubt.",4,2018,07,23
123,tries to be more than it is,"I debated between a 2 and a 3 star. First off they do not have air conditioning. If you want a concierge, you have to wait until someone from the front desk is available and then they just tell you their favorite restaurant. Their breakfast area is crazy - the continental breakfast represents nothing so forget getting ""free continental breakfast"". They tell your room will be ready in an hour or so and when you get back your luggage will be in your room. We went walking around, got a bite to eat, and finally wandered back after about 2 hours or so. Well the room was not ready so we had to wait about 30 more minutes and then another room (below the one we reserved) was ready (bait and switch???).",3,2018,07,23
123,"Understated luxury, top service! ","This is our go-to London hotel. The location is ideal for us as we love the neighbourhood feel of Marylebone and the proximity to Oxford Street, Hyde Park etc. Expect classic old school hotel unobtrusive service with a modern twist. You will read from other reviews that the room and bathroom is small, that’s true, but what European capital city hotel doesn’t have small rooms? It’s the details that make it special, quality bathroom amenities, super comfortable bed, chocolates and huge flat screen tv (my husband made me put that bit in). We are Expedia gold members and at a VIP hotel should have got an immediate upgrade, but hey it’s July, peak season so we were happy with the 20% off food and drink which was offered. The staff were fabulous as always and we look forward to booking our next stay!",5,2018,07,23
123,Deceptive,"Very tiny room and not only ours but a lot of them, deceptive breakfast at the 108 with no sens egg Benedict and waffles just waffles without topping and presentation, “freshly!?” squeezed juice taste as normal... DECEPTIVE",3,2018,07,22
123,Conference Room - Flawless Service,"We used a room here for an event, the room itself was very good and the food was brilliant. However, the best part of the event was the staff - Katrina was lovely and helpful but most of my contact was with Otto, a true professional and exudes customer obsession. Very very good service; I highly recommend this venue.",5,2018,07,20
123,"Great hotel but tiny rooms, poor rewards program and no follow up by staff to simple requests","Standa$ rooms are tiny and expensive - have stayed in the past and rec’d an upgrade due to being a Discovery rewards program BLACK level member. Unfortunately this time none of the extra benefits were offered or provided. Had to follow up constantly on upgrade and other benefits without any feedback despite numerous assurances and apologies that the front desk staff would attend to it straight away. But they didn’t. Simple requests like bottled water required a visit to reception. All I was really after was a response or follow up on the request. None received.

Made a formal complain to front desk manager on check out - she comp’d breakfast and a few coffees on bill and assured me that she would contact me via  email that day to follow up. That was a week ago. Nothing received - yet again another customer service failure to communicate.

This was our 3rd stay at the marylebone in 12 months around the same time of year. Each other time we received an upgrade and were very happy with the service. What went wrong last week?

To the honest the benefits of the Discovery BLACK status are near worthless. As an equivalent status membe rwith SPG, Marriott, IHG and AccorHotels, I get guaranteed upgrades and breakfasts/drinks etc. Nothing seems to be guaranteed in the Discovery program. Why bother ?

What a fantastic worker and a lovely man.",5,2018,07,18
123,"Small breakfast,","1. As to me there are too few food for the breakfast. Probably for those, who just eat cereals and coffee or tea it is enough, but I would like to eat several dishes for the whole day till lunch time.
2. Great location of the hotel close to metro stations and near center and places worth to visit.",3,2018,07,17
123,Not worth the money,"The Marylebone Hotel is nice enough and in a pleasant location. The rooms were really quite small relative to what I was expecting for the cost and rating of the hotel. In general it was fine, but I don't think worth the money. My overall experience was really negative, though, because the staff was so inattentive and unhelpful.

We had an issue where the shower in our bathroom kept flooding. The first night we arrived late and the shower completely flooded the room. My boyfriend and I both mentioned the flooding to staff (one of us to someone who stopped by the room, and the other to the front desk). When we arrived back they told us it had been fixed. It had not. We had to ask again, were told it had been fixed again though it hadn't. Only after the second day and three attempts at requesting a fix was it fixed. We were offered a comped meal at the restaurant, but we already had dinner plans. They then said they'd comp the cost of our laundry, yet forgot to do that and charged us for it on the bill. We then had to go through a whole confusion at check-out to get it removed. This despite the fact that the cost of laundry was really very low and didn't really feel like it was making up for our experience. 

I also found the staff in the restaurant to be similarly inattentive. I had to ask two or three times to order before I could put in my breakfast order. 

The gym was really nice, and had an amazing sauna. That said, I was really excited to try out the spa but they were totally booked so it wasn't an option! ",2,2018,07,16
123,Expexted more,"All the common spaces are really nice, the 108 bar is a nice place to spend a night and the waiters are really nice.
Guys at the check in are really slow, it took us 15 minutes for a check in and 15 more for the check out, and the guys at the desk don't smile too much.

The room is pretty small, no space between bed and wall, you have to jump on it!!!
And the bathroom is not really comfortable, too small as well, and taking a shower means having the sink and everything laying on it completely wet.

Pity, I was tehre for just 1 night beacause I had a concert at night, and I expected a more comfortable stay.",3,2018,07,16
123,To many faults ,"From check-in till departure to many faults.
Check in lady unprofessional and unpleasant.
Rooms are very very small, you can hardly move around.
Bathroom is smaller then on a cruise boat. No comfort when you shower in the toilet area.
Housekeeping keeps on calling you despite the do not disturb sign. 
Some rooms have no curtains. We moved to a smaller standard room but at check out lower price was not added in the system.
We Will return to London for sure but will sleep somewhere else. ",2,2018,07,15
123,Nice hotel in a good location ,"The Marylebone is a modern hotel in a very nice neighborhood. It is close enough to the tube, Oxford street, and Hyde park, yet it is in a mostly upper-class neighborhood

We enjoyed sitting along the street at night h 108 restaurant ",4,2018,07,14
123,Great,"Friendly atmosphere. Ideally located. The concierge, Rahim Ismael can get you anything!!! He is a star!!! I have been staying at this hotel for many years now and it remains my top home place in London. The staff is extremely nice. The room have every facility you can imagine for a 4 stars hotel. The gym & pool are great. A MUST!! I strongly recommend.",5,2018,07,14
123,First visit to London - great hotel,"Generous sized rooms and quiet.  We had complimentary breakfast each day.  I had my family of 4 there and would stay there again.

The area was safe and had a number of boutique shops.

The attached gym was one of the better hotel gyms that I have ever stayed at.

Upon leaving, we had a selfie with the door man (Roberto Figlio Di Dio).  We loved the place and were sad to leave.",5,2018,07,13

123,Oh So Lover-ly,"It's hard to know which part of central London to stay. And then which hotel. I hit a home run with both. 

Marylebone is truly a lovely area. (And I don't use the word 'lovely' often - but it's the perfect word, esp.  after having just seen My Fair Lady at Lincoln Center)

The Marylebone is an upscale boutique hotel - superior staff and accommodations. 

Perfect location. Perfect hotel.",5,2018,07,10
123,Great Location,"We stayed here for one night to attend the British Summertime Festival and Hampton Court RHS. Great location ...10’ walk from Hyde Park and 5’ from Bond St tube.

Highly recommended.",5,2018,07,10
123,"Incredible service, beautiful setting","We recently held our wedding reception at The Marylebone and had an amazing experience. From planning the day with Gemma (who was very responsive to our requirements - thank you Gemma!) to sorting logistics with the unflappable Hannah, to the day itself, the day was stress-free and professionally delivered. We used the beautiful No.6 and had around 80 guests - there was more than enough space for everyone.

The day was a dream - Hannah helped us with last minute changes, our suppliers were able to deliver direct to the hotel and the room set up was stunning. When our guests arrived, they were expertly looked after by Hannah's team, particularly George, Otto, Andreea and Karina!!

The food was incredible (some of our guests said it was the best they'd had at a wedding!) and all our expectations were met and exceeded by the team.

A massive thank you to everyone involved for making our day so special! Highly recommended.",5,2018,07,08
123,Beautiful Hotel,"Hotel was very nice! Room and bathroom were modern, clean with glam decor. Lobby and restaurant areas have amazing design and ambiance. I had a king size bed which was very comfortable. Nice views. I was on the 6th floor and it wasn't noisy at night or in the morning.",5,2018,07,07
123,Fantastic,"One of the nicest hotels I have stayed in. The location is good, staff friendly and helpful, the restaurant is great! Our room/suite was perfect. We ordered room service one night and the food arrived very quickly and was delicious!",5,2018,07,06
123,Mr Avisar,"We had a wonderful stay.The staff was friendly, reception, Andrew the doorman was playing with our daughter every time. We really enjoyed it. Thanks everyone, we will definitely come back.",5,2018,07,06
123,Be careful they charge roon rate double,"I booked through Expedia my room and i paid full room price. I stayed on 29th of june and checked out 30th of june.
But after i checked out they charged me 216 gbp on my credit card . Room number was 182 or 184.
I contacted 4 times hotel.
They told me that they will cancel room charge.
But up to now, there is no refund on my credit card.
Please avoid this hotel!",1,2018,07,05
123,Ms Audrey O’Brien ,"It gives me great pleasure to write this review , however this is not a good hotel,it is a stupendous hotel,
Our rooms were a wonderful surprise and we all enjoyed pre -dinner drinks in the 108 brassiere followed by a delicious three course meal with impeccable service and quiet efficiency. Afterwards we adjourned to the cocktail bar for a night-cap to savour all the moments of this very special day.
In the morning we all enjoyed a sumptuous breakfast and I was so impressed that gluten free bread was available as I was born a coeliac 
And it’s not always available in previous hotels that I have been to.
Our special day was an unforgettable experience both in the pleasant attitude and willingness of the entire staff.
In the finality of things I would like to thank Roberto Figlio di dio(doorman) Brendon(guest relations manager)Lee(luggage porter) Michal Lebek(concierge)
And Gareth Walsh (General manager)
Kind regards 
Ms Audrey O’Brien ",5,2018,07,05
123,Great service,Ran a 2 day event at this hotel. George was incredibly helpful - even organised for us to watch the England match at short notice ( of course the win also helped!). Great service,5,2018,07,05
123,Be careful booking directly with the hotel. Not always the best rates.,"I have stayed many times at this hotel but always struggle with trying to find the best rates, feeling I am presented with a better offer almost as soon as I have booked. One Saturday last July 2017, I booked directly with the hotel one Saturday on the phone for the following October. I had a voucher which I was to drop into them on the Monday but later on the Saturday afternoon, an ad popped up on my Facebook which offered better rates and also included breakfast for the same dates. Luckily as I hadn’t yet delivered the voucher I was able to avail of this. We had a great stay and Other than the very small rooms, everything else was wonderful. 
This week I decided to book again for this coming October and checked online rates. I was being offered better rates on Splendia than the hotel were showing online. I called the hotel and suggested that they must be able to offer me a better rate than Splendia if I booked directly with them as they would have to share fees with them. I was made to feel as if I was lying and asked for a screenshot email of the rate, which I duly provided. It was a Sterling rate showing the price per night although the lady suggested that it was the currency or an average rate per night issue neither of which were the case. They advised me they would match it on receipt of the mail and although I sent it from my desktop there and then they did not seem to be receiving it and meantime the clock on my Splendia offer was ticking down from 5 minutes. There was no benefit to me waiting for the same rate and in the end they advised me to book with Splendia which I did. I sent an email informing them of my dissatisfaction and a copy of the booking evidencing the rates. Unfortunately it hasn’t even been acknowledged two days later. I love this hotel and always speak highly of it but I am disappointed with the booking process. I fear that it has now become so popular that it doesn’t care about what you or I think. More is the pity. Anyway, just wanted to share my story and let others know to shop around. I will let you know how my trip goes in October. ",3,2018,07,04
123,Second stay at this fine hotel,"Betting on our experience in 2013, we again booked the Marylebone for a 5-night stay with 4 other members of our family.  The hotel is still a brilliant example of how it should be done:  beautiful accommodations and common areas, stellar staff (kudos to Michal Lebek and the other concierge staff who were incredibly helpful), and delicious food.  The location, while a little difficult to find, is superb - quiet and tasteful.",5,2018,06,30
123,Fantastic service and location!,"My husband and I stayed at The Marylebone for 10 nights in June. We are very familiar with London, and this hotel provided the perfect location to explore many of our favourite restaurants and shopping spots. The service was very good and all staff were pleasant and helpful. We will definitely be back!",5,2018,06,29
123,Terrific Hotel,The hotel and accommodations were very nice. Centrally located in the Marylebone area. Easy walking distance to most attractions or quick uber away. Would stay here again. Staff was friendly and accommodating.,5,2018,06,27
123,"Wonderful hotel, fantastic location","I have just returned after a weekend stay. Fantastic hotel, lovely decor, great breakfast and brilliant location getting in and around London. 
Friendly staff, especially Hannah who went that extra mile to make our stay even more memorable.
Will will defiantly be returning.",5,2018,06,26
123,London trip,All the staff were so very helpful. The doorman Roberto was especially helpful. He exceeded all of our expectations!  The concierge helped us arrange our tours and get us tickets and took care of everything we needed with a smile.,5,2018,06,24
123,"Sleek, contemporary hotel in the perfect location","I stayed at this property with friends for  along weekend.  The location was perfect, the staff was incredibly friendly and incredibly helpful. It was an excellent experience from the doorman at check in until we checked out. Some of the rooms are a bit small (as is the case in the UK), so be prepared for that, but were very well appointed. The bed was incredibly comfortable. I will definitely stay again on my next trip to London.",5,2018,06,21
123,Amazing hotel and service,"A very nice hotel with exceptional sized rooms for a London hotel. we came for our 1st wedding anniversary and not only did the hotel upgrade us to a suite but they also sent us a bottle of champagne to celebrate, a lovely touch.",5,2018,06,21
123,An Excellent Choice for a Stay in London,"This hotel is near a tube station that puts everything you'll want to visit in London easily accessible. The surrounding neighborhood has a lot of interesting ethnic restaurant choices (Indian, Greek) that are a bit less expensive options for dining out, too.  The breakfast served at the hotel is just fantastic, especially the avocado toast.  The air conditioning in our room was not functioning properly, but the hotel staff was kind enough to not only change our room to one with working a/c but help us move all of our luggage, all with a smile.  Definitely stay at The Marylebone -- it is a great choice.",5,2018,06,21
123,Beautiful hotel and amazing service,"Centrally located and perfect for every occasion, the Marylebone Hotel is wonderful. I love the event spaces with beautiful lighting and stylish design. The service is particularly great, thank you Hannah, George, Otto, Karina, Andreea and Po.",5,2018,06,19
123,FABULOUS GEM OF A HOTEL,"I had the pleasure of staying at The Marlyebone with  my family in Feb 2018.  What a gem of a hotel.  The rooms are great, great location, great food.

I would go back in a second and can't wait to go back",5,2018,06,18
123,Excellent hotel and fantastic customer service,"I've spent a lot of time traveling to London for work, and most of those trips were in horrible hotels with uncomfortable beds and ridiculously small rooms. Compared to all the others, The Marylebone was a breath of fresh air, let me tell you! 
(1) The location is fantastic (and not just for business travelers) - you're easy walking distance to Regent Street, multiple tube stops, and a lot of great food.
(2) Their breakfast is delightful! We just did the continental, and I was a happy clam after stuffing my face with toast, jams, tasty meats and cheese, fruits, yogurts, etc. 
(3) Customer service was unbeatable. I can't even fit all my praise in one review, but from the second we stepped out of our Uber upon arrival until we left three days later the service was impeccable. 
(4) The rooms are nice and a respectable size (this was a pleasant surprise as they are ""large"" by UK standards). Bathroom was small, but got the job done just fine and had plenty of hot water to go around.

I will say that it was unseasonably hot when we were there, so the AC was having a hard time keeping up. But I have silly American standards for AC, so if it's not an ice chest, I'm hot. I wouldn't change my review for this, as this is most likely a ""me"" thing. But on the off chance that any of you intend to go the rare days it's hot and you have to have it colder than 73ºF (~22ºC), just make sure you ask them to check your room's unit.",5,2018,06,18
123,Perfect weekend away,"Visited the hotel for a romantic weekend away, and it was the perfect choice. Snazzy bar in the reception area and great service in the breakfast room. It was busy particular on the Saturday with a wedding happening but as a newly engaged couple a nice women Hannah took time out to show us the venue and explain the new rooms to us, we were very appreciative of her time as she was clearly very busy and we would certainly consider the hotel for our wedding in a couple of years!! Only negative would be the AC in the room wasn’t very affective, but didn’t really bother us. Thanks also to Manon the guest manager she was also helpful throughout our stay!",5,2018,06,17
123,Event and week stay,"Stayed at this lovely hotel for a week for a training programme. We had a 5 day conference in the meeting rooms palm bar. The staff are the best I have yet to discover Very attentive, got to know us as people and not just ‘another guest’ it was a pleasure to meet Otto, Hannah, George, Peter - thank you for my many cappachino! Karina and Andreea! A well deserved 5* Review.",5,2018,06,17
123,Amazing services and stay!,"I had an excellent experience with the Marylebone hotel this week, while having an event at the hotel in London. The staff is amazing, always attentive, doing an incredible job and helping tremendously for the event to go smoothly. I would like to thank Hannah and her team: Otto, Andreea, George, Karina, Peter and Viktor. Thanks a lot to all of you, you were amazing :)",5,2018,06,16
123,"5 night stay at Marylebone Hotel, London","My husband and I stayed at The Marylebone Hotel in London from May 23-28, 2018. While we were a bit disappointed in the room size, we were completely satisfied with the service and consideration of the employees, The breakfast was outstanding and the doorman, Roberto, went above and beyond in helping us navigate our way around the neighborhood, in getting taxi service, and always greeted us with a smile and an open door upon our arrivals and departures!  We felt like we had made a dear friend in Roberto and would look forward to staying at the Marylebone Hotel because of his warm and welcoming attitude.",4,2018,06,15
123,Outstanding service ,"I visited for a leadership conference and stayed a week.  As part of the faculty I had a lot of opportunity to work with the staff.  While they were all good, Otto and Peter really stood out.  They helped rearrange the room, conducted sound checks, and also brought cappuccinos, drinks, and anticipated requests for fresh fruits!  Their unassuming and professional service was truly outstanding!  They seemed genuinely happy to be of service.  ",5,2018,06,15
123,Fantastic Stay,"An excellent hotel, we knew it was going to be great from the moment we arrived, the location couldn't have been better, checkin was seemless and our room was lovely.  The staff were all really attentive and it was polished off by a superb breakfast the next day.  A final mention to the Spa where I had the best ever pedicure, well worth a visit.",5,2018,06,14
123,"Perfect location, nice property and great people!","Recently refurbished and nicely done. The staff here is absolutely wonderful, food is pretty good. The location of course is one of the best features-within walking distance of many nice shops and restaurants in the little 'village' of Marylebone. Rooms are of course small but well appointed. There's only one window that cranks open-wish there were two. Some people we especially were impressed with-Otto, Banquet Staff was efficient and courteous-he was so helpful to our group. Also Manon the concierge is a real pro and very helpful to us. We would stay here again for sure.",5,2018,06,14
123,Wonderful Stay,"This hotel was just lovely, fabulous location and wonderful staff who could not do enough for you!  My trip was business but would definitely book this hotel for any trip to London.  Rooms were large and the bed very comfy.  Air conditioning unit in the room was a godsend.  Only issue I had was the breakfast, would have preferred a buffet so as to ensure continuous movement in the restaurant without the hold ups of a chef making all cooked breakfasts..",4,2018,06,13
123,super hotel in super location,"very good hotel where a guests feels really welcome. Modern, good restaurants with breakfast, good pool and gym. Absolutely super location. Staff very helpful. An quite  oase in the very bossy West End",5,2018,06,12
123,perfect stay,"Everything about this refurbished hotel is excellent - the room, the guest areas, the bar (great place to watch the world go by outside, and a great atmosphere inside) and most of all, the staff - just excellent in every way - we've stayed in many hotels and (price reflected)  this is up there with the best",5,2018,06,12
123,Marylebone Hotel never disappoints,"I have stayed at many 4 and 5 Star hotels in London throughout the years. The Marylebone is my absolute favorite. The staff are so genuinely warm and helpful. The linens on the beds are high quality and housekeeping and turn down are excellent. The restaurant is top quality and they have an awesome afternoon tea. If that’s not enough, they have an indoor pool, steam room and gym. The location is perfect with all the shops and restaurants near by, not to mention a quick stroll to Regent Park. The concierge Riyas will take care of any need. Angie and Daniel always try to give you the best room available with breakfast. I always feel welcome when I am there. 
The lounge area is great for meetings and they have arranged couches and chairs in a way that promotes privacy. It’s a true gem!",5,2018,06,11
123,great service,"The hotel is very nice, a lot of common space on the first floor and the stuff is amazing. Many thanks to Prosper for being so nice to help me with my enquiry right away. I would definitely come back to this hotel again.",5,2018,06,11
123,Wonderfull service and experience in the heart of charming Marylebone,"Location ::
The hotel is located in charming Marylebone and is very calm to wander down the streets. A 5 to 10-minute walk takes you to Oxford & Regent street if you want to go shopping or another 5 minute if you want to go to luxury Mayfair. a 5-minute walk north takes you to Regent park, although I would definitely also recommend the romantic Primrose Hill. All in all, a top location if you want to be in the center but away from the crowdy tourist buzz.
Rooms ::
Standard Rooms are small, bed is small, bathroom is very small, but it didn't bother us as all is finished with luxury materials and all amenities are there: free coffee, ironing, desk, huge plasma tv (oversized for the room?), and a very good bed - which was for us the most important.
Service ::
Close to a 5* service with multiple room cleaning times a day, free water continuously, bath robes, amazingly friendly and helpful staff, professional porters and all staff is so friendly.
Food/drinks ::
We didn't take food there only enjoyed some lovely time in the bars (there are 2 outdoor bars and various indoor spots) all very cosy and typical 'British' style.

Conclusion :: GREAT hotel & service, GREAT location, BEST bang for the buck in this neighbourhood.",5,2018,06,11
123,The courtyard and library,"We celebrated the birth of our granddaughter with a drinks event for 80 people. The room had a great ambiance with foliage on the walls, an open sunroof, small lit fireplace, with scattered seating and high tables. The bar was headed by Otto who followed our instructions diligently, and managed to also look after our Spotify music playlists. His team of five Petr, Andrea, Victor, Karina and Kosta kept the canapés and bowls at a very good pace as well. It was very heartwarming when they presented the 4 babies who attended with Marylebone hotel bears. Top marks for venue, drinks, food and service.",5,2018,06,10
123,Drinks and canapé reception,"Thank you for hosting our company annual presentation and networking drinks reception. Great newly refurbished hotel and event spaces. Excellent team who looked after us Hannah, George, Po, Andreea, and Karina. The hotel has a fantastic location in central London with great transport links.",5,2018,06,10
123,High quality personal service ,"I travel a lot and could stay in many hotels around Marylebone but I keep coming back to this hotel - yes the facilities are excellent and the recent refurb is tastefully done but for me it it is the personal interaction of the staff where nothing is too much trouble. Antje in particularly runs receptions seamlessly and always makes me smile - it’s the little things when you travel a lot which you appreciate, like her asking after your family with sincerity and just naturally making you feel welcome time after time. ",5,2018,06,10
123,Great experience during weekend,"Had a short stay in the hotel, but had a good chance to visit restaurant and bar. I had a pleasant experience, specially in the bar. Great cocktails and service. It was a pleasure to have Max around, gave us a nice introduction to the gin world...
Thanks a lot",5,2018,06,09
123,Treat,"I've spent one night with my daughter on a night out to the theatre. Marina at the reception was lovely. 
Room a bit small but pristine. 
We went to the restaurant for a quick bit around 6 pm. After asking for an exception, the host gave us a table. The waiters were very attentive. Must say that I found a bit shocking had been charged an extra piece of the Seared tune almost double price of the starter size.
Breakfast was beautiful and the waiter (I believe was French) was very nice too.",5,2018,06,08
123,Great place for a Business Event,We stayed there for one night to attend a two-day business event. Everything was well arranged and the service was great! We had an excellent private dining experience with great service from Karina. She made sure we always had something to drink and did it with a smile.,5,2018,06,08
123,"Quirky hotel with real character, let down by some fundamentals","The hotel interior is fantastic in the public areas. It has real character and uniqueness.
A small sized standard room but with a really comfy bed. Nice toiletries in the bathroom.
Really Friendly staff.
Iron and ironing board in room.

That’s where the good bits stop.
The weird sewage like smell as I entered the bathroom was off putting to say the least. Although that did get better by the morning.
The iron did not work because no electrical plug worked in the room!
The TV would not turn on, the air conditioning did not work. No plug worked to charge my laptop. The lights worked though. That was a bonus.
And the fridge worked.
Ah the fridge, the tantalising mini bar fridge in the room, looked really cool. With what looked like a superb selection of drinks too. If only it was unlocked so I could use it during my stay.

If it wasn’t for the fact I didn’t find all of this out until late at night having returned from a company event I would have complained and moved rooms there and then. 

Starting a new day, I went down for an early breakfast which was included in the room price. Excellent. Albeit it was only an average continental selection. Given the cost of the rooms, having only a continental breakfast included feels cheap.

On check out I raised my issues. I did get a “I’m sorry” from the reception, but nothing else. Sorry I do expect better customer service than that.

In summary, oh dear what can I say...
It’s a Quirky hotel with character and really friendly staff. Potentially a gem let down by, lets face it, some fundamentals you expect in a room, electricity being one. I expect more from any hotel room, let alone a £300 a night hotel room.
Based on this experience I would not opt to stay here again.",1,2018,06,07
123,Great doorman,"It’s hard to find such a courtesy and kindness as Roberto does. Always a pleasure to find professional and kind people like him, by the way all hotel staff is great. It’s well connected with all the city and there’s plenty of restaurants around.",5,2018,06,07
123,Great location for team meeting,"Just returned from using the hotels facilities for a team meeting, excellent staff, food, accommodation, location, etc. The interior of the hotel has real character! Great service from Otto and Karina especially!",5,2018,06,07
123,Perfect Hotel in the perfect location,"I spent an extended vacation at the Marylebone hotel this summer.  Although it’s hard to be away from home for an extended period time, I felt completely welcomed and comfortable.  The staff is friendly and set the bar when it comes to hospitality.  
They upgraded our room to a suite which was so comfortable.  
The restaurant and bar options just within the hotel are fabulous.  They have two wonderful areas to grab a drink.  One bar is buzzing with a great energetic vibe.  The other bar is quiet and relaxing.  Both are usually pretty crowded.  
The location can’t be beat!  An easy walk to Oxford for great shopping.  The Marylebone neighborhood has quaint restaurants which are wonderful and boutique shopping too.  
Marylebone is a gem! ",5,2018,06,07
123,PERFECT HOTEL,"Our stay was perfect. Clean rooms, great bar, elegant ambience and the friendliest staff you will find in London. Marina at the front desk and Roberto the doorman are two examples of the best service you will see in London. The location is excellent. We will come back to this hotel.",5,2018,06,06
123,Excellent location,"Hotel with a very good localtion, close to regent´s park and metro. Attention for the many good restaurants close to him. And also, provides a very good infrastructure. And the breakfast it´s worth value.",5,2018,06,03
123,Fantastic Hotel,We could not have been happier staying at this boutique Hotel. All of the staff were exceptionally friendly and always helpful. The accommodation was excellent especially the comfy bed. The location was amazing as it was in a quiet upmarket area yet very close to the busy part of London. Roberto was a very professional yet friendly doorman.,5,2018,06,03
123,Perfect,"Stylish, luxurious and comfortable with a great spa and pool. The bar and lobby lounges are gorgeous - the kind of place you want to spend all day reading a book - and the room was well appointed, quiet and large. The staff were very helpful, charming and discreet. The hotel backs on to Marylebone Lane so plenty of excellent restaurants within easy walking distance and oxford street is a short stroll south, but it feels just far enough away from the hubbub of the very centre of the city to be relaxing. I would definitely stay here again.",5,2018,06,03
123,"Oasis in central London, we’ll appointed, good staff","Started with warm welcome from Andrew the porter, guest services changed our room without ado to one on a lower floor that appealed to us more. Great location, lots of places to dine and shop nearby, close to public transit, and walk to all the sights. Quieter hood, but around the corner from as much life as you’d need. Wonderful stay, wont look elsewhere.",5,2018,06,02
123,Beautiful Venue,"Came to visit the events spaces and ended up staying for a drink and so pleased we did! Hannah who showed me around the event rooms new every detail, you can tell she loves what she is doing! Once we had finished she found us a table at the bar for a drink.  All the staff were smiley and very friendly.  Looking forward to our next visit!",5,2018,06,02
123,Fantastic host and help for corporate event,"This evening I held a corporate launch party in the library and courtyard. The space was so gorgeous - we had a lot of compliments from guests. The team at the hotel have been fantastic in supporting the event in the lead up, and the staff on the night excellent to make the evening run smoothly - thanks to Otto, Po, Kosta, Andrea and Karina!",5,2018,05,31
123,Company Summer Event,"We can with 94 people to this lovely place to have 1st in bar No 6 welcome drinks 🍷 and then in The Palm Room sit down dinner and party afterwards. I was a fantastic event. Big thank you to  Rohini for letting us book the place and organize the dinner with all the different meals/vegetarian/vegans and allergies to be thought of. The staff was absolutely 👌Everything went smoothly and the dinner was served impressive to all the right dinners . The DJ Kris played all our favorites, so the party was an absolute success. A big thank you to: Poppy, Rohini for organizing it. A big thank you to all the lovely helpful staff: Gergo, Eszther, Otto, Po, Victor and Kosta. We can only recommend The Marylebone for events like this. 👏👏👏👏👍👍👍👍👍❤️❤️❤️❤️",5,2018,05,31
123,"Tiny room, tiny uncomfortable bed","I booked a superior double room and it was so tiny that my husband and I could not get around the room at the same time. The bed was not even a queen size, incredibly tiny and uncomfortable that we kept waking up every time we turned and as a result, did not get a good night sleep. This type of room should have been a single not a double, let alone superior double.

The AC did not work well and the room kept getting hot. 

On a positive side, I liked that the room and bathroom were spotlessly clean, but given their size it's a potential injury hazard if you stay with someone else in the room due to severe space constrains, even in the superior double room.",2,2018,05,30
123,Fabulous venue & wonderful staff,"I recently organised a drinks reception at the Marylebone Hotel for a work function and it was the perfect venue. I have seen a lot of event spaces in London, particularly within hotels, and have to say this one is a new favourite. It is a beautiful setting and I feel the function spaces are really versatile to suit a range of different types of events, however it is the staff that really made it extra special. A lady called Hannah was running my event and she was fantastic - very friendly and approachable while remaining extremely professional and making sure everything was perfect. Her team also did an amazing job and nothing was too much for them. I would like to say a special thanks to Hannah, George, Po, Andrea and Victor to name a few - overall the event was a great success and I will definitely be recommending this hotel and hopefully coming back soon!",5,2018,05,30
123,Fabulous stay,Excellent customer service throughout.  Staying with 2 teenagers and the staff was more than accommodating throughout our stay.  Rooms were stylish and comfortable with all amenities ... including US outlets.  I would stay here again and again.  Food was tasty and the bar staff was great.,5,2018,05,29
123,Excellent customer care,"Visited with family to celebrate my mums up and coming wedding. Hannah sorted us with a beautiful room and some special touches that made the weekend extra special, thank you. George, Po, Andrea and Karina were also particularly lovely, making things go smoothly. Thank you. 
 The hotel is beautiful, the only improvement I would suggest is the air conditioning. It was not great.",4,2018,05,29
123,Excellent Business Conference,"I use to stay at the Bloomsbury hotel but I have moved my boookings to the Marylebone hotel due to the great new meeting rooms. I recently held our business conference in the new palm number six room. Everything ran like clockwork as I requested thanks to Hannah the manager and the team assisting her on the day Otto, Po, Andrea and Kosta! They were all so attentive and thanks to them made it the success it was. I like this hotel because the staff have personality and make events which should be boring actually quite fun!",5,2018,05,29
123,Best hotel for meetings,"I book all my small meetings for work at the Marylebone hotel. The newly refurbished event spaces are beautiful and perfect for what we need. There is always plenty of refreshments and the team Gemma, Otto, peter and Hannah are so friendly. I also like the click and share software they use for the tv screens. Keep up the good work guys!",5,2018,05,25
123,Apple ,"My first time in Londen for my Apple training and had a great stay in The Marylebone Hotel.

I really want to thank Marina (reception), Manon (reception) and Victor (waiter) for making my stay even better!",5,2018,05,24

123,An Incredible Hotel,This is my third time staying at The Marylebone. Brendan at the front desk looked after me and my friends as always. I dont normally write TripAdvisor reviews but this hotel just keeps getting better. The new cocktail bar is a great addition. Looking forward to my next trip to London.,5,2018,05,23

123,Amazing Events Space and Staff!,"Thank you to The Marylebone Hotel for hosting the SheerLuxe Wellness day - The space was perfect, food was great and the staff were extremely helpful during the planning and on the day - Thank you to Rohini, Hannah, Otto and team!",5,2018,05,21
123,Extremely Pleased,"I Visited the Marylebone Hotel for a work conference. I stayed 2 nights in a luxury suite, and had a great nights sleep. For me the best part is the events spaces, I have been to many event spaces all over the uk, and the team at the Marylebone are by far the best I have ever encountered! The manager Hannah was very well organised and was on the ball, she clearly had everything under control, Otter and Peter the waiters who looked after our room were attentive but by no way intrusive, I can’t wait to return for our next conference! ",5,2018,05,20
123,Great Hotel,"Allround great hotel, nice location in the heart of London. From the brilliant smiles at the Hotel reception (thank you Marina for your time and patience while checking in, you really made us feel welcome) to the great service in the restaurant/pantry. Would definitely recommend this hotel for business travellers/ people looking for a great hotel in the city centre.",5,2018,05,19
123,A hidden gem in the heart of London!,"This is the second time I have stayed in this hotel in two months, and I will be visiting again next month too. The rooms, facilities and amenities are truly world class, and the staff offer a memorable and highly personal service that frankly puts elite 5* hotels to shame. Whether you are couple looking for a romantic, trendy getaway, a wellness enthusiast who's all about gym and the good life, or a luxury seeker after the best in food, drink and leisure, the Marylebone really does have it all!   

I would like to give a special mention to Guest Relations manager, Manon, who during our most recent stay, went above and beyond to ensure that me and my partner had the best possible experience. The special touches she added to our stay had my partner beaming throughout. Manon made sure that the hotel forever remains our go to hotel in London! 

 Look forward to meeting you again next month!",5,2018,05,19
123,Excellent Family Stay,We stayed for 4 nights at the Marylebone with our 4 month old and 5 year old and had a wonderful time.  The hotel is in a fantastic location with top class facilities yet lovely and quiet too. But the best thing was the fantastic staff who really looked after us and made our stay memorable and super comfortable. Can't wait to go back!,5,2018,05,19
123,Perfect Location!,Walking distance to the tube and fabulous shopping on Oxford street.  Very quiet at night.  The workout facilities are top notch.  Staff is friendly and helpful.  We were able to get taxi's and Uber's quickly.,5,2018,05,18
123,Perfect for company meetings.,"We have recently held our company meeting at The Marylebone Hotel and our time here was exceeded by our high expectations. The space we were allocated was perfect for what we had planned and allowed for a extremely positive and well enjoyed day by all. The events manager Hannah, ensured our day went smoothly and provided all that we needed along with Otto who made us feel welcome and responded quickly and efficiently to our requests. I can assure we will return to The Marylebone Hotel for meetings in the future.",5,2018,05,18

123,Fabulous classy hen weekend with my daughters,"A huge thank you to Hannah, Lisa, Brendon, the housekeepers (2 ladies) on floor 7, the deputy restaurant manager at breakfast Sat, the 2 doormen (Fri and Sat nights) plus the young Chinese waitress sun morning. Why should I write a review? The care, customer service, politeness and professionism shown by the above staff was without doubt excellent. My daughters surprised me with a 5* city break and I was not disappointed. The room was fabulous, comfortable, extremely clean and oh so quiet. The breakfasts were delicious, properly cooked and presented. The hotel smart and welcoming. The staff were very very helpful, friendly, smiley and on the ball. We most definitely would like to come back to enjoy your hospitality once again. A big 5* from myself and my wonderful daughters.  Thank you.",5,2018,05,17
123,Fantastic corporate drinks reception,"We chose the Courtyard area within the hotel to host a corporate drinks reception for clients. It was a fantastic space which suited the informal nature of the occasion. In such a great location, it was great for guests arriving from throughout the country. 

In the lead up Gemma couldn't be more accommodating, ensuring everything we requested was executed superbly. The afternoon tea canapes were just right to accompany mid afternoon drinks. Our guests were looked after so well, we will definitely return for future hosting and events.",5,2018,05,16
123,Corporate Training Event,"Fabulous experience working with this hotel.

Staff were attentive and accommodating every step of the way. The space is absolutely gorgeous, with many different spaces to choose from depending on your needs. Already planning our next event here.",5,2018,05,15
123,80th Birthday Party,"A big family gathering  most of us staying in this hotel , such fantastic staff helpful in everyway , doorman at frontdoor gave my granson this beautiful teddy from hotel reception , Thank You for making our stay PERFECT ",5,2018,05,12
123,One of the best,"We are lucky to have stayed in some great hotels and this was one of our best experiences. The hotel is beautifully appointed inside with a modern and boutique feel and the rooms are immaculate.

From start to finish Brendan and his team did a great job looking after us and make sure we had everything we needed with lovely touches like complimentary chocolates in the room.  Marylebone is well located near Hyde Park and Oxford Street and its a also very chic neighbourhood with great shopping and restaurants. 

Thank you for wonderful stay!",5,2018,05,12
123,Highly recommended ,"Just returned from a two night stay here, really lovely hotel with great staff and service. Room was well appointed and comfortable, no complaints there. Public rooms are nice and reception is efficient. Gym and Spa looked good although I did not use them. Good location too.",5,2018,05,11
123,Honesty and great service ,"Stay regularly and love  all aspects of this hotel however this week they excelled, long story short left an expensive piece of jewellery in the room and didn’t realise for a week... when we called to ask, big shout out to Lucas at the front desk who dealt with our query so efficiently and quickly... and massive thank you to the fantastic house keeping who had found it and kept it somewhere safe",5,2018,05,11
123,Just can't recommend too highly. Melted away the stress!,"Following a long and somewhat painful board meeting I had to stay the night and following morning in London before catching a flight with my husband. We were very tired but were welcomed by courteous hotel staff and shown to our spacious and comfortable room. 

The bed was good and I had a great nights sleep. We got to try the pool and the sauna as well the morning which helped relax these old bones of mine even further before dashing off to the airport. I would recommend The Marylebone to anyone wishing to stay in London.",5,2018,05,11
123,Simply excellent,"What can you say about the Marylebone, beautiful hotel in a brilliant location just behind Oxford St and on the edge of Marylebone village, excellent bar areas including opportunity to sit and watch the world go by from the pavement, friendly professional staff. Only issue for some maybe the bedrooms are small but then again you don't go to London to sit in your bedroom. It's certainly our hotel of preference in London",5,2018,05,11
123,Can't wait for my next visit,"I have been visiting the Marylebone, monthly, for over 2 years now and I have always been treated as if I was the only guest in the hotel.  Every member of staff cannot help enough, from Rama on the door, who greets me with a huge smile  to Brendan who always makes sure my favourite room is available whenever I come to town.  The rooms are wonderful and clean, light and spacious and the beds offer a great night’s sleep(sometimes too comfy, especially when I have had a few too many G&T’s in the fabulous bar downstairs).  The breakfast is tasty and plentiful with staff who cater to my every whim.   In recent months they have renovated part of the downstairs lobby to create an amazing new bar and chill out space which I now take full advantage of whilst my Son is enjoying one of the best gyms in any London hotel.

 

I have stayed in many hotels in London, and across Europe, over the years and I can honestly say that The Marylebone offers one of the warmest and relaxing experiences, with some of the most wonderful members of staff I have met.  I cannot thank them all enough, for making this last couple of years so comfortable and enjoyable.

 

Can’t wait for my next visit!!",5,2018,05,10
123,Really lovely hotel with an air of all round quality,Superb hotel with very good clean  rooms and quality bedding . Quality breakfast with great choice. Location is just great with the busy streets of London on your doorstep but you wouldn’t know as the hotel is lovely and quiet. Could recommend more !,5,2018,05,08
123,Good hotel ,"I was there for business for 2 nights. Everything was fine, nothing to complain. Friendly staff at reception, everything was clean and in good shape. Rooms are serviced frequently. Bathroom was very clean but quite small. Unfortunately I didn’t have time to try gym and pool.",4,2018,05,08
123,Excellent visit to very comfortable HOTEL,"spent 2 lovely weeks at the quality hotel.  Excellent location, service, lounge and restaurant.  When in London highly recommend for dodging.  Near quality shopping and up beat restaurants and PUBS.  Staff were very helpful and courteous.    ",5,2018,05,06
123,"Great location, great hotel",The Marylebone is an excellent hotel. It is located in a neighborhood that centrally located and perfect for walking. It also has an air of quiet competence to it that my wife and I very much appreciated.,5,2018,05,05
123,Love this hotel!!!,Another great stay at The Marylebone. We have stayed here several times a year for many years and it is always a joy. The staff are always wonderful and so helpful and go out of their way to make your stay perfect. There is always a great atmosphere in the bar and it is a great place for pre dinner drinks. The location is perfect for shopping in Oxford Street and there are lots of fabulous restaurants nearby. Altogether a fabulous stay.,5,2018,05,03
123,Good place for your London stay,"Location: located in a place well known for restaurants and close to Bond Street.

Accessibility: the nearest subway is a good 5-10mjn walk. 

Tourist spots nearby: Madam Tussaud’s, Bond Street 

Eateries: has a good restaurant. Good spots nearby as well.

Room: not much of a view. Tight (as can be expected in London) but comfy.

Would recommend.",4,2018,05,02
123,"Beautiful public areas, great location and helpful friendly staff","Our almost week long stay in the hotel was very enjoyable. The eclectic style of the hotel's newly renovated public areas are beautiful. The room and bathroom while smaller than we had expected were also very nicely designed.  To our delight it was serviced twice a day. The only problem with the room was that the view was an office building, so we did not open the curtains. The staff at reception were extremely friendly and helpful finding us the right bus routes for various trips and booking us on a bus to the airport.  The location is excellent being within minutes of Oxford Street and the lovely Marylebone High Street. We will stay again when in London. suerosen",4,2018,05,01
123,Great hotel in cuts neighborhood,"This was my third or fourth stay at Marylebone.  I love it’s location. Cute neighborhood with great interesting shops.  Close to Regent Park which is beautiful and great for runs.  I arrived on early flight so room wasn’t ready right away. Was told bags would be placed in room when it was ready.  When I got to room bags weren’t there and could get no one to pick up at reception. all I wanted to do was nap but Had to go downstairs.  Issue was addressed immediately. That’s my only complaint.  After that had a great stay.  Love the turndown service.  Room was well cleaned. Concierge Michael was very helpful with arranging day trip and
Theater tickets. Breakfast was great very day (though I was almost charged for breakfast even though was in rate-always
Check your bill ).   And I love the third yard (the gym).   A pleasant surprise was the complimentary organized walking tour on Friday morning.  Was great to learn about some neighborhood history. While Marylebone may be a little pricier than other options I do thinks it’s money well spent.  Already looking forward to when I can come back. 
",4,2018,04,30
123,"Good hotel, curious lobby bar","Most recent stay April 2018.  The room during this stay at the Marylebone was good and more spacious than some previous rooms.  Cleanliness was good, as always.  The A/C was a little dubious, but there was a major heatwave in London at the time so perhaps they deserve a pass on that.  The cursed duvet being the only bed covering was quickly remedied upon request - I do wish hotels would drop this tedious trend of furnishing only duvets.  

On the downside was a visit paid to the newly installed lobby bar.  The idea is good and it looks attractive, but the staff culture is positively toxic.  They get on well with each other, seemingly, but cannot conceal their disdain for the customers.  One quick drink was more than enough and nearly sank the overall score here.",4,2018,04,27
123,Great hotel,"A great hotel that I could not fault in any way. 
Staff are really friendly and can't do enough for you. 
We had our room upgraded at a discount as it was my birthday. We had a studio room on 6th floor that was lovely and spacious. The room was clean and the bed was so comfortable. Lovely bathroom with aromatherapy shower gel, shampoo etc. Free bathrobes and slippers are provided too.
There is free use of the pool which was empty on Sunday morning. They also have a free gym. There is a spa there too which you have to pay for but very reasonably priced.  Never seen changing rooms like this hotel anywhere else!! It has hairdryers, hair straighteners,  toothbrushes and toothpaste and lovely showers. 
Plenty of places to have a drink in the hotel or bite to eat they also have a ground floor bar with balcony and if the weather is nice they open up the windows so it's all open.
Plenty of bars, shops and restaurants within Marylebone village so plenty to do day and night.
I will definitely be returning for another stay at this lovely hotel",5,2018,04,23
123,Little to criticise here. ,"Little to criticise here.Room,cleanliness, location,food,ambience,gym, staff,all excellent.
Not inexpensive, but on balance ,considering the location,fair value for money. If you are staying in this area of London , and it's in your budget range , I could certainly recommend it. ",5,2018,04,23
123,Great Hotel and Location,"Excellent location, cute boutique hotel.  Bar/club was really loud a couple of nights and it went on until well past the time it was supposed to close. The hotel was very comfortable and has lots of charm. WIll stay again!",5,2018,04,22
123,Everything was just perfect! ,"My husband surprised me for my birthday by booking a weekend away to stay at the Marylebone and seeing a theatre show.

The hotel was really easy access to find from Bond Street station. Not even a 5 minute walk and very safe area to walk. We got there a little early for check-in but the front desk staff were happy to get us checked in and take our bags for us to go look around.

By 2pm we went back and picked our keys cards up to surprisingly be told we had received a upgrade to a suite as it was a special occasion. What a lovely surprise and it was just perfect. 

The room was stunning, the bed was comfortable and the room had lovely high ceilings. Everything had beautiful attention to detail. We will be recommending to all our family and friends. Can’t wait to return again when we are back in town.  

",5,2018,04,22
123,"Excellent, well run hotel in an excellent location.","I have stayed here for both business and pleasure and have found it be extremely comfortable, well designed and personal. The hotel is in proximity to lots of great restaurants and bars, as well as shops, but the food and drink at the hotel is equally good. Hotel staff are very friendly and competent, especially Roberto on the front door.",5,2018,04,21
123,Recovery from operation ,"We spent two nights at the Marylebone after I underwent cosmetic surgery.  I didn’t like the first room we were offered, as it was a bit dark and depressing to recover in I felt.  I rang reception and very quickly someone appeared to take us to choose between two other rooms.  Which were both totally lovely.   After the operation we had buckets of ice sent up to the room all night long (literally all night) which wasn’t any problem for them at all.  All the staff were really extremely welcoming and I’d heartily recommend staying there.  We enjoyed our stay there equally as much as our previous favourite, Claridges.  x",5,2018,04,21
123,Superb,"We stayed at this wonderful hotel last weekend for my wife’s 40th birthday. We walked from St Pancras station rather than get a cab due to the fantastic weather we had that day.
The door staff were welcoming and offered to take our bags. The reception was quite busy with people checking in and there was a short wait to be seen but the front of house staff we quick and efficient at dealing with the queue.
Our room wasn’t quite ready when we arrived so we were offered another to stay in whilst it was prepared. This wasn’t a problem for us and we went to rest for a while. Within 15 minutes of getting to the room we got a call to say our room was ready now and that someone would be along to show us to it.
Our room was wonderful. A nice large bedroom, a very comfortable bed and great air conditioning on this very hot day. The staff had been great and left us a chilled bottle of prosecco and some mini desserts for my wife’s birthday.
The bathroom was very compact but still had everything you needed. The only faults (and these are very minor) were the plug in the sink got stuck and therefore would not empty. I informed the reception about this and it was fixed while we were out for the evening. The only other thing was a design issue in the bathroom, the toilet flush was hidden behind the seat when it was raised.
We had drinks in the bar prior to heading out for dinner, the staff here were also very attentive and friendly. The staff ensured our glasses were always topped up from the chilled bottle of champagne beside our table.
I would definitely recommend this hotel to my friends and family. I’d also be very happy to stay here again if I overnight in London.",5,2018,04,21
123,"Incredible room, great service, great location","My husband and I stayed at the Marylebone hotel for one night at the end of March 2018 to celebrate a special wedding anniversary.   Marylebone is a brilliant central London area to visit - close to Regent's Park and a real boutique shopping heaven, packed with an excellent range of quality restaurants and cafes.  We booked one of the suites in the hotel as a treat, but were bowled over to be generously upgraded to the amazing Terrace Suite by the hotel manager and given a complimentary bottle of champagne too - so really kind of her.  The Terrace Suite is like an apartment in itself, complete with a huge covered side terrace, boasting its own cosy fire and TV and offering a magical late night Mary Poppins view across London.   The main sitting-room, with its own kitchen and another roaring fire and TV, is beautifully furnished in a warm, modern style and very spacious.   We used the large, well-equipped hotel gym and the quiet swimming pool downstairs in the morning and would definitely recommend availing of both.  Our dinner in 108 Brasserie was excellent and our waitress and the host were genuinely friendly, thoughtful and efficient.   In fact, all staff from Reception to Room Service to Restaurant were absolutely faultless.  All in all, a fantastic way to celebrate our anniversary.   Thank you so much to the hotel management for a wonderful memory!",5,2018,04,18
123,Romantic weekend break,Just returned from a relaxing weekend break at The Marylebone. A big thank you to the whole team for making our stay a memorable experience. We visit London on average twice a year and for the last 5 visits we have made The Marylebone our home.Great location with everything close to hand yet just far away from the hustle and bustle of Oxford street. Did not visit the 108 Bar on this occasion as I found the new bar near the reception. Especially on a Friday and Saturday night you find it a lot quieter and service is much quicker. We are now looking forward to our return visited at the back end of the year. Thanks again Marylebone Team.,5,2018,04,16
123,Great location but poor attitudes and inflated egos from front of house staff make for a miserable stay,"Having stayed in numerous similar and higher star-rated hotels, I was extremely disappointed in The Marylebone. Maybe it’s just how London is these days, who knows. Front of house staff are anything but welcoming and treat clients as if they are beneath them. I found the whole thing both annoying and humorous at the same time since, they seem to think they are better than the customer who is paying handsomely to stay in the hotel!  Maybe someone who runs a better customer focused hotel could teach them that you should never judge a book by its cover or by its accent! If I treat everyone with manners, I expect the same in return. The room wasn’t ready even at check in time, the TV didn’t work, breakfast was excellent on day one and, at best, jaded on day two. Location is excellent but that would be my only reason to return. ",3,2018,04,16
123,A haven ,"Finding somewhere quiet, comfortable and friendly for an hour to catch up on emails etc can be a challenge in London. Without access to swanky clubs, a hurried coffee in a cafe is the norm. 
Not any more. Called in here for a cuppa and a croissant. Place was really comfortable with good WiFi and plenty of power outlets. Tea was lovely and joined by a beautiful crunchy-on-the-outside, soft-in-the-middle croissant. 
Staff were the friendliest I’ve seen in London - the waiter even sang while he delivered the tea! 
Only tea and a pastry this time but it’s encouraged me to book my next overnight stay in London here. Just shows that a little bit of good old customer service goes a long way! ",4,2018,04,16
123,"A WARM WELCOME BY Mr ZAN JOVIC, the receptionnist.","All the way through...A perfect welcome, handsome young and so well educated staff. Up to date, cool, and relaxed. EXTREMELY  PROFESSIONAL.
The Hotel +++++ apart may be from the sizes of the room a bit small though charming and well decorated. Only 5 minutes walk from Oxford Street...So central and located in a chic bobo area. 
Same rating +++++ for the bar, the breakfast room and the elegant brasserie. 
Same rating +++++ for the cleaning ladies. 

THANKS AGAIN TO Mr. ZAN JOVIC at the reception desk. A great help for my Wifi problems (LOL!) and changing room at once and a delightful gentleman. xoxoxoxoxo

All in all, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED

123,Love this hotel.,"Stay here often and can highly recommend.  The decor is gorgeous and very stylish.  There is a choice of trendy bars within the hotel as well as seating areas to relax.  The restaurant is spacious and comfortable and the food amazing.  The rooms are modern and extremely well maintained.  Finally, the staff are what make this place special.  From the moment you arrive being greeted at the door right through to everyone you will meet on your stay.  They all make you feel welcome and nothing is too much trouble, thank you.  I especially like to mention Brendan and say thank you to you for always looking after us so well we really appreciate it. Great hotel and great location!",5,2018,04,10
123,So many cosy rooms,Our Rotary club met and enjoyed a pleasant side room which was quiet and convenient. The staff arranged the table into a long line with chairs and carafes of water and glasses. Afterwards we lunched and I had a chicken salad and then a desert.,4,2018,04,09
123,Comfortable and a nice place,"Brilliant location, Public places around the hotel were really nice and always well decorated. Really nice lobby bar with an amazing cocktails. Definitely a great place for the Afternoon Tea I will definitely visit again.",5,2018,04,09
123,"Comfortable, friendly and good value","Spent two nights here with a group of colleagues and had a lovely time. Great Marylebone location; close to lots, yet quiet and comfortable. Rooms were very well appointed and very comfortable. Not huge, but comfortable. Great bed, huge soft and thick towels, lots of outlets, and very clean. The public spaces at the hotel were really nice, especially the bar which is beautiful.  Two small items to note. I bought mine as well as my seven colleagues rooms via Expedia and they were all paid in advance. Despite paying in advance, the bill under my door, and everyone else too showed full payment due. I straightened it out, but it was disconcerting. Also the morning I was to check out (before I had done so) twice maids came into my room without so much as a knock. Not good.",4,2018,04,08
123,Mick Jones,"Great Stay as always, Brendan and Jack and the rest of the front desk staff amazing as always, Great barman in the lobby bar Charlie amazing cocktail maker. Excellent gym and Resturant, hotel is situated in a brilliant location to explore london and the surrounding area.",4,2018,04,05
123,Such a nice place! ,"The Hotel is beautiful , the room very spacious and the staff is very pro and kind with kids.
The bar is really well decorated an

Special thank you to Andrei who play with our little Lucie ( 4 years old) when we waited to check in.

123,Amazing Customer Service & Accommodating Staff,"Arrived for a friends birthday with a pre booked room and were welcomed by friendly and professional front of house. Due to unforeseen circumstances we needed to add an extra person to the room with disabled needs. This was dealt with so efficiently and with such l kindness, with Brendan being particularly helpful and understanding. The room was beyond expectation for the birthday guest. Exceeded all expectations and will return again soon! Thank you ",5,2018,03,31
123,Couldn’t have wished for a better experience!,"My five year old daughter and I stayed here for two nights as a treat, and what a treat it was! We were warmly greeted by Brennan at reception who checked us in and offered to help with anything we needed during our stay. The room was lovely and comfortable with gorgeous toiletries from Aromatherapy Associates and all the amenities you might need, including a mini bar. 

The hotel was lovely and quiet and we had a very peaceful nights’ sleep both nights. We had breakfast in the 108 Brasserie on the first morning which was absolutely delicious, with a range of choices from traditional Irish breakfast to continental selections. Again, the staff could not have been friendlier or more helpful. On the second day we had breakfast in our room - arrived bang on time, hot and again delicious and exactly what we asked for. 

We used the pool on both days too - there are restricted hours for children which is more than fair and the pool and changing rooms were really clean and luxurious, with Cowshed toiletries, plenty of clean, fluffy towels and fantastic shower and beauty facilities. 

The hotel feels modern and sleek but the atmosphere is one of friendliness and warmth and was perfect for us. Literally every single member of staff we encountered - the doormen, housekeeping staff, waiters, receptionists and concierge - was friendly, cheerful and genuinely made you feel welcome. 

As it was Easter weekend, my daughter was made a special fuss of by everyone and was given a teddy bear, Peter Rabbit toy and book and a bag of Easter Eggs by the staff. She was delighted! Each gesture was really thoughtful and kind. 

I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend this hotel for any type of stay. It’s less than 5 minutes walk from Oxford Street and the roads surrounding the hotel are full of wonderful lanes and shops to wander around. It’s a perfect base to explore London and see the sights or to retreat and have a relaxing weekend (there’s a gorgeous spa too). My little girl and I have come away on cloud nine from our experience and are already looking forward to a return visit! My sincere thanks to everyone we encountered on our stay who made it so very special. ",5,2018,03,31
123,Hoping For Relaxation But Disappointed ,"This hotel is the least relaxing place I’ve ever stayed. I requested a quiet room three different ways (first online, then over the telephone with Adriana, and in person at check-in). 

I was allocated a room directly across the street from from an active construction site and next door to a hotel room undergoing repairs. During my stay, the manager offered to change my room, but I was staying here for medical treatment and was not feeling well enough. 

In general the room needs maintenance attention: the toilet did not consistently flush properly; the telephone only worked intermittently; the bath didn’t drain properly. There were scuff marks, dents and chips throughout the room. See photos. The climate control is noisy and clunky. 

On the plus side: the room is clean and the location is excellent. The room service from 108 is fantastic - the meal was beautifully presented and delicious.

At this price point, you can find much more interesting, better maintained hotels. 

I was allowed to leave early with no penalty and a discount was applied to my one night, since everyone was in agreement that there were several problems in the course of my stay in regards to both the plumbing and the noise. ",2,2018,03,31
123,Still very comfortable. Been here before and will return again!,"Very comfortable room, nice bathroom, very nice and helpful staff. We've stayed here before and will stay again. Our room was bright, quiet and nice. We'd recommend it for sure! Would be nice if they had newspapers, but no real complaints.",5,2018,03,27
123,Enjoyed every minute,"The Marylebone is a friendly but professional hotel with very nice staff. I was staying with my friend who visits London once a year and this was our first time in The Marylebone, but probably not the last.
The room was very spacious and the bed was really comfortable. We got to try the pool and the sauna as well on our 2nd day after shopping on Oxford Street.
All in all, our stay was great and the location is amazing. I would definitely recommend if you are looking for a getaway in the city.",5,2018,03,27
123,"TO LONDON, FROM LOS ANGELES","I absolutely loved my stay at this hotel. The staff went above and beyond kindness and helpfulness and truly gave me a memorable experience. 

I was staying here for a work trip from Los Angeles and was extremely jetlagged. I had a massive headache by the time I checked in. I was able to get some rest since it was so quiet. I woke up in the evening and ate an amazing dinner (Pachamama- Peruvian Tapas) that was suggested by the front desk. 

When I needed extra toothpaste, a charger, late night tea-anything really, my needs were quickly met by the staff with a smile on their face. It was just lovely. 

The location is remarkable, It's very WeHo. Lots of boutique shops and amazing restaurants. The area is extremely walkable. 

I can't wait to come back here. So so thankful I chose this hotel off of a colleague's suggestion. 

Thank you to the staff!",5,2018,03,25
123,A home away from home,"I have had very fond memories of this hotel from an early age having experienced the hotel throughout all it’s changes, and it still remains my number one hotel in London.

The location is ideal, merely a short 4 minute from Bond Street Station.

What the hotel has is character. On any given evening you can enjoy a quiet drink in the relaxed atmosphere of the lounge bar, or if you walk further down to the back of the hotel you’ll be met with another bar which is a total contrast! Far more livelier, loud music and young socialites knocking back prosecco into the night! 

The staff are great. Incredibly accommodating and friendly. Jack and Daniel at reception are brilliant to deal with. They really do pull out all the stops! When I arrived to my room last week, I was greeted with a bottle of prosecco and chocolate dipped strawberries. An amazing surprise which really lifted my mood after a long day of travelling!

The breakfast is fab. Highly recommend the smashed avocado with chilli flakes on toasted sourdough. I’d also recommend having ‘Cream Tea’ at some stage in the Pantry. It’s served on a miniature “garden” which has a sachet of seeds for you to take home with you - very quirky and charming. It’s also accompanied by their own rhubarb jam. A waitress was kind enough to ask my mum if she’d like a jar of this to take back to Dublin! 

All in all it’s a fab hotel, class location, fantastic staff, and the foods exceptional. Will happily continue to return to this magical home away from home!

123,The perfect hotel for a London Holiday,"This hotel is in a great location, close to the subway, major shopping locations but in a fab village environment.  It was an easy cab ride from both St Pancras and Paddington.

My room was well appointed and the bathroom was luxurious.  Everything has a sense of style, but functionality was not forgotten!  Nice big desk, super comfy but stylish chairs, great bedding and amenities

BUT the real reason to stay here is the service.  Check in was efficient but incredibly welcoming, the concierge was brilliantly up to date and helped me with events/locations etc that were just what I was looking for.  The doorman was friendly and helpful and the housekeeping was terrific.  Even the turndown service was perfect - water chocolates and actual turndown!

I can't recommend it enough",5,2018,03,24
123,STAFF ATTITUDE ,"Unfortunately my partner left the room key card next to her Mobil phone so she went to the front desk where the blond person behind the counter gave her a lecture in not placing key next to a phone then told her she has waisted 10 minuets of her time and mine . ABSOLUTELY SHOCKING 
No manners no training will help her ",2,2018,03,24
123,Second stay in hotel,"Stayed overnight for the second time in the hotel for my birthday as loved our stay last year and found all the staff to be wonderful.  The hotel has a lovely feel to it from the minute you arrive and loved the new bar and lounge area and can't wait to return in the summer and sit outside.  Bedrooms are very comfortable and nice size bathroom.   Appreciated having the coffee machine and kettle in the room for when we returned from the theatre.   Staff all look very smart.
The position is fantastic and we were able to walk everywhere which was great.  Took 15 minutes to walk to the Marble Arch theatre in the evening, a few minutes to The Wallace Collection, Selfridges and M & S.  Loads of coffee shops, bars, restaurants and easy to walk to Bond Street Station or Baker Street Station.   Loved walking around Marylebone High Street as well which is literally round the corner.  Had a delicious breakfast, again with wonderful service.",5,2018,03,22
123,A little dissapointed,"My husband and I stayed here for our birthdays for 3 nights last week and were so looking forward to our trip away.
When we arrived I think we were both impressed by the overall look and feel of the hotel and the doormen were so friendly.

The disappointment was our room, the room and bathroom were so so tiny that I would only recommend 1 person staying in there. We were also placed next to the staff lifts so it was constantly noisy with glasses being thrown and doors banging. 
I also emailed the hotel prior to our arrival to see if there was anything else I could add to our room as we were celebrating our birthdays just a day apart. They said they would note this down, unfortunately, nothing was mentioned at check in or throughout our stay, so I felt a little let down by this.
Also, when checking in they said breakfast wasn't included but we had paid for so I got them to check this. No apology and it seemed like a bit of an inconvenience to them.

The bed we had was very small, my husband is 6ft 3 and i'm 5 ft 9, both of our feet were hanging over the end of the bed. 

Breakfast was good though and the staff seemed friendly.",3,2018,03,22
123,Lonfg weekend in London,"Rocky start with a booking problem (casued by booking.com). The Marylebone reception was very accomodating and sorted it out swiftly at no cost which we highly appreciated. The stay was very comfortable with nice high quality rooms, excellent breakfast and lunch and a great bar area with a cozy fire place. The hotel gets regularly updated and can be highly recommended! Excellent location for shopping around Oxford street (4min walk from the hotel) and strolling around Marylebone high street with lots of small individual shops. Fantastic experience and we will be back!",5,2018,03,19
123,Another comfortable stay,"We stayed for one night with breakfast, which we always have in the room. It's always very well presented and well cooked. The rooms can be quite small, but for one night it's not a problem. Some bathrooms are very tiny, which is our only real criticism of the accommodation. The hotel is in a wonderful position for the shops and dozens of good cafes and restaurants. The staff in the bars and restaurants do not seem to be quite as friendly and efficient as previously, but the reception/concierge and doormen are on the ball. They no longer stock dry sherry in the bar, which is my preferred tipple, and I find this unacceptable for a good hotel.",4,2018,03,13
123,Even in the crazy snow...we loved it.,"We arrived off our overseas flight -- (the week London got snow) & were pleasantly surprised we could check in early.The hotel is in a great area. Close to Oxford St shopping, tube stations, with little boutiques, pubs & restaurants nearby. The day we arrived the hotel experienced some electrical issues which ended up having us move our room a couple times, but the staff were very accommodating, sent us champagne and upgraded us to a nicer room on the same floor (7th). Luckily this small inconvenience did not interfere with our daily plans. We did not do the breakfast, however we enjoyed the coziness of the bar area and had a pre-theater meal in the restaurant. I would definitely stay here again. I loved the warm charm, yet sophisticated feel it offered, and liked coming back to it after a full day of bopping around the city. 
.",5,2018,03,12
123,"Great hotel as such, but very snobby waiters","Great location, facilties, rooms and the attached gym access worked also really good. Only thing that keeps me from giving the hotel a 5 star rating was the unbelievable snobby waiter in the breakfast restaurant. First day I thought he just had a bad day but it was the same the day after. The rest of the staff seemed fine, but this guy who was respoinsible for my table - don't know how to explain besides if you ever had a prejudice about a snobby Englishman - he would be your star example. 

So overall great hotel - but the very annoying snobby waiter (two days in a row) was ruining the last star",4,2018,03,12
123,Second Visit ,This was my second visit to The Marylebone. Initial room a little different from my previous stay but was soon sorted by Lucas at reception. Very comfortable studio suite and a healthy but tasty breakfast in the morning served by Ali completed a pleasant stay.,4,2018,03,12
123,Central and friendly,"This hotel has a great location and many facilities. The staff is friendly and make you feel well taken care of. Many places to eat and services nearby. Quiet rooms, albeit they could be larger. Generally an attractive place well maintained.",4,2018,03,11
123,Fantastic hotel,"We had booked through TABLET PLUS and with it being my 50th birthday I was very lucky to get an upgrade to a stunning room so a huge thank you to the hotel. They were very welcoming, especially as it was during the big snowfall and so I was very pleased to have made it. Our room was beautiful and very comfy bed, gorgeous bedlinen. With Tablet we also had a gift of a bottle of Prosecco and fruit/cake. For central London I think this is a lovely hotel and great value.",5,2018,03,10
123,"Just a one night stay, but it was clean.","I wasn't well and spent the night in.  

Plus:  very clean, nice sheets, good room service.

Negatives (which are not huge):  poor selection of stations (I was sick!), and the button to call for room service didn't work.  However, the front desk always put me through to room service quickly and kindly.

The room was sufficient - not big, but fine.  The bathroom was quite small, but clean and absolutely fine.",4,2018,03,07
123,Morning Coffee,"Consistently outstanding service from friendly, attentive and professional bar staff - an asset to the hotel. Newly refurbished multi zone bar/lounge area. A great venue for a morning coffee in Marylebone. ",5,2018,03,07
123,Lovely hotel but tiny rooms,"This is a great smaller hotel, in a great location in London. The bar area is beautiful and intimate. Our bedroom was small though and it was a struggle to move in the bathroom! We were disappointed also to find out that the spa was closed during our visit and yet this was one of the reasons we’d booked to stay here.",4,2018,03,05
123,Wedding night ! ,"We went to this hotel on our mini honeymoon to London.

Location: ideally located with a lot of restaurants, bars and cafés in the area

Staff: very friendly and helpful.

Room: due to it being our wedding night the hotel upgraded us, and surprised us with Champaign and desert in the room, which was lovely.

We had an amazing time and will definitely stay there again for anniversary ! ",5,2018,03,04
123,Very Enjoyable!!,"I am just back from London having stayed in this hotel. We arrived on Tuesday the 27th of March. From the moment we arrived we felt very welcome. It's hard to mention any specific names as they do not wear name badges in this hotel. This is something that could be looked at. I can only describe the people that stood out for me. Two members of concierge stood out as they were very welcoming and made conversation as we waited to check in. One of these males was wearing a black 3 piece suit and had a beard. The other guy was a young foreign guy who was wearing a gold coloured waistcoat. He appeared to be very hard working and professional as he was constantly on the go anytime I passed reception.

As there was an issue with the heating we were asked to move to one of the sister hotels, the Kensington. This was arranged by Louise who was extremely apologetic and paid for the taxi fare. The hotel is located very close to Oxford street so would be ideal for anyone who is going to spend some time browsing in the nearby shops. It's hard to comment on the hotel itself as I feel we were unfortunate with the timing of our visit. I don't believe we got to experience this hotel in all its glory. Will definitely be back during the summer months as we were offered a complimentary nights stay because of the heating issues.

The Kensington hotel is a little bit out of the way from all the hustle and bustle of London but is about a 2 minute walk from the nearest tube station. The tube takes about 5 minutes to get into the main areas such as Leicester Square. For anyone who plans on taking the tube buy an oyster card or use your phone/contactless card to access the tube. You will save a fortune. If you buy tickets you will spend approx 4 pound more!!!

The Kensington is well worth it's 5 stars. It's absolute luxury. I thoroughly enjoyed sitting in the lobby area by the fire on the cold evenings. The food menu is the same in both hotels. I feel it lacks something  and I would like to see a little bit more variety. Would have encouraged me to eat more within the hotels. 

Breakfast was my favourite part of the day. Very relaxing and a very good menu. Thomas welcomes you in the morning and again he is very friendly. Very well spoken and completely fits the surroundings of the hotel. Eric served us breakfast both mornings. Again he came across as very professional. Nothing was too difficult or awkward for him. Also George on concierge was very friendly. Stopped to check if everything was ok and to provide information/advice on where to go and how to get there. Always seemed very positive and full of energy.",5,2018,03,04
123,Great hotel and restaurant!,We stayed at the Marylebone while visiting London with the family. Great hotel and restaurant. Breakfast and sinner were great. Bar staff were so friendly!,5,2018,03,03
123,Beautiful hotel close to Oxford Circus,The hotel is located very well for shoppers. We stayed as we wanted to spend a weekend shopping. The hotel is very modern and clean. Decorated with lovely taste. We loved the paintings on the walls which was actually and exhibition and one can buy it. The check in went very fast. Stuff is so kind. They allocated a room which was was quite at rooftop as we mentoned we dont like noisy rooms. We had a view of the London rooftops. The restaurant is very charming. Has a great selection of dishes. We tried seafood and loved it! We would always go back!,5,2018,02,28
123,BACK TO THE MARYLEBONE,"After 3 nights at the Langham (5 star hotel) and 2 night at one of the Village hotels (4 star) we wanted to close our stay in London with an additional 2 nights.
As I am a travel agent for the past 19 years I had notions of differnt reasonable 3 star hotels in the Russel Square area and budget conscious was seriously tinking in that direction.
but fortunately due to the insistence of my wife and children we decided to go back to the Marylebonne.
We where there for 7 nights 4 year earlier also in Januarry and then we got upgrade to a deluxe room that made a wonderfool stay of wich I wrote about in Trip Advaisor.
By the way i reccolect that trip advaisor then helped me to decide for the Marylebone.
As this time we where there only 2 nights I realized that I can not hope for an upgrade and as I myself in the eyghties for 5 years put up and run a beds and brekfast establishment in my KIBBUTZ (Alumot, from wich you can have a fantastic wiew of the Kinneret Lake - theSea of Galilee) I was not surprised or aggravated by what I found.
The standars room I was allocated was in front of the lift (always a bad spot) and I liked the way NicolaBK describe it in his rewiew on Trip Advaisor as the room is really small, but also this is undersandable in the hearth of a mayor capital in Europe.
What I did not expected was that after my wife had her night bath I could not use the bath as it was impossible with the tools we had in the room (a teaspoon) to open the plug in the bath so we had to call maintenance and it was clear that we where not suppose to take care of this every time with a scrudriver.
So Ii made it clear to the guy of maintenece that we hope to a changhe of room but will spend this night in the allocated room.
Just to be on the safe side I went to speack to the Manager on duty and he was very comprensive and promise to see what he can do.
The day after ,after a wonderfool breakfast (as usual at the Marylebone) while going back to room to get fix for the day out we where informed by the reception desk that a new room has been allocated to us and if we agree we could do the swap immediatly with the help of the hotel team.
And so it was that for our surprise and delight we where given a deluxe room
defenitly bigger than the standard and far from the lift.
So I went and thaked the Manager on duty (by chance the same one) and complitly regained my trust in the level of hospitality, profesionalism and service  of the Marylebone team.
So again thank you all and when we will be back in London it will be again the Marylebone (our budget allowing).",5,2018,02,27
123,Excellent service,"This is the second time my partner and I have stayed at The Marylebone and I think the level of customer care is excellent. In particular Zan, Donald and Rocio looked after us very well. We'll definitely be back and I can recommend it not only for its good service and well appointed interiors but it's location is excellent for shopping trip.",5,2018,02,25
123,Crazy small,"After a one night stay the pro’s:
Gorgeous location
Fantastic bar
Early check at 1200
Free drink each 

Cons
Ridiculously small room (superior double room 550)
Sewer smell in bathroom
Noise from outside I am guessing was air conditioning units
Billed for above said free drink, though it was sorted out

The bathroom was fine and it was well equipped but I could not have swung a vole let alone a cat in the bedroom

Bar was stunning and staff were great. Pricey drinks buts that’s to be expected in a top end hotel

I dithered over the star rating as I think the room is only 3 star but everything else was 4 star. If I booked it again would go for the queen deluxe ",4,2018,02,25
123,AMAZING!!,"I have recently stayed at The Marylebone Hotel and it was an amazing experience. It’s location is excellent with the ablility to get around the city. Rooms are beautiful, well appointed, comfortable and incredibly clean. The bathrooms are superb. Here the staff is amazing between the exquisite service from Zan Jouic, Jack, Riyas and Brendan. They made our stay  even more pleasant. I can not wait to return to the Marylebone for my next stay in London. The food here is amazing! There is nothing I would change about my stay here expect staying longer. 

Ps.....  The staff gives great ideas on fun things to due during the day and places to eat!",5,2018,02,24
123,Amazing !,"Stayed here on the advice of friends...absolutely blown away by it....fab location, great staff, great room, amazing bathroom with superb towels etc.....bar downstairs is the real star of this hotel....we spent the evening talking with a senior member of staff who hails originally from Skibbereen in Ireland...and we really enjoyed our evening...thanks to everyone for a great stay and we will be back.",5,2018,02,21
123,AMAZING,"I have recently visited The Marylebone Hotel in London and it was such a pleasant experience.
 
Location is great to get around London and the atmosphere at the hotel is always pleasant.
The staff is helpful, the concierge guy very helpful (I cannot remember his name) and also Maria Ramon, the lady from Guest Relations is always with a smile on her face, ready to help with any request.
Rooms are nice, always impeccable and the food I had in the hotel’s restaurant was great (compliments to the chef).
I do recommend this hotel to all my friends and family for their trips to London as it is a 5 star hotel in terms of service quality.",5,2018,02,21
123,A Great London Hotel!,Staying in this hotel is a really enjoyable experience. Lisa on Reception combines efficiency and friendliness superbly. Maybe its the Dublin influence from the Doyle Group that makes the difference but I always stay here when i visit London on business.,5,2018,02,16
123,Valentine's stay,"Arrived at the hotel at 11pm on Valentine's day after spending the day at the theatre. The hotel has got a luxury feel to it and although the rooms are a little small, they are very nice. 

My husband had arranged with the hotel for a valentines surprise and we arrived to rose petals on the bed. A very nice touch. 

We booked breakfast with the hotel and it was very unique and had a great atmosphere. There is an a la carte menu and a continental style buffet included in the breakfast.

Staff are very friendly and helpful. The nearest tube station is Bond street, which is a few minutes walk away. The hotel is close to oxford street.

Highly recommend if you want luxury but don't want to pay crazy prices that some other hotels charge.",5,2018,02,16
123,As good as it gets...,"This is the 3rd time I've stayed at the Marylebone in nine months. Starting from the always reliable and efficient concierge to quick room service to the smiles from the servers whilst having breakfast, I've never been disappointed. It's the simple things that make the difference here. I'll certainly go back again. Be it for pleasure - because the hotel is in the heart of the city - or for work, because it is a quiet hotel with all the necessary amenities for a business traveller...",5,2018,02,12
123,London at its finest,"Really enjoyed my week long stay at the Marylebone Hotel in London in Feb 2018.  I was upgraded to a junior suite on the 7th floor and really enjoyed the extra space.  The staff were excellent and in particular the doorman who kept a bottle of water handy every time I returned from my morning run around Regents Park and Primrose Hill.  It’s the proximity to that park and the shops in Oxford and Regent Streets that make this an outstanding location.  And it’s got a full gym and quite reasonably priced food and drinks for a hotel in this part of town.  I had room service, several dinners and a full English breakfast in the 108 restaurant and everything I ate was excellent and the staff were attentive and helpful.  All in all a really lovely place to stay. ",5,2018,02,10
123,Exceptional Short Stay,"This hotel is simply fantastic, in a quiet yet accessible part of the city it's a perfect chill out space for anyone who is visiting. The team are wonderfully friendly and helpful and nothing is too much trouble for them. Rooms are immaculately clean and tidy and to a high standard. Breakfast is a must have at this hotel, it's amazing !!! fantastic choice and all FRESH. Great Location !!!!",5,2018,02,09
123,Outstanding venue & exceptional service  - Networking Dinner & Drinks Reception,"I would highly recommend the venue and the newly renovated event space -courtyard/blue room & Library  for any business or social events. As an events manger organising several events, we booked the Marylebone for a high calibre of clientele and they all left happy and not wanting to leave!

Exceptional Service throughout from the pre-event service from Rohini to ""the onsite""  service from Hannah/Otto & team (Po, Karina, Andrea & Victor). Staff never phased by any changes or last minute requests, an event managers dream!

 Great service, Great food and Great ambiance what more would you need, we will return!",5,2018,02,08
123,Classy Hotel,"A contemporary hotel with all the amenities you could hope for. Bars and restaurants on site. Very nice and safe neighbourhood with many more restaurants and pubs nearby. Close to some of the best shopping in London, Regent Street. Great location, near to Oxford Circus and Bond Street Stations. All this in walking distance. Very comfortable and clean rooms. Discrete cleaning staff. All round great service. And RAMA the concierge went above and beyond when our booking for our hire car did not turn up at the hotel as ordered. It was sorted very quickly with the hire car company, inclusive of an upgrade and a discount.",5,2018,02,06
123,"Reservation, Reception, Restaurant, Room and Concierce","Due to many previous stays at the Marylebone hotel, made the reservation direct with the hotel and got prompt and accurate confirmation as per our request.
Staff at the Reception are always friendly, welcoming and efficient.
The Rooms are always very clean and comfortable with sufficient amendities.
The Lobby area has been refurbished with a very nice layout and cosy atmosphere.
At the Restaurant, the food and beverage has an very good variation and quality.
The waiters have good knowlege and the service and atmosphere is excellent.
Concierce staff are always very helpful and ready to give you help whenever needed.

123,Simply outstanding,"No words can describe the quality of the location and the politeness of the staff members. From the moment you enter the building you are hit by a wave of class and style with an astonishing attention to details. Nonetheless, I must mention that the experience was topped out particularly by Henri and Francesco, which I would like to thank again for their dedication.",5,2018,02,03
123,Absolutely wonderful experience! Big thank you to Kevin Passon for managing our corporate event,"Thank you so much to Kevin and the team at The Marylebone for all your support in organizing our corporate event in December 2017. We had a wonderful time and felt really looked after throughout the evening. Stunning space, very friendly staff and delicious food.",5,2018,01,29
123,"Excellent hotel for all the ages , hip and polished","This was our fifth stay
Staff are a delight throughout, Zan at reception and Roberto at Concierge are top class and very sincere in helping 
Rooms food and Spa fantastic 
Menus are seasonal in different dining spaces 
New cocktail bar very cool",5,2018,01,28
123,Chic cocktail bar with great staff,"We've visited the Cocktail Bar on Saturday noon for a coffee break before heading to the city. Stunning interior, amazing atmosphere, delicious food and drinks. All well presented and served by professional bartender, Gianluca, who we found to be immensely knowledgeable and helpful. Highly recommended.",5,2018,01,28
123,Thank you for an amazing breakfast,"Today me and my friend visited the Cocktail Bar to have a breakfast before our trip to Birmingham. Amazing atmosphere, food and delicious drinks served by professional barmen who gave us good advice and delightful beverages. Recommend to everyone.",5,2018,01,27
123,Great stay and great staff,"I stayed at The Marylebone hotel the whole week for business. The location is pretty convenient, near Oxford street and with a lot of restaurants, pubs and shops nearby.

The hotel has been refurbished recently and now it has a great lounge area, and the rooms are also very comfortable, although quite small if you stay on a standard. Better look for an upgrade.

The best of the hotel though is the staff, all of them very nice and always eager to help. I want to mention specially Maria Laureano from the reception, who always helped me to ensure my stay was perfect, even if my reservation had some issues on it.

By the way, they serve a spectacular grilled organic salmon! I attach a picture :-)

I fully recommend this hotel as one of the best in the area.",5,2018,01,26
123,Wonderful little getaway,We live in London and were just looking for a weekend spa/ staycation.  We loved everything about the hotel and staff.  The spa treatment was amazing and I am planning on making it my regular spot for spa treatments now.,5,2018,01,26
123,Doyle Collection Marylebone Cocktail Bar ,"I was there with some friends after work and had an amazing experience at the Cocktail Bar at (Doyle Collection Marylebone ) My friends and I were well looked after by Gianluca the bartender, all of us were very impressed by his knowledge and passion about Cocktails, super friendly and we hand an awesome time there . 
Highly recommended. ",5,2018,01,24
123,Fantastic hotel!,"This is a beautiful hotel situated about 5 minutes away from Oxford street and from Bond Street station. It was clean, tidy and comfy. The staff were amazing: they were very friendly and always there to help if you had a query. I would recommend this to anyone.",5,2018,01,23
123,Oasis in the heart of Marylebone,"Comfortable, hip hotel in the heart of Marylebone.  Third Space fitness Center with pool attached to hotel is outstanding. Hotel is a block from Marylebone High Street and another two blocks to the Wallace Collection and Wigmore Hall.  Fabulous location!  Moreover, it is four blocks from the Bond Street Tube with quick service to both the City and Canary Wharf.  Finally, Oxford Street and Selfridges are also a 5 minute walk away.  ",5,2018,01,21
123,Bad room experiences in 3 out of 4 stays,"I've stayed at - and recommend - the Marylebone for years. Unfortunately, after persistent room problems I can no longer stay or recommend the hotel. In particular, in 3 out of my last 4 stays, I've had to change rooms due to bad odors or loud noise. (I've only asked to move rooms at one other hotel in my life - not something I frequently request.) On my most recent trip, my room was not ready even though I checked in at 3pm. And when I finally did enter the room hours later, it smelled absolutely rotten. I moved to another room, which was lovely, but the keys didn't work. Finally, when I went to the bar at the main restaurant for dinner (where I've dined several times before), the bartender told me there was no food service available at the bar. No worries, I found a lovely neighborhood restaurant, though after a long day of travel and difficulties at the hotel, an easy meal at the bar would have been nice. For all these reasons, I can no longer recommend the Marylebone. The problems are just too persistent.",1,2018,01,21
123,Cozy atmosphere,"Stayed on citybreak for 4 nights. Great position of the hotel (quiet neighborhood and only 10min walk from Oxford street, 5min from nearest tube station-Bond). Fusion of urban-classy&cozy interior.
Approachable&helpfull staff on reception, excellent first impression (bellboy Andrew welcomed us in front of the hotel, asked our names and presented us to receptionist for check in), nice&polite staff on breakfast and dinner, good choice of music during the dinner.
Amenities in the room every day with turn down service, clean room on arrival and every day after, Nespresso machine and kettle in the room, I like the most everyday reload of tasty Schottish Shortbread fingers.
A bit dissapointed with the ""view"" (wall view) but as we were all day out of the room, wasn't break point for any bad comment.
Delicious Benedict's eggs every morning (with salamon or spinach or avocado on side). Overall, I felt very welcomed and cozy in The Marylebone and I would recommand this hotel.",5,2018,01,20
123,"Chic boutique hotel, quiet rooms and good service","The Marylebone hotel sits in the heart of Marylebone,between Regents Street and Baker Street.  The surrounding streets are the epitome of London.  The hotel is deceptively large, with a large restaurant at rear where breakfast is served.  The loony bar is set across several rooms so has plenty of private corners where you can drink and talk in peace.  I would recommend to sit at the cocktail bar if you time and watch the highly trained cocktail waiter preparing drinks.  There are business spaces for meetings which are private and quirky.  Good for a small meeting (20 delegates or less), but the spaces are not suitable larger groups.  Rooms are well appointed and quiet.  A great hotel in a great location for business or sightseeing. My only complaint is the price of drinks in the lobby bar which in themselves are usual London prices, but beware the lobby charge which is added even if you order at the bar.  A bit cheeky in my view.",4,2018,01,20
123,Great vibe,"Stayed 2 nights for business and find that the Marylebone has a great vibe to it.
Nicely refurbished entrance and bar area. Staff was very helpful, nice breakfast.

Meeting rooms on first floor was nicely decorated but didn’t work that well for my intended purpose.

Bedroom was clean and spacious with a comfortable bed.",5,2018,01,19
123,Weekend break,"Recent weekend was about the seventh visit,always enjoy our stay,friendly and helpful staff,loveley breakfast,comfy beds and comfortable lounge and bar.Like the area it's quiet in the hotel but plenty of bars and resteraunts close by,Ten minute walk to Oxford street and a further ten minutes to west end",4,2018,01,18
123,"Great style, location, and service at the Marylebone!","Our family of five concluded a great vacation in England with a four night stay at the Marylebone. The neighborhood has fantastic shops and restaurants, and the hotel staff, was superb, especially Andrei at the door.",5,2018,01,16
123,the marylebone,"We’ve been staying in the marylebone hotel during Jan 3rd until Jan 9th 2018, and enjoyed every moment.

We think that beyond the perfect location and the beautiful accommodation, the secret of the hotel is the professional and welcoming staff.

We especially want to mention and gratefully thank Miss Antje Poschel, whom her kindness and special personality made our stay even more pleasant than expected.

Hope to come back soon...",5,2018,01,15
123,"Amazing Stay, Welcoming and extras!","We have just returned from a weekend at The Marylebone and we had a brilliant time there and will definitely be returning.

From the man at check in (cant remember his name unfortunately) who was extremely welcoming, asking us if we needed any directions and recommendations for local restaurants, he offered plug converters, even though we didn't need any. We were also given a free room upgrade on arrival to a stdio suite on the sixth floor which was a lovely surprise!

The hotel itself had a great feel and felt very elegant, with beautiful decor. 

It has a bar area in reception which has a range of cocktails and spirits or coffees in the day. There is also a pool in the basement, as well as a sauna which we unfortunately didn't get time to visit.

Before our arrival I emailed the hotel and asked if there were any extra packages I could pay for as it was my boyfriends birthday. They replied the same day and informed me I didn't need to pay extra that they has arranged something for me.
Once we had settled into our room, we had a knock on the door and had a bottle of Prosecco and cake delivered along with a hand written card. They truly made you feel special here, and thank you to Jack who arranged it!

The hotel room itself was very spacious for London, with a shower/tub combo. The TV was huge, and the bed was really comfortable, as well as the pillows. There was a Nespresso machine, Kettle, Mini bar (extra charge), in room electronic safe and a full size hairdryer in the room. The bathroom had shower gel, shampoo, conditioner as well as a shower cap, soap and cotton buds etc.

It was a 5 minute walk from Bond Street station, just off of oxford street, but was far enough away to be quiet. There was a huge variety of restaurants and cafes close by.

A great place to stay if your looking for impeccable friendly service, comfort and close to the restaurants and shops!
Will be returning!!",5,2018,01,15
123,"Great Service, Great stay ","We stayed 1 night in early December, we arrived early and our room was ready ahead of time. The check in process was quick and friendly. The location is great for Oxford Street and is walking distance to the BBC Studios. We had a good meal in the restaurant, the bar area was busy as it was a Friday evening but there are tables set above the bar and that was quieter. Comfortable room, great staff and a good location. Already booked to stay at another Doyle collection hotel this year, The Bloomsbury. ",5,2018,01,14
123,Great vibrant exquisite hotel,We chose the marylebone for my mums birthday and it certainly lived    up to its expectations.  This beautiful exquisite hotel is located in a buzzing trendy area with lots of great restaurants and high fashion boutiques also close to Oxford street. The staff were so attentive and especially  Jack  who went out of his way to help us celebrate my mums birthday. He is a credit to the hotel.    He made our stay perfect.  The breakfast was delicious and we had a great spacious room. Will definitely visit this hotel again.,5,2018,01,14
123,Pleasant stay,"It was very good. There was friendly staff and nice rooms. We really enjoyed the 108 bar. Very good location. Many good restaurants and Café's surrounding the hotel, in Marylebone Village. Only disappointment was no fridge in room for guest's use",4,2018,01,12
123,Wonderful hotel,"A quiet and luxury hotel in a very nice neighbourhood. So close to the main shopping streets (Regent Street, Oxford street…) by foot.
Our room was very quiet, with an excellent service.
We will certainly go back there for our next trip to London.",5,2018,01,11
123,Very nice great location just above oxford street,"The hotel is very nice, a tasty mix of modern and traditional, rooms are comfortable, clean and nice, breakfast is good too. The lobby offers a lot of common spaces where people meet during the day. I didn't take advantage of the pool and other amenities.The location is very good, just north of oxford street and walking distance to new bond st. station and Sefridges.",4,2018,01,10
123,Love this Marylebone/London Hotel,"I used to always stay near Sloane Square, but, stumbled upon this lovely small scale hotel and love it.   First time I checked in, the room was small and a/c wasn't working.  I called the desk and within 5 minutes, someone came to rescue me, upgrade the room without any questions asked.  I returned and they noted the room and returned it to me a year later!   Great location, great dining room, pool in the basement, well appointed room....every morning I would wake and walk the neighborhood before breakfast because it's amazingly charming....blocks from Regent Street, best shopping and sights....central to everything for a few days visit to London!",5,2018,01,10
123,Central Boutique,"This is my 3rd time to stay in the lovely establishment. 
Check in was fantastic. Quick and painless. We were handed hot cloth on arrival as a refreshment after our travels and the staff were extremely lovely and friendly.

We stayed for just the weekend this time which makes this hotel ideal. When you're working with short time you want to be as central as possible. Shopping (right off Oxford Street near Harrods), restaurants, bars and theatres were all within walking distance. The train station was also very close which made any travelling extremely easy.

The hotel is VERY comfortable. The first time I went to the hotel a few years ago I noticed just how incredibly comfortable the beds were. I'm an awkward sleeper and any discomfort can keep me awake. These beds were amazingly comfortable. The only downside to our room was I thought our room had come with a seperate sitting area but we booked through 3rd party and while there was two seats in our room it was not how it was depicted on the photos. 

The pool area is lovely. Nice to spend a bit of time down there to unwind and then into the bar area for a drink before heading out on the town.

Lovely boutique atmosphere in the center of London. The decor is very nice and the hotel over all is very inviting. 

This has become my go to hotel when visiting London as it really makes my short trips worth while.",4,2018,01,10
123,"friendly, boutique","The room was small but clean and very comfortable.  It had the added bonus of being able to open the window for fresh air.  The bathroom was very small but sufficed for what was needed.  Perhaps a smaller basin would make it feel less cluttered.  Breakfast was very good and the hotel staff were all very friendly and helpful, including Roberto on the door.  As an overall experience I recommend this hotel and the chain for return visits.",4,2018,01,08
123,"Nice, central hotel with very nice staff","We very much enjoyed our stay at Marylebone.  The staff is very friendly and the hotel is very nice. The breakfast is fabulous.  The people in the bar are particularly accommodating.

The rooms are nice but small.  The bathrooms are particularly small.  This is a bit common for London but I felt they could have been a bit more spacious as our room was cramped for two people.

The concierge was helpful but I did not think the staff knew London and how to get places as well as I would have liked.  Notwithstanding all of this, I would still consider staying there again.  It is a very nice place.",4,2018,01,06
123,"Modern, Chic and Comfortable Hotel in a great location","I make several trips to London and always like to stay in new areas and properties.  I'd never stayed in Marylebone, and was pleasantly surprised at how conveniently located it was.  No more than a 15 minute car ride anywhere I wanted to go (Chelsea, Kensington, Mayfair, Knightbridge, etc.).  The hotel is extremely comfortable and chic, with heated bathroom floors and modern furniture.  My only complaints would be that the room service was sub par, the cleaning staff kept leaving the window open after they cleaned, and we were originally given the incorrect room upon check in.  Mere hiccups on an otherwise amazing stay.  Would definitely return.",4,2018,01,05
123,"Great location, property is lovely!","The hotel is an ideal spot if you are in London for pleasure with family as it is 250 meters from JOHN LEWIS and Oxford street. Andrei and Roberto are a great help and nice guys at the door whilst the rest of the staff are mostly friendly. 

Enjoyed our stay and would recommend this hotel to anyone in town. ",5,2018,01,04
123,"Family service, smiling faces and Christmas spirit in spades!","The staff... the staff... the staff. With two excited Children the Hotel managed to have a wonderful Christmas decoration display, but the doormen were the real winners. Roberto was superb with the kids and incredibly helpful when packing the car.  At the front desk Jean looking after the family and also saw to it that my parents who were staying for a short while were near to be able to babysit. Then organised milk and cookies for the children. I missed the name of the concierge but he took care of all of our needs and also organised a car to take us around town.

We were lucky enough to be staying in the suite with an adjoining room on the fourth floor. The space was superb and the main bathroom was much bigger than the normal sized rooms.

The slight downside was being above the entrance to 108, however, the noise really didn’t travel. You know you are in London and the hubbub of the Marylebone High Street is lovely. Generally, there is no noise after about 20:00.

The babysitting service is also from a regulated company and they only use employees from a fully regulated group.

Superb stay, lovely staff and would highly recommend it.",5,2018,01,03
123,"Great location, good rooms, lovely bistro, brilliant breakfast","My favourite hotel in London.

We have stayed at the Marylebone several times and we keep coming back because it never disappoints.

The location is fantastic.  Easy to drive to, parking down the street is easy to find and it's within walking distance of Oxford Street.

The rooms are nicely decorated and always of a high standard.  The staff are always friendly and helpful.

The breakfast is great and my husband even said he had the best pancakes and bacon he's ever had.  He eats a lot of pancakes and bacon ;-) and so this is very high praise indeed.

It can be expensive, but if you skimp on a hotel in London, then you always end up spending more money on tubes/taxis.  Spend the extra £30/40 and stay somewhere really convenient.",4,2018,01,02
123,Super guys who work there (Roberto) and great location,"Great location; we needed to be near the Langham where our friends are staying; near Selfridges which is literally 6 mins walk; and has a swimming pool; spa and gym. 
The front door man, Roberto from Sicily is excellent; very nice and very helpful and provided us with lots of tips of where to go; parking advice over New Year and also landed us an umbrella in anticipation of rain in the afternoon (can't be too careful in London)
Anyway, we like the service, even when room wasn't ready, we were able to use another room for prayer, then go out, and came back to a nice room on level 6; but it was not too big; (rather missing the large suite in Zanzibar) anyway, anything we asked, it came quickly whether it was more towels, more shower gels, teabags, milk cartons et al. The strive to please you which is very good.
On day of checkout, we were allowed to check out at 1.30pm. Great front staff. Thank you to Daniel who's just going to South Africa. Good luck.",4,2018,01,01
123,Perfect Visit ,"I have stayed at this hotel 3 times this year, previously staying at The Langham round the corner I have most certainly found my London home from home. Whenever we return Jack is ready to assist to our every need. Thank you",5,2017,12,31
123,A Very Comfortable Stay,"I haven’t stayed here since it was the old Montcalm but the renovation has changed it beyond recognition and all to the better.
Very comfortable room with good quality of sleep.  Upscale toiletries in the bathroom. Good Continental breakfast and excellent service.
Very smart cocktail bar. The position is fantastic - 2 minutes away from Bond Street tube. 
Price very reasonable too. Would definitely stay again. ",4,2017,12,29
123,Too short a stay - will definitely stay again!,"Had a lovely stay, unfortunately for only one night. Very comfortable and well appointed room, and the hotel has excellent amenities and service - starting and ending with very friendly and professional Roberto at the hotel entrance!",4,2017,12,29

The staff was very helpful, every question and request was answered properly. The room was big and convenient.",5,2017,12,28
123,Excellent Friendly Service,We stayed at The Marylebone Hotel for 10 days over the festive period and were pleasantly surprised by the service of the excellent staff with special mention to Jenna in the restaurant and Roberto at the door as well as the Concierge. Would recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to London. Excellent location close to all amenities. ,5,2017,12,27
123,Great visit,One of the best hotels in London. It has a great location and is close to the Center. The rooms are very clean and the staff extremely friendly. The restaurant offers a great variety of tasty food. Always a great experience staying there. Roberto was very friendly and nice ,5,2017,12,27
123,Incredible gluten free afternoon tea,"For mine and my partner’s second anniversary I took her to The Marylebone for afternoon tea. Usually for me, being gluten free, it never adds up to the ordinary   and I envy (in jest of course) my partner’s helping. On this occasion however, the tables had well and truly turned! My gluten free helping of afternoon tea far outweighed the ordinary. In fact, I would recommend anyone to actually try the gluten free afternoon tea for the buttermilk scones. They were simply incredible. We were given a beautiful booth by the window, courtesy of a mr Jack Mckie, supplied with beautifully presented, fresh sandwiches and cakes, crisp, fresh sparking and simply doted on by the staff. A man named Lorin was so kind and welcoming. My partner felt very special and I couldn’t thank the staff more for their warmth and professionalism. I will be back time and time again. Worth the money a thousand times over for both the quality of the food, the staff and the experience. A 5 star experience! ",5,2017,12,27
123,Great hotel ,"Hotel is great.. always my first choice on coming to london because of its great location and service! Clean rooms, friendly staff and amazing concierge.

The hotel is also close to hyde & regent parks. ",5,2017,12,25
123,Excellent hotel in very elegant Marylebone,"The Marylebone Hotel is centrally located in a very elegant area and the common areas and bedrooms are nicely decorated. You are very close to Oxford Street and shopping area, although in a quiet and very classy neighbourhood. Breakfast is quite plentiful, with a buffet section, and a la carte selection, that can be included in your room plan.  Hotel staff is very polite and attentive to customers requests - we had our room changed because there was no heating in the bathroom - only in the main bedroom - and for us it was a little bit cold. The frontdoor man, Roberto, gave us some insightful tips for Christmas Mass and Boxing Day <shopping spree. Thank you!
",5,2017,12,25
123,Highly recommend ,"I stayed in the Marylebone several times, the service is always top notch, rooms are nice, clean and well equipped, breakfast is amazing, hotel is very friendly for children,staff are very nice and helpful, especially Roberto the door man he is always greeting with a guanine smile helps with the bags and the stroller.
The hotel can use a better loyalty program though.",5,2017,12,25
123,Cozy and relaxing stay in London,"We have stayed in the Marylebone hotel for 5 days in December 2017 and had a wonderful time! Everything from the welcoming check-in, the room, service, breakfast, the unbelievably large and modern gym, the pool, wet steam sauna, the 108 brasserie.... everything was an absolute delight. Special thanks to Zan and Rocio who were very attentive and helpful. Hoping to return with the kids next time we’re in London.",5,2017,12,25
123,Nick Fitz Ire,"Service is excellent, rooms are always extremly comfortable and well serviced, location is A1 for me regarding central London meetings, you are always treated with utmost professionalism by all staff especially Brendan and Jack, i also use this hotel for leisure trips with my wife and 3 kids,",5,2017,12,20
123,Great Service,"I have stayed at the Marylebone Hotel on a number of occasions over the past 2 years and find the front of house staff really polite and helpful, if I ever needed help for anything Brendan at the reception area was always on hand to point me in the right direction. Also Jack Mckie explained the hotel and surrounding areas brilliantly, I look forward to staying there again very soon.",5,2017,12,19
123,"Amazing service, atmosphere and venue.","I booked one of the function rooms for a Christmas party. The lady I booked with (Rohini) went above and beyond to help me sort it all out. I really appreciate her help. 
The venue is lovely, decorated perfectly and all the staff on the night were lovely and very attentive with topping up drinks etc. We had a large food order for 50 people and everything came out on time and was very tasty! 
I would 100% recommend. 
Thank you to The Marylebone for giving us an excellent experience.",5,2017,12,18
123,Perfect Place for Events,"I organised a dinner for top C Level Executives at The Marylebone and I must say, what an incredible experience from both sides - mine as an organizer and my clients as guests.
The whole process was extremely smooth, informative, professional and the team fulfilled all of my requests. The function rooms have an impressive decor and are very versatile. A very especial thanks to Gemma Brant who managed the event for me.
My clients had a lovely evening and were very pleased with the quality of the food and amazed by the high caliber service provided by all members of staff. 
I am a very strict and demanding person when organizing my events and I only write reviews when the place I use scores a 10! The Marylebone scored a 10+",5,2017,12,14
123,"Great Location, Freindly Stuff, Clean","Sty at The Marylebone for weekend.
The hotel is in great loacation, close to Oxford but in a quiet street.
The Room and public area are clen, the stuff is very freindly.
The room is little smal but I didn't expect more for room in this location",5,2017,12,12

Special thanks to chef Marco for all the gluten free goodies in the Festive Afternoon Tea!

Excellent location, comfortable rooms and attentive staff, highly recommended, looking forward to our next trip!

123,Outstanding Venue for Client Christmas Party,"The Marylebone and their staff were fantastic in hosting our Client Christmas Party.  The space is stunning, I cannot rate it higher and their attention to detail is second to none.  They did absolutely everything to make the event a huge success and we have received incredible feedback from everyone who attended the evening.",5,2017,12,07
123,Excellent Hotel in London,"Came back to Marylebone as family for a fortnight's stay from November 19. Found it as great as we had in our first stay. Excellent rooms. Very clear with linen well taken care of.  Breakfast continues to be best that we as a family have found in our travels around the world. All hot food offered fresh as per your orer. Buffett has only cold things and those also with great choice. Too tempting to overfeed yourself, so be careful.Staff is very polite and friendly always willing to help. It is very difficult to name any one as outsetanding , but let me take the risk of specially mentioning two names. The welcoming lady at breakfast Ms.  Chalita and the Front Desk Asstt Manager Jack Mackie. all in all an excellent five Star Delux stay. Looking forward to going back.",5,2017,12,07
123,Another perfect stay,"From check in to check out the service was 5* Great hotel, staff and location.
Rooms are small but have everything you could want from a hotel room. Bar prices are expensive but its worth paying a little extra for the buzz in the bar",5,2017,12,06
123,Outstanding Venue for our Christmas Party,"The Marylebone and their staff could not have been seamless in hosting our annual Christmas Client Drinks party. From Kevin to George and Gian Luca in the bar area and all the other staff they ensured a really impressive evening. The space is beautiful, I cannot rate it higher and they did absolutely everything we wanted and more to deliver a first rate evening. I would absolutely want to return and host the party there again. The hotel is designed with such beautiful interiors and helpful staff you can't ask for more. The canapés were absolutely delicious and we received incredible feedback.",5,2017,12,06
123,Nice stay let down by cold shower in gym,"Lovely hotel and amazing gym with excellent facilities and very clean.
Only negative is the showers in the gym were cold at the time (assured me that's not always the case) then when I returned to the gym the following day it was the same?
The staff in the hotel didn't seem to think it was a problem as the showers in the rooms were fine?",4,2017,12,05
123,Recommend,"Perfect location a few minutes walk from Oxford Street. 

Spacious rooms compared to many other hotels in London. 

Personally I found the interior throughout the hotel lovely and it made me feel at home.

Breakfast buffet alright, nothing extra about it. 
Quite slow service in the hotel bar, however good selection of beer and wine. 
",4,2017,12,04
123,Outstanding Staff and Accommodations,We just returned to Chicago from a one week stay at the Marylebone Hotel. I would highly recommend this hotel. We had 3 rooms for 9 people and a baby. Their spectacular service began with the friendly doormen greeting us upon arrival. Great location in a beautiful neighborhood. I would absolutely stay there again without any hesitation. The rooms were very nice and an adorable bear with a sweater saying the hotel name was given to my grandson. Nice vibe and restaurants and bar within the hotel along with so many options in this neighborhood! Thanks to the staff at this hotel for making our trip amazing!,5,2017,11,27
123,Second time and will keep coming back,"
After staying at the Radisson in Marylebone Lane for years (and being constantly disappointed) I thought I'd give this hotel a try instead. 

It really is exceptional! Hard to fault it... here are some of the positives below if you aren't sure whether to stay here. 

* Excellent welcome from greeting at car, collecting bags and seamlessly checking us in. 
* Friendly and helpful staff on reception. 
* Comfortable rooms with all the mod cons you need 
* A great selection of food and beverage - the juicery and healthy options are well loved! 
* Hotel support any business meetings you
* Restaurant 108 is great and the cocktails are to die for! 
* Close to shops 
* Pool and Spa :) 

What more could you need???? ",5,2017,11,25
123,Relationship between cost and product rather vague,"I stayed here on a business trip paid for by the client. Very friendly staff, a breakfast, and a nice little pool, but I didn't see anything to justify the very high rates charged by the hotel. My room was fine, but small, and the ceiling in the bathroom so low that in the shower I could touch it without even extending my arm all the way (and I am not very tall). It seems like an awful lot to pay just for someone to come and leave out your slippers before you go to bed. Good location in a posh part of London, though.",3,2017,11,24
123,Thanks for exceptional service and help!,"I wanted to share my experience and express appreciation for exceptional service in the hotel. Last week I forgot professional photo lens (which is expensive) in a lobby. I realised it only few days later. When I came back to reception, managers checked it in 'lost & found' but couldn't find it. Then I spoke Mr. Ivo Milkov, who is servicing guests in lobby and he said that he will double check it again. Then he managed to find my lens and gave it back to me! I couldn't believe my eyes!

I wanted to thank all hotel management for having such a great team and inform that Mr. Milkov did real effort and managed to help me. I'd like to mention that he always provides highly professional customer service (not just in this occasion) and I am really thankful for his responsiveness.

Many thanks again and I will recommend your hotel to my colleagues and business partners with pleasure.",5,2017,11,22
123,"Stylish, welcoming hotel, ideally located for Christmas shopping",Have been coming to The Marylebone for the past 3 years for Christmas shopping. It is ideally situated off Marylebone High Street and close to Oxford Street. The staff are warm and welcoming and the doormen friendly and helpful. There is a good restaurant and bar but also lots of interesting places to eat nearby.,5,2017,11,20
123,Wonderful afternoon tea!,"From the moment we stepped through the main hotel door and were welcomed by Roberto, we felt so excited to be celebrating a birthday with a Festive Afternoon Tea at The Marylebone.

Our waiter, Steven, offered us such a warm welcome too, and kindly gave us what we thought was the best table in the 108 Brasserie: the window seat! Steven's service throughout the afternoon was truly wonderful and he deserves 10/10 for kindness, friendliness and efficiency.

The Festive Afternoon Tea was exceptional! Way, way better than I could have imagined, especially as it was my first experience of Afternoon Tea! From the delicious sandwiches and mouthwatering sausage roll, to the scones with homemade jam and clotted cream, to the sweet delights on the top plate of the tower ... polenta cake, mince pies, chocolate roll, eggnog with gingerbread crumb ... we were ooh-ing and aah-ing with every mouthful.

And on top of that, one could order refills of the scones and savoury items, which we did, of course!

We were able to ask for all of the left-over treats to be boxed up for taking home, and we left the hotel with broad smiles and great memories!

We shall most definitely be back for another celebration in the new year, and highly recommend the afternoon tea to anyone looking for a lovely venue, good service and delicious tea time treats!

123,Cloakroom chaos lets the show down,"Enjoyable, crowded party with an extremely attentive head waiter but oh what a chaotic departure as staff in the tiny cloakroom were out of their depth. 
The hotel must sort this out or risk others not booking large events. ",3,2017,11,16
123,Excellent hotel.,"We have stayed in the Marylebone Hotel on several occasions and it just seems to be getting better and better. From this second one steps inside the doors one is welcomed and made to feel comfortable. My stay on this occasion was in a lovely room, perfect in nearly every way, my only criticism being that the carpet probably needs to be replaced as it is a bit old and worn. However everything else was wonderful. The bed was exceedingly comfortable, I wish I could have taken it home with me as I had the best sleep there. Staff are unfailingly polite, cheerful and friendly, from the front desk staff to the cleaning staff. I had a very happy stay.",5,2017,11,16
123,Company birthday celebration,"We booked the courtyard and library for an evening drinks reception to celebrate our company's birthday.  The décor and feel of the rooms and hotel in general is fantastic -understated glamour and a great sense of calm and tranquillity. Nothing is too much for any of the team here and I would particularly like to thank Kevin Passon in M&E for expertly masterminding our whole event. The serving team on the night were George, Hannah and Elijah and every guest was greeted with a smile, warmth and politeness.  The canapés were delicious, especially the crab and lamb and our drinks were fantastic. The team managed all deliveries from external parties and I would host an event here in a heartbeat! I can't wait to organise our next event with Kevin and the team!",5,2017,11,14
123,Don't look anywhere else.,"I stayed at the Marylebone Hotel with my daughter recently on two occasions whilst my daughter had her appointments for laser eye surgery.  Do not stay anywhere else.  You are truly pampered from check in to check out.  Nothing is too much trouble and we loved it and the staff are very friendly and welcoming.  With a special thanks for the doormen who make you feel special.  We stayed in a Queen Suite and it is worth paying that bit extra for the added luxury of a lounge area.  The furnishings are excellent with every thing you can wish for.  It feels like a very homely place.  We especially loved the fact that your rooms are serviced regularly if you choose this.  The location is excellent just 5 minutes walk from Marylebone High Street with quaint shops, bars and restaurants (a very village like feel) and you are only 5 minutes walk from Oxford Street ideal for shopping.  We will be back.",5,2017,11,13
123,Lovely Hotel in a great central location,"One night stay for a theatre / museum trip. Lovely hotel, boutique feel but not too quirky or overly posh.

123,Well situated and well appointed,"Nice room, with outlets for British and North American small appliances such as curling irons. Bathrooms are small but very clean and well equipped. Hotel is very quiet and the staff went out of their way to be nice. I'm looking forward to my return visit. This hotel provides value for the price. 

Be sure to spend some time exploring Marylebone. It has some nice Georgian and Victorian architecture, pretty squares, and lots of little shops and restaurants. The Wallace Collection is in Manchester Square; I've visited twice and it's a nice way to spend an afternoon. Serene Marylebone is a relief from crowded and noisy Oxford Street.",4,2017,11,08
123,value and location,excellent location quiet but yet close to many venues.the basic room is a little bit small for 2 and the storage space is scarce but except of that it is a winner. excellent breakfast and if you want  dinner and not to go far you have the hotel bistro with good good and drinks.Staff are friendly and professional. definitely will come back  but try the bigger rooms.,5,2017,11,08
123,My favourite at Marylebone area,"Its a fantastic venue. I feel relax and comfortable. Very good food, breakfast is fantastic. Beds, pillows are fantastic. The hospitality is very good, you are treated respectfully and in a proper kindly way.",4,2017,11,07
123,Good value,"For value and location, this hotel is a winner. Some of the lower priced rooms are basic and smallish but can’t beat the place for the location. We stay there whenever we go to London. There are super individual shops and restaurants two minutes away on the high, street; trendy cafes and bars just outside the hotel’s back door and the bustle of Oxford Street a few minutes walk away! ",4,2017,11,07
123,Birthday party in a private room,"Was looking for an private space to host a birthday party for my wife. The Marylebone is a lovely hotel, in a great central location. They have several new event spaces, all lovely. 
Through from the first enquiry, I have been dealt with prompt and professional manor which is nice, as from experience with other establishments this is not always the case.
Kevin is sales, Hannah running the operation and Russell the Executive Chef have all been superb. Delivered everything promised, with that little bit extra which does not get missed. Personally I loved the relaxed, friendly and approachable staff. Their personality added to the atmosphere on the night and a big smile goes a long way. Thank you to the lovely Marylebone and your wonderful staff!",5,2017,11,06
123,"Great hotel , great location","Very high class hotel (and not too expensive) in a very good location. Close to most things in the west end but in a quiet area. Local area has a lot of good restaurants and bars, plus close to Oxford Street",5,2017,11,06
123,"Perfect location, quite good service","The Marylebone, like other Doyle hotels, is luxurious. I'd recommend it for a business traveller: facilities are convenient and extensive, with a large basement fitness room and small spa. The hotel is expensive, but corporate rates might control your costs. It's too big to be charming, but it's small enough to feel personal. Staff are well trained — if very busy at times. 

I found the doormen to be the cheeriest and most helpful of the staff. Front desk were responsive and competent, with items like ice and toothbrushes delivered lickety split. The in-house restaurant, with a breakfast spread, was only so-so. (This need not matter much; Marylebone is chock-a-block with excellent cafés.) However, room service was consistently good and very quick. Again — this makes it great for a business traveller. 

The elevators are an oddity: they stop on ascent and descent regardless of the call-button pushed, and you need to walk around the building to the rear elevator to get to the facilities in the basement. It's kind of amusing, but also just plain odd. I laughed with multiple other guests about our pointless rides to the 7th floor, where the doors opened for no one. 

Our room was pin-drop quiet, spacious, and well equipped. The view onto the back rooftops was nothing to get excited about, but windows open to admit air, and the quiet is welcome.

Marylebone is a swish, convenient location for most kinds of travel involving the western parts of London, and the hotel is square in the middle of the most charming bit, Marylebone Village. You are conveniently between Paddington (for Heathrow and the West) and Euston / St Pancras / Kings X (for the north and Eurostar), with only a few stops to ride on the tube or a few minutes in a taxi. Covent Garden theatres are a half-hour walk or an easy ride. Tourist attractions around Baker St and excellent music at the Royal Academy are steps away. The Regent's Park is a few minutes' walk, and Hyde Park, then the museums and music venues of South Kensington aren't much further.",4,2017,11,03
123,London trip,"fabulous location and very quiet, had a super room ( though small and it was a little difficult to get around the bed and the bathroom door had to be shut ) - however, attentive staff at reception and housekeeping.
Only thing disappointing was breakfast service, as we hadn't paid for breakfast, we felt a little second class and it was all a bit too much trouble.",4,2017,11,02
123,Well looked after in lovely location,I decided to give the Marleybone another try. Last trip did not go so well however I was contacted by the lovely Brendon who was keen to show me the best of the hotel. He upgraded my room to a lovely suite and yes the air conditioning worked perfectly. I enjoyed breakfast in my room (7.15 on Sat am as had meeting later) on time. All went to plan and it is a very special place in an excellent location. Thank you Brendon I will be back.,5,2017,10,29
123,Excellent hotel and location,"Stayed here for 1 night and thought the hotel was wonderful.
We had a suite on the 6th floor which was perfect.
Check in was speedy even tho we arrived early to drop off our luggage, nothing was a problem for the staff. We left our luggage and when we returned it had all been left in the room.
Would definitely recommend.
The hotel was right in the centre of everything that we needed yet was far enough away to be nice and quiet.
Wish we'd had more to to enjoy the swimming pool and other facilities

Would definitely recommend ",5,2017,10,29
123,Sleepless night,"We wanted somewhere close to the London Palladium and found this classy hotel. Greeted on arrival and directed to the desk; the background music and the receptionist’s accent made it a little difficult to understand what she was saying but we got there in the end. The room was very ‘compact’ (especially the bathroom!) but otherwise ok. Unfortunately our room was situated near a lift which seemed to be ‘on the go’ late into the night/early hours of the morning and from very early the next day, I must say it really spoiled our overall experience.",3,2017,10,29
123,"Great bed, friendly staff for a high price","This hotel very much feels like a business hotel. I had a good stay (5 nights).
Location is excellent in a beautiful area.
I was here for business and for me alone the size of the room was OK and convenient with all modern comfort. Great bed and small details like 2 water bottles a day make it extra-comfortable. For 2 persons and a longer stay I would find the room too small.
Bathroom is tiny, a bit tricky to climb out of the bath tub after taking a shower.
Common rooms in the hotel feel very luxurious (like a lot of small meeting corners).
Food is very yummie but room service extremely expensive.
Staff at check in and entrance is very friendly and professional and there are A LOT of them. You are greeting and welcome by multiple persons. There are always different employees at the reception all eager to help.
Also in the corridors with rooms there is a lot of staff - I felt a bit ""stalked"" at some points.
Rooms are cleaned and serviced very well.
Breakfast was a bit disappointing: only continental is included and I found it a bit limited choice. Also service at breakfast is weird: tons of staff but still it takes long to get your coffee and toast (up to 10-15 minutes before you finally get it). 
I would personally prefer a bit less staff and a slightly lower price.

Had a good stay, but would find this hotel privately too expensive for what you get. Hence the 3 stars. I you prefer a lot of attention, then this is a great place for you.",3,2017,10,29
123,Spotless room. Quiet and great access,"Business trip with a day for pleasure tacked on. Hotel is a off the main drag, but has perfect access to Oxford, the lovely Marylebone area and tube access to anywhere. Room is small but smartly laid out. Lighting could be better in entry area .
Department stores all closely, walkable to everywhere if you are willing to go for it.
Check in was a breeze and breakfast is efficient. Had the continental and it is adequate and ample with fish, yogurts and breads cheese and meat.  Waitresses are not fully fluent in english and seemed to require some training but were assisted by older staff.
Nespresso machine and tea replenished as are water bottles and tea. The cleaning staff take time to do it right.  Is swanky enough and works well.",4,2017,10,28
123,London is all about location,I love staying at the Marylebone. The location is excellent and oxford st is literally two minutes away. Baker street and Marylebone high st is also a 5 min walk. Bond street tube station is close enough for you to connect to all major lines also. The room we had was tiny!!!! However the staff was super. They were courteous and helpful and always there. It was a good experience.,4,2017,10,25
123,Fabulous afternoon tea at the Marylebone Hotel,"I went with a friend for afternoon tea at the Marylebone Hotel on the 20th Oct and it was fabulous in very way. The savouries were delicious, in addition to a finger sandwich we also had an open sandwich with rye bread and poached salmon, both of which were very fresh and delicious. In addition we were also given a sausage roll and a mini quiche with the lightest pastry possible which were also superb. 

After this were the lovely scones followed by a selection of smaller cakes and pastries, which again were delicious. 

There was a choice of tea, which was refilled several times. 

The ambience and decoration at the Marylebone Hotel make for a relaxing and calm afternoon tea, and unlike many other afternoon tea establishments in London, you are not asked to vacate your table after a certain time. This was an afternoon tea to remember!",5,2017,10,24
123,Luxury and comfort in London,Check in and room allocation very speedy and efficient. Friendly helpful staff. Lift availability inadequate at busy times but ok otherwise. Room bijou but very cosy and comfortable. Good sized comfortable bed but why do they have scatter cushions and massive throw and spare pillows that totally fill the miniscule floor space? Overall very pleasant stay! ,5,2017,10,23
123,Fawlty Towers - Stay elsewhere,"I wouldn't stay here again for free. 

The service was somewhere between shambolic and bizarre. We booked two rooms and different people came into both of them during our stay without knocking. The explanations given by the hotel, such as they were, were unsatisfactory, inconsistent and inherently implausible. The assistant manager we dealt with has no future in hospitality. He even had the audacity to suggest it was our fault people had entered our rooms without knocking because we had not put the Do Not Disturb signs out. He was blatantly rude, inexperienced and incompetent. 

Putting all that aside, the check in was painfully slow, and the staff are poorly trained and inefficient. Bed sheets were unclean. Calls to reception/ concierge repeatedly went unanswered. Rooms are tiny and above a loud restaurant. 

There are scores of better hotels in London.",1,2017,10,23
123,A large hotel that feels like a small boutique hotel,"The hotel is central, within walking distance to many bustling tourist attractions and shops but it remains a peaceful retreat surrounded by a few excellent restaurants. The entrance actually looks fairly unassuming but its interiors and furnished to a very plush standard. The rooms are not large but within London standards and they do have all the amenities you could wish for. They are serviced twice a day (particularly thoroughly) but staff remain unintrusive. They have a gym - yes, a real gym - not one of those gyms most hotels have which contain a treadmill and stationary bike. They also have a pool and a spa but as I didn't try either I can't comment on how good they are. However what makes this hotel truly exceptional is the staff - they are exceptionally well trained, enormously helpful and always willing to find a solution.",4,2017,10,19
123,Gr8 Stay!,"With such a central location in London it was a pleasure to stay for the 3 nights! The staff was friendly, the room was fine - the bathroom was maybe  a little small but no complaints! I would stay at the Marylebone again even for pleasure.",5,2017,10,17
123,Flash foyer cannot make up for minuscule rooms,"This used to be the Jury's Clifton Ford, very much a 1960s dump and, sadly, the expensive refurbishment hasn't improved much. True, the foyer (and website publicity shots) have been glammed to the max, and the staff are on perma-smile, but it still has the facade of a brutalist polytechnic, the musty lifts, and the super-small rooms. I realise this is London, but having to turn sideways to get round the end of the bed to the other side of the room is something I haven't encountered anywhere in the world, except at one of The Marylebone's sister hotels on the other side of town (The Bloomsbury). It's a pity they spent so much on the refurb without dealing with this fundamental problem. It's just about okay for a single night when travelling alone, but longer and with company would be truly unpleasant. Even in London, you can get more space at this price.",2,2017,10,15
123,A great experience....wonderful ,"First I want to thank all the team of this hotel, from the réception the first day and the last day continuing by the breakfast team and all the room ladies, all it's perfect.

Summary :

Situation :
This hotel is near Oxford Street (5minutes walking from the réception) and very quiet
the hotel is at 10minutes by Uber from San Pancras Station (5£ for coming from the station for 2 peoples)

Réception :
On Friday :A good team with a lot of positive energy witch can help you. I had asked for a room at he upper level and they propose to me the 588.
Because the room wasn't inspectade by the gouvernant they offer to us a tea time
On Sunday : all was ready for a quick check out. We receive the bill under the door during the night. I would like to post a letter for Paris and I didn't pay for the service it was kind.

Room :
Very nice and a good bed all it's perfect and we have a Nespresso machine and bottle of water every day
Bathroom is good with marble every where and all the necessary for ladies

Breakfast:
A continental brackfast with all you need : nothing to say

Swimming pool :

Very nice but children are not allowed all the days (there are son times for them).
The way to go to swimming pool is not very easy you have to go down to the gym center and then follow the stairs

The 108 Brasserie :

Inside the hotel there is the 108 brasserie and there is a very good atmosphere for week end at the bar (see photos)
The cocktail man is very good and can elaborate all type of cocktails 

My final note : 10/10

Bravo à toute les équipes",5,2017,10,15
123,Excellent service in Marylebone,"We are staying in Marylebone hotel at 47 Welbeck street very often. This is one of the best hotels in London in terms of location, service, food, rooms. All the staff is so much friendly, welcome and always ready to help. Especially highly recommended Riyas Kallan at the Concierge desk who really helped a lot with our difficulties and took care of us.",5,2017,10,13
123,A week in Marylbone village,"Love this area of London. It has a village feel just a short distance from the rush of Oxford Street.
Spent a week at the Marylbone always just steps from great restaurants, coffee houses.
Doormen Rama and Prosper took care of us.and staff in general excellent.
Quiet at night, however current remodel ( should be done shortly) meant some noise during the day.
Will be back again next year!!!",4,2017,10,10
123,Lovely hotel with great service!,First trip to London with our kids and wanted a small hotel where we could walk to a lot of attractions. Also wanted breakfast included. The Marylebone met all of our needs.  Lovely rooms and very clean. Wonderful bar downstairs. Very friendly servers. Would stay again!,5,2017,10,10
123,Very nice!,"This was a first trip to London for my husband and I and we are thrilled that we chose The Marylebone. Service was outstanding! They met us promptly at the curb, which was a relief after 10 hours on a plane. The room was clean and comfortable. Modern appliances in the bathroom, including an impressive jet lag curing rain shower head. Slippers and robe provided. Definitely took advantage of the Nespresso machine. For travellers they have a great power console fitted for various plugs, including one for a grounded American plug with voltage conversion. Knowing you can plug your laptop in without frying it definitely gives some peace of mind. 

Do the full English breakfast in the morning! You will not regret!

",5,2017,10,09
123,Great atmosphere with attentive service,"From efficient check-in at the front desk to the check-out, everyone always had a warm smile like welcoming you into their home. The room was very comfortable with soft linens and the pool/gym area was great to relax in. Everyone was so helpful from beginning to end.     ",5,2017,10,09
123,Marylebone Hotel,Excellent hotel in a wonderful neighborhood. Hotel staff extremely helpful with reservations and general information.  Room was comfortable and quiet. Would definitely recommend the Marylebone Hotel for business or vacation.  Great breakfast in very pleasant surroundings.,5,2017,10,08
123,Ideal location,"Excellent arrangements direct with hotel for reservation.  Ideal location near to the rear of Debenhams and House of Fraser on Oxford Street.  Great for shopping, meeting friends yet far from the madding crowd in terms of noise.  We were there for one night and it was a wonderful little oasis.  We ate in 108 brasserie in the evening. They managed to fit us in without a booking and we had a wonderful table.",5,2017,10,08
123,Wonderful bed and pillows,"Overall The Marylebone was a great property. I was travelling for business so didn't get to see much, but honestly the bed was awesome. I normally don't sleep well when I'm not in my own bed but this time was the exception. Everything else was great, it's just the bed and pillows really stand out in my mind.",5,2017,10,05
123,They know their Gin!,"Come talk to these guys about gin, they know all about it. Great bar, great vibe, great atmosphere, good times!! Free popcorn! And there's happy hour from 8-9pm! Friends loved the other cocktails, for me it was all about the GIN! Ding!",5,2017,10,05
123,The Marylebone Hotel,"Friendly and efficient staff from the moment we checked in we were made to feel very welcome and nothing was too much trouble.
Our room was lovely with comfy bed and lovely bathroom.
We will definitely stay here again and we have recommended this hotel to our friends, family and colleagues.
I would like to thank all staff at the hotel for making our stay a lovely experience.",5,2017,10,05
123,It is my second stay at Marylebone Hotel London,"It is my second stay at Marylebone Hotel London and for sure my husband and I will return to this hotel the next time.
Fantastic location with an excellent fitness club, a big pool, very good resturant and a marvellous breakfast. The hotel is placed a few blocks from the Oxford St and its sores and there are many resturants close to it.
Staff very friendly and helpful specially Maria Laureano from the Reception who helped us a lot and Aurore Civel from the Guest Relations Manager at the time of the booking. I recommend it. Cherry Abe",5,2017,10,01
123,"Consistent excellence, great location","I have stayed here 4 times recently and each time was impressed not only by the quality of the accommodation but also by the friendliness and helpfulness of the staff. The location is one of the great attractions of this hotel - a stone's throw from Oxford and Bond Streets and yet in the middle of the charming Marylebone Village with its boutiques and restaurants. Such cultural venues as Wigmore Hall and the Wallace Collection are a short walk away. The hotel itself offers a great restaurant as well as an impressive fitness centre and spa, with swimming pool. But the real reason I keep coming back is because I am made to feel so welcome and feel very at home here. I have also stayed at a sister hotel in Bloomsbury, where I had the same feeling, so I suspect that this may be characteristsic of the Doyle Collection brand. So I will have no hesitation about returning here in the future!",5,2017,09,30
123,Excellent service ,My first impression of the hotel was amazing the head consierge rama made me welcome before even entering the premises he was an absolute diamond and helped me above and beyond the call of duty with parking and anything else I needed to know he is an absolute asset to the hotel. I cannot fault the hospitality of the staff and the room was perfect for my stay. Definitely would recommend this hotel ,5,2017,09,29
123,Amazing!! ,Second time I've stayed here and I honestly can't fault it!!! Fantastic service. The food is incredible and 100% one of the best hotels in London! I must say thank you to the lovely guy Rama for putting a smile on all of our faces! Such a cheery charismatic chap!! Thank you all for a lovely visit! See you next time I'm back! ,5,2017,09,28
123,"Service, service, service ","And excellent facilities.  Doormen, housekeepers, wait staff--all were uniformly pleasant, responsive, attentive, and professional.  Breakfast, included with our room, was solidly good, but coffee was perfect.  (For those who cannot have cow's milk, alternatives were available.) Gym facilities were first-rate. Our room was neither large nor cramped, but comfortable. Decor and amenities were quite pleasing. ",5,2017,09,28
123,Fantastic London Location,Hotel situated in the heart of London. A little bit of quality and luxury in easy reach of Oxford Street and all that this offers. Great facilities and fantastic service. Nothing seems too much of a problem to the staff. Highly recommended.,5,2017,09,28
123,Marylebone Hotel - Great experience,"Excellent location with easily walking distance of Bond St. Underground station.  Beautifully appointed hotel with quiet altmosphere.  Excellent breakfast with menu that is very wide in selections.  Quiet and courteous housekeeping staff.  Our room was somewhat distant from the lift.  Workout options are vast, modern, and very inviting.",5,2017,09,28
123,Great Hotel if One Does Not Need Internet,"I have struggled with these folks for a year on the internet issue, with zero success. It seems that the top management thinks (wrongly) that there is no internet issue, but there is a giant internet issue.

The hotel in general is charming. Very small rooms but done to a nice style, good gym, fabulous service to the highest standard (highly trained very friendly staff, from the cleaners to reception), really good food in room service (the food is great, breakfast and everything else). It is an excellent hotel, but the internet does not work. 

I have been staying here the past year on my trips to London but it is now clear that nobody in management cares about this issue, so i will have to try another hotel. The internet cuts out every 5 - 10 minutes, blowing one out of Skype Business calls, blowing one out of normal Skype. For a business person to stay here would be insane. I recommend it for tourists who do no not need business internet, but business people should stay away.",4,2017,09,26
123,Amazing Hotel,"I will probably stay here every time I am in London from now on - the hotel is in a great location, has lovely rooms and super friendly and helpful staff. Rama at the front of house is great! 
It was quite expensive by the time I booked, however you get what you pay for - well worth it. ",5,2017,09,26
123,"The smallest, noisiest room on the planet","This was the smallest bedroom I've SEEN in my life, never mind staying in!  On the one side, the bed was actually against the wall, with a small cabinet on the other side.  There was NO place to even put my suitcase! But the main issue was the placement of the room next to the staff lift, and across from a room where staff, throughout the night and day!!!! (as I was working in my room), were literally throwing glass bottles in a bin. Across from my room was some kind of storeroom, where staff was entering the whole time, opening and slamming the door - always in pairs, always making a party of it! The last time I asked them to STOP was at 3:10 in the morning.  This room (550) is NOT fit for guests! And DEFINITELY not at the rate my company was charged.  ",1,2017,09,26
123,can't beat the location - great value,"Great hotel in an awesome location.  Very friendly staffs everywhere.  I had an especially pleasant interaction with Rama, who was manning the door on my last day; there was a very rude cabbie that was keeping the engine running in front of the hotel, and Rama very politely asked him if he could shut his engine so the guests won't be disturbed.  The response he got was totally uncalled for but Rama was very professional and before anything else wanted to make sure I was not disturbed by the cabbie's rude actions.  Other staff members were all very energetic and engaged as well, but Rama's professionalism truly stood out; he made sure I was comfortable while I was waiting for my ride and helped with the luggage as well..",5,2017,09,25
123,Amazing ,It was my first time in London with my husband Stuart. It was fabulous. Great staff.. the breakfast was amazing you couldn't wish for anything more..Our friends Al and Lynne have been hear quite a few times and said we wound not be disappointed and we were not.. can't wait to return.. they asked and we got an up grade and a bottle of fizz and fruit .. Jack is the guy that made it happen for us .. didn't get a picture of him but he's the best . Rooms have all you need and more x,5,2017,09,23
123,A great hotel in a fantastic location,"Excellent location and very friendly welcoming staff. The rooms are nicely decorated. The bathrooms are bright with nice products. There is a really good bar with a wide variety of cocktails. 
The beds are really comfortable. Not cheap but nothing is in the centre of London.",5,2017,09,22
123,The friendliest hotel in London.,"The people that work in this hotel are what stands it apart from any other hotel in London. the first person you meet on the door is the most amazing doorman called Rama who makes you feel so very special and is very helpful, nothing is too much trouble. The day manager Jack mckie is also another member of staff that deserves a mention. He and Rama make you feel at home as soon as you walk through the door. The hotel itself is an absolute gem in the heart of London, id even go so far as to say, an oasis. That with the most amazing front man on the door and a well run hotel on the inside, there is nothing you would want more.",5,2017,09,22
123,"Excellent service, very central","Overall really nice hotel. good continental breakfast. Especially the reception staff is super-professional, nice, welcoming. a special comment on Mr Rose at the door: outstandingly welcoming! :-) makes you feel like coming back home (away from home)",4,2017,09,22
123,Comfort and service,"Lovely hotel, very central if your in town for some shopping. Staff are always happy to help. Really nice fresh juices and food. So much is on your doorstep so you might as well venture out for food.
 Rama suggested we take a umbrella as it could rain, he was persistent so I took him up on his offer, after initially refusing, on returning to the hotel it rained. Nice call Rama, if my wife's hair got wet we could of been several hrs late for our dinner reservation :)
Second stay and would highly recommend the place",5,2017,09,21
123,Excellent London Hotel Experience!,"We loved our 5 night stay at the Marylebone last July. The rooms were great (we had two connecting rooms in a corner, with one room being a one bedroom suite, so essentially, it functioned as a two bedroom suite for us). From our room, we had a great view of one of the oldest pubs in London and it was so fun for the kids to watch all the action from our room. The 2 rooms were comfortable with plenty of storage space and plenty of room for all 5 of us (2 adults, 3 young kids). We had breakfast included and it was tasty and convenient in the restaurant downstairs. The concierge was very helpful with recommending a couple restaurants and booking a hair blow out for me. They did a great job booking a reasonably priced, competent and friendly babysitter for us for most of the evenings that we were in town. The doorman was friendly to our young kids and to us. The room service went above and beyond with extra treats and fruit included with the kids' dinners that we ordered for them each night. There is a full gym that is attached to the building that offers classes and great equipment. You will be working out alongside Londoners who belong to the gym as members (it feels like a Crunch fitness or 24 hour fitness), but equipment was great and it was certainly nice to have access to a gym. The location was quite good -- we walked to SOHO, to Hyde Park to Oxford/Regent Streets, and the Marylebone neighborhood itself is adorable and charming. We would have preferred to have a Tube stop a little closer (it was ~10 minute walk away), but if that's my only complaint, then it was obviously a VERY good experience that we had! Oh, and it was very reasonably priced for the quality and location. On our last trip to London, we had stayed at the SOHO Hotel, and while we loved that hotel as well, the Marylebone was just as good and the price was half of what the SOHO would have been for us to stay at.  Thank you Marylebone Hotel staff for a wonderful stay!",5,2017,09,19
123,Pampered,"The staff was professional and consistent! The food in the restaurant was superb and the room service not so bad, and was super fast! The swimming pool was so much fun and the steam room was a delight, not to mention the gym. This is what makes this hotel perfect!   Also Rama was an excellent conceirge!",5,2017,09,18
123,Reception nightmare,"Room not ready, ok no big deal, come back 1 hour later, room still not ready, ok go away and come back 45 minutes. I gave another hour, waited ages to get served by one of two people on reception despite a line forming, then they kept serving people out of order. Eventually get served, room still not ready.
It took a while for them to find me a room and another 45 minutes to send my bag.",3,2017,09,17
123,Lovely boutique hotel in a great location,"We were only here for one night, but really enjoyed our stay at the Marylebone. The rooms are on the smaller side, but you don't really feel it since they're quite well-appointed. The location is excellent-on a quiet, beautiful street but within easy walking distance to major shopping and the tube. The staff is friendly and helpful. Also, would definitely recommend this as a choice for Italian speakers, as the entire staff is evidently Italian!",5,2017,09,17
123,Excellent,I am a London Black cab driver who regulary uses the cab rank at the front of the hotel. The warm greetings we are given by the doorstaff especially Rama is second to none. He is very welcoming and always with a smile. He is so professional in dealing with customers and there needs the ffedback from the customers is great.,5,2017,09,17
123,Great Stay,"A short walk to Regent's Park, Hyde Park with a little longer stretch to St. James, Parliament and Westminster Abbey makes the Marylebone a wonderful jumping off point for the traveler who wants to seize the day on foot.   This is a lovely hotel with a modern feel, a wonderful restaurant and a warm and helpful staff.   

Our room was a bit snug and the hallways close, but the common areas were so capacious - sitting rooms aplenty and a two-floor health club that's among the best I've experienced in any hotel - that we hardly noticed.  All in, we had a terrific experience and recommend it highly.",4,2017,09,16
123,"Great people, nice room and amenities","I searched for a hotel that would fit all my requirements, friendly staff, nice rooms 
Great pool and gym and tasty food, I was going to be staying for 8 months and after looking at a few hotels I chose the Marylebone, something felt right and my choice was correct.
If you want to stay for a while in London and be close enough to the hustle and bustle but don't want to pay a fortune then I can't recommend this hotel enough.
I would like to say a big thank you to Brendan for all his help during my stay, nothing was too much trouble and a final thank you to the man that put a smile on my face no matter how tired I was, Rama one of the nicest and most genuine people you could ever wish to meet, he's on the door you can't miss him, the biggest smile for miles around.",5,2017,09,16
123,Coolest oasis in West end,Once again an A1 stay at the excellent Marylebone hotel - from Rana at the front door thru front and back of house it can't be faulted. Tip top!! Ambiance great food good and always a warm welcome. Couldn't ask for more!,5,2017,09,15
123,Lovely Work Event - Nothing too much for the Marylebone team,"Engaging the Marylebone events team for the use of their stunning weatherproof terrace area (with the most beautiful decor)  for a work cocktail party was an absolute pleasure from start to finish. The team there, led by Rohini, made sure we were looked after by ensuring ample staff were on hand to handle any last minute changes to the planned evening. Food and cocktails were lovely, but most importantly every request, regardless how small, was dealt with in a professional and friendly manner. We will definitely be working with them again.",5,2017,09,14
123,Very good but not Great,"I didn't have a negative experience, and really enjoyed most elements of the property. But I never experienced the ""wow!"" that I expected from reading the reviews.  

The highlights for me were in ranked order the fabulous gym, the very nice bar, the quiet rooms, and the attentive doormen. 

The areas of improvement again in order are the food service (event, restaurant, and lobby), the hot water supply, the keys that seemed to demagnetized each day (for a number of us), and the front desk staff efficiency (add more or speed up systems).

So overall an average hotel from my experience.",3,2017,09,14
123,Fantastic hotel!,"Thoroughly enjoyed my stay at the Marylebone hotel and highly recommend this hotel. The rooms are clean and very comfortable. The staff are friendly and special thanks to Rama for his warm greetings at the door! 
",5,2017,09,14
123,Top service,"We did an event this week in the hotel for five days in the blue room, courtyard and library and received top service from the staff. 
Seldom seen a so dedicated team. 
Nice setting and great food. 
Very good rooms. 
Marc",5,2017,09,13
123,Excellent choice,"I have stayed at this hotel a couple of times .  Staff are fantastic, efficient, courteous, helpful and much more.  Management excellent.
Very convenient for all London amenities, including transport.  Certainly shopping. 
Perfect for a celebration,  treat or just to recharge your batteries.",5,2017,09,13
123,Event at marylebone hotel,"Really great hotel with extraordinary service. Especially Ottó and Gergö, they helped us setting up the event room and even went into London to buy a missing cable. Service + and Rama at the door as well.",5,2017,09,13
123,"not perfect, but a good (if expensive) choice for London","Still haven't found the perfect hotel for business trips to London - even the more expensive ones (such as The Marylebone) don't deliver perfectly. It depends on what's important to you, so here are my plus and minus points:
PLUS POINTS: Very quiet rooms, little street noise (not dead silent, but definitely quieter than average for a Central London hotel); A/C efficient and very very quiet; very clean room; large, comfy bed; nice toiletries; room very large for Central London standards
MINUS POINTS: Can't open the window, which means no way to air out the room; very narrow, low-ceilinged hallways, made me feel very uncomfortable going down the very long hall to my room all the way at the end; awkward shower (no place to hang the hand-held unit, no way to avoid getting whole bathroom wet during shower)
Hassle getting invoice correct, but eventually got things sorted. 
Summary: Expensive, not perfect, but good choice if a large, quiet room is important to you!",4,2017,09,11
123,50th birthday treat,"We stayed here for one night as a birthday treat in room 492 (a deluxe double). We picked the hotel as it was within a half hour walk of Lords cricket ground and we were attending the last day of the Test. 
492 was quite a spacious room with windows facing 2 different aspects as it sits on the corner of the building. It could easily booked as an adjoining room if you have booked 2 rooms together as an external door gave access to two rooms so you could leave internal doors open. The bed was the most comfortable hotel bed I've ever slept in. 
The staff were friendly, especially in the bar, where staff were both attentive and happy to chat. Breakfast was good, the eggs are delicious.
I will definitely return to the Marylebone, its in a great location and makes for a very comfortable stay. ",5,2017,09,10
123,Fabulous Hotel in Great Location,"We really enjoyed our stay at the hotel. It is in a great location with the most lovely staff. The rooms are beautiful and well designed. From the gentleman who took our bags from the taxi, to the concierge who walked us down the street to give us directions, to the front desk staff, who gave 2 tired travelers early check in so we could enjoy our day in London...all were wonderful and thoughtful.",5,2017,09,10
123,good hotel,"I liked the hotel a lot it was cozy and felt like home. The breakfast was excellent. The employees were very helpful, rama rose really helped us and took great care of us. 8/10 hotel good location, it took us 5 min to reach oxford street and around 7 to bond street. ",5,2017,09,08
123,Great hotel,A lovely hotel which whilst been on a quiet street away from the main bustling streets of London is actually only a 2/5 mins walk to these attractions. Cleans rooms ( some can be a bit too small ) and a marvellous breakfast with freshly cooked produce and waiter served breakfast .,4,2017,09,07
123,Beautiful Hotel in a Fantastic Location,"We arrived off a long-haul flight from LA and had a wonderful stay at the marylebone hotel, Rama greeted us graciously and was a fantastic first-impression! The hotel is located in the best spot in the City, there was a first-time night manager (forgot his name!) who was terrific in helping us with a few issues in the room (fireplace, hot water etc). Highly recommend!!",5,2017,09,05
123,Wonderul hotel,Had the best stay here for my boyfriends birthday. Booked the romantic package and it was all amazing! Would have liked he champagne to have been delivered when we arrived it in the room already instead it turned up at about 6pm and we were about to go out for dinner! When we arrived we had brunch in the restaurant which was very tasty and service was fantastic. We then followed this with a 40 min massage which was amazing - would have preferred it to have been done in the same room as a couples treatment but either way the staff were amazing and we started the weekend very relaxed! When we arrived back at the hotel after dinner our room had been turned down and was full of rose petals which was a lovely romantic touch! Ordering breakfast was simple just left the selection form on the door and the food was delivered when requested the next day. All food was beautiful - so much of it! Could have sat eating my breakfast for a good couple of hours! All in all a fantastic stay the staff were very attentive and when we left were given bottles of water for our day exploring London. It's the little touches that make the difference and I would definitely be back as I felt like a princess - and it wasn't even my birthday treat!! Thank you to everyone at the hotel :),5,2017,09,03
123,Can't wait to be back! ,"There's something about The Marylebone that has such a luxury feel but you can be so comfortable. The staff, the atmosphere, the bar and restaurant are all fantastic. 

I came down for a leisure visit to see friends and visit Diana's exhibition and yet although I was alone at the hotel - the staff were so helpful in advice and showing me around. Big thank you to Rahim and Brendan. You were great!! So understanding and patience with me in london advice.

I stayed in a Superior but later found I was upgraded to a Deluxe, what a lovely touch and a great surprise! 

I can't genuinely fault this place and can't wait to return.",5,2017,09,03
123,Excellent,Wonderful hotel. Excellent staff. Some London hotels look at children with more than a touch of suspicion.  These guys manage to make the kids feel welcome while maintaining a sense of exclusivity and class .  Great location and great job to all concerned ,5,2017,09,02
123,Leif Ewa Sweden,All the staff was extremely service minded and kind. It was very quiet and restful. The location was excellent. The Continental breakfast was very good. We will come back and stay there when visiting London.,5,2017,09,01
123,"Great Bar, friendly staff","I don't normally do reviews, but I felt inclined to write one here. After a great day in London with an old friend, I thought why not grab a couple of drinks before I made my way home. I was so glad I made that choice! I loved the ambience and atmosphere in the bar, I also have to give special praise to the very friendly doorman Rama, who was so welcoming on my arrival, would definitely come back, would like to stay overnight next time!",5,2017,08,31
123,Nice to be back ,"Had stayed here and in the two sister London hotels for many years 
We had a corporate deal but fell below the required days for this year and lost it - probably a good thing for me as less travel but bad for the hotel budget!! 
I still visit now when the rack rate comes within reach of our budget but high season rates can be very costly 
Visit in the early part of the year and the rates are very reasonable 

The Marleybone Hotel is one of my favourite hotels - the comfort of the hotel is top class with all rooms being fitted out to a very high standard with plush furnishings and touches like Nespresso machines 
The hotel is maintained extremely well 

Some of the rooms go beyond amazing and rank amongst the best city based rooms I have stayed in anywhere 

Guests can use the attached Leisure club and gym which is well kitted out for any level of fitness enthusiast

The bar is an off the street one and gets very busy but the lobby has an extensive lounge area which is also great for casual meetings but no lounge food after 6pm! 

As for location it's just a few minutes walk to Oxford Street and Bind Street and close to Marleybone high street 

Great hotel overall ",5,2017,08,31
123,Rama the doorman,"Rama the door man was very helpful and went above and behind in making it a good experience, made sure the guests was happy which really made it a welcoming experience, definitely recommend this hotel due to the the staff the high quality restaurant the price.",5,2017,08,31
123,Wonderful Birthday Celebration,"We recently celebrated a very special birthday at The Marylebone hotel and it certainly lived up to our expectations! 
From the moment we arrived at the hotel we were made to feel very welcome, being warmly greeted by Daniel at reception. 
We dined in the hotel's restaurant 108 Brasserie that night. The food was outstanding and the service was impeccable. No wonder the restaurant was buzzing!
Thank you to all the staff, especially Brendan the Guest Relations Manager who looked after us so well. 
We would definitely recommend this hotel and look forward to returning the next time we are in London.",5,2017,08,30
123,Fabulous thoughtful staff,"I am a regular business traveller to this gem of a hotel. The fantastic location, great rooms, high quality restaurant, funky bar and a fabulous gym are enough to keep me coming back regularly.
Last week  I visited with my wife and what shone most brightly was the exceptionally thoughtful front of house customer service.
The reception staff and customer services manager combined to create a fabulous evening for my wife and I which culminated in a brilliant meal in the hotel restaurant.
Keep up the great work guys, you run the most friendly, high quality hotel in London.
",5,2017,08,30
123,Marylebone Hotel,Hotel location was just perfect.  Room was small but adequately equipped with all amenities.  Bathroom was also small but had everything that was needed.  The only small irritation was that when booking the room the price did not include VAT so had not taken account of the extra charge.  Overall would stay again at the hotel.,5,2017,08,29
123,"My Favorite ""Little Secret"" in London",The Marylebone is a somewhat hidden hotel just off the high street and one of my favorites.  the staff are always friendly and while the rooms can be small (typical london) they are well appointed.  I just found the bar this time and loved the ambiance.  Breakfast is always good and the spa looks nice.  This time I arrived too late to get a massage.  No worries - the Concierge has an outside therapist in my room in 60 minutes.  Impressive.  Always happy to stay here. ,5,2017,08,29
123,Wedding Anniversary,"Great Hotel, Looks from the outside are very deceiving. Very modern inside and a genuine 5 star hotel. Great location for central London. All the staff are very welcoming and helpful. This is our 3rd time staying here and will definitely be coming back again.",5,2017,08,29
123,Wedding weekend,"We had a great weekend in the Marylebone.  The check in was quick and the receptionist was extremely helpful.  The room was nicely furnished although a bit small.  The bathroom was extremely small with a shower over the bath.  Tea/coffee making facilities and hairdryer provided. There was a minibar which we did not use.  The room we had was at the back of the hotel and we were wakened at 7am each morning with the sound of the bins being emptied.   When we booked the hotel we were given a price per night and on check in they gave us the same price.  However on check out there was the 'hidden' vat added on to the bill which was not mentioned when we booked which was a bit disappointing! 
It is a great hotel and we would stay again.",5,2017,08,28
123,Awesome location,"Husband and I stayed here a week (my first time in London). The hotel had a few nooks, but no grand lobby- a bit awkward layout in front. But the back houses a wonderful bar and 3 level restaurant, as well as a great patio on a cute street. Breakfast was included in our rate and service was very friendly, prompt and professional. Food was very good. A menu plus buffet with anything you could want. 
Room was tight, but there was room in the closet for several things and lots of drawers and shelves in furniture. The bathroom was small but very well-lit, heated floor, great water pressure. And, girls, a REAL hair dryer!
The neighborhood is great, with lots of friendly, interesting shops and restaurants within a few blocks. We had Indian, Turkish, French, Mediterranean, Italian.....
A little stretch to the underground, but definitely worth it. 
We felt like we found a jewel of a place to stay. 
Also, hired a car service and paid online (£39) ahead of time from Heathrow (Blackberry Car)- picked us up outside customs and helped with luggage. Used the same going back to Heathrow (£30). Great!
Loved our week at the Marylebone!",5,2017,08,27
123,Great Hotel,"I have stayed at a variety of hotels in London over the years - and for the price and location I would rate this as one of the best.
Great service, very friendly. Good facilities  excellent gym and pool. Hard to beat the location. ",5,2017,08,27
123,Service Quality,"What a lovely stay beautiful part of London quiet and lovely restaurants, on me and my wife's arrival as soon as we got there we were greeted by a really smart and professional gentleman Rama rose that made us feel so welcome. When I went inside the hotel everyone was super friendly and everything around the hotel was a 5 star experience. It made my trip extra special to meet great staff that loved what they do and do it with a smile. Me and the Mrs can't wait to come back again my favourite hotel in London for sure.",5,2017,08,24
123,Excellent ,We booked our hotel through Tzell Travel LI. Loved the location! Great property! Service was top notch. Breakfast was amazing! The staff went above and beyond for my family. Convenient location (close to Bond Street Underground) can't say enough good things about this property.,5,2017,08,23
123,The best ,"The hotel reception is amazingly decorated , staff are friendly and helpful. Smooth and fast check in comfortable bed and nicely furnished room .  Refreshing water infusions and fruits are available with no charge i would visit again ",5,2017,08,20
123,A Hidden GEM,"Right from Prosper and others at the Door to the Vibrant, helpful and beautiful smiles behind the reception, The Marylebone is a hidden Gem in Central London. When the standards of London as a city, in terms of Customer Service are at an all time low, The Marylebone's efficient and helpful staff, top to bottom, are a class apart, especially for families with young kids. Sprinkle that with an amazing location and great facilities( Hotel with a pool in London!!!), Definitely a Great place:)

",5,2017,08,18
123,Stuck in elevator: hotel didn't answer calls!,"It's rare I have such a complaint thankfully but one wonders about the management and safety protocols at this hotel.  

I understand old elevators in these old London buildings can break down but that's what the call button is for - answer it!  I also tried the front desk on my cell - no answer either!  After 15 minutes of up and down trying to get to the lobby - finally and inexplicably the door opened on the top floor. 

I noted this to the hotel manager - no adjustment to my room rate or anything other than an apology btw - and hopefully they'll fix it.  But if they don't even answer elevator distress calls one wonders about their fire safety, cleanliness and management generally.  And what else in this old hotel is in need of a renovation?",1,2017,08,17
123,"Excellent hotel, excellent service","Recommended to us by a good friend for it's excellent location and comfortable rooms, we couldn't have faulted anything about our five night stay in the Marylebone Hotel. From the moment we arrived, the staff impressed us with their genuine friendliness and courtesy. Nothing was too much trouble. My husband and I and our two children thoroughly enjoyed the well appointed and elegantly furnished rooms. Of particular note was the great buzz in 108 Brasserie, the excellent restaurant and bar which opens out on to a street at the back of the hotel which has a cluster of nice restaurants and shops. The service at the concierge desk was outstanding. This hotel has it all.

",5,2017,08,17
123,Nice staffs ,I stayed in the Marylebone hotel and the staffs are very good and nice. Also always they made my day specially the Bar tender Csaba. I asked him to make any drink he did it right. I love this place so much. If you plan to visit London I advise you to book with this hotel.,5,2017,08,15
123,The Marylebone Hotel💫,"A star in the jungle of hotels in London. We've just returned back home after spending some wonderful days here. There is politeness, interest and care. The staff is fantastic. The Queenbed suite is spacious, clean, tidy and comfy. The location also made the stay easy and conveniant. Close to shopping, the underground and some really fancy restaurants. ",5,2017,08,14
123,Great price for a good hotel,"Marylebone is a beautiful part of London, near Mayfair but with a more local feeling, hotel is perfectly located.. The hotel has small rooms but with new, modern decor,  with good marble modern bathrooms. Staff is very friendly, food is very good. Will certanly go back.",5,2017,08,12
123,Mrs. Adriana svartsnaider ,"I had q wonderful experience at the hotel.  But there is a specific staff members who takes care of all your needs: the concierge Riyas Kallan! He is very attentive and always taking care of the hotels guest! Even before you arrive, and after you leave! ",5,2017,08,11
123,Perfect Boutique inner city hotel,"We loved everything about this little hidden gem! The rooms( be sure to go for one of the bigger style rooms) lovely and the attention to detail was fabulous, perfect location with that English feel, but oxford street is 5 minutes away, just couldn't fault anything about this place. The best thing was the staff, nothing was to much trouble so helpful and friendly. ",5,2017,08,09
123,Happiness is missing in the place ,"Spent 2 nights at this hotel. From the outside the building looks very old and dirty. The flag is grey. The lobby is very sad, so as the corridors leading to the rooms. It needs lights and happy painting!

The staff looks demotivated. Some of them were shouting in the corridors.

The deluxe room has a decent size for 1 person. But the view is so depressing .. at the image of the general mood of the hotel ( pic attached). 
And I I found the tiniest bathroom of the universe - picture attached. To the point that I was wondering if it legal to have such small area for all the use. 

The pro: great gym with a pool. Smiling doormen. 

In conclusion, the hotel is part of the Doyle collection group but is definitely not up to the standards given the price of the room. For more or less the same budget I would recommend the kensington hotel which is also part of the same Group. ",2,2017,08,08
123,"Amazing service, great location","We spent 5 days at the Marylebone in July. The staff were amazing - from the doorman, to the concierge booking last minute dinner reservations, to room service. The rooms were very comfortable, great bathroom and amenities. Access to the gym connected in the basement was great - it's not a hotel gym, it's a proper full gym which was a great surprise. With room service, they brought our children complementary fruit for dessert. The breakfast is ok - the room was always very busy and the service was challenged but the food was good and the buffet worked well. About 8 minute walk to a good tube stop but easy to get taxis.

I will absolutely stay here again for business or personal travel.",5,2017,08,07
123,a great one night get away,"traveling thru London and only had one night to stay.....wish I'd known about this place before as I would have preferred to stay longer.  It will be my place of choice if I return.  Great service, location, beautiful hotel",5,2017,08,07
123,Great location in buzzy Marlyebone,"The Marlyebone hotel is in a great location, just five minutes walk from Bond St tube (and Oxford St) and amidst the buzzy streets of Soho/Marlyebone. My room was spacious but the lighting was very dim. Thankfully there were two big windows to bring in some light.  

The bed was very comfortable and, as I was only there for one night, this was the main attraction! I noticed the furniture (bedside table and desk) looked old and worn. Shower was good and bathroom amenities were by Aromatherapy Associates. Bathroom was spacious. Although the hotel looks to be trying for a ""modern"" design aesthetic, there were no USB ports in the room. There was also no plug for the Nespresso where it was placed in the mini bar so I had to move it to the desk to plug it in (in the one available plug socket). Great to have a proper coffee machine though!

Had a cocktail in 108 Bar which was a perk of Tablet Hotels, who I had booked my stay through. The bar area was buzzy on a Thursday evening and there was a great selection of both wine and cocktails.

Good stay overall and I would stay again for a similar room rate (I paid £234 including VAT, upgrade and welcome cocktail),
",4,2017,08,07
123,Wonderful break,"My friend and I have just spent two nights at this hotel and I can't praise it enough. The staff were amazing, the service impeccable, the breakfasts delicious and our rooms very comfortable. The hotel is in a very good location and taxis park outside for people wishing to go further than walking distance.",5,2017,08,05
123,Excellent hotel,"A good looking hotel with very friendly staff. Room was very nice and they have a good pool. Did not eat anything but the menu looked good. Great location to see the centre of london, perfect for shopping like we did.",5,2017,08,05
123,Friendly haven in a busy city,"My mum organised a lovely surprise booking with a manager called Jack for two nights for me and my new husband after our wedding in Marylebone. She visited the hotel several times to make sure her arrangements were being carried out and Jack was ever so patient and understanding of her high expectations. We were not disappointed. Our room was luxurious and spacious, the breakfast was delicious and the cocktails we treated ourselves to one evening were spectacular. Thank you to everyone at The Marylebone for a wonderful and truly memorable stay.",5,2017,08,04
123,Fantastic Events Team and Venue - can not rate them highly enough!,"In March, I was given the responsibility to organise an all day event for VIP Business Guests and by luck, my search for a suitable venue brought me The Marylebone Hotel. I can not thank Kevin and his team enough for his help. He was with me from my initial phone call to enquire about the appropriate spaces until the very end. He was incredibly patient and kind while I went through numerous requests/changes and the up and down numbers for attendance. We hired out the entire floor upstairs which comprised of the Blue Room, the Library and the Courtyard and we are literally thrilled to have found what my EVP described as her new favourite venue. 
The food was superb - the avocado toast went down a storm for breakfast as did the freshly pressed juices which were so delicious! 
Hannah was on call for the day of the event and she was incredibly on the ball and quick to respond to any call or text I made to get her attention (pushing back breaks/set up of lunch etc.). 
Thank you guys, you made a stressfull day seamless and so comfortable and you are my go to for future events!
Sarah",5,2017,07,31
123,Ms van den Hoogen,I love this hotel. It is my place to stay when I am in London. The welcoming atmosphere starts with the friendly staff at the front desk. Ask for Jack - he goes out of his way to ensure guests enjoy their visit. All the staff are very helpful and professional. The hotel is elegant but homely and it is always good to see the familiar faces of other regular guests. The 108 restaurant and bar is a must - great cocktails. ,5,2017,07,31
123,"Nice staff, classy hotel but room stank of weed ","Stayed here a couple of nights, couldn't fault the staff, evening meal a tad pricey but good quality and service, breakfast ok but frankly overpriced for what you get- buy the full English for around £15 and you should get the breakfast bar, juices, coffees etc thrown in. Hotel very helpful looking after bags after check out. Only real grip was overpowering smell of weed in room 590 - tried with and without air con but it made no difference, it's pervasive 24/7 so goodness knows where it comes from. To be fair didn't complain as we used scented candles for our short stay and we were hardly in the room, wouldn't have mentioned it in this review except I notice similar complaints so clearly an issue the hotel hasn't been able to address. Security but lax for central London- recently stayed in remote Finland with every floor secured by key card but here anyone can wander to around any floor. Don't get me wrong like the hotel, great location and staff , some nice touches like sweets and soft drinks on arrival but could be even better. Would stay again despite those issues. Didn't have enough time to try pool/ gym but nice to have these facilities at no extra charge.",4,2017,07,30
123,Great Hotel for Events!,"We recently celebrated our son's first birthday at this wonderful hotel in the heart of Marylebone. The event rooms are fantastic, as was the catering! The hotel's event management team were amazing at anticipating and meeting our needs, as well as efficiently coordinating with various external vendors, to ensure everything came together as planned on the day. Special recognition to Kevin who managed the event brilliantly, and Hannah who was on hand throughout the event day for pre-setup, setup, event management and close - all the time with a smile on her face. Highly recommended for events!",5,2017,07,27
123,Wonderful stay at Marylebone,Very nice hotel and wonderful staff.  Everybody was helpful & went out of their way to be accommodating and friendly. Delicious breakfasts and very quick as we were on a schedule. Would definitely stay again & recommend to a friend.,5,2017,07,26
123,Very good hotel. Just the right distance from main drag,"Really nice hotel on the inside. Looks good from the restaurant side too. But the building itself is very underwhelming.
Really good restaurant with great buzz. Lovely reasonably priced breakfasts, especially for London. Close to Oxford Street, but not too close. Great staff. Great gym.",5,2017,07,26
123,Absolutely Wonderful Week!,"In mid-June we spent a week at the Marylebone Hotel and cannot wait to return for another stay!  Our experience began before we even arrived as we had many questions for the concierge(s) since my husband has difficulty walking.  Our questions were answered with thorough and helpful emails.  When it became apparent that London was going to be in the midst of a heatwave during our stay the concierges once again came to our rescue by calling numerous locations to see whether there was air conditioning and emailed us back with the results.  Once we arrived we found the hotel concierges and staff to be constantly accommodating and thoughtful.  The concierges did everything from handle restaurant suggestions and reservations on our behalf to trying to assist us with upgrading our seats on the flight home (this included hanging on the phone with Virgin Atlantic for 45 minutes waiting to talk to a representative).  A special thank you to concierges Riyas and Rahim, and to Vlad for his assistance with the electric scooter!",5,2017,07,25
123,Great location,"Excellent location for all things in the Marylebone area, which is packed with restaurants, bars and shops. The hotel was comfortable and clean and we'd definitely stay again. Didn't use the restarting but the bar, at street level, was a good spot for a drink and people watching. ",4,2017,07,23
123,We've only just begun,"Checked in today for a 4-night stay at The Marylebone. Typically I would write my review at the end of our stay, but the first few hours revealed a superb level of service ... thoughtful, helpful, and warm.  The staff is fantastic, all around. Stay tuned for more. This is my new favorite in London. And Marylebone is a dynamic, vibrant neighborhood in central London with the feel of a village. A very hip village at that! Not to be missed. ",5,2017,07,21
123,Great hotel,"Well appointed hotel with easy access - 10 minutes walk - to Oxford and Regent Street and Underground.
Hotel has recently been refurbished and rooms are comfortable if a bit small. Restaurant good and staff efficient and helpful.",4,2017,07,21
123,Great London Location,"First time guest and it was a great experience. Check in was fast and by a friendly front desk staff. The room was huge for a hotel room in London. Nice work area, large bathroom and a very nice bed.  The wireless work great in all locations of the hotel. The location is perfect, located near lots of shops, pubs etc and a easy walk to Oxfords Street. I would stay here again",4,2017,07,21
123,Best service I have ever experienced,"We had a great stay at the Marylebone hotel in London. My sister's family (2 kids, 2 adults) and my family (1 baby, 2 adults) decided to meet in London for a holiday. We booked two interconnected rooms with a central living room area at the Marylebone. We stayed for a week and had the most amazing time.. Some highlights: 

* The rooms are fabulous: extremely comfortable with all the details taken care of. 
* The location is outstanding: right in the heart of central London with some very very nice pubs and restaurants right outside. With kids around, we were still able to enjoy the pub scene because of the proximity to the rooms. 
* The breakfast at the 108 Brasserie is fab. We ate there every morning. The selection was outstanding and the quality impeccable. 
* The quality of the room service food is top notch, a real asset when there are jet lagged children about.

But I think the best thing about the Marylebone is the staff. They went above and beyond in every aspect to make sure we had a great stay. Their attention to detail is off the charts. 

For instance, if you order room service multiple times, they invariably remembered what we ordered last time and asked how we liked it. If we asked for an extra towel after a baby accident, it was in our room in a minute. Walk up to the front desk and they always knew my name. etc. etc. 

But the highlight of the service was how the handled a special request. My wife's birthday happened during our stay. I wanted to arrange a cake and Champagne. I asked the concierge about where I could get a cake nearby, or if they baked cakes in their restaurant. They said they didn't. But they went out and got a cake for us from a nearby bakery to satisfy the request. They also provided a bottle of champagne. All with their compliments. I was astounded.

All these these things just made us feel so welcome that it added a glow to the whole stay. That is priceless. I will never stay in any other hotel when I am in London as long as the Marylebone has a room for me.",5,2017,07,19
123,Amazing location ,"We wanted an affordable hotel near Oxford St, with an old world charm, and we have lucked out here. Easy location at a great price.

500m from Bond St tube station, and the Oxford St shopping.
We spent days here. Would stay here again. ",5,2017,07,19
123,Very good location and Friendly Staff,"My favourite neighbourhood in London... very safe, lots of nice restaurants and very well located. The hotel is very clean and the staff very friendly. I highly recommend it and the common areas are very confortable.",5,2017,07,17
123,Great location and restaurant,"We enjoyed our stay here, it's so close to great shopping and walkable to attractions like the British Museum (noting that we are New Yorkers and used to walking and walking). I think my favorite aspect of the hotel is the restaurant, which serves wonderful food, in particular at breakfast and afternoon tea. We asked to go off-menu for the tea and just select the treats that we wanted, rather than getting a prescribed selection, and that made it a lot more affordable. They were able to accommodate a late checkout for us, which cost 60 pounds but was worth it to have the room available to us until we were ready to leave in the late afternoon. Their service is kind and considerate, I'd happily stay again.",4,2017,07,17
123,very well run hotel,"I have stayed at this hotel for over 20 years and can only compliment how the service and quality keeps improving!This is an exceptionally busy but well run hotel where the service is excellent.
Right from the welcome reception desk ,all the way through ,staff try to assist in any way to improve your experience at their hotel and the level of hospitality is high especially for a non family run hotel!
we were in a tiny room to start off but as soon as they were able they assisted to move us and to make our stay that much more comfortable. 
Antje especially tried her best to accommodate our needs as did all the others. The breakfasts too are very good and is well run.Many thanks and hope to see you soon.",5,2017,07,17
123,Great place to stay,"Stayed for business. location is 5 minute walk from Marble arch in the posh marylbone area. Great place to stay, very luxurious and very much worth you money. nice quiet rooms. breakfast there is also very tasty and fun to sit at and eat before your day.
the Gym is big and very well equiped and swimming pool is a bonus.",5,2017,07,14
123,Worth a visit or stay just for the atmosphere,"I haven't stayed in this property yet but had lunch outside 108 and have coffee inside the bar also. It's set in a beautiful part of the city and sitting outside the bar lets you enjoy watching the world go by. The service was great, food was excellent, coffee could have been nicer, but I'm fussy. :) 108 is a really nice bar where you don't feel like you're in a hotel at all. Great place to sit and spend an afternoon.",4,2017,07,13
123,Good place for coffee,I met some business contacts here for coffee and we were made to feel welcome. Some hotels are a bit snooty about just serving coffee but not the case here. We sat in the Juicery and thought the service was friendly and efficient. ,4,2017,07,13
123,London Weekend,"Booked this Hotel once again after previous visit a couple of years ago.Very well located.
The Hotel is lovely. Staff are very pleasant and courteous. 
Rooms very smart, clean and fresh.
We had Breakfast included in our booking. Plenty choice from buffet and Full fresh cooked Breakfast menu.
Viewed well equipped Gym & Swimming pool. (No thanks, on Holiday)
Bar 108 was lively, selling all drinks and cocktails.",5,2017,07,12
123,A friendly hotel in London.,"We have just had another most enjoyable stay at The Marylebone Hotel.  All the staff there are very friendly and helpful.  The hotel is well situated to walk to most of the main sights in London.  Although quite small the rooms are nicely decorated and the beds comfortable.  The turn down service in the evening with water and chocolates is a nice touch.  The buffet breakfast has a very good selection of food catering for all tastes. We will definitely stay here again next time we""re in London.",5,2017,07,12
123,Asbestos,"This hotel is in a converted mid-century office building.  There appears to be a large asbestos removal project going on in the basement of this hotel.  The unmarked construction site - an anomoly in London, where building sites are adorned with contactors' names and health and safety signage galore - runs the length of the building and workers wearing respirators are removing bags of material and loading them into vans belonging to an asbestos removal company.  No permits are on visible display. Had I known about this I would not have stayed here.",3,2017,07,12
123,Close to London Welbeck Hospital ,"I'd undergone day surgery at the London Welbeck Hospital and despite not needing an overnight stay at the hospital itself, I required somewhere nearby to stay overnight rather than travel immediately afterwards.

The Marylebone is just across the road from the hospital. My mother and I had a wonderful room which was incredibly comfortable and the staff were very friendly and accommodating, allowing us to stay in the room for an extra hour after the usual check out time under the circumstances, and due to our flight home to Guernsey from LGW not departing until early evening. Breakfast in bed was also very much appreciated! 

I'd highly recommend this hotel, and hope to return again (although preferably for a leisure visit next time!) ",5,2017,07,12
123,Good but could improve a little bit,"I like the location in a quiet area but close to the Oxford/Regent shopping district.overall good service. Some Rooms could be a bit narrow, especially some bathroom. More toilet products like cotton bud, comb, or shoe wax would be needed to avoid disappointing customers. Some rooms may be noisy due to adjacent service rooms. Air conditioning is not working in a satisfactorily manner. Last but not least waiting 10 minutes to get your keys due to some computer bugs. Hope that next experience will improve to continue visiting the place.",4,2017,07,11
123,excellent hotel,"We stayed here for 2 nights, the staff are so friendly and welcoming, especially Jack Mckie and Zan the doorman. Close to Bond Street tube station,and shops.I recommend the Marylebone hotel for business or pleasure.",5,2017,07,04
123,A lovely stay,"We have just returned from a weekend stay at The Marylebone Hotel and had a lovely stay. We were one of the many people who had booked the night to stay here as we were due to see Adele in concert. As we had booked a non refundable room we decided to still make the visit. Upon checking in the lady (Sujan Gurung) offered us a free upgrade. We mentioned how nice that would be following the cancelled concert, a horrendous journey to London and the fact that it was my birthday weekend. 

We checked into our room and 10 minutes later there was a knock on the door and a birthday card and a bottle of prosecco. It was a lovely surprise and very thoughtful.

The location of the hotel is great. Handy for the shops on oxford street and yet a nice village like feel. Lots of bars and restaurants nearby.

I would definitely recommend this hotel and if budget permits would like to stay here next time!!",5,2017,07,04
123,Events team at The Marylebone hotel delivers above and beyond,"I had a corporate event at the Courtyard in June and was absolutely blown away by the venue and the staff. Hannah, my operations manager for the evening was easy to work with and very flexible re my last minute requests and made my event run smoothly. Kevin was a pleasure to work with leading up to the event and on the day. He was always available when I had a question or a request and took care of us throughout the entire process of booking an event, menu tasting and on the day. We finished our event well over our booked hours and still received smiles from the staff that stayed behind. Above all, the customer service at the hotel was excellent and I am already looking to book more events later on this year.",5,2017,07,03
123,Unbeatable location but service and decor need a refresher ,"I have booked two rooms via Booking.com. The reception team was far from being friendly and ended up getting a room in a size of a shoe box. 
Only after having a scene at the reception, we have been moved to a normal double room, without having any assistance from the hotel staff. 

We had breakfast at the 108 Brassiere, wouldn't rate their Egg Benedict as ""special "" to the contrary, quite mediocre. 

The hotel room service team and maids are great and doing their job very well, but the hotel room needs urgently a new carpet and additional TLC. 

In summary, relativity a high price for the quality and performance. ",3,2017,07,02
123,Great Spot,"In London I always stay at the Marylebone.  It is hip without being overwhelming in a ""Las Vegas"" way (e.g. like the W).  Let's call it ""understated hip"".  The food is very good and the beds are very comfortable",5,2017,07,01
123,More of a business hotel,"The first look at this hotel you would think it's more suited for business travelers. However, my family with kids were still well taken care of. They set up a tippee tent in one of our connecting rooms and my kids were thrilled!

Breakfast were limited in choices but they were fantastic. I loved their portobello mushrooms and everything on their menu. 

Only negative point was probably that it's located about 10 mins walk away from bus stops and tube station. Not a major problem if you don't have kids, but good to stay near a tube station when you're in London.",5,2017,07,01
123,The Marylebone Team Continues To Impress,"We have stayed at The Marylebone Hotel a number of times and continue to be impressed.  Having stayed in numerous hotels in London and Marylebone, The Marylebone is our first choice by far.  The staff is always welcoming, most helpful and remember details about us from previous visits.  Jack Mckie, Assistant Front Desk Manager, is a stand out.  Jack goes out of his way to make our stay enjoyable and is alway eager to assistant with any questions or needs we may have.  During our last visit, he even popped outside to great us as we arrived in the taxi.

We have recommended The Marylebone to a number of friends and all always return with rave reviews.  Keep up the good work and high standards!!  We certainly will be back!",5,2017,06,30
123,Classy but expensive,Not been in here before but needed a reasonably quiet place for a business chat and the other pub I went to nearby was rammed. This place does all sorts of highly unusual cocktails including one with raw egg - and has a vast choice of optics.  We had cider which was nice but expensive.,4,2017,06,30
123,Absolutly great place to stay in! Super service!,"Super location, in the center, many tasty and cozy restaurants and bars around, good shopping street near by. The hotel has quite high service, individual approach,  good rooms! Everything you need!
We stayed several days with my friend who has a birthday! Front manager Jack Mckie helped to organized balloons and cake!!! And the bottle of prosecco was a present for us! Priceless surprise! )
Thanks for great memories!  
",5,2017,06,29
123,Excellent Hotel,"I could not recommend this hotel enough. We stayed there from the 22 -25 June for a special birthday and the staff really made it special.  Thank you Aurore, Brendan and Roberto.

Great location, only 5 mins walk to Bond St Station. Got a lovely quiet room on the 3rd floor and you would think you had the hotel to yourself.

We will be back again.",5,2017,06,29
123,Long weekend stay,"The Marylebone Hotel is a lively hotel situated in a quiet area yet it  Is a stones throw from Oxford Street, Regents Park and many other amenities.
This was our first visit and we were extremely satisfied and most impressed. We will be back again.
",5,2017,06,27
123,The Best Hotel in London- Hands Down!,"I recently stayed in the Marylebone and was so impressed with the hotel and the area. I have stayed in many hotels in London and can honestly say I won't be staying anywhere else from now on. The rooms were a perfect size and you can't hear other guests at all which is a rarity in London hotels! Having Aromatherapy Associates toiletries and cushioned slippers was a nice plus , as was the Nespresso machine. The food was amazing and we are both our breakfast and dinner in the 108 Brasserie. The staff were so professional and curteous and couldn't do more to help, especially Rebecca Conlon, who ensured we had the most perfect stay in London and to whom no job was too big or too small. It's perfect if you would like to stay in a quiet part of London but with easy access to more touristy areas. Bond Street is a 5 minute walk away, Oxford Street is 10 and there is easy access to the 74 bus route which takes you near Hyde Park, Marble Arch, Knightsbridge, V&A. I'm already looking forward to my next visit. This hotel is in a league of its own.",5,2017,06,26
123,Fabulous hotel for our wedding night,"We got married nearby at Asia House and spent the night at the Marylebone in one of their junior suites. We had stayed before and so glad we paid the extra for a suite – the difference is dramatic. The room was spacious, clean, cool and had a fantastic design. For the price, you get an awful lot. The staff are fantastic, really polite and helpful. The whole hotel décor is gorgeous, felt like a real gem. The breakfast is DELICIOUS and definitely worth getting up for!! Also note check in was from 2pm which was great – some hotels now you cant check in until at least 3pm, so was great for us to be able to get ready at the hotel. Thank you Marylebone hotel for making our wedding night feel that extra bit special!! We will be back!",5,2017,06,26
123,Great hotel,"Great staff, clean rooms, best food, near all the atraction.
Ask for RAHIM
The concierge and he and the rest of the staff all overthe hotel will give tipps and advices always with a smile and great energy.

",5,2017,06,25
123,Keeping with tradition,"Another business trip to London, another wonderful stay at the Marylebone Hotel. The staff was typically gracious and helpful. The facility is well located, clean and comfortable.
Special note to try out the bar at 108 - -  attentive and engaging bar tenders provide hospitality and informative guidance. Can't wait until the local gin still is up and running!!",5,2017,06,25
123,The Best Hotel in London for that price,"It's my 4th trip to London in 20 years, and this is the best one I've been so far , first the location, it's in a quiet corner of Oxford street, the room that I stay with my Mom was great , clean with a great facilities, the staff was so helpful and welcoming, that you could see that they really care about you , from the Doormen Roberto and Jean to the reception lady Maria L. If I'll return for the 5th time , I'm sure that I'll stay in here . ",5,2017,06,24
123,Another excellent stay,"Don't be put off by the small bedrooms everything else about this hotel fits the bill, great location just behind Oxford Street and on the edge of Marylebone village, public room are spacious and luxurious, bar on a hot June weekend was packed but always somewhere to sit, professional friendly staff just what you would expect from a Doyle Hotel, can't wait to go back",5,2017,06,24
123,Loved it!,"In the course of a 12 night stay, my partner and I went from saying ""we'll never stay here again"" to ""we'll never stay anywhere else"". Once we looked beyond the rather depressing narrow, dark corridors and rooms with somewhat dated carpets and sliggish plumbing, the rest was perfection. Staff is hugely accommodating... when the doorman says ""welcome back gents"" he really seems to mean it. We haven't been too many places where the restaurant maitre d' not only remembers you from week to week, but also asks if you want the same table! 
Morning breakfast service is just excellent both downstairs and in your room. One morning we ordered many individual items through room service, and two young women appeared with trays. 
We loved the cheery Irish housekeeper who does a great job tidying up the restaurant and lobby who would have a wee chat with us every morning. 
When our first room was a bit noisy ( there is currently some construction on one side ), the guest services manager met us, showed us two rooms, and said "" pick one "". We were moved within an hour, and a bellman did the heavy lifting!
We cannot recommend this hotel highly enough, you just will not find better value anywhere in London. Between the staff and the amazing location in a cool yet quiet neighbourhood, we can hardly wait to go back. Well done, team!!!",5,2017,06,22
123,Highly recommended,"Everything we had hoped for and more: great location but very quiet, lovely rooms, friendly staff that went out of their way to make sure we enjoyed our stay, delicious and extremly generous complementary breakfast. 
",5,2017,06,21
123,Engagement Party,"I recently had an engagement party in the Long Room at The Marylebone Hotel. When it came to planning the party, the staff made me feel like they cared about our big day. They were happy to answer our many questions and arrange multiple visits. 
On the night, the staff went above and beyond to help us set up. The drinks and canapés (which were generously sized) were beautifully presented and went down a treat. 
I highly recommend the venue, especially if you want to have an intimate and sophisticated party for a special event. Thank you, The Marylebone - in particular Rohini, Kevin and John - you made this an unforgettable night!",5,2017,06,21
123,Perfect Stay!,"My family 5 stayed for 5 nights and we could not have had a more enjoyable stay.  The staff was great and the room was very comfortable. Access to a full service fitness club was a huge plus as was the daily breakfast at 108.  The location of the hotel is perfect in the quaint section of Marylebone, but  close enough to the hustle and bustle.  The concierge and team was always ready to help to ensure a great trip.  I would definitely stay again when I am in London.",5,2017,06,20
123,London in Summer,"Lovely stay at the Marylebone,  we were quite impressed by the hotel, surroundings and all the hidden parts of the hotel we found the day before we left lol.
 Comfy rooms, staff was slow but great . Unfortunately we arrived early from a 7hr flight and they couldnt get us early check in, they said they were fully booked, no upgrades available either and the kind lady who checked us in did try.
Central to Bond and oxford street for all our chopping needs. Bond Statetion was literally less than 5 mins down the road, we walked everywhere. 
 London we will return!!",5,2017,06,19
123,Sizling Hot.,"I booked the hotel on recommendation of the company I work for. I was there 3 night in one week in two visits. 1 night in midweek and 2 nights over the weekend. 
The hotel is well situated in central London, off Marylebone High Street. Walking distance from Oxford Street shopping Mecca. I was welcomed as soon as I got off the taxi. Reception was efficient and quick. 
Got a room on high floor, renovated. The look and feel was contemporary. Bed was comfortable, and so the linen. The room (550) was tiny. It’s suitable for one night stay of a single person with a small overnight bag. 
Breakfast: Food variety is great. There is continental/British buffet or a la cart. My only reservation is the table’s size. Way too small for a single person. Let alone two.  
On checking out, knowing that I will be back for the weekend I asked reception to help, if possible, by allocating me a bigger room for my next stay. They said they will try. 
Upon arrival for the weekend stay, London was getting into a heat wave. Temperature was rising above 25c. I asked reception if they managed to get me a bigger room?  They confirmed it’s bigger. I sked them if the air-con is working? They conformed it is perfect.  
Room (625) was even smaller than the previous one. The air-con was working. Or at least it made a sound of working. I didn’t have much time to really check out the room until very late that night. By which time I realized it was clearly the tiniest hotel room I ever come across. The air-con was not coping with the room size and the rising outside temperature. Because of the time (past midnight) I didn’t bother. To add insult to injury, the shower didn’t work (broken tap). Due to the late hour there was no alternative room. (I was told the hotel is fully booked, upon arrival) By the way, the hand basin in this room is as small as the one you will find in an airplane toilette thus, it was an awkward shower experience after a long day in sizzling London. 
When I confronted reception about their false promises about the room’s size air-condition and the ill functioning shower, their initial reaction was kind of indifference. Ultimately, they agreed to move me to, “this time a bigger room” (583) for which, after spending the night in, I was grateful.
I must say that I really feel for the reception people. Clearly I am not the only guest complaining about the rooms’ size and the nonfunctioning air condition units. (see some of the other patrons’ complaints here). Apparently, the average room in this hotel is very small. Some are even smaller. Whoever runs this hotel, know they have an air-con problem and yet they don’t seem to sorting it out. The hotel is being promoted as a “boutique” with posh rooms etc. Yet only a few of their rooms meet the expectations of a guest in a boutique hotel at £250 a night. Coupled with summer rising temperatures it’s a disaster in the making which the people at reception have to sort out without any real solutions at hand. 
I’ll check out the reviews before making my forthcoming booking for London. It will take a lot of persuasions to get me back there.",3,2017,06,19
123,Good boutiquish hotel in great location,"We stayed at the Marylebone for 6 days in early June. First of all, the hotel is extremely pleasant and everyone has a great and very helpful attitude. My wife, who is a swimmer, really appreciated the (good sized) pool. The room we had was a corner room on the 7th floor, which was not big, but big enough for the 3 of us. The breakfast selection was good, with coffee and tea made to order. Perhaps it would be a good idea to vary the selection of items somewhat from day to day. The noise level in the bar/restaurant in the evening was the only complaint we had, but short of that, we had an extremely pleasant stay and will most definitely consider returning to the Marylebone.",4,2017,06,19
123,Close to Oxford Street,"The great thing is that the hotel is very close to Oxford Street and train station. You can walk anywhere from this point. It was 5 minutes away from my office so cannot complain. The hotel itself is ok - the corridors are narrow and very dark and to be honest i didn't feel comfortable walking to my room - too many dark corners! The room was alright for one person - but seriously shutters??? for a hotel of that standard! If you think you can sleep in - forget it. Was awake at 4am because of the light.
Got charged 5.50 pounds for a sachet of tea from the minibar.... usually these things should come for free. I think that was quite an exaggeration for 280 pounds per night.
Other than that, clean and friendly staff.",3,2017,06,18
123,Staff & Management,"Good helpful staff and a Manager who goes beyond the call of duty to resolve a minor issue.
A good size clean and pleasant room.  A real pleasure to get back to after a hot sticky day traipsing round the tourist spots of London.",5,2017,06,17
123,Very good hotel in the heart of London,"The Marylebone is in a fantastic location.  Just out of the very center of the main tourist traps which makes it perfect but possible to walk to almost everything.  Marylebone is a really cool neighborhood with beautiful houses, great restaurants and local pubs.  

Easy access to both Regents Park and Hyde Park which is great for walks and activities.

The hotel has all the amenities one could want, including free wifi.  The breakfast is Ok but better options if wonder into local cafes.",4,2017,06,17
123,Hotel stay ok but customer service very poor,"My overall stay experience was ok but what happened afterwards shows the poor customer service of the property. My invoice needs to be corrected (some data is missing) so I wrote several emails to hotel at marylebone@doylecollection.com. Nobody ever responded to my emails. So after two weeks waiting I started calling the hotel, I made several calls and each time I talked to someone else and each time I was promised to get a reply with a corrected invoice. No results. Finally I talked to a lady who responded to me saying that my invoice was corrected but she did not attach the invoice! I asked her twice again via her personal email and no reply since then..... What is wrong Marylebone????",3,2017,06,16
123,"Wonderful stay, amazing place","Stayed at the hotel this month for a special anniversary and the staff were fantastic. From the time we checked in we were looked after superbly. They were hospitable, the bedrooms have all the amenities you would want and the brassiere is vibrant, with delicious food and great wines.
Can't wait to come back again this year.",5,2017,06,16
123,Superb stay,"Delighted to park ourselves here with the family for an extended stay. Excellent hotel. The staff always eager to save and extremely polite. Excellent breakfast Buffett with great service. Room cleanliness perfect . Lovely lounges to relax and read. We are enjoying the stay and reccomend this hotel not only for what is already stated , but for its location. It is within walking distance from the Oxford street and the hotel us surrounded by some excellent restaurants. Thanks to all the staff.",5,2017,06,15
123,Strictly Arts & Traffic Hurricane Advertising & Marketing Event,"The Marylebone Hotel experience was truly excellent from start to finish. A lovely member of staff named Maria Balleste was an absolute pleasure to deal with as she was very kind and courteous throughout the whole experience of planning our event, booking the conference room, and bedrooms too. She is a real credit to the hotel.
A very well-mannered and lovely gentleman named Roberto greeted us on the door and politely carried our luggage.

Our whole business conference and room accommodation was first class and we would highly recommend everyone to choose this hotel for your stay in London, as it is also so close to all of the shops and amenities.

You will love the Marylebone hotel!",5,2017,06,14
123,The Amazing Marylebone Hotel our home away from home!,"We traveled for business and pleasure and could not have been happier with this boutique hotel. First the amazing Alicia Tjader took care of us before we even got there. We were staying for many weeks and I was concerned about a cramped hotel so she upgraded us and included the most amazing breakfast for us every day of our stay. Every morning we had the most incredible breakfast from an extensive and delicious menu sitting on the front red velvet couch overlooking beautiful Marylebone. The location could not be better in this cute, charming and central area to everything without the noise. We loved walking to fun restaurants and exploring the area all around us. One of the best parts of this hotel is this incredible gym, pool, sauna area it is part of a separate health club so that meant all classes, the amazing indoor pool was available to us every single day. The yoga classes were top notch to work off that amazing breakfast. The furnishings and decor were beautiful and they have this special outdoor area on the first floor and really great conference rooms for work with fireplaces. Every one from front desk, housekeeping, bellboys were so kind and most helpful to us. The only drawback would be a bit better concierge services that are more helpful and available. Overall with the larger room, supplying us with a refrigerator we needed for our stay, and the great service we will definitely return on our next stay. There are some great restaurants to try nearby include Ivy Cafe and Cavendish! Thank you Alicia, Garrett and the whole team at The Marylebone we can't wait to come back to our second home in London! Tip: And the rooftop penthouses are insane the patio cover opens up to the whole city!",5,2017,06,14
123,In the Heart of London,"This four star hotel is in Central London near everything. You can easily jump on the tube and get to any tourist destination quickly. The tube system is easy to figure out. The staff is over the top friendly and eager to give you anything you need. They allowed us to borrow two electric converters since we are from the US. It's about a 40 minute taxi ride from Heathrow Airport. However, if you don't have much luggage, you can take the Heathrow Express tube to Paddington Station then change lines and get here quicker. I don't recommend that, though, if you are dragging around a lot of luggage or if you have small children. We had a suite which as perfect for two adults and a teenager. ",5,2017,06,13
123,Miniature Rooms,"I've stayed in many London hotels at this price point. (Average of 330 pounds) When I arrived to my floor, I was a little wary ... the hallway was so claustrophobic it reminded me of a scene from ""Alice Through the Looking Glass,"" ... my head practically touching the ceiling. (I'm 6'2"", slim). The guest room continued with this theme, being the size of a large walk-in closet, with an unattractive shuttered window - like a kid's bedroom or something. I could barely squeeze myself in the chair at the computer desk, as it was right up against the bed. (I booked a standard Queen size bed room. I'm sure the upgraded rooms are larger.) The room had climate control, including air-conditioning. However, the way the room's designed, the cold air from the air conditioning would float down the wall to the one side of the bed and be cold too on one side of the room.

The amenities in the room we're fine. It was clean. I can't say it was the most attractive room in the world but not a disaster either. But luxury?  One of my pet peeves is when hotel room windows are not black-out  In the morning, light came through the seams in the shutters, lighting up the room. Not good if you're trying to sleep in past sunrise.  Luxury? The shower was the step-into-the-tub type, but had a personal cleaner and such.

The service in the hotel was very good, attentive staff, no long waits. No complaints there.

Room service food quality was questionable (based upon two dishes.) The Fish and Chips was acceptable. But the arugula salad tasted as if someone poured a salt shaker into it. I couldn't finish it. Yet the most shockingly bad choice was the pizza. I can say, without hesitation, it was the worst pizza I've ever had. You couldn't create a nastier pizza if you tried: cardboard-like dough with a smidgen of sauce and cheese. Even with added toppings, it was practically non-edible. Really, Marylebone?! I would sluff it all off if it were a cheaper hotel. But for a hotel which touts itself as being somewhat classy, I should have asked for a refund for the dish.

Location was off the beaten path on a quiet street. I walked out to see some things, and the hotel didn't seem to be too near any hubbub; which is either good or bad thing depending on what you're looking for. I tend to like places that feel more embedded in the action.

Again, I've stayed in many hotels in London, boutique and otherwise. For this price point, I would have a hard time recommending the Marylebone.",3,2017,06,13
123,Recommended!,"We had a wonderful time at this excellent hotel.  The spaces were beautifully designed and comfortable -- the hotel is ideally situated.  The service was great, especially Roberto -- the wonderful doorman --  who helped send us off.",5,2017,06,12

123,The Marylebone Hotel - our 5-Star Experience,"This is a revision of an earlier review:

After careful research and reading scores of TripAdvisor reviews, we selected to the Marylebone Hotel as our base in London for 5 nights; and were very pleased with our choice and experience.  For various reasons, we wanted to be to be relatively near all the typical attractions; close to the Paddington RR Station, Hyde Park, and Regents Park; yet far enough away from the downtown hustle and bustle to ensure some tranquility – and the Marylebone Hotel’s location met all of these needs.  

While not extravagant or outrageously expensive, the Marylebone Hotel is incredibly nice and comfortable with many outstanding amenities (pool, gym, laundry service, turn-down service, very good in-house dining choices, etc.).  Most rooms – as is typical in the UK – are a bit tight, so be willing to pay more for more space - our Deluxe Queen room was very comfortable, though not “large” by US standards. Our bathroom with a tub/shower was a bit cozy, but modern, clean, and very nicely appointed. Wi-Fi was very good. We wanted a hotel that would be a welcome respite after long, busy days of tourist stuff, and the Marylebone easily met that expectation. 

We found all staff at all levels to be universally competent, helpful and friendly, especially the doormen. There was one unfortunate situation with one staff member; which was handled exceptionally well by the Guest Relations Manager, Brendan Madden.  Mr. Madden contacted us after our initial review expressed dissatisfaction with this one incident, and went to great lengths to rectify the situation and to ensure that we were satisfied with the resolution. This was exceptional service from a hotel that genuinely cares about its guests. 

Overall, the Marylebone Hotel was a terrific experience and we will definitely stay there again if we return to London. A bonus surprise for us was stumbling in to Daunt Books on Marylebone High Street (perhaps a five minute walk).  If you enjoy perusing superb book stores, make sure to check it out!  

Room Tip: To ensure peace & quiet, ask for a room away from Welbeck Street and/or facing the center space of the hotel. Our center space 2nd floor room, near the rear of the hotel was very quiet and peaceful.

123,I am coming back,"Such a great hotel. Loved my stay here. The friendliest staff ever. Super polite and help full. Great rooms, very silent room with great beds. The gym is amazing, the breakfast buffe as well. I am definitely coming back again. Perfect walking distance to the city.",5,2017,06,11
123,Wonderful Hotel ,"We had a lovely stay at the Marylebone Hotel, lovely staff especially the Doorman Roberto. The rooms were impeccably clean and they offered several refreshments in our room. Will definitely visit again.  ",5,2017,06,11
123,Great Hotel with Great Service,The hotel is in more of a neighborhood area so away from the busy parts of town but still has several great restaurants and walkable to many sights. Our room was spacious and very comfortable. The service was great from all of the staff. ,5,2017,06,07
123,Good stay,"Stayed here after eye surgery in Harley street and the staff could not have been more helpful.
Highly recommended beautiful hotel and lovely spa. 
Great location for lots of attractions and near to the beautiful Regent's Park.",5,2017,06,07
123,Such a relaxing and special hotel for a visit to London,"My sisters and I booked this hotel based on TripAdvisor reviews and were not disappointed. The price is pretty moderate and the location was perfect for us because we wanted to shop and stay in a quieter area since  we had been to London a few times and had done most of the tourist things.   The public spaces are so comfortable with couches and intimate seating areas. The attached bar, The 108 ,was so classy and the special drinks and the fun way they were served was very special.. We had happy hour drinks there almost every day and even snagged an outdoor table one day. The rooms themselves were not very big but were very comfortable with wonderful bedding and had all the special amenities like Nespresso coffee makers with a shortbread cookie added every day and a chocolate every night. The only downside is that our views from our two rooms were  brick walls. It did not bother us that much since we were only there at night and it was very quiet for London. There were just so many little extra touches that made this such a special place. I also have to mention the wifi. You did not have to jump through any hoops to get it set up and never had to reenter info like you do at so many hotels. It just worked easily and flawlessly all week.
The staff could not have been more customer focused. A special call out to the concierge Rahim who was so helpful when booking our transportation to the hotel and responded so quickly to email questions we had before our visit. Once there, he found us great restaurants, knew where the best place was for high tea, and kept his eye on us all week to help us however he could. We also had a great experience and some pleasant conversations with Brenden and Vlad who always acted like they were not too busy to spend a couple minutes chatting when you knew they were really very busy. Everyone in the hotel went out of their way to be pleasant and you could tell it was sincere.
We all agreed that we will be going back to The Marylebone on our next visit.",5,2017,06,06
123,Amazing boutique hotel,Highly recommend this hotel.  Rooms are wonderful compared to others we have experienced in London.  Location is fantastic.  The service received across the board was exceptional. Will definitely return.,5,2017,06,05
123,INCREDIBLE hotel and staff--highly recommended.,"This was one of my favorite hotel experiences across all of my world travels. The hotel has a stylish and comfortable vibe, with all sorts of thoughtful perks like bowls of fruit, a nespresso machine, a nice pool and steam room, full gym with classes included, and delicious sheets and bedding. The hotel is luxurious while still retaining a relaxed feeling.
The staff were INCREDIBLE, kind and warm and helpful at every turn--even more, their kindness feels truly genuine. Enji at the bar downstairs is the most welcoming bartender you can imagine, and he and the rest of the crew will make you feel at home with their humor and excellent service (plus they have great wines). Zivile the duty manager is also exceptional at her job.
 I agree with other reviews that this feels like a 5-star hotel. Go for it.",5,2017,06,05
123,I'll be back soon ,"Excellent room , excellent service and staff will be back soon , this was my second stay at the marlebone sadly I was only there for 3 nights but I would recommend this hotel to anyone . The hotel is close and central to many shops and stations ",5,2017,06,05
123,Very nice hotel in a very cool area of London,"The hotel is very nice and in a very cool area of London. We had 2 communicating rooms and had an excellent stay, with several complimentary beverages, fruit, etc. 
A special mention is to the doorman Roberto, very kind and nice!",5,2017,06,05
123,Very nice...very convenient but not as close to Tube as expected...,Great facility all around.  Rooms can be a bit crowded but comfortable enough given that you'll be out most of the day.  Only drawback is the 7-10 min walk to the Underground Station.  It was a lovely warm and sunny walk 10 minute walk when we did it but I could imagine it would be pain if it were raining.  Otherwise a good stay.,4,2017,06,05
123,A 5 star hotel or at least it should be!!! Highly recommended! Memorable weekend!,"Classy! Crispy Clean! Stylish! Location was perfect! Welcoming staff! Friendly! Quality bedding!

I booked this for my husbands birthday as a surprise. We loved our experience from the moment we walked into the lobby. We were greeted by a very pleasant and professional guy, Fabrizio Incardona. He was clearly spoken and met my requests as i asked for extra things for the room. The staff made our stay very special including surprising gifts in our room for my husband and a card written by Fabrizio which shows how important it is to the hotel to provide special touches for their visitors. This hotel is very, very generous and nothing is too much effort and the quality of food and drink is very good, they do not skimp! The location is absolutely perfect, the area is quiet and classy with only a 2 minute walk from Bond street. We had free parking literally across the road as we arrived after 6.30 on a Saturday evening. You get what you pay for and more and i will not bother with another hotel in future!! Please give this hotel a chance. I was looking at 5 star hotels for weeks for my husbands birthday and my god was i glad to find this hotel!! It does not matter of the room size, if your in London what are you doing staying in a hotel room all day?! I had the standard room and it was a perfect size. Photo's does not do it justice, its better in person!!! Thank you so much to all the staff and the quality of service you provide. We cannot wait to return.",5,2017,06,04
123,Lovely and inviting,"Stayed for 2 nights in October 2016. It was my 5th stay and won't be my last. The staff deserve high praise for their friendliness and warmth upon arrival and throughout the stay. As always it was a pleasure to see Gunther again who made a point of asking how our rooms were when he saw us (he wasn't working when I checked in) as well as welcoming me back, and generally being concerned (as all the staff are) that I was enjoying my stay. A colleague of mine was also staying there (on my recommendation) and she received the same friendly treatment when she checked in. The staff never seem rushed and make time to ask how you're doing, how your visit is going, and if you need anything. You really feel well taken care of when you're there. 

The hotel itself is lovely - they do a good job making the small (lease expensive) rooms comfortable and the spacious public areas are equally comfortable and always incredibly tidy; they never seem worn. The tea and coffee in the mornings in the lobby along with papers is a lovely start to the day. My young daughter's favorite thing is to come down in the evening after a long day running around and ask for chamomile tea to sip while we read in the lounge. It's lovely!

The gym (3rd space) is a complete gym, not at all a hotel gym, so you can get an excellent workout or even take a class if that's your thing. The gym is clean and I've not seen it very busy in the mornings. The sauna and steam room are great if you can find time to use them, as is the pool (kids are able to use the pool during select hours). 

Highly recommend - we stay here every visit we make to London!",5,2017,06,04
123,Great Hotel & Location,"EXCELLENT staff, everyone was helpful. The room was very small but nice and cozy. They have a nice gym, spa and a lap pool. The hotel is close by to the tube (Central & Jubliee lines) so easy to get to Canary Wharf for work. The doorman who greeted us upon arrival was awesome and he recommended a café called Ivy which is walking distance from the hotel. Would definitely go back.

There is a lovely pool and sauna, hotel is spotless and the rooms have everything you would need plus more. 

We ate dinner and breakfast at the hotel which was nice and reasonably priced. 

I would highly recommend this hotel and would definitely return. 

Well done to all the hardworking and lovely staff.  ",5,2017,06,03
123,Excellent staff,"Lovely hotel, our stay was enhanced by the fantastic attitude of the staff, typified by Rama and Prosper at the door. 
The gym facilities were great. Room lovely and spotless. Air con was broken in our room but we were relocated and offered an upgrade. ",5,2017,06,01
123,Faultless,"This hotel is an exquisite gem in the heart of the fashionable and convenient Marleybone area, close to the High Street filled with wonderful stores, patisseries and restaurants.
The Marylebone Hotel stands out for always getting it right, of course due to the fantastic staff whose customer service is always effortless, offering exemplary service, which is why we are so loyal to the Marylebone.
Jack you are amazing, you know where to get everything and where to go, unique places always and ofcourse the best places to eat, you are always so efficient and enhance our stay immensely.
Rahim and Raos, you are the quintessential concierge team, never leaving anything undone. Rahim your suggestions are always spot on, your efficiency in arrangements and reservations is always appreciated, and of course your friendship.
Brandon thank you for so efficiently arranging a wonderful dinner at the Kensington for us, you are always there to answer questions and take care of all the fine details so capably.
This hotel is  a combination of a great British tradition with a modern twist, which gives this hotel the edge.
The dining room offers wonderful food, I especially enjoy the healthy indulgent breakfasts served by our favorite waiter Julian.
Julian you certainly contribute to making our stay so special taking such personal and excellent care of us always, knowing EXACTLY we want to order even before we tell you.You are by far the best server in London.
The gym is fitted out with a wonderful selection of machines, likely one of the best exercise facilities in a hotel in London, and is part of a health club, also including an indoor pool.

We are very loyal to the Marylebone because of people like Rebecca Conlon who always takes such incredible care of us, your efficiency always is so appreciated and keeps us returning to the Marylebone.",5,2017,05,31
123,Professional service,"Both my wife and I are Hilton gold members. However the reason why we picked this hotel was due to myself having an operation at the London clinic. The hotel is very close to the clinic. Also, I had to attend the clinic for treatment over a 3 week period and as we are not from London my wife and I stayed 7 times at the hotel throughout the 3 week period. We found it to be a lovely clean modern professional run hotel and also close to many attractions and major shops like Selfridges, etc. Arriving at the hotel you are greeted by a friendly smartly dressed doorman ready to take your bags and open the door for you. The reception staff come across also freindly and for us were always were willing to help or advice you with anything you need. The first room we had was nicely decorated with a good size bathroom. However as the room was too close to the staff lift and staff cubbard we thought it was a bit noisy from early morning. On our other stays we asked for a quite room away from the lifts which we got without a problem, although the bathroom was a little smaller than our first one, but was still okay for us. In every hotel we stay at, have our breakfast and evening meals to the room. We prefer this as it's more relaxing and easy for us, as we find getting up out of bed and have your breakfast there in the room is a treat. We both work very hard all week, rushing madly around in our business, so yes it's a big treat for us. All the food, even the milk and, butter etc, we found was covered over, however in many other hotels they don't seem to do this. This is something I really think should be done, especially if you pay and stay in 4 and 5 star hotels. Well if you think about it, who wants a waiter especially if they have a bit of a cold coughing or sneezing onto your food when bringing it on a tray to the room. What stood out for me apart from the being in a splended modern hotel was the friendly and professional service we recieved from the assistant front desk manager when learning I was attending the clinic. Nice one sir (Jack Mckie). The only mistake I am sorry for, was on my very last trip to the clinic was we decided to stay at the Hilton Double tree as we were also meeting friend who lived close by. Even though we are hilton gold members, but never again, for it's back to Marylebone for us.",5,2017,05,31
123,Loved this place,"Newly renovated. Centrally located at 5 minutes walk from Oxford street (Bond station).  The room is spacious, newly furnished. Carpets are new. Good amenities. Friendly staff. Even though I didn't get the impression that the bathroom has been part of the renovation, it was in a very good condition with no complaints whatsoever. I definitely recommend it and would stay there again. ",4,2017,05,30
123,Perfect Hotel in a perfect location with perfect stuff!,"The hotel is perfect located in a beautiful area not too far from the shopping hot spot oxford street and perfect to visit the main sights in London. The Hotel restaurant and the breakfast are perfect, too! Especially we have to say that the stuff – ALL the STUFF – are so friendly, accommodating and attentive! Special thanks we want to say to Maria L. from the reception and to Jean the portier – they always took care of our well-being and had many recommendations for us! We can recommend 100 % this hotel",5,2017,05,30
123,Top class hotel!! ,"After much research I booked the Marylebone hotel for my husbands 40th birthday break. The hotel did not disappoint in any aspect of my stay, it was first class. The staff were lovely, especially Brendan for arranging prosecco & cake in our upgraded room! I could not fault anything from check in, to our beautiful room, breakfast, service, cleanliness, pool etc. The hotel was a stones throw away from Oxford street which was so handy.  I will definitely stay here again if I'm ever back in London and will recommend to family & friends. ",5,2017,05,29
123,Home away from home,"We spent 5 days here and was just great. Front office was very kind and helpfull. Continental breakfast was very good, and sevice was freindly. delux room was tidy clean and good size. Location is 7 min walk to oxford st. What more do you need?

123,Air conditioning failure on hottest day of the year,A very smart hotel - liked decor and buzzy bar. Great breakfast especially the healthy juice smoothies. However room very small and when the air conditioning went out it made for a horribly sticky evening. I understand these things happen however I was not even asked how my stay was on departure so decided to email the hotel on 25 May (still not had a response). Disappointed,2,2017,05,28
123,Two Miserable Room Experiences,"Arrived for a four-night stay in late May 2017. Our room was not ready at check-in time...delayed for two hours and assigned an upper level room. The temperature in the room was absolutely sweltering and there was no functioning air conditioning system to our room. The next day we were moved to a second level room. It was every bit as undesirable—located directly over the hotel bar with a thumping bass beat that shook the floor of our room, keeping us awake until the bar closed. The staff was helpless and largely dismissive when asked to address either of these problems. As the hotel was sold out, no alternative lodging was arranged for us. 

On the plus side the neighborhood is great and the food in the brasseries was quite good. At the same time the breakfast buffet in the restaurant was underwhelming and the reception desk was in perpetual disarray. Overall, would strongly recommend against booking a room at this hotel. Simply miserable experience.",1,2017,05,27
123,Very helpful staff ,"Great service from Rahim the amazingly helpful concierge. Food good, in a very pleasant part of London. Room can be a bit noisy. It was a difficulty time as they were having air con problems but every did their very best in difficult circumstances.

123,Lovely hotel in Marylbone,"One of my favorite hotels in Central London. Clean and nicely decorated rooms, lovely swimming pool, good restaurants and very professional, nice and welcoming staff. The hotel has a very good location, as it is situated close to Oxford Street, but at the quite street, which makes the stay very comfortable as there is not much noise around; at the same time it is a walking distance to majority of London attractions.",5,2017,05,26
123,Rahim the concierge is very pleasant and efficient,I was extremely relieved when Rahim the concierge found me a solution to bring my children to the Harry Potter museum.  I had previously went on-line and unfortunately there were no tickets available.  Certainly with his magic wand he was able to find me tickets for my family - we had a fantastic time.  My boys were able to have fond memories of their 7th birthday :),5,2017,05,26
123,"Must, must, must stay here. ","Location = perfect 

Hotel = stunning. 

Restaurant (108) = heavenly

Location-
First and foremost, the area that the hotel resides is fantastic. Really popular buzz and great energy in the city. 10-20 minute walk to Regent Park, steps to the best boutique shopping in the city, and so many great restaurants. 

Hotel & 3rd Space gym- 
Stepping into the hotel I was in awe of the beautiful tiled floor.  The design of the lobby continues into the guest rooms. Bright and airy, the suites offer a Mary Poppins London chimney view and are enormous per London standards. 

The suite I was in has its own terrance with a retractable walls and roof. Such a treat!  The weather was beautiful while in the city but I want this for my home on a rainy day. I looked out over the city and thought this is worth every penny I paid! 

Oh and the gym!  After my over indulgence at the hotel restaurant I needed a workout. I expected a standard hotel gym and was shocked with how amazing their gym is. It's huge and even has an Olympic sized swimming pool. 

108- 
This is a must try even if you're not staying at the hotel. Reservations are a must!  I tried a variety of items on the menu but you have to try the crispy pork cheeks!  To die for. I was a little hesitant because of the name but am so happy I took their recommendation to try them. #heaven. 

The bar: be sure to try their bespoke gin.  I've never been to a restaurant that has their own gin (made by the team at the hotel) but I was lucky enough to get to see it in process at their bar. The French Martini is absolutely spectacular. 

I can't wait to go back to this hotel... and try a few more cocktails. ",5,2017,05,26
123,Wonderful stay at The Marylebone!,"We had a wonderful stay at the hotel.  Location was great, in a quiet, quaint neighborhood, with tons of amenities within 5 minutes walking distance.  Close to Bond Station which is a fairly large tube station connector to multiple lines.   The room is a bit on the ""cozy"" side, but to be expected for Europe!  Staff were great, very friendly and helpful! Would definitely stay here again!  Thank you Marylebone staff for a wonderful and memorably stay and vacation!",5,2017,05,25
123,Great location and staff,"After doing some research I found this hotel as it had a great central location within the massive city of London. You are within walking distance of Oxford St, Hyde Park, Marble Arch, and Regent St which can provide access to Piccadilly Square and Leicester Square. The rooms were slightly small but that is to be expected in London. Outdated A/C system and key card access for lights to power to the room.",4,2017,05,25
123,Appallingly badly managed hotel - avoid at all costs.,"A hotel management shows it mettle when things go wrong. I stayed here for three nights during which the air conditioning was broken turning the rooms into claustrophobic ovens. The windows here open just a crack so no ventilation is possible although loads of street noise does come through. We were not warned of the problem on arrival - there was just a pre printed note on the desk when we got to the room. Staff at the front desk had no idea when the problem might be fixed. No effort was made to offer a fan or to hire any portable a/c units. No one even apologised let alone offered a refund or alternative accommodation. Three boiling hot nights of no sleep. Whoever runs this hotel (I never found out as each time I went to reception they were hiding, letting the hapless front desk staff take the flak) should be fired immediately. I for one will never come back to a hotel where management is so openly careless of the well being of their guests.",1,2017,05,24

On arrival our room was not ready but we were very kindly offered to sit back and relax and enjoy a complimentary cocktail. 
The 108 bar is hip and trendy with a great talented fun team of bartenders and a great vibe especially on a Saturday night they have a DJ belting out some great tunes creating a great atmosphere. 
The 108 Brasserie providing us with delicious breakfasts each morning with a great choice of hot and cold food.

123,A convenient Location,"I was there in May, in between the trip, I need to head off somewhere for a short visit. They allowed me to leave my luggages behind which was helpful. In the middle of one night, I was not feeling well, the service staff at the reception helped me to call for medical profession without any delay and saved my life. I was very grateful. No doubt, I will stay in this hotel again if I am in London again. The location is good, the room is big and comfortable. Only it looked as if the fridge is locked, one could not use it freely, as I need to put my medication into the fridge but it was locked. I asked the hotel staff, they automatically unlocked it, but it looked as if once is opened, there a small  charge per day even I did not consume any drinks inside the fridge. This was a bit strange. Other than this, I like this hotel.",4,2017,05,21

123,Very pleasant stay,Stayed here for three days whilst having a short break in London.  All staff that we met were friendly and courteous and could not have done more to be helpful.  It is an expensive hotel but you get what you pay for and I feel we got good value for money.  The room was comfortable and well appointed and the public areas of the hotel very pleasant.  I would stay here again for all these reasons but also as it is so well positioned for central London.  Marylebone is a lovely area and it was a pleasure to be there.,5,2017,05,20

Special mention to Maria Ramon who was on the front desk & offered us very helpful advice & was such a pleasure to talk to. The doorman won't let you down either with their service.  We had breakfast at the hotel which wasn't included but just paid for it daily & the manager at breakfast was ever so helpful & friendly also. The only small issue we had was that we were given 2 bottles of water every night & at no time were we informed that we would have to pay for them so it would have been nice to have been told there was a charge.

The most exciting thing for me was the gym that was adjoined to the hotel. As a keen fitness buff, any hotel that has modest exercise facilities gets top marks .... but this one blew my socks off.
The Restaurants were reasonable priced.",4,2017,05,17
123,Perfect!,"I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights in April. From check in to check out the service was exceptional. My room was spotless and the area is beautiful and within walking distance of Oxford Street, although there is no need to go far as the bar and restaurant offer some wonderful choices for a light lunch or an evening meal. The staff were amazing. Looking forward to my next stay already!",5,2017,05,17
123,Great drinks in 108,"Stayed here a few times but hadn't been for a drink since the first time. Had a old fashioned in the bar. Was possibly the best. Rooms were nice as per usual. Will be back for an old fashioned again sometime. 

Also I must say. The food is nice there too 
",5,2017,05,17
123,4 day 5 night stay,"The not so good bits, be aware that there a few charges for the water and surcharges which aren't explained.

The Marylebone is just a great place to stay in London, it is close Oxford street, it close to some great eateries and close to the tube but these are not the reasons for it being great.

The service is exceptional from the moment you alight from the taxi, the doormen, Ramon and others are just brilliant, when you enter the men helping with your luggage cannot do enough and are friendly without being cloying, the Concierges and reception staff are equally helpful, Maria was just plain helping no matter the issue. The lady that cleaned our room 823 was equally great at her task.

The rooms are clean, spacious enough for a great stay, the coffee machine is a good thing given the English still cannot make coffee properly.

It was a great experience for us and finished our holiday off brilliantly, Thank you to all the staff",5,2017,05,15
123,Very nice hotel,"Me and my family stayed here for three nights. Staff friendly and helpful. Good location. Rooms clean and fresh. Breakfast very good. Food and drinks in 108 Bar and restaurant was very good. Nice pool to swim in although my son was to young to come with us in the evening. Very helpful doorman that immidiately called and checked our airport-transfer when they didn't show up on time. Thanks for that!! 
If coming back to London, we would like to stay here again.",5,2017,05,15
123,Small room with noisy surroundings,"I had no choice as this is the designated hotel chosen by the company. I was assigned a room on the 1st floor, right at the very end of the corridor. The room was directly above 108 Brasserie and on the outside was a small lane with busy restaurants. There was never a quiet night during our 4 nights stay, and at our last night someone was drilling the wall (or was doing construction works) in the middle of the night.
Our toiletries were only replaced at the last day, including the bottled water.

The only good thing about this hotel is the staff - they are all friendly.",2,2017,05,15
123,My favorite hotel - location can't be beat,I travel A LOT for work and this is one of my favorite hotels. The location is so central from multiple tube lines and most of the rooms are so well updated. Each time I've stayed I've had views looking out into the quaint high street which is the most adorable neighborhood in London. Most folks don't know about it but locals do so the boutiques and restaurants nearby after always packed and lively but the rooms don't get that noise.,5,2017,05,14
123,Tiny Room With Brick Wall Views,"I'm not one to post bad reviews but felt compelled having been charged £200 for a view of a brick wall from this miniature room. 

Limited natural light. A little disappointing given the beauty of the surrounding Marylebone area. Stay elsewhere! ",2,2017,05,14
123,Conference week,"I stay in many hotels around the UK and often aboard, My preference is normally small bespoke hotels as they tend to offer the best welcome, service and individually. However I can highly recommend the Marylebone. The hotel is a haven in central london, the service is friendly and welcoming from the guys on the door to the front desk, in particular Antje (angie) and the team in the breakfast room and the bar. 
Great Location for shopping, theatre and great restaurants abound. Great drinks selection in the 108 bar, big breakfast buffet and always with a smile. Have a great stay.",5,2017,05,13
123,Fancy hotel at a great location,"The hotel is just a couple of minutes walk from Oxford st. I really recommend visiting the gym and the locker rooms, they are top notch! The hotel staff is really friendly and the rooms are clean and modern. ",5,2017,05,12
123,tiny perfect spot,"This is a beautiful little hotel in a lovely serene location. It's a short walk to little shops. pubs, Oxford street, huge parks, or TWO subway lines. It also has a super, cool gym below, which is key because our room was actually so small (for us as a couple-- would be ok for one person) that i showered and did my hair at the gym every morning. This was the only problem with our experience, and I do realize that rooms are small in London so it's not atypical. The staff is lovely and helpful and  the bar is gorgeous with super cocktails. I'd recommend it!",4,2017,05,11
123,Central and bright,"Happy with my choice of hotel.
Room
Big, comfortable bed, bright room, nice smell.
Staff
Helpful and really good with my abysmal travel knowledge around London.
Food
Breakfast was a good one, we ended up eating all over the place.
I would stay here again because I now know how to get to a couple of places, good price and just because I liked it.",5,2017,05,09
123,Very welcoming to children! Even rambunctious ones!,"We were treated to a weekend stay at The Marleybone to the great delight of our children (4 and 7), who received a war, attentive welcome which included teddy bears, coloring books, lots of smile--and most importantly to my son, a visit from the in-house tooth fairy! Without exception, staff were friendly and helpful.",5,2017,05,09
123,Amazing service from the manager and concierge Rahim,"We stay at The Marylebone Hotel on a regular basis with the Brix and Bailey team and we are never disappointed. On this occasion the hotel manager and concierge were unbelievably helpful and we could not have been more appreciative. The manager changed our room to a quieter room as we had a meeting which was perfect. 

We were expecting a parcel from DHl to be delivered but it was delayed. Rahim the concierge sorted the problem out and our box was delivered with an hour to spare before our meeting...fantastic service!

This hotel is a great location and the staff and incredibly attentive and helpful....we will always return and would highly recommend it as a central London hotel to stay at if you are looking for style, comfort and the all important service.",5,2017,05,09
123,"Great place, great team","Top class of hotel in Marylebone with a very professional team.
Great service and great location. Worth the money.
Was a great experience due to quality of the staff. My room was quiet. 108 Brasserie is a top place.",5,2017,05,09
123,Great service,Great service especially from the front desk and Concierge Jack was superb. Room was good for central London and the coffee area was good service and great for meetings i need to do. Location is great and thanks to the team,4,2017,05,08
123,20th Wedding Anniversary,"We stayed at the Marylebone for one night and overall had a really nice stay. We were pleasantly greeted by courteous door staff and the receptionist was polite, quick and helpful. Our room was clean, well equipped and very spacious (Superior Double with King Size).
A complimentary bottle of prosecco and some cake was a pleasant surprise and was thoroughly enjoyed!! The pool and gym facilities were very good too although could be better signposted. Breakfast was very tasty but here's the only minor point - service was a bit chaotic and it was expensive. This included an unexpected service charge.
Would definitely stay again for a special occasion but would either breakfast elsewhere or be more careful when ordering/paying. A big thanks to all the staff though for a pleasant stay.",4,2017,05,08
123,"Good location, small rooms, too many faults in the room","The hotel itself is okay, the service at the front desk also good, but with a broken toilet and bulb which were never resolved, the cheap toiletries and the size of the room I would spend your 260GBPs on a different Hotel, or only stay if you get a cheap rate.",3,2017,05,06
123,recent stay,"We recently stayed at this hotel over a family holiday, traveling from the U.S.  The continental breakfast included daily was great.  The people working at the hotel went above and beyond to make our stay outstanding.  We had a problem with our football tickets and the Concierge, Raheem resolved the issue in spectacular fashion.  This hotel is truly a hidden gem that we will strongly recommend to anyone traveling to London.  Keep up the great work!",5,2017,05,01
123,Delightful place,"This is a wonderful place, well-run. The food and service are excellent and faultless.
I've not been fortunate enough to stay in the hotel yet, but have taken afternoon tea and had evening drinks in the bar. The afternoon tea is lovely, with fresh scones and good gluten-free options which is refreshing. The gluten-free scones I had today were fresh and warm.
The hotel is a modern building, tucked away in a side street off Marylebone Lane, but it's well-designed and the place appears to be faultless. Very comfortable, and excellent service.",4,2017,05,01
123,Don't judge a book by its cover,"The outside of the hotel resembles a 1970's office block, the inside however is a different story altogether.
The hotel is comfortably and tastefully furnished; the rooms immaculately clean, and perfectly spacious; the bed wonderfully comfortable, and the bathroom, complete with bath, well equipped, modern and a suitable size.
I particularly liked the dressing gowns and complimentary slippers.
The hotel is ideally situated for access to central London.
We had a slight problem with the key cards, but this was quickly rectified, and I was disappointed about the limited quantity of coffee. There was lots of choice, but only 2 sachets and 2 capsules of caffeine coffee, and 3 small pots of milk between 2 although I suspect I could have asked for more.
The staff are delightful and so accommodating, without being stuffy. I think the room is quite expensive, but I'm not an expert in London prices, so I suspect our deal actually offered very good value for money.
Great stay.",4,2017,05,01
123,Lovely stay.,"Me and my partner stayed here for the first time last week, and we weren't disappointed. Check-in was very quick, and even though our room was small it was very luxurious with clean towels and free tea, coffee and shortbread. As my partner won the stay in a competition through his work, the hotel staff delivered us a handwritten note and complimentary apples. We also had breakfast included, which was lovely and service was quick. On check-out we were ignored for a couple that turned up after us, which angered us. Apart from that though, we'd gladly stay here again in the future.",4,2017,04,30
123,Great service & stay,"The hotel is located in a lovely area. Walk distance from main shops and great restaurants options. Also good connections with public transports. The room is amazing for a reasonable price. All staff were kind and attentive with an extra complement for the doorman. Anytime with a big smile. The manager, Brendan was friendly and helpful. Definitely my place to stay for the next time.",5,2017,04,30
123,Ideal Hote for a West End Stay,Great hotel in an excellent west end location. Excellent staff who make you feel welcome and always very helpful. The bar has transformed over the past 5 years from a boring hotel bar to a happening and lively place.,4,2017,04,30
123,"Consistency, luxury and service","I've been coming to The Marylebone mainly for business for more than 2 years and the hotel never disappoint. The hotel is in an exceptional location making it easy to both work or leisure. From the welcoming greeting by the gentlemen at the door to the always smiling and polite cleaning team the staff are there to reassure you'll have a great stay. Often luxury place like this make you feel intimidated, but thats not the case here. The rooms are outstanding! Comfortable, high standard and spacious. I couldn't recommend enough",5,2017,04,29
123,Little piece of heaven ,"We stayed here for a Saturday night at the theatre in London. Really smooth check in, luxurious lobby and reception area. Got in our room and it was exactly as described. For London sometimes you pay over the odds for a decent room, but here it was absolutely worth the cost. The hotel has a spa which we didn't get the time to use, but it looks very impressive. I will return here and will definitely go to the spa! If you fancy a high end meal, L'Autre Pied is just across the road and the hotel also has a bar and brasserie in house which was very busy, so must be good! Overall this was early good value for money and I will 100% return, can't wait!",5,2017,04,28
123,Outstanding concierge service Rahim has very good advice about restaurants near your theater,"A first rate hotel in a lovely area at a reasonable price.  The restaurant is very good It  serves nice food cooked well Service is very good.
The staff in all departments is very attentive and courteous.",5,2017,04,25
123,Impeccable Service & Stay,"Had a fantastic stay in the hotel which is optimally located in the heart of london. The rooms were clean and very comfortable. A special thanks to Brendan and Zivile for your help, you guys were great. Look forward to coming back soon",5,2017,04,25
123,Incredibly helpful staff,"Aurore Civel, the Assistant Guest Relations Manager, could not have been more helpful. She dealt with my enquiry swiftly and professionally, making sure I was made to feel welcomed and valued. Thank you Aurore!",5,2017,04,24
123,Lovely staff but shop around for price,"We had a lovely two-night stay this weekend. Short, level, walk from Bond Street or there are taxis permanently stationed outside.

The room we had was very functional. Not huge but space for everything. It was nice and quiet which is a big plus for this area.

Nice features like the bathrobes and slippers too.

Slight annoyance with the tea/coffee making in that there are three milks but with two tea bags and three coffee pods if felt very slightly penny-pinching. That really is the only thing I can think of that wasn't perfect.

Do look around for prices though as there is some variation and if you have evidence of cheaper pricing the hotel will match it so that is a big plus.

Breakfast at £26 each we felt was too much so we ate elsewhere.

Well recommended hotel.",5,2017,04,24
123,Marylebone Hotel & Village,"Being close to Paddington Station was the prerequisite for out trip to Cornwall ....our wonderful travel consultant Laura Madrid from ResortToLauraMadrid.com introduced us to the Marylebone Village and the Marylebone Hotel. We loved them both ...equally! The hotel staff was very professional and warmly welcoming... our room very modern and comfortable. The village was unique and quant right in the heart of London ....a haven for shopping,food and Culture- Divine!",5,2017,04,23
123,Excellent hotel with excellent service,"I had the pleasure of staying at the Marleybone for both a personal and business trip. I stayed about 3 weeks last July, and then again in March 2017 and I can't say enough good things about this place.   It's large enough to provide the amenities business travelers are looking for, but small enough to feel homey and comfortable.   My room was fabulous- clean and spacious, with a lovely turn down every night.  The breakfast in the morning was fabulous; plenty of options for both the busy business traveler and the lounging tourist.   The staff was unfailingly polite and really do go out of their way to be helpful.",5,2017,04,23
123,Marvellous ,"This is one of the best Hotels ever. The Service is excellent, the room a dream, Pool/Gym absolut gorgeous, Breakfast (we had everything included) delicious - you have a buffet or you can order a la carte. 
We stayed in London for my husbands Birthday and I asked before our arrival, if we can have a room with a view. (Thanks to Aurore for the assistance and the prompt answers to all my emails) And when we arrived, they gave us a free upgrade in a deluxe Room! But that's not all: in the room was a gift: Champagner and  delisious cake and strawberrys!!!
Thanks to all of you. We are so very touched by your gesture. Never forget this.
So our stay was totally a dream.
Thanks to Diana as well.
Oh and the Location is very close to all the important attractions. Walking distance to Hyde Park, picadelly Circus even Buckingham Palace. But Metro and bus is also near. Pubs and Food also in walking distance. Check St. Christophers Place out

",5,2017,04,23
123,Amazing Service,"When I arrive, I was given a towel to refresh myself and there was water with fruits inside to give a light flavor to the water. The people in the reception was very helpful and made a quick check-in.
Once in the room, it was late after 11pm, I was starving, I look to the room service and there was 24h menu, hamburgers, salads and others, I ask for an hamburger and before the time I was given, it arrive, another very polite employee.
In the next days I can mention the breakfast, English breakfast with a lot of options of cheese, fresh fruit salad very good, dry fruits, .. I would say a complete breakfast. I had also the opportunity to use the gym, and what a nice gym, the running machine was the best I have ever used in my life, with HIIT program in it, sprint from the matrix brand.
One afternoon I needed to work, but didn't want to stay in the room, I found a nice place outside of the room of the breakfast. There is also a bar on the back of the restaurant that is full of people in the end of the day, I just look, didn't stay for a drink but the ambience seemed with nice people.
There is a very nice hall entrance to seat and relax.
On the check out once again the extremely attention of the persons working there capture my attention. Everyone was always very very helpful. 
I will return for sure. This will be my hotel for working in London, I feel very welcome.",5,2017,04,21
123,"Great staff, great location and very relaxing","This hotel was lovely - the staff were friendly (porters, checkin desk, concierge and room service).  The design and comfort was fab and the food was yummy.  Great location as well for the Oxford St days and quieter Marylebone high street days. ",5,2017,04,21
123,"Staff so warm friendly, and helpful!","Dear Marylebone
Thanks you for a lovely Central London stay full of the home comfort and ease that makes a short trip memorable.
It's got everything we wanted leisurely breakfast time with every choice from eggs royale to fruit smoothies , a pool and sauna, and exquisite cocktails at the 101 after a days browsing at Selfridges and Regent st. (This hotel is a great base for London shopping trips) 
The staff are so welcoming and helpful ,the concierge even managed to book us two very well priced tickets to Beautiful the musical which I also highly recommend .
Around the corner the buzzy St Christopher's place was a delight to walk through every day with no end of cheerful hipster spots for coffee.
I've stayed here in the Winter  season too and the crackling fire offers lovely wrap around loungey couch time and the hotel library houses a well curated art  book section .
Speaking of Art ;you are never too far from decent paintings hung  in the foyer which shows the hotel also obviously has an good eye for contemporary artistic talent.",5,2017,04,20
123,First time in London; definitely not my last time at Marylbone,"Positively exquisite. I found the staff extremely warm and inviting. My room was simple and unpretentious. The 108 Bar was my favorite: hip, trendy, chic, and sexy! A wide selection of spirits, and a very talented team of bartenders (barkeeps). I really liked the location - I could walk just about everywhere, except the airport of course. I found the hotel on Jetsetter.com. ",5,2017,04,20
123,Our family Easter break stay....,"Amazing hotel with great location wherein surrounded by the different store as part of shopping centre in central location, absolutely the environment is amazing and refreshing because they have complete recreational facility such as gym,spa and of course indor swimming pool that is why it is highly recommended for family holiday break in addition to this the deluxe room is gorgeous because it has a wide space of toilet and bath tub with shower with complete vanity stuff good for sweet and romantic moment for everyone...",5,2017,04,19
123,Lovely boutique hotel in an outstanding location,"This was my first stay at the Marylebone and it definitely will not be my last.  The hotel is impeccable in every way.  The staff makes you feel like you are the only guest at the hotel and they are always ready to help.  From the front desk, to the concierge, to the bellmen, doormen, housekeeping and restaurant staff, they are all professional and friendly.   Our room was lovely and spacious with high ceilings and windows that open.  We ate breakfast daily in the restaurant and the buffet was plentiful, fresh and provided a large variety of food (you can also order off a menu).  The hotel is approximately a short 6 block walk from the Bond Street tube station (on Oxford St.) and there are many restaurants and shops nearby on Marylebone High Street.  An additional bonus is Regents Park which is about 8 blocks away.  I highly recommend the Marylebone.",5,2017,04,18
123,Amazing service!,"My daughters and I loved everything about this wonderful hotel.  We loved the location.  It was close to the underground station and when we didn't use the tube our cab rides were not expensive.  It is in a lovely neighborhood with some nice restaurants to choose from.  We had high tea and breakfast in the hotel restaurant and the food, service, and presentation were impeccable.  The rooms were clean and comfortable with every possible amenity.  The personal service we received from the entire staff was unbelievable.  Each time we entered the hotel we were greeted by a staff member who was eager to help us with anything we needed.  They helped us with tickets to attractions, transportation, reservations,etc. It was such a warm, friendly, and inviting place. I unequivocally recommend this hotel.",5,2017,04,16
123,"fantastic hotel, great location, great staff","stayed here a few times when in London and will always book it first if we can to go back. looks a bit dated from the outside but inside is great. fantastic staff, nice rooms, great café, great restaurant, close to Marylebone high street and plenty of shops/eating places.
only 5 minutes walk from oxford street but quiet enough to believe you were miles away.
couldn't really fault anything apart from what others have said.  the Wi-Fi is absolute rubbish, but its not a problem in the slightest.",5,2017,04,16
123,Really lovely place,"I spent 2 nights there while on a business trip I extended into a leisure trip. I loved it!
Very nice hotel, great staff and the restaurant is really good. I also found the place was very well located in the heart of the action.
Would go back.",5,2017,04,16
123,Small but great location,"This hotel is in a great location. Close to shopping and tube lines. So a great place to based yourself for exploring London.

The beds were comfortable however the rooms are very small though.

The restaurant & bar  have lots of character and worth a visit.

",3,2017,04,16
123,"Our third stay, hope to come back soon!","Great location, beautiful room!   We love the Marylebone area, lots of restaurants, and close to Oxford Street shopping.  A lovely touch is the very polite doormen, dressed in a formal British style.  The closest tube stop is Bond Street.  Takes a few minutes to get there, but I enjoyed the walk, gives you a chance to look at the restaurants.  Be sure to walk down St. Christopher Place.",5,2017,04,15
123,"Great hotel , great service, just let down by patchy wifi","Our first stay at this hotel and would definitely go back.   Really good location for Marylebone High Street with all its shops bars and restaurants. 
Service was consistently good, starting with really efficient check in by a young lady from Turin (regret I can't remember her name) who also gave us the friendliest welcome we have ever had in any hotel.
We used Room Service for breakfast which  was really  quick, still hot, and really tasty.
Stayed in a studio room which was spacious and had a really comfortable bed. 
Our only gripe was that the wifi only worked efficiently in the sitting area, but the room was L-shaped and we kept losing wifi in the bedroom area.  
Had it not been for the wifi issue we would have given this hotel a 5",4,2017,04,12
123,Perfect for us,"Quiet neighbourhood in terms of traffic, but lots of lovely restaurants (try Aubaine for easy informal finner with the kids) and shops. The hotel restaurant works out fine in the evenings.

Super hotel for families. Great and nice service from the straff. Good pool with childrens swimmingtimes.",5,2017,04,11
123,Quiet & comfortable,"First stay April 2017.  Having endured the irritations of hotels in Mayfair far too long, a short jaunt up to Marylebone was a breath of fresh air.  The neighborhood has a far better vibe - more lively than Mayfair while not boisterous.  The Marylebone Hotel is on a mostly residential street and feels tucked in to a neighborhood.  The result is a quiet establishment that felt practically exclusive compared to the hectic bustle of much larger hotels.  The staff was friendly and helpful, from check in and check out to assisting with a map of running routes in nearby Regents Park (worth a visit too).  

The ""studio suite"" room was simply but comfortably furnished with separate sleeping and sitting areas.  Pay attention to the room size though - the size of the studio suite was fine but didn't bode well for smaller rooms.  The bed was comfortable, despite being made with no flat sheet, only a blanket - this is becoming an annoying trend in hotels.  It's well known the blankets and duvets get cleaned less frequently, so it is imperative to make the beds including a flat sheet.  The bed was comfortable and not too soft or worn out.  

The room included a Nespresso machine and coffee cartridges, always welcome.  The main negative issue was the bathroom door of frosted glass overlooking the bed, which could cause issues for couples late at night.  The bathroom itself was small but functional.  

Recommended.",4,2017,04,11
123,Great location and comfortable stay,"I traveled with my 9-year-old son and we
were made to feel very welcome at your hotel.
Everything was top notch, from the welcome
greeting all the way through breakfast, afternoon
tea, pool visit, sleeping, dining, local neighbourhood,
cleaning, friendliness, local knowledge and check-out.
Thank you for enhancing our stay in your great city!/Bodil&William
",5,2017,04,11
123,Excellent As Always,"I have stayed here several times and the experience is always excellent.  Location wise, you are within a short walk to Oxford Street and Bond Street Station. The hotel itself boasts superb Spa, gym and pool facilities. The bar and restaurant has a very cool and welcoming vibe.  The food is scrumptious and always an enjoyable experience. The staff are friendly, professional and accommodating.  I would like to make a special mention regarding Jack The Duty Manager. Jack is the ultimate professional whilst being super friendly and it's a pleasure to be greeted by him on our many visits to this hotel. Finally, I would like to say a huge thank you to all at the Marylebone Hotel and look forward to seeing you all soon. ",5,2017,04,11
123,Its all about Customer Service,"What a fantastic Hotel. Lobby, Bar, Restaurant and health club are all beautiful and help to make this hotel high quality, but it is the staff that make it amazing. Special thanks to Žan, Rama, and Brendan who looked after us and understand how important the guest experience is, making our stay extra special.",5,2017,04,11
123,"Ordinary exterior, extraordinary staff.","The hotel has unassuming exterior and lobby but has superb '10 star' staff. They go the extra mile in everything they do. Standing at the reception to check in, I was offered drink and warm towel to freshen. The rooms are modern with perfect bed linen. Supreme soft pillows make you want to steal. Bathroom spotlessly clean. Bed so comfortable you worry about missing alarm and waking up late.
When we came back at night, the beds were remade, curtains drawn, slippers next to bed, reading lights on and fresh bottle of water and chocolate. Super. All these touches make stay a true luxury.
There is no car park in the hotel. But there is NCP car park very near. Plenty of spaces. Costs £44.00 per day. Machine did not accept notes so had to use debit card. Credit card attracts 2.5% charge. You can park for free on the street from 8.30 pm to 8.30 am in designated areas. Note hotel is in the congestion zone.
Concierge during the daytime called Roberto is special. Super helpful. Warmth is something difficult to describe. You will understand what it is when you interact with him. He has it in bucket loads.
I ask myself. Why can't we give stars to individual staff? Five gold stars for Roberto.",5,2017,04,10
123,Nice,"Had a 2 night stay here for some birthday celebrations. The staff were all great; very friendly and helpful. The gym is very large and well equipped, but open to the public/Jon-hotel guests so was quite busy with lots of classes. The pool was a good size and there weren't many people in it when I went for a swim. The steam room was a nice touch. A great bar at the rear of the hotel   The only slight dampener was the room. I secured an upgrade but the room seemed no better/bigger. We were on the top floor and had good views but the room was quite stuffy with the sun shining and he air con didn't pump out much, if any, cold air.  The windows were hard to open.  Thankfully, we were out a lot. The room did have a coffee machine, iron etc. ",4,2017,04,09
123,A wonderful place to stay,"We spent 8 nights and the Marylebone and were very happy. Beginning with Maria Ramon, who greeted us at the front desk and made sure we had a lovely room, our visit was off to a great start. Every member of the staff was helpful, warm, and welcoming. The hospitality was superb. Our room was very clean and well appointed, with a lovely view. It was relaxing to come back to it at the end of the day. The bed was incredibly comfortable. We usually have trouble sleeping the first few nights away, but not here. The location of the hotel is perfect--close to Regent's Park and the Marylebone High Street. We will most certainly be back on our next trip to London.",5,2017,04,09
123,"Nice, pleasant and welcoming stay!","Spent the weekend at the hotel and felt very welcomed. Friendly personnel, clean, fresh nice atmosphere and high attention. Good breakfast in a calm atmosphere, very good location and a nice atmosphere in the bar eveniing timed. Nice stay - we´ll be ack

123,Best service ever!!,"I have stayed in hundreds of hotels over the years and when it comes to great service and hospitality, I have never stayed any better than at Marylebone. The hospitality is something you experience from all employees from you arrive until departure. I can only give my highest recommendation to this hotel, because of the location, room etc. but first and foremost because of the people there, who go out of their way to give you a good experience!!",5,2017,04,05
123,My stay ,"I felt so welcome as soon as I walked in the door , this really made the Marylebone feel like home thanks to the help of Rama Rose at the door . It was so easy to get checked in thanks to Gunta and the rest of the staff and I had a really comfortable and strait forward stay. Thank you!

123,No bones to pick with Marylebone!,"I have been staying at the Marylebone Hotel for several years for business meetings.  The staff are always extremely helpful and friendly.  The rooms are comfortable and the facilities in the hotel are quite good, including the bar and restaurant.",5,2017,04,05
123,Lovely Stay,"We spent 3 weeks in the hotel so we have had a lot of time to experience many things.  The rooms are nice, not as fancy (at least the Deluxe rooms) as I expected but where comfortable and very nice.  Clean and with all the amenities offered. 
Initially we book the Junior Suite with a Kind bed (and choose that because it said walk in shower).  There was no walk in shower and the bed was a queen size bed so we asked for a change of room.  Aurora was so nice and caring that she gave us a room a lower category (crediting the difference) but it was a huge room with everything we needed.
There is no perfect place because each one has its own needs but here what we needed was promptly provided.  Needed more hangers, towels, pillows...whatever in minutes (really amazing) everything was there with a big smile.

This is the general feeling in the hotel...they are there to make you feel happy and welcomed and they have achieved it.

Used the fitness center a couple of times and loved it ! Good breakfast, good restaurant and Bar.

The location is superb.  Welbeck Street, in the back of Marylebone Lane and 1 block from Marylebone High Street.  4 or 5 blocks from Oxford Street but without the noise.  Loved the location !

We will definitely be back to this hotel and recommend it very much.",5,2017,04,04
123,Exceptional staff,"We have just stayed overnight at The Marylebone Hotel and loved it.  The hotel decor is great and very comfortable with plenty of areas to sit and relax.  The staff were all exceptional and very friendly, welcoming and efficient.  We went as a special birthday treat and they really did make me feel special.  The location is brilliant as you can walk to many places in central London including loads of bars, cafes and restaurants.  The 108 bar and restaurant areas are great and there's a lovely area to sit outside when the weather is nice.  You also get use of the large gym, spa and swimming pool.  Would definitely recommend a stay or just to go and eat there or meet clients.",5,2017,04,04
123,Great hotel...but quality of TV is poor,"I stay here most weeks and the hotel has great staff esp Michael & Brendan.
But the quality of TV is poor.  It blacks out regularly and the channels are in no logical order.
But rooms are comfortable and hotel is well located.  The bar is always buzzing.",4,2017,04,03
123,Good location for Oxford street.,"I stayed here with a girlfriend on a weekend away to London shopping. The hotel is quite big and has a nice reception where we were greeted by the friendly staff. The room was modern and very clean and the usual London size which could be bigger, but what is expected. Nice bathroom and everything was great for our couple of nights stay. The only fly in the ointment was that we were kept awake by slamming doors on both nights at all hours. I know people stay in London for the nightlife as well as shopping and shows but I was not expecting that sort of noise in a good hotel. Apart from that everything was great and it only takes around 5 minutes to walk down to Oxford street. Would also like to mention the brilliant concierge man who seems to know everything about London!",4,2017,04,02
123,"Great Hotel, walking distance to all great London attractions.","We were greeted with wonderful service. The hotel upgraded our room when they learned we were on our honeymoon. The concierge was knowledgeable and helped set us up on tours of the city and tours to Windsor, Stonehenge and Oxford. Breakfast was delicious. You are a mile from Westminster which was an easy walk or quick tube ride from Bond Street. My wife and I Highly recommend.",5,2017,04,01
123,Return visit,"I haves stayed at The Marylebone many times and always leave looking forward to the next trip. The decor is modern and sophisticated.   Hotel is situated in the Marylebone neighbourhood that has great shopping and restaurants, and very removed from the hustle and bustle of Oxford which is only a 4-5 min away. There are serveral seating areas in the lobby to sit comfortably with friends to relax, meet up, or have a drink.  Rooms can be small..not unlike any other spot in London. ",5,2017,03,30
123,Great hotel with the best gym I have ever seen in a hotel,"Located in a trendy Marylebone street, it is close to everything.  It is a short walk to the bond street station. If you fancy shopping, there are never ending streets of shops nearby. The staff is exceptionally polite and helpful. The gym is three levelled, excluding the pool. It is by-far the best gym I have ever used in a hotel all around the world.  The bed is comfortable in a London-esk small room. I had a nice view of Marylebone from my room.",4,2017,03,29
123,A warm welcome in a perfect location ,"Just had to record how welcome I was made on my return visit to The Marylebone Hotel. They remembered my previous visit, the fact we had returned with children for a specific celebration theatre trip and made sure everything was just so. Thank you Gunther and the team at the front desk for looking after the family Low. London is very friendly when you stay here. ",5,2017,03,28
123,Exceptional staff!,"Especially jack McKie! Upon arrival I was greeted at the taxi door asked my name by the porter who then introduced me to jack at check in, the porter then went to get me a hot towel to wipe my hands, check in was friendly and welcoming I felt like jack was a long lost friend, it's nice to be greeted by someone who actually wants to put them selves out for you and jack did in every way! He couldn't do enough, I was going into hospital and coming back afterwards and was worried my room wouldn't be ready, jack said to call him and he would make sure it was no matter what time!! The staff can either make or break a hotel and believe me this hotel has exceptional staff is located in an exceptional area with all amenities I will be coming back. Thankyou ",5,2017,03,28
123,Excellent location and great hospitality.,"The Marylebone has an excellent location, just 5 minutes walk to Oxford Street and Selfridges. Staff is extremely hospitable and helpful. 
The front desk staff is friendly and hospitable. Door men attentive and helpful. 
You feel a sort of five star hotel service without being pretentious or annoying. Rooms are big, spacious and clean. This is a good option if you want to stay in the center of the city and you have budget for it.  ",5,2017,03,28
123,4th Visit looking forward to the 5th,"This was my 4th visit to the Marylebone and it won't be my last. I last visited two years ago and for various reasons haven't been able to find a date before, on arrival it was just like I've never been away. The greeting was warm and friendly we arrived just before mid-day and the room (634) was ready. We were given the usual hospitable welcome, the staff showed us the controls etc in the room. The room was a ""suite"" quite large with a settee, big enough bath room with shower and a bath, the controls on the shower were easy, although I wish the maid hadn't left the shower pointing to the room rather than the wall, when my wife tried it she was drenched, perhaps my wife should have looked. the room had all the usual, kettle, iron mimi bar, hair dryer, bed was comfortable room quiet. The breakfast was ok. This hotel has a great cocktail bar, and restaurant and when you are tired of the hotel the area is great, several restaurants, pubs and coffee bars. Why would you stay anywhere else.",5,2017,03,27
123,Weekend break,If you are stopping in london this is the best hotel with a great location wonderful staff always polite and helpful food in the restaurant is second to none special mention for elena who looked after us very polite and professional and asset and credit to the hotel thanks again see you soon  Barry and Caroline Holden 😄😄,5,2017,03,27
123,Excellent Weekend,"We booked the hotel mainly due to the location, but got a whole lot more. the staff could not have been nicer. we were fortunate to get an upgrade. the food was really nice also. We went to London to see a concert at the Palladium and the hotel was 10
minuets walk. You always have a slight apprehension before you get there wondering if you have made the right choice, we certainly did here.
Would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel to anyone.",5,2017,03,27
123,Great service,"I had trouble charging my cellphone and Jack McKie, the assistant manager, immediately sorted out my problem and gave me the right kind of connector for my phone. Not only that, but he helped me put the Citymapper app on my phone. Bloody marvelous, as the Brits would say. Gives you maps, info on buses and the Underground, and shows you how to get from here to there by bus, underground, car, or walking! When I got home I discovered Citymapper also works wonderfully for New York. Fabrizio at the front desk was also very helpful to me and two young friends who were visiting London for the first time.",5,2017,03,26
123,Great Location ,"Having booked this last minute due to its location to the Restaurant booked (another review), I can say start to finish the Staff excelled in giving us the best that they could offer., upgrade on arrival and nothing a problem in making our stay enjoyable. Thank you 

",4,2017,03,26
123,Very good weekend hotel destination!,"We have been for a weekend at the Marylebone hotel recently and ist was really very good overall! Room is nice, modern, clean and spacy. Lobby etc is very modern and clean also. Most important as always are the people and this team is really excellent!",5,2017,03,24
123,Good place,This luxury hotel offer a quiet place. Rooms are not extremely spacious but well maintained with all amenities. Location is convenient close to the Oxford shopping area. Price remains acceptable and it offer a good value for money. Will come back.,4,2017,03,24
123,Ideal for the shopping fanatics,"The main advantage of this hotel is its convenient location. Tucked away in Welbeck street, the proximity to Oxford and Bond streets would be every girl's dream. The hotel offers an immaculate standard of service and attention to detail; this is complemented with friendly and courteous staff members guiding your every step.",5,2017,03,23
123,Luxury ,"Stayed here for one night with a friend as a bit of a last minute trip to London. The hotel is so easy to find and as we had cases we were worried about the walk but it is literally 5 minutes from Bond Street station. Hotel staff were incredibly friendly and upgraded us to a superior double room when we got there. The room was nice and modern and spacious, bathroom was lovely - huge mirror and good lighting! Bed was so so comfy, would have happily stayed in that for my whole stay! Lovely lady also came and knocked on our door that evening giving us bottles of water and some small chocolates which was a lovely touch and I've never had that before when staying somewhere. We visited the spa the next morning, included in the price, which is ideal for a morning swim. I would just say if you plan on using the lockers maybe take a padlock with you. But the changing rooms have everything else you might need! We ordered breakfast to the room and I will say now it was the nicest eggs Benedict I've ever had, the eggs and ham were so fresh! After checking out the hotel kindly kept our bags safe for the day which was very handy. Would definitely come back and stay here again, I would love to try the afternoon tea as it's meant to be lovely. ",5,2017,03,23
123,A weekend of constant smile,"Arrived friday evening, checked in and got food need removed. Had interesting conversation in the bar of 108. Got up saturday, morning swim at hotel and steam bath. Got a juice in the juicery, ready for the trip goal achievements. All goals completed on return to hotel saturday evening. The 108 bar again, was center for sunday planning, and the good people there, made smiling the only expression on our faces. After sunday adventures, back to hotel, relaxed in the lounge area, and got a great meal in the restaurent. Homegoing monday morning, with smiles locked on our faces. Thanks for giving us a great stay.",5,2017,03,22
123,3 Night holiday in London,"We stayed 3 nights at The Marylebone - A superb hotel in a great location.  Brendan and ALL of the staff were fantastic - friendly, professional and couldn't do enough for us.  Breakfast was superb with a great choice but I really appreciated the quality of the food and speciality teas.  We ate twice in the 108 Brasserie - great food & wine.  We would definitely come back.",5,2017,03,22
123,Nicest hotel,"We love this hotel. You get the warmest smile even before entering the building. Full of details like giving you a bottle of water coming in from running. Or giving you an umbrella when you are going out in the rain.
Location is great. Gym is very good.
Also love the paintings from Chantal de Gaudio on the ground floor.
Happy people working at the hotel... Happy cutomers too.",5,2017,03,21
123,London's friendliest choice,"All is comfortable and un-pretencious, with the best quality but without expensive and un-needed luxuries. The lobby is a very friendly space, not of the enormous size usual in luxury hotels. The spa and pool are also friendly and easy to use.",5,2017,03,21
123,"Excellent central hotel, top class customer service","This hotel is excellent, centrally based, but quiet, excellent customer service and well deserving of it's 4 star rating.  The Marylebone is less than 5 minutes walk from Bond Street tube station (Oxford Street), so travel around London is easy from here.  We booked the studio suite, which was spacious (for central London), the bed was unbelievably comfortable, the power of the shower was great, and the Aromatherapy products were fantastic.  The breakfast in the morning had a great choice.  We will definitely be back.",5,2017,03,21
123,Weekend Away,"We arrived a few hours early for the check in time of which we were reminded by check in staff. But the staff were very friendly ad welcoming. Got our room upon arrival, the room was small and the bathroom cramped, the bed was comfortable though. We didn't have to much of a problem with the small room as we did not spend much time here. However, i feel the bathroom was far too cramped as we struggled to get in and out of the bath to shower. 
All in all it was an enjoyable trip to london and would think about staying again in The Marylebone Hotel. ",3,2017,03,21
123,Very nice boutique hotel in Marylebone.,We stayed 4 nights in October.  Good shopping all around the neighborhood and a variety of choices for food nearby for casual fish & chips or a lovely dinner at the Ivy.  LOVED the heated floors in the bathroom!,4,2017,03,20
123,Consistently good,"Have stayed at this hotel now about 7 times.  Consistently good.  A welcoming reception, good rooms, and overall staff that are prepared to go the extra mile.  You can get many things in central London, but the staff here are exceptional and are the reason that I come back (combined with room quality of course.)  Excellent breakfast and dinner facilities as well.  It feels like coming home.",5,2017,03,20
123,"Good modern hotel, in heart of Central London","The Marlyebone is a very solid, good hotel with a great location just of Marylebone High Street. The condition of the facility is excellent.  The bar/restaurant is very attractive, and the gym of high quality.  Our room was on the small side (even by London standards), but everything worked well.  Our boys had a suite which was larger, but not large but was suitable for three teenagers.",4,2017,03,20
123,Will Be Back.!,"My partner and I had a wonderful 3-night stay at the Marylebone in late February 2017 this being our very first visit to the Marylebone.

Oxford Street was a very quick 5 / 10 minute walk with the likes of Debenhams and Selfridges not far away and close to many tubes stations for getting around London.

The suite we stayed in was good size with a wonderful comfortable King Size bed. Breakfast was excellent, with a everything you could hope for on offer. 

Unfortunately we did not get chance to try out the pool and spa as it looks so impressive and inviting.

We would 100% recommend this hotel and will more than likely be returning in the near future and thanks to Brendan for arranging the surprise prosecco.",5,2017,03,19
123,Lovely London hotel,"Stayed at The Marylebone for business and it was a great property.  The hotel was very clean, my room on the 4th floor was nice and quiet with comfortable bedding and a decent size for being in London.  the hotel staff could not do enough to be pleasant and helpful during my entire stay.",5,2017,03,19
123,"A nice place, easy access, friendly staff","What a lovely hotel. I haven't been to London in ages and through a referral from a friend, he said this hotel was pretty good. So I went ahead and booked.

The arrival experience was decent, everyone was professional. Once we got to check-in, we had a really nice conversation with the front desk manager. After we got to the room, a few moments later, someone sent Champagne! What a surprise!

The room is a bit small, compared to other places you travel, but I guess for London it was a good size for the price you pay. All the facilities you needed were there. Most importantly, the place was clean. 

It's walking distance to Selfridges and that entire area. Easy to get a cab to anywhere you need also. And at night, peace and quiet to ensure a good night's sleep. 

All in all, a great choice of hotel and would definitely return again!",5,2017,03,18
123,One of favourite spots for coffee,"I use the lounge that has big windows and comfortable sofas. As I live in the area I drop in quite often but only when I see that the lounge areas are quiet. I like quiet :-) The other day I ordered my coffee, sat down, picked up a copy of the times and enjoyed a quiet time reading and then my coffee and some little cake (no extra charge) arrived. When I asked for the bill I was surprised to be told, no charge Sir, we kept you waiting too long. I'd been having a grotty week up until then. It quite raised my spirits. Thank you. Only one little niggle. Sometimes I hear that the MUZAK has been turned up. Who actually asks for it to be turned up? I don't like and if it is too loud, I won't stay.",5,2017,03,17
123,"Fabulous hotel, Fabulous location","Nothing negative whatsoever!!!
Location was brilliant for us as we walked everywhere. Madame Tussauds, Sherlock Holmes Museum, British Museum, Soho and Regents and Hyde Parks.
Room lovely, spacious, comfy bed and pillows and quiet. Lovely big shower and Aromatherapy products.
Staff were welcoming, helpful and professional.
Will stay here again.",5,2017,03,17
123,Brilliant location,"I stayed here for work recently and it was a really lovely hotel with a great location. The staff were so friendly and accommodating, they couldn't do enough to help. 
I would definitely stay again and am looking to book for a personal trip now, would like to come when I have more time to use all the amenities.
",5,2017,03,16
123,exceptional front desk staff,"My wife had written a review recently and had by mistake omitted to mention the outstanding warm excellent service we have always received from Gunther at the front desk.
his exceptional care is always a stand out and I believe he might not be there when we return in a few weeks time, we will certainly miss him.
thank you Gunther for everything. Sandra and Ian
Rebecca keep up your excellent work of a great team, you are the BEST",5,2017,03,14
123,Amazing service and experience! ,"What a fantastic experience at this wonderful hotel! From the moment my boyfriend and I arrived we had the highest level of service from everyone. Firstly the location is excellent and I'd recommend it for its very central location in a much less touristy area of London as you have so many lovely restaurants bars pubs cafes and walking distance to the shopping areas. The rooms were beautifully decorated, the bar is buzzing and somewhere I'd definitely revisit even if we are not resident. The highlight of our stay was Jack McKie the manager. My boyfriend and I travel vastly and often stay in neighbouring hotels - wish we'd discovered this first!! Thank you for your service, help in everything we requested and down to earth attitude with a constant smile. We are already booking to come back!! Highly recommended!! ",5,2017,03,13
123,Service and location recommend it to you,"We have stayed before, the hotel has got better. The staff are excellent ask where to go for breakfast and to eat and follow their advice. They couldn't have done more for my wife and I.
Use as a base to explore Marylebone the shops and the cafes just soak up the atmosphere and look at what you can't afford!
It's a lovely part of London",5,2017,03,13
123,Excellent,"Excellent stay once again.  Great quality hotel and facilities, a very enjoyable experience.  The pool and gym were also fantastic, unusual to have such good facilities in the centre of London. Staff were very attentive and professional throughout.  Every request was dealt with promptly and efficiently.",5,2017,03,13
123,Best Hotel in London.,"Most friendly and attentive staff I have ever witnessed in any hotel! from the second you arrive at The Marylbone the staff are more than happy to help you with your luggage or in any way that they can. While checking in at reception with Fabrizio he asked the purpose of our visit to London and we told him it was to celebrate my 18th birthday, later that evening we were elated to discover he has sent up a complementary bottle of prosecco to our room with a happy birthday message, which was very kind and unexpected. 

Hotel is situated in a great location with a tube station (Bond Street) and shopping district (Oxford street) only a 8/10 minute walk away, along with multiple restaurants and cafes, even though the restaurant in the hotel is great and very reasonably priced for dinners and breakfast. Lovely rooms with very comfortable beds and no noise during the night. Overall I couldn't rate The Marylebone hotel any higher and could not fault it on any front, would never stay in any other hotel in London after this experience. 100% will be returning! ",5,2017,03,12
123,The friendliest staff I have EVER met!!!,"The hotel is located at a perfect spot with everything in a walking distance including oxford st, leicester square, china town...and what amazed me the most was how friendly the entire staff is, may it be at the reception, or the manager or the staff at the breakfast buffet. We had originally booked a double room but the hotel management upgraded our stay to a suite, which was a beautiful room overlooking the city.  Upon arrival, they have complementary prosseco and chocolate covered strawberries in the room for us and also a sweet note welcoming us to the room.  At night, they decorated the bed with rose petals.  It was simply beautiful.  It helped that one of the staff there is my husband's cousin (Suzan Gurung) and her, along with the rest of the staff went overboard with giving us the best treatment I have ever had at a hotel!",5,2017,03,12
123,Great stay at the Marylebone,"Just came back from a 4-night stay at the Marylebone, the hotel is very nice & well located, facilities (gym, pool & Lobby) are really good, the service by all the staff from the lobby team (Fabrizio & the team) & to the room cleaning & maintenance was really excellent – very friendly, flexible & professional. 
The one negative thing was that the room (mainly the toilet/bath room) were rather small – except for that it was really good.",4,2017,03,11
123,Fantastic service all the time,"The hotel was brilliant and looked after us very well indeed.
Everyone was very attentive and I I will definitely use it again!
Great location too, very well placed in central London - great whatever your interests.",5,2017,03,10
123,Amazing hotel and amazing staff,"stayed here for our anniversary as a treat and from the moment we walked in we were made to feel very welcome. 
When the lady on reception found out it was our anniversary she had a bottle of prosecco sent up to our room which was a lovely touch. 
All staff are helpful and very friendly which is a rarity for some high end hotels, I will return definitely! 
The rooms have dressing gown, slippers and toiletries, another nice touch was the nespresso machine. 
The bed so so comfortable and there was hardly any noise at night time. 

Over all this was a great stay and I would love to return again, couldn't recommend it enough, we were made to feel so welcome.

Also a great location! 5 minute walk to Oxford Street",5,2017,03,07
123,Accomodating staff,"This may sound harsh, but many London hotels fail largely with respect to the quality and attentiveness of the staff. At Marylebone, Gunther, in particular, has always been helpful in ensuring things work smoothly during my stay. As a result, I push my company to accommodate us all there, when possible.",5,2017,03,07
123,"Wonderful location, Great Staff","I stayed in the Mar-y-le-bone Hotel as an impulse weekend away and I was not disappoint. A wonderful location, Beautiful modern interior and friendly and most importantly approachable staff. Jack (guest relations) in particular was wonderful. His nothing is a problem and can-do attitude was refreshing and he should be held as a credit to the front of house team. 

Breakfast was a delight, eggs were perfect every time and I wish I had more time to try the rest of the menu.
Having left the hotel refreshed and well rested, I look forward to my next stay.",5,2017,03,06
123,Fantastic,"Wonderful wonderful hotel, simply cannot fault it. Yes the bathroom is slightly small however it's perfectly equipped and the little touches of the toiletries and wonderful deep baths more than make up for it. The turn down service was a delite and the staff are excellent. Superb continental breakfast and a perfect location. I definitely would like to return!",5,2017,03,05
123,Excellent nights sleep and attentive staff,"Wonderful stay here . The staff really set the bar for London . The lobby is very professional and staff couldnt do enough. Excellent location if you are shopping in oxford street
Only negative thing about the room was the smallest bathroom ever like literally could just about fit in it ",4,2017,03,05
123,Poor room quality ,"I am a big fan of this hotel due to its central location, good quality and reasonable price.  Our recent visit was let down by a bedroom (526) in poor condition with broken fixtures and tired furnishings.  Refurbishment was definitely needed.",3,2017,03,04
123,Top tip...,"I have to admit I pulled up outside this hotel and thought it looked like an old office block.  But inside it's wonderful.  The service is spot on.  The room was beautiful and very clean.  I ordered room service which was piping hot and absolutely delicious.  The breakfast buffet was also good with lots of choices.  

The only thing that disappointed me: I found the young lady on check out to be very rude.  I questioned an 8.50 tray and service charge added onto the cost of my 18.00 burger from room service.... she made me feel like a criminal for doing this.  

I would recommend this hotel for a stay in London.  I was as also pleasantly surprised with Marylebone, it's got a lovely community feel to it and some super restaurants and shops. ",5,2017,03,03
123,Top quality delivered in a prestigious location.,"Stayed two nights on business,the hotel having been chosen for it's location convenient to our meeting place.
It's a top line hotel which delivers effortless service in a way that you don't realise how good it was until you leave.  Really well trained and focussed staff who go about their work with style and care.
Very comfortable rooms with good equipment and style.",5,2017,03,03
123,Brilliant boutique hotel brilliantly located,"The Marylebone is part of the Doyle Collection, an Irish family hotel.  I hadn't stayed here since it changed names and was renovated - it's just lovely now.  Very nicely decorated public spaces, warm welcome, professional staff and bedrooms that are quiet and comfortable, well designed and just work well.  Apart from all of that, this hotel is just off Bond Street and Oxford Street on one side and the brilliant Marylebone High Street on the other - so location couldn't be better.  Competitively priced too (we booked direct with the hotel's website).",5,2017,03,02
123,Delivering on style and grandeur,"The ultimate hotel base for a leisurely shopping break in the capital, The Marylebone is only a five-minute walk from both Oxford Street and Bond Street. The hotel, which is part of the luxury family-owned Doyle Collection, hits you with style and sophistication as soon as you enter. Have an eye for designer living? You’ll love its well-planned décor, embracing cosmopolitan design and culture, with the public spaces being a winning celebration of contemporary art and furnishings. The perfect backdrop to a couple of days being spoiled rotten! 

Looking for even more luxury? Let us suggest the Terrace Suites (there are three in total). The suites feature private terraces with retractable roofs, plus spectacular views of the iconic London skyline. The heated terrace is fully furnished with a large TV and comfortable seating – ideal for sitting back with a cocktail in hand whilst taking in the sights and sounds of the city. Or better still, you can watch the sun rise over the Shard by requesting breakfast here on the terrace. What’s more, each of the suites enjoys marble bathrooms with heated floors, a Nespresso coffee machine, 100% cotton, crisp white bed linen, bathrobes and slippers… What more could you ask for? 

The Marylebone village is famous for its culinary delights, but we can certainly recommend a visit to the hotel’s 108 Brasserie for an evening meal. The restaurant is open seven days a week, serving breakfast, lunch, afternoon tea and dinner. With a passion for seasonal cuisine made using the finest ingredients, from grass-fed British beef to artisan cheeses, the chefs source only the best fresh produce from a number of highly respected local suppliers such as Aubrey Allen and La Fromagerie. Be tempted by the 108 hamburger or the traditional fish and chips! Dietary request? Not a problem. The hotel caters courteously for the health-conscious traveller with free-from menus, plus juices, shakes and smoothies. 

With exclusive access to the Third Space gym, wellness area, spa and 18m swimming pool, after a busy day’s shopping, why not make the most of the hotel’s excellent spa and fitness facilities? With a range of complimentary fitness classes for all levels and interests, and a wonderful menu of health and beauty treatments, just take your pick! 

Delivering on style and grandeur, but backing it up with a feel of comfort and cosiness, be sure to make the stunning Marylebone Hotel your home-from-home on your next trip to London. Uniting unique interiors and opulent soft furnishings, together with helpful, friendly staff and a warm and relaxed vibe, you simply won’t want to leave!",5,2017,03,02
123,Birthday break in London,"From the start we were overwhelmed by the friendly, helpful staff at reception.Because it was my birthday we were given an upgrade to a larger room. The room was much larger than the usual tiny rooms that are usual in most London hotels. There was even a walk-in wardrobe. A bottle of sparkling wine and pastries awaited us along with a newspaper of choice.
The many lounges in the hotel were very comfortable and beautifully appointed.There is even a heated swimming pool and gym downstairs. 
The hotel is conveniently situated , 5 minutes walk from Oxford Street, and 2 minutes from the village atmosphere of Marylebone High Street.
Just round the corner from the hotel are many cafes and restaurants. We found that the best was the Ivy Cafe-great for breakfast or lunch.
All in all I shall remember this hotel especially for its friendly staff,who seemed genuinely happy to welcome us, and truly sad to see us go.",4,2017,02,28
123,"Great Location, Great Staff","I often stay here for work and I must say I love visiting every time. The staff are always friendly, the atmosphere in the lobby welcoming and the cleanliness of the rooms is of the highest standard every single time. I must give special mention to Gunther at reception who is always on hand with ready smile and no request is too big or too small.",5,2017,02,28
123,Theatre break,"Booked this hotel as part of a theatre break. The hotel is beautiful, very comfortable and welcoming. Our room was lovely although a little snug particularly the en suite. Staff are very courteous and made us very welcome. We were very pleased to be given a complimentary bottle of Prosecco as it was my husband's birthday which was a lovely surprise.",5,2017,02,27
123,Perfect hotel,"From the moment we checked in it was clear to see the staff were extremely friendly and we're more than happy to do anything they could to assist us during our time there. We were immediately impressed. 
We dropped our bag off and was told it would be sent up to our room ready for when we come back later....and sure enough it was. 
The hotel reception area was very impressive and just beautiful and there was plenty of little seating areas to catch a quick drink/wait for taxi's etc.

The room was equally as nice and was perfect for our stay.",5,2017,02,27
123,"First class service, great location","First impressions were great with a fabulous welcome and service upon check-in. You cannot fault the location, it is walking distance to Oxford Street and the cute boutiques and restaurants of Marylebone. The room was nice, our only complaint was the size of the bathroom. I read reviews that said they were small, but think postage stamp size, I am actually amazed they were able to fit a fully functioning bathroom in such a small footprint!. We only stayed one night, any longer and it would have become an issue.",4,2017,02,27
123,A little gem,"Not knowing what to expect when I arrived with my daughter, I was pleasantly surprised when we arrived. A nice and cosy entrance and a quick and easy check-in was a good start, and the icing on the cake was when the receptionist stopped us at the lift and gave a wonderful teddy bear to my daughter! Not much more to add...",5,2017,02,23
123,Beyond Excellent - 3 day Event,"I have just finished a 3 day event at The Marylebone and instead of catching up on emails I need to action from being out of the office for 3 days, I need to express the excellent service I have received over the past 3 days.

From the moment I arrived early on Monday morning, I had very high demands of the staff. I needed this week to run as smooth as possible and to their efforts, it has!

George looked after my event and helped with setting, moving furniture and every other request in between. I can't thank him enough. 

I am returning in March and hope the team are just as wonderful as this time - which I already know they will be.

Thanks to George and the whole team.

Also need to mention - the new event/meeting rooms are spectacular!",5,2017,02,22
123,Excellent Hotel,"We stayed at the Marylebone Hotel for three nights and really enjoyed our stay. Service was friendly and efficient, the rooms comfortable and spotless, as were the bathrooms. The atmosphere was calm and professional. We will definitely make use of this hotel again.
Graham and Ina Paarman",5,2017,02,22
123,Convenient Friendly Central London Hotel,"We have stayed many times in the Marylebone and always found it welcoming. Very clean and comfortable and all the staff most helpful and attentive. There is always a taxi waiting outside in Welbeck  Street, although it is walking distance (even in my eighties) to Marylebone High Street, Oxford Street, Bond Street etc.
All the staff are very good, but the Head Porter and Justina in the 108 Brasserie were exceptional!",5,2017,02,21
123,faultless,"the ambiance of this hotel is luxurious, yet contemporary.
the staff are poised and professional.

123,Home from home,I always stay at The Marylebone when I visit London. It is my home from home in London. The location is great and the rooms comfortable and clean. The people at the front desk are friendly and helpful. Especially Gunther who is a top man. I can recommend this hotel for everyone.,5,2017,02,20
123,A gem of a hotel,"I stay at The Marylebone regularly - it's a lovely, cosy and well organised hotel, and am always well looked after.  Gunther on reception gave me a warm welcome this time, and we had a nice chat about bottle recycling.  The rooms are luxurious and clean, the beds are comfortable and I always sleep well.  Looking forward to my next visit!",5,2017,02,19
123,Good hotel in great location,"Spent one night here on business in November. 

Good value and great location, close to shops, restaurants, sites and transport. Very helpful staff and nice touch with free coffee and pastries in the morning. 

Would highly recommend if on short trip to London",4,2017,02,18
123,Excellent !,"Lovely hotel beautifully designed, 
excellent location, very close to Oxford street with close tube.
 friendly and efficient service by staff and especially Mr Gunther
Swimming pool and health club included .
Nice spa too ( extra cost) 

",5,2017,02,18
123,Stayed for a weekend break and will be back,"As a London resident, it's a rare opportunity when I can spend a weekend feeling like a tourist. I booked one night at the Marylebone Hotel as part of my partner's birthday celebration in early February 2017. When I was researching accommodations, I kept going back to this hotel because it ticked several boxes: location, luxury, spa, pool/gym, restaurant, bar, and above all, its reputation.

We were not disappointed.

The rooms might be a tad smaller than some other luxury hotels -- call them bijoux -- but they are superbly decorated and are fitted with excellent furnishings. When you arrive at the Marylebone, you receive customer service that exceeds expectations. Even if you're staying for just one night and have never been there before, the staff provide you with an exceptionally high level of service. Want a bucket of ice? The staff will deliver it almost faster than you can travel from the lobby to your room. 

The facilities in this hotel go beyond what you would expect from a building of this size. The gym is vast and the pool -- a rarity in London hotels -- should satisfy any desire to swim a few laps. The spa, while small and a little bit less luxurious than other hotels, punches above its weight. Moving on to food and drink, the bars and restaurants were the biggest surprise. An evening drink in the 108 Brasserie was relaxed and enjoyable. While other hotel bars are frequently stuffy and impersonal, this one was a breath of fresh air. It seemed like the sort of place where local residents actually came for a drink and food, which made it all the more enjoyable.

Overall, we enjoyed our all-too-short stay and plan to come back again when we need to get away from it all.",5,2017,02,17
123,Fabulous,"Brilliant birthday surprise trip. Made even better by staff at this hotel. 

Housekeeping - the rooms are always spotless and they can never do too much. 

On reception, Gunther is amazing and made everything happen. Thank you! It's a crime you're leaving
 
Thanks for all!",5,2017,02,17
123,Fantastic Stay Will be back very very soon.,"I booked this stay for my daughter and boyfriend as they were visiting Harry Potter studios. So here goes. I wanted a Central Hotel with excellent reviews and this Hotel did not disappoint, along with all the staff I have to say. (I have grilled my daughter on her stay).It was their 1st stay in the Capital and I wanted it right for them. So paid for one night room only initially, then the day before their stay I rang to ask if they could have breakfast, along with a bottle of fizz as it was the 13/14th of February, the person who answered was helpful however I then spoke to Jack (The Manager), WOW he was fantastic (Garreth Walsh) he deserves to go far within your group. He listened and genuinely said that he was looking forward to welcoming them to the hotel.  My daughter arrived there around 8.30pm, the woman on reception welcomed them warmly when they booked in.  They had upgraded them as a surprise , the room was amazing I'm told ( funny I paid for it but never enjoyed it ) !!!! .  There was the fizz, strawberries dipped in chocolate and rose petals on the bed in a heart shape, what more could one ask for.  Jack then called the room and asked what they thought of the room and enquired where they were thinking of eating, my daughter said that they were coming down to the restaurant, however they hadn't booked.  Jack said that he would arrange a table for them they just had to wait 30 minutes but he very kindly offered them a glass of fizz. Whilst they were waiting he took time out to enquire about their day, how fantastic HP was and where was good for shopping !!! The meal was superb (congratulations to the Chef) they enjoyed the whole evening and then retired to the room.  They slept well , the next morning the breakfast was excellent and set them up for a days shopping it was a 10 minute walk to all the main shops. Can not fault this Hotel and the Staff there.  My daughter is already planning another trip there in a couple of months and this time I may well have to go .  Jack hats off to you and your staff, you went the extra mile thank you its much appreciated.  So if your a woman travelling on your own I would say book here, if you have young adults and want to know that their safe book here for them you wont be disappointed.",5,2017,02,17
123,JPC,"Fabulous location. Close to Oxford Street ,Harley Street and  in Marylebone, a quiet and cosy hotel. Wonderful breakfast in the Pantry. Had a lovely dinner there also at reasonable prices.We had a gorgeous deluxe room, beautifully decorated throughout.We were in London unfortunately for medical treatment nearby but the staff couldn't have done more to make our stay as easy as possible . We had exceptional service from Gunther at reception who was amazing to us , nothing was too much trouble and he was a great help. Highly recommended.",5,2017,02,16
123,Great staff,"I had a terrific experience at Marylebone. The hotel is as the pictures show on the website; modern, clean, and chic. There was a special staff member called Gunther, that was extremely careful with my needs and helped me with everything I needed (even when I didn't ask). He would go out of his way to make me happy! Congratulation Marylebone! Terrific staff training!

123,Expensive luxurious hotel in the heart of London Marylebone,I am visiting London very often and I am staying regularly in The Marylebone hotel in the heart of Marylebone London. Great location close to Oxford Street and Marylebone High Street. Rooms are rather small and sometimes bath rooms need a refurbishment. Overall however good experience and OK value for money.,4,2017,02,16
123,"Great hotel, fantastic location and people","We stayed at the Marylebone for three days for my daughters 6th birthday, from the moment we arrived the experience was perfect, Maria Ramon and the team could not do enough to ensure our stay was perfect, lots of attention to detail really made the stay a pleasure.  The hotel is in a great location, 8 minutes from Oxford Street and easily reached via Bond Street Station, our room was well equipped, spacious and very clean.  We ate in 108 twice for dinner and highly recommend, both for dinner and breakfast there the service and food were faultless.  Used the pool and sauna - again  scrupulously clean, the pool feels cold to start with but after a few lengths the temperature is just perfect.  We will be back to the Marylebone again, highly recommend! :-) ",5,2017,02,16
123,Welcoming & professional,"A wonderful hotel in the heart of Marylebone.
I have had the pleasure of staying here many times on visiting London and have not been tempted to stay anywhere else.
All of the staff I have encountered have been friendly and helpful.
The rooms are quietly luxurious, beds are super comfortable and housekeeping are very generous with the aromatherapy associates products.
Front desk staff tactfully deal with my many requests for specific room types.
Friendly door staff always have a warm welcome and luggage arrives in the room seamlessly.
The lounge areas are wonderful and staff in the pretty restaurant remember how I like my coffee.
Looking forward to my next visit",5,2017,02,14
123,Fantastic stay!,"Wonderful location and from the moment we arrived the staff were so welcoming and helpful. A very calm environment to come back to and the gym/spa has been refurbished and upgraded and we enjoyed the dance studio! The hotel also has a lovely new atrium on the first floor with roaring fires and lots of cosy places to sit and read a book. Juice bar good too.   Room was great - comfy beds, turn down service and large shower. The staff do their utmost to make your stay special - if we had to nominate one particular person who stood out it was Gunther. Such a gentleman. Thank you for a wonderful stay! See you again next year!",5,2017,02,14
123,Great Suite,I recently booked one of the new suites at the Marylebone.  Newly redone.  Comfortable and classy.  Great room!  Great bar and gym.  Fantastic service especially Gunther at the front desk.  Overall a great experience in central London.,5,2017,02,14
123,Lovely hotel!! Highly recommend!,"We stayed here for 4 nights and it was so lovely. Luxurious but still relaxed. Nice continental breakfast with gluten free selection. Amazing service and such a friendly staff, Maria Ramon took great care of us at the reception. We will definitely stay here again!",5,2017,02,14
123,One night...too short.,"Firstly location, The Marylebone Hotel is on a back street seconds from Marylebone High Street with its great range of independent shops and fantastic restaurants. Its also just a short walk from Oxford Street for those in need of more retail therapy.
So to the hotel, its modern, clean and smart without being at all pretentious.
The staff is professional, courteous and friendly. 
Our room was small but was fine for us. It was nicely appointed and the bathroom with marble heated floor was again small but perfectly adequate for us. I have a thing about good shower pressure and this was good enough to not run the shower on full.
Small touches such as Nespresso coffee maker, chocolates by the bed and free bottled water put the final touches to a lovely room.
Sadly we had just the one nights stay so we didn't experience the restaurant or room service. We did walk through the bar area which was lively (it was a Saturday evening) with a good atmosphere.
On the Sunday morning we used the swimming pool and steam room before checking out, leaving our bags and heading out for lunch and some shopping. 
We returned, and waited in one of the homely lounge areas, drinking the complimentary iced fruit water while our bags were collected for us.
It was a faultless stay, start to finish. We are planning to return for a couple of nights next time we visit London.",5,2017,02,14
123,Lovely stay but bad weather,"We had a lovely stay at the Marylebone Hotel for Valentine's Weekend. The hotel is very cozy, welcoming, friendly and spacious. While the room was a bit small but you would expect that in a big city hotel. The bathroom was tiny also. Breakfast was delicious and the staff were very attentive. Everything else was great and was a good base for Oxford Street etc. Marylebone village is lovely too and only around the corner with plenty of bars and restaurants etc.",5,2017,02,14
123,Consistently outstanding,"I've been very lucky to stay again at the Marylebone for one of my business trips to London.

I had to change at the very last minute the dates of my trip and was afraid to lose my reservation and having to change hotel. And here I have to mention very specially the excellent work of Gunther at the reception, who took care of everything and got me an excellent room for my stay. 

Once again, this never disappoints. Fully recommended!",5,2017,02,14
123,Ideal location ,"We've stayed at this hotel quite a few times now. We like it because it's just off Oxford Street so away from the hustle and bustle. Bond Street tube station is about a 10 minute walk away. 

The rooms are very nice. We've stayed in large rooms and not so large ones. They all are tastefully decorated, nice crisp white bedding and comfy chairs too. An iron and ironing board are provided also. 

The bathrooms are either a walk in shower or a shower over the bath. Some bathrooms are on the small side so a larger person may find it a bit of a squeeze. There are robes and slippers too plus complimentary toiletries. They also have a turndown service where bottled mineral water and chocolate are provided.

There is a lounge area off the foyer and a bar at the rear end of the hotel. It's very popular so you may have a wait getting a table. Away from the hotel, there's lots of bars and restaurants so you don't have to go far for lunch/dinner.",4,2017,02,13
123,Luxurious Stay!!,"Most amazing room, superb views, everything you could possibly want, a real treat and a huge thank you to both Gunther and Maria Ramon for our upgrade!!!  Magnificent.  Nothing is too much trouble when you stay at this hotel.  Wouldn't stay anywhere else in London.",5,2017,02,13
123,Gunther made stay a luxury,"What a wonderful couple of days at The Marylebone. Excellent service, high quality room. My stay was arranged by Gunther and everything was in place, down to the studio suite and the prosecco in my room. Will be back! (Chefs-Please consider adding vegetarian sausages to the breakfast menu!)Thanks again and look forward to my next stay at The Marylebone.",5,2017,02,13
123,Great Hotel!!!!,"We stayed at The Marylebone Hotel in January and what a great experience it was. From the moment we entered we were greeted by the lovely doorman and the receptionists made us feel at home. A mention goes to Jack, who's levels of service in rectifying and initial problem were second to non.....

Thanks you Jack and The Marylebone. We are already looking forward to our return 

Daniel",5,2017,02,13
123,Lovely Place to Stay,Just got back a week ago from London and stayed at the Marylebone.  The room was big enough for two and very well kept.  And the restaurant and bar below were great for breakfast and some Prosecco in the afternoon!  The best part was Gunther.  He was very attentive and helped us with everything that we needed.  Thank you Marylebone and especially Gunther for making our first trip to London a wonderful experience!,5,2017,02,12
123,Birthday trip,Was a fantastic hotel went for my 50th birthday and the hotel couldnt do enough for me a bottle of prosseco was left in my room with a birthday card and we got upgraded to a deluxe room will be back this year for my wifes 50th would highly recommend ,5,2017,02,12
123,Great Stay at The Marylebone,"Great weekend in London, staying at The Marylebone. Fab hotel experience right from the welcome in reception. Brilliant location, 5 minutes walk from Oxford Street in a really lovely part of London.   Room spacious, immaculate. Nice bathroom. Our room on the 7th floor was incredibly quiet and had a great view of the Post Office Tower. Staff attentive and very helpful. Thanks especially to Jack. Can thoroughly recommend this hotel and will be returning soon.",5,2017,02,12
123,Private dinner,"I booked a dinner in one of the private dining rooms.  I hadn't used the hotel for a private dinner before but had eaten previously in the Brasserie, which is very good.
The private dinner was a resounding success with comments that the room was a good size and nice ambience, the service was efficient but unobtrusive (this was a business dinner) and the food was excellent.

All round, it was a very successful evening.",4,2017,02,10
123,"Nice Location, Teeny Room","The hotel is located in a quiet and upscale neighborhood.  The room amenities were plentiful and the gent working the door was very engaging and remembers us after the first meeting.  

The only downside was the size of the room.  It was so tight that it made it difficult for two people to move around.  The space from the end of the bed to the wall was less than a Meter.  The WiFi on the 5th floor was also deplorable, but they did have a ethernet connection on the desktop.",4,2017,02,09
123,great hotel in a great location,"great hotel! the location, the service, the rooms and the food
you could not ask for anything more
especially if it comes with the best reception guy in London - Gunther!!
i am truly sorry he is leaving!! it will not be the same without him!!",5,2017,02,09
123,A very good stay,"Hotels are best judged by how they act when things don't go as planned. After a mishap with my reservation, the lovely staff did everything the could to help, and it was more than enough. Special thanks are well deserved for Gunther, Maria R. and Maria L. for their efforts.

I will certainly be back.",5,2017,02,09
123,Good Location and smiling staff ;o),"Good place, clean and friendly staff. Be carefull with the mini bar. Any move, a charge in your bill ;o)
They are always ready to serv you with pleasant and care. I love my stay and I recommend it!!!!",4,2017,02,07
123,GUNTHER rules!,"I have a clinic in Harley Street London, and my staff and I regularly stay here as it's only around the corner. There have been a few mix ups etc... however Gunther is the hotels saving grace. Nothing is too much trouble, he has a can do attitude... and it's largely because of him, that we stay so regularly. I've since learned he's leaving, and I feel remorseful I've left it this long before telling the world how great he is! You'll be sorely missed, and our team of doctors can't thank you enough for everything you do! Please God, they hire someone as good as you!",5,2017,02,07
123,"Great Hotel - Great Staff, Especially Gunther","I travel quite a bit to London and this is my go-to hotel. Rooms are exactly what I'm looking and the Nespresso machine is a killer perk. 

Breakfast options are wide and the staff is super-helpful.

This is particularly true for Gunther... Always great to see him when I check in! He always takes care of anything I need handled--from restaurant reservations to late check-out. Will see him next week when I'm back at the Marylebone :)",5,2017,02,07
123,Amazing Hotel Stay,"I stayed There to attend a business event, the hotel is very nice, breakfast is very good and tasty
Definitely will stay there if I ever go to London 
location is perfect as it is 5 minutes walking to Oxford street",5,2017,02,07

",4,2017,02,06
123,"Great, but not amazing","I don't want the headline to fool you. This hotel is great!
It's location is ideal to access transport links, shopping, great restaurants and cafes, and the hotel itself is of a high standard.
I only gave two reasons why I say this hotel is not amazing. Firstly, our room was lovely, a good sized double, but the bathroom was not for swinging cats in. In fact, you had to dodge round the back of the toilet and snuggle up against the shower to be able to close the door. Having said this, the decor was lovely and it was well appointed, just a shame it was a little cramped.
Secondly, the wifi. This is an annoyance to me in general as I've stayed at hotels and resorts here and abroad that have wonderful, strong wifi on every part of their land. So I was surprised to find that in the mid afternoon I wasn't even able to watch a clip on YouTube, never mind stream the football match. I think in this day and age, things can and should be done better.
Other than these two irks, the hotel was lovely. It has a great bar (we didn't try the restaurant), wonderful friendly and helpful staff, and the bed was amazingly comfortable and we both had a great night's sleep.
So, to sum up, great, but not amazing, but we'd happily stay again!",4,2017,02,06
123,Wonderful surprise,"Was not sure what to expect as have visited at a few Doyle Collection hotels and each has its own style. The Marylebone is really lovely. Clean and elegant with modern touches, and in a great location.
Upon arrival we were warmly greeted by the friendly Gunther, and with check in so simple we headed up to our Terrace suite on the 7th floor. with a private door on both the corridor and also at the top of your own staircase, you feel like you are in a very exclusive apartment.
This signature suite has loads of space in and out, with a spacious and well equipped bathroom, excellent facilities, toiletries and bar/coffee stocks. I can remember the last place I stayed where the room had 4 TVs...but this one does.
The terrace is beautiful and most definitely for all weathers, with not only a retractable canopy roof but also screens to shelter you from any wind, etc.
The whole experience at the hotel, including a dip in the pool after the very well stocked and delicious breakfast, was excellent and we would recommend to friends, family and clients.",4,2017,02,06
123,"Great Location, Tiny rooms","Great location, just a stone throw from Marylebone High Street, on a quiet residential street. Easy access from King Cross/St Pancras, ideal if you're looking to mingle with the locals rather than the tourists, but not be too far from the museum, theatres, restaurants, shops, ... Our room was tiny and a bit stuffy, but the bed super comfortable. ",4,2017,02,06
123,Excellent service,"Have stayed many times at this excellent hotel . 
Lovely refurbished rooms , very comfy rooms , outstanding gym , cool trendy bar . 
Front desk service consistently excellent .

Excellent choice!!!

123,Not quite the rave review I gave it in 2014,"We stayed in two rooms here with our boys for Christmas week in 2016, exactly two years after our first visit, where I gave the hotel a rave review. Overall, this is a solid choice given its fabulous location, friendly staff, generally understated chic vibe. But, this time, we were given a second floor room facing a brick exhaust chimney or something. The room was also much smaller, although I don't think we had booked any differently. The first time we had a lighter higher floor room with views over the charming rooftops of the townhouses of Marylebone. I asked to change rooms and the staff was very accommodating, giving us a larger room, one floor up. But I noticed the property is showing a little wear. The lobby looks like it's been freshened up, but there were stains on the rug in our room, a few chips on the bathroom accessory boxes..and the housekeeping was a little less impressive than last time (a hair behind the nespresso machine when I pulled it out to use it, etc).  Ok, some of you are reading this like what's the big deal and some of you are like, nice to know. I suspect management's attention is more sharply focused on their new London property, the Bloomsbury, which i will definitely check out next time we're in London. Again, staff couldn't be nicer at the Marylebone.",4,2017,02,04
123,London Weekend,"Excellent stay at the Marylebone again!! Great location for Marylebone high street and for Oxford Street, If driving my car great location for getting in and out of London quickly. Will definitely be returning. ",5,2017,02,03
123,LOVE LOVE LOVE this hotel!,"I was meant to stay at The Marylebone Hotel for a week while I was sorting out renting a flat while staying in London for work. I loved The Marylebone so much I stayed for 5 months!!! 

To be fair, they kind of had me at hello--- the beds were so comfortable that jet lag had no chance of getting the best of me. Then, when I ordered room service the deal sweetened, as the food was fresh, delicious. This was consistent throughout my stay- granted I was on a first name basis with the Margherita Pizza, which is surprisingly scrumptious- but I think the feeling was mutual. Viktor in room service was kind enough to always offer brilliant wine pairings--- which somehow had a more generous pour depending on how rough of a work day I had had. 

The Brasserie/Bar 108 has a great vibe and is always full enough to feel like you're somewhere fun, but never so wild that you feel the floor under your feet getting stickier with every step as people spill their drinks. And the cocktails are amazing! The food is always stellar. I'm not sure how something as simple as scrambled eggs with smoked salmon or a rocket parmesan salad could be so perfect, but they always were. 

The location of the hotel is second to none. You are surrounded by the best of everything. Marylebone has incredible shops and restaurants. If you want the hectic shopping of Selfridges or Oxford street you are there in 5 minutes. Regent Street 7 minutes. Soho 15 minutes walking. You have the best of every world. 

Should you need impossible tickets, impossible dinner reservations, something completely difficult to get, Riyas at the concierge, and Gunther and Jack at reception make dreams come true. Nothing was too much trouble, and they always made it happen.

The doormen made my days such a pleasure with a warm welcome when I returned from a long day of work... Michael, Daniel, Jean, Mohammed, Niko and Roberto show excellence in hospitality every time they opened the door, helped me with packages or ran in the freezing cold pouring rain to hail a taxi for me. Nothing was too much trouble. 

The women at the front desk were consummate elegant professionals. Smiling every time they had to copy my lost key, help me with work documents, go through my bill, answer questions. Smart and trustworthy!

And then there's the guest relations manager, Brendan. What a great leader Brendan is. Everyone looks up to him and his enthusiasm for his work and love of the hotel is contagious. I have friends who live in the neighborhood who now stop by the hotel to have a cup of tea and see Brendan. He makes the hotel a destination itself. 

The service at this hotel is second to none. Laundry is done perfectly and same day. Rooms are cleaned twice daily and are always beautifully cleaned. After seeing many of the rooms I will say that the terrace suites are some of the nicest rooms I have every been in. The retractable roof is ultimate luxury. 

And if you think I only have nice things to say, I do have one complaint... The toast at breakfast needs to be made so that it's still warm when it gets to the table. Cold toast is so depressing. The morning kitchen staff could figure out the timing a little better.

So there it is. Five months and nothing but nice things to say! Home away from home, full of wonderful people, The Marylebone is a special place and has been nothing short of a pleasure. Thank you to everyone there. Hope to see you soon!",5,2017,02,02
123,Perfect London location with a lot of charms,"A 3 nights stay for the 3rd time in this lovely hotel.
The location could not be better( walking distance from oxford street or Regent's park).
My room was a great size, clean ,with amenities (mini bar, kettle ,nespresso machine..)
The breakfast is good (with hot dishes cooked to order) in a really nice place and an excellent service.
The staff is friendly and interested in hearing your demands .
A special Big thanks to Gunther ,at the reception, who dealt with my requests with ease and professionalism !!
I will definitively be back....",4,2017,02,02
123,Turker Tumer,"Very nice hotel, I think one of the best location for this rate , also good rate in early reservation and very very friendly staff, especially Mr. Gunter from the front desk helped us with everything including reservations for the restaurants and information about the city, he made the life very easy for us.
The rooms are very clean, sheets and towels are also very clean. The restaurants are good also, only maybe I can criticize the breakfast, I think it can be better, and especially on Sundays  because people are coming from outside hotel customers can not find tables, I think this doesn't make sense, the brasserie is better happy hours and mini burgers are really good
Overall We really enjoyed the hotel, of every time coming to london we prefer this hotel and do not regret",5,2017,02,01
123,Geraldine Walther,"I would like o recommend Gunther, the very courteous and kind hotel agent and this beautiful, centrally located hotel.  The room is spacious, the tub is large and the location is perfect, right down the street from the Wigmore Hall.  The rates are a bargain for what you receive!
Highly recommended!",5,2017,02,01
123,Much better than we expected,"We stayed 2 nights while my wife was having corrective eye surgery at nearby Harley Street. We had expected a ""typical"" mid range London hotel but thus was so much better. Every staff member we encountered was friendly and charming, the room was better than we expected with a queen size bed and a TV that was at least 50 inches and a/c that was easy to get to the temperature you wanted. We highly recommend this hotel",5,2017,02,01
123,Superb hotel in an excellent location ,"Absolutely loved our stay in The Marylebone, beautiful intimate hotel in the very heart of London walking distance to Oxford street. Really lovely communal areas with a fabulous bar and two restaurants. Also benefits from having the use of Third Space gym, pool and Spa below the hotel. Rooms are lovely if a little small but common for this part of London and you are not in London to sit in your room. Special mention to Gunther at reception who was exceptionally helpful, all the staff were friendly, warm and keen to help. We will definitely return!",5,2017,01,31
123,"""Wonderful weekend  in London with friends""","Wow..what an amazing experience it was to stay at the Marleybone hotel , beautiful clean rooms, with beds to die for, so comfortable! Perfect location just off marleybone high street ,ideal for shoping on Regents street and Oxford street. Service here is best I've experienced and I stay in 5 star hotels whenever I travel so expect a high level of service, what makes the service stand out is the joy that each member of staff has as they go about their business, everything is done with a smile nothing is too much trouble so thank you Marleybone hotel especially Brendan, Diana, Rahim and Zan. We will be making this our hotel of choice when we come back to London . Also check out the 108 brassiere for food and the bar too it's fantastic but is a very popular spot so might be good idea to book ahead.",5,2017,01,31
123,"Amazing hotel, great location and awesome staff!",What a great boutique Hotel! Loved every minute of our stay. Restaurant service was fantastic. Breakfast was great too. Gunther from the Front Desk made our stay extra special and accommodated all our needs. Thank you!,5,2017,01,30
123,Weekend in London ,"Great hotel in an excellent location just off Marylebone high street. Really enjoyed the 108 bar at the back. Really good service across the board, pleasant modern, classy feel to the place - we loved the flock wall paper. Would have given 5 stars if didn't have to wait for the room although we checked in quite late - to be fair they did comp us a drink for the inconvenience, and room small size (not unusual for central London). Would have no hesitation to recommend this hotel. ",4,2017,01,29
123,"great service, nice people","everyone in the hotel is quite welcoming. from the front door man to reception (gunther). food is ok, hotel is centrally located so easy to access restaurants and shops. Food is good too but limited selection if you will be here for a few days.",4,2017,01,29
123,"Lovely, comfortable hotel","We stayed here for a weekend away in London.

The hotel is in a quiet backstreet off of Marylebone High Street. The staff are fantastic, and always keen to help.

The room was very comfortable, quiet, with a large double bed and all the amenities you'd expect in a high end hotel.

The only negative was the bathroom, which I think is possibly the smallest I've ever seen. If they'd made the main bedroom 1-2 feet smaller, you'd not notice, but it would be a huge benefit to the bathroom. However, this doesn't detract from everything else.

The hotel has a reasonably early check in (we were able to get into our room at 2pm) and a reasonable checkout (12pm).

Overall, a great hotel, and highly recommended.",5,2017,01,29
123,5 star care & comfort,"I booked a Saturday night at the hotel with dinner at 108 as a mini mini break Christmas present for my partner. From the moment we arrived I knew I'd made the right choice and that my money was well spent. Very attentive, helpful, pleasant & efficient staff - we felt very well cared for by everyone. The room (superior) wasn't big but the decor is nice & the bed was very comfortable. Room temperature was perfect & it was very quiet - no traffic noise, no noisy guests. We were able to check in early and leave our luggage while we went out for the day. We had cocktails in the bar & dinner in 108 and then breakfast the following morning. Again - lovely staff, efficient service & we were really well looked after. I wouldn't hesitate to stay again.",5,2017,01,29
123,Great hotel and great staff!,"I had a very pleasent stay at Marylebone Hotel. The staff was a highlight as they we're always making us feel at home. Gunther, who checked us in, gave us the best tips of restaurants. The room was very good and the hotel have a great localization.",5,2017,01,29
123,Perfect ,"My partner was having surgery at the London Welbeck Hospital. This hotel was perfect as located across the road.
The hotel itself is in an amazing location.
I parked 5 mins away at the Q park, off oxford Street, the hotel will give you discount on the charge.
The concierge who wore a bowler hat was amazing, courteous and had a vast knowledge of the area, a credit to the hotel.
My room was lovely, clean and had all you need.
Bar 108 was really welcoming at the rear of the hotel.
Awesome location for looking around
I am planning a sightseeing trip later in the year and will definitely use this hotel again
General manager and all the staff were helpful and happy smiling people
Well done to you all

123,Business meeting,"This is the 4th successful business meeting I have organised at The Marylebone.  The sales team Kevin & Rohini are a pleasure to deal with, they take all the stress out of organising big events, nothing is too much trouble.  Myself and my colleagues were very impressed with the recently refurbished meeting area, The Blue Room, Library and Courtyard.   The staff at the hotel are so friendly and make you feel at home.
I would highly recommend the hotel for business meetings and for personal visits.
I can't wait to return!",5,2017,01,27
123,"The hotels really very good, the breakfast is excellent and the staff is wonderfully especially Gunther whom is very kin",Especially Gunther who is very kindly thanks for taking care off me and my wife I will return to the hotel always when I came to London in order to work or to go fo turism. This hotel will be my best choise.,5,2017,01,26
123,Home away from home!,"If you are looking for a place to stay, for both business or pleasure, look no further. The hotel is great, and pushing everything to make your stay as comfortable as possible.

The location is perfect, walking distance from Oxford, Mayfair and the Soho. However - not crowded and allows peace of mind when you need it.

The staff is the real thing here, friendly, professional and will not stop at anything to help (including arranging a doctor if you need..).

Thank you for everyone, especially Gunther, for the warm welcome. Truly recommended - if you are visiting frequently you should definitely give it a go!",5,2017,01,26

123,A Great Reception,"I stay at the Marylebone Hotel on a regular basis therefore it goes without saying that I am happy there.  However, I would like to express my thanks and appreciation to the reception staff, particularly to Gunther, who is so friendly (I always get a great welcome!) and extremely attentive.  Last weekend was no exception...I was spoilt to embarrassment - an upgrade, complementary drinks and champagne!

I look forward to my next visit.

123,Nice Hotel in the City Center!,"Good middle-middle Hotel 10min. walk from Oxford Streets/ Bond Street Tube Station. Nice area with little shops and restaurants. Rooms are small (typical for London) but ok, bathroom not always as clean as I expected! If you want to make use of the free gym lessons make sure to book them a couple of days in advanced as they are mostly fully booked! Staff is welcoming and friendly. Just around the corner is Content Beauty and they offer fabulous beauty treatments and a wide range of organic skin products.",4,2017,01,23
123,Great reception service!!!!,"Mr.Gunther was so helpful and problem solving. He has given a great service to us for finding us the most convenient room with a great price. We had the best vacation ever. Thank you Mr. Gunther, thank you Marylebone hotel. ",5,2017,01,22
123,January trip to London,"A comfortable nice hotel with service minded and very friendly staff. The location is perfect, walking distance to a lot of high spots but in quiet and calm surroundings. An extra plus for the fresh breakfast. ",5,2017,01,22
123,Excellent again!,"Stayed here a couple months ago and was very impressed I decided I'd come back. After the last time booking through a third party there was a problem with my room choice (which was fixed immediately) This time I decided to call the hotel directly. Dealt with a lovely girl named Emma. She was very friendly and professional throughout. She ensured we got exactly what we wanted. 

When we arrived I was welcomed back by Brendan. Who is the duty manager? He remembered me from my last visit which was a nice surprise. He brought us up to the room and told me if there was anything we needed we were to call him. And gave me his card. 

As we were only there for the night it was a short visit. But this experience coupled with my last stay has confirmed this as my go to hotel next time I am in London!

",5,2017,01,20
123,Great stay!,"Was in London for 3 nights in Jan and from the minute we walked in - we were in great hands!  The hotel is in an amazing neighborhood with lots of shops and restaurants and still close to all the sights.  Had great help and recommendations from both Gunther in reception and Maria at the concierge desk.  Rooms are nice, beds super comfy.  The hotel and adjoining restaurant are definitely popular not only for guests but for locals - the place is buzzing!",5,2017,01,19
123,Excellent hotel,Really impressive hotel - both for business and pleasure. The rooms are great and the restaurant has excellent food and vibe. All of the staff (especially Gunther and Brendan and the restaurant team) are extremely helpful and professional and nothing was too much bother. Felt completely looked after. Great location and v good gym and pool.,5,2017,01,19
123,Excellent,"The hotel is super central in London, with wonderful rooms with views of the city. The bar is nice and cosy, but above all I really enjoy the spots club below the hotel, with inner pool and sharp equipments.",5,2017,01,19
123,New Years Eve,"I know this is a late posting, but we had a fantastic time at this hotel as usual, what made it so special for us and my mother Inlaw was Gunther always he's comes up with the best things to do and visit.
I strongly recommend this hotel as base to be in London, only a short stroll to Oxford street and there is many restaurants close by.
If you visit please ask for Gunther.

Thank you Gunther.
Mark & Anjelika.",5,2017,01,18
123,Wonderful London Hotel,"Spent 2 nights in this lovely hotel, could find no fault with it. Stayed in a deluxe room, big bed, crisp white cotton sheets, excellent service.  Pool and gym area were excellent, water in the pool could have been a bit warmer.  Great bar area. Staff were brilliant, easy access to Oxford Street, quiet for sleeping.  Went out for breakfast, rather expensive in hotel.",5,2017,01,18
123,Wonderfull stay,We had a great time at the hotel. The room was very nice. The gim is amazing. The staf was very nice and helpfull especially Gunthar who was very patient and helpfull. I also wants to thank Aurore who was very kind and highly professional.,4,2017,01,17
123,feels like a classy hotel,"my wife and i spent one night here on december 17th. the hotel feels quite classy and is a good location for shopping in oxford street or in marylebone village which is also very nice. we had a standard double which was well appointed with nice decor. it was quite compact and if we were staying longer would have a larger room. staff were very welcoming.
we ate that evening in the attached bistro restaurant. i would have to say it was dissapointing . the staff were very nice and helpful but couldnt make up for the quality of the food and awful cocktails. we regularly eat out in central london and expected good food in nice surroundings.we got the surroundings but not the food.
this should'nt detract from the hotel which i would stay in again.",4,2017,01,17
123,Marylebone,"Another great stay at the Marylebone, great rooms and great staff, it is great when the staff know your name as you walk into reception, Gunther always has a smile and is very welcoming. Food in the restuarant is of a high standard and well presented",5,2017,01,17
123,A nice hotel but some disappointments,"It was difficult to decide between 3 and 4, and in the end I have been generous. On the positive side the hotel has some excellent features and communal areas, and the staff were also friendly and polite. And the restaurant was also of a high standard. However, there were significant negatives regarding the room, which was a studio suite, on the top floor, and which should have been of a higher standard than I found. Firstly, the walk in shower was minute, so small it was impossible to shut the door once inside. The bathroom floor is advertised as having underfloor heating, which it does - in part! So you go from the warm half to the cold half as you walk across the bathroom. SImple solution, put a bath towel on the floor on the cold part! The windows are not well sealed (there is no double glazing and a slight draught could be detected at times), and each morning they were very wet on the inside, with pools of water on the sills. These were never dried off by housekeeping. One of the blinds did not work properly, and was not repaired properly when asked. The heater was effective but quite noisy, and overnight the room cooled off significantly. The heater was in the sitting area and the bedroom area took ages to warm up and then got quite cold by the morning - I decided to wear the bathrobe in bed ready for getting out in the morning! Another grumble, the TV had radio channels but no signal, despite them being advertised in the room directory. I was promised a separate radio, as well as another heater for the bedroom area, but nothing came of this. In fact, it took the engineer 5 hours to arrive to explain all this, and even though an iPhone dock appeared it was not up to date enough to take my iPhone, so that was that! One final point regarding breakfast which was extremely good and plenty of choice but somehow the price varied. I had the same continental breakfast each morning but my bill was different on the last day - cheaper! A pleasant surprise but I was told it was because I had taken fewer items. How did anyone know what you took from the buffet? No real difference, so had I been overcharged on the other days? And what if you had prepaid? So just a warning - before you sit down check whether you will be charged the full amount if you take fewer items and see what they say! So, to reiterate, a pleasant hotel that is well run, and kept very clean, but if the quality of the room is your main priority it might be a bit risky.",4,2017,01,16
123,Very nice Marylebone hotel,"The Marylebone is my favorite hotel when staying in London. Very nice location, in the heart of Marylebone, close to the nice restaurants and shops... Rooms are fairly small but very comfortable (and if you are in London, you want to go out anyway...). Very nice swimming pool (18m) as well, which is not common in London... And if you need any advice, Gunther at reception will be able to help you",5,2017,01,16
123,Great service starts when you enter,"I visit London about once every 2-3 months and frequently stay at the Marylebone. On every visit I'm warmly greeted by Gunther upon check-in. By now he remembers I enjoy dinner upon arrival and always suggests booking a table for me. On business travels arriving from the airport I appreciate quick service, a clean room and someone knowing I'll need to dine as well. Thanks Gunther. Service doesn't get better!",4,2017,01,16
123,Second home,"Been staying at the Marylebone hotel for many years, always made to feel welcome. Everything is very good, I treat the hotel as my second home when in London, I no longer stay in other hotels.
All Staff are very professional and are very good at making your stay special. 
Food in restaurant is also very good.",5,2017,01,16
123,Always made to feel special on arrival by all staff,"I have been staying at this hotel regularly for the last 2 to 3 years. The staff make you very welcome and as regular guest they know me by name on arrival which always makes me feel I am back home. Over the last few years I have seen their staff being promoted, this is excellent as the staff are happy and have a great loyalty.
The bar is amazing and a great place to catch up with people, or just sit alone with a drink and absorb the atmosphere.
I am fortunate to travel a lot and always make a point of naming a member of staff who has been particularly excellent and made the stay special, this time it is Mr Jack McKie who has always ensured that my guests and I feel special, he is professional and cares that your stay is perfect. He is a credit to the hotel and management team.",5,2017,01,13
123,Great and friendly stay,Perfect location. Good service and nice room. I stay every month and always get consistent service. Particularly like the hot flannel at reception.  I like the boutique feel and style of the hotel . See you next month !!,5,2017,01,13
123,Above and beyond....,"My husband and I arranged a stay at the hotel for my birthday. We arrived at this beautiful hotel and were told that our room had been upgraded to a deluxe room. The room was very large, tastefully decorated and with a lovely bathroom. We went out shopping and when we returned to the room there was a free bottle of prosecco waiting, with chocolates and a birthday card from the hotel. How lovely!
The hotel location is perfect for Oxford Street with Selfridges very near by. We also noticed that there were a lot of restaurants around in the back streets around the hotel, including a lovely burger place called Burgers and Cocktails, where we had a delicious lunch.
We had brunch in the hotels 108 Brasserie on the first day, and the food was delicious. The setting is great, very cool!

I can't recommend this hotel enough, and I really hope we get to stay there again one day.

123,"Great London hotel. Location, facilities and staff at its best.","I have been staying at the Marylebone many years as I commute in and out of London regulatory. Location is just perfect! 
It has the quality, standards and facilities to match.
It all starts with the meticulous and first class welcoming from Antje, Gunther and the reception team. 
It also has the best Gym attached to any hotel that i have been to anywhere.
Cannot fault the Marylebone and highly recommend.",5,2017,01,12
123,A great place to stay,"It always feels good to stay at the Marylebone  - Nice experience, nice bar and restaurant.  It's has a SPA & sport club you can directly reach from your room - It's a cosy in a nice area of London   Very nice & helpful people.",5,2017,01,12

123,Very happy to stay here,I visit London on occasion for business purposes and have stayed at the Marylebone hotel on several occasions. On my most recent occasion I saw Gunther at the front desk. He has managed my check in before and always does it efficiently and pleasantly. The room gave always been clean and well presented. The bathrooms are always clean and modern. This is my preferred hotel for central West London from all the other nearby hotels in the area,5,2017,01,12
123,great hotel great location great staff attention,"Have been using this hotel for several years when in London.....its well situated centrally, the rooms are clean comfortable beds and the staff always very attentive....everytime I go back they remember who I am which is always nice....especially Gunther at the reception....always friendly and ready to make sure my stay is at its best.....",5,2017,01,11
123,"Great hotel, great location, great service, close to everything!","Fantastic experience from beginning to end.
The front door guys are so helpful and give excellent recommendations on places to go nearby for breakfast or dinner & are always super friendly when you are coming or going.
Great hotel, great location - very close by to all shopping areas of central London. I've stayed in different hotels in similar areas and this was a very good spot to be.
Great restaurant in the hotel as well & overall fantastic service from check in to check out.
Only negative for me would be the room sizes - We stayed in a superior double & 2 people with decent sized suit cases can be a pretty tight squeeze in this space! The bathroom was also pretty hard to navigate with 2 people to get into and out of the shower etc. Although a lot of places in central London can be similar unless you pay more for larger suites.",4,2017,01,10
123,Lovely hotel great location,Check in and the welcome was lovely - the hotel is very nice and decorated beautiful with lovely furniture   The welcome was wonderful and the staff can not do enough for you.  The bedrooms are small and the bathrooms small however they are furnished very very well and comfortable bed - everything you could need.  Breakfast was wonderful with a great choice - also the chef in hotel is excellent the food served was very tasty and a good choice - would recommend this hotel,5,2017,01,10
123,Marylebone Hotel Business trip,"Another great stay at the Marylebone Hotel.
Very welcoming reception dealt with by Gunther whowas very friendly and provided excellent service.

123,An American In London,"This was my first time in London and the location of The Marylebone could not have been better.  It was close to the tube, shopping, dining but away from the busy high streets and crowds.  Very comfortable accommodations and lovely staff.  Great restaurant on the premise.  A few minor issues with our room that were quickly rectified such as a broken kettle and missing alarm clock.  Because it was just me and my mom traveling we requested two twin beds and were given a handicap room on the 1st floor. (which was available first thing at check-in very early around 8am, so that was nice)  It was very large and comfy with a great seating area but the bathroom was a little strange as it was designed to accommodate a wheelchair.  So we flooded the floor a bit when we showered and the toilet was very high. And no worries about being on the first floor as the block is very quiet. Housekeeping forgot to turn down our beds about 3 nights out of the week so no chocolate on my pillow but honestly not a big deal there.  Otherwise my biggest complaint was that there was no cable tv.  There were a few basic channels of BBC and 3 sports nets but no on demand or streaming access which would have been nice.  I will definitely stay here again the next time I'm in London which I hope is very soon.",4,2017,01,09
123,London during NYE,"The Marylebone is a great hotel away from the tourist high traffic area, yet only a 7 minutes walk away. Bond St. and Oxford Circus Underground stations are very close and pretty much these Underground lines will take you to all London attractions in less than 15 minutes. The location for us was perfect. Also, near the hotel there are some great local pubs that you should check out. 

The hotel is beautiful and super clean. We stayed in a standard room which may seem small to some, but it was very comfortable. The hotel staff was fantastic from the moment we checked in to the moment we checked out. Very helpful, professional, and everyone was extremely nice. We would definitely consider staying here again for our next trip to London. ",5,2017,01,08
123,Preferred choice in London,"When traveling to London this is my preferred hotel. Very friendly staff. This time it was Gunther who checked me in and made sure, that I got a room that suited my requirements (non-smoking, with curtains rather than blinds)
Will definitely come again!",5,2017,01,08
123,Fantastic stay for my son's 12th birthday ,"We just spent 2 nights at The Marylebone and loved every minute of it! 
The concierge helped me out planning a surprise visit to the Harry Potter studios, everything went perfectly right! 
On my son's birthday we found a lovely plate with cakes, refreshments and some chocolates. My son got teary as he was really touched! What a lovely thought! 

We were offered a 20£ voucher to spend in one of the restaurants as well.

We had dinner at the restaurant one night, the food was really nice, very nice ambiance and perfect service. 
Breakfast was great too, lovely, warm atmosphere at the 108 Pantry. 

The room was great, good size, the bathroom a little bit small but hey, it's London after all! 

The only downside was the pool area, we were expecting more of a ""relaxing"" pool to rest before dinner and after running about the city but found people doing laps, so we didn't use it.

The hotel is fabulous, so is the service and the location is just perfect! Marylebone is definitely one of my favorite areas in London! 
We will definitely come back.",5,2017,01,08
123,Reception staff - Gunther,"This is the fourth time we have visit the Marylebone , London 
Each time we have been greeted by Gunther,

123,Christmas Party Event,"We are a private clinic in Marylebone and held our Christmas party in one of the fabulous new event rooms. Everything went perfect from start to finish and the food was amazing! The staff on the night were so accommodating and helpful (even when we asked them to film our mannequin challenge :) ) Kevin's help with organising everything from the reception to dinner to quiz that we held was invaluable and he even popped by on the night to make sure everything was ok. 
Would definitely recommend to other businesses looking to host an event or party.",5,2017,01,07
123,"Good location, but not a great hotel","The location was convenient, which is the hotels best asset. The staff really tries to be friendly and accommodating, but was a bit disappointing with room size, room cleanliness, and also the general feeling at the hotel. If just a quick business trip in the area ok, but it was not a refreshing stay at the hotel.",2,2017,01,05
123,HOME AWAY FROM HOME,"Outstanding staff at this brilliantly located hotel. Whoever trains the staff at The Marylebone needs a medal. Particularly the doormen who invariably remember your name. We stayed on 3 occasions over 2 weeks, one of the rooms was a bit small but they fixed that for us. Fabulous lounges for relaxing or having an informal meeting. It's only a few minutes from Marylebone High Street where we preferred to have breakfast as a great breakfast there cost £16 as opposed to £60! I'm not a cheapskate but 60 quid for 2 for breakfast is over the top. It's also minutes from Selfridges. I won't stay anywhere else now when visiting London.",5,2017,01,04
123,Family Christmas break,"Stayed with my wide and 4 young kids aged from 4 - 13. Location was perfect for site seeing, shopping and restaurant. Staff were great. Hotel rooms and facilities were perfect for our needs. we will be back!",4,2017,01,04

the Location of the hotel was just perfect we took the Piccadilly Line from Heathrow, changed at green park to the jubilee line and stopped at bond street station - a few minutes' walk from the hotel. our room was large clean and modern with 
 great bathtub, luxurious bathrobe and thick towels
the hotel staff was nice and helpful. we also had really good pizza ordered to the room It came real fast. I recommend this hotel and plan to book it again on my next trip to London",5,2017,01,03
123,my favorite hotel in london,This was my second time staying at the Marylebone and it will continue to be my choice hotel for each visit. Why stay somewhere else when I love the hotel and its location. The staff is friendly and knowledgable about the area which is always a benefit when traveling to London. The hotel is located on a quiet street and the room was exceptional. Five minute walk to the Bond Street tube station. Cannot wait to return to London and stay here again. ,5,2017,01,03
123,Marylebone Hotel - guarantee not to disappoint,"as we have done for the last three years when we decided to travel to London to bring in the new year The only place to stay in London is the Marylebone hotel. This hotel is ia absolutely fabulous and has always met our expectations, in fact the hotel is now a family favourite and we would not stay anywhere else. Located close Oxford street is is ideal for avid shoppers, while those you a enjoy good food and atmospheric pubs and bars will not be diaappointed with the choice to be found in Marylebone.",5,2017,01,03
123,"Lovely hotel, great location - just needs to work on guest services ","I have been staying at this hotel with my partner for the past few nights. The hotel is beautiful with a boutique feel. Very cosy feel in the interior especially at this time of year. 

We did encounter a few problems, the doorman and general staff were very friendly and welcoming on arrival.  However, whenever we approached the reception staff they did not smile until you did, it was bizarre.  During coffee some of the other hotel guests also passed the same comment. 

Upon using the shower, we opened the towel to find a used plaster stuck to it. Then on the day of checking out they posted my bill under the door, when I opened this I also found the bills for two other guests containing their personal information.  When I contacted the reception the duty manager said ok I will only be charged only for my bill. No concern or apology that they had shared other guests details with me or put their bills in with mine.  They also took additional money from my credit card without advising me. Again the duty manager did not seem concerned by this, in fact got almost angry when I suggested she should have more concern. ",3,2017,01,03
123,Excellent Value,Alround experience was great.... Especially Gunther from reception was outstanding. The rooms are very cosy. Breakfast was also very nice. I find the people of this hotel extremely friendly and accommodating!!!,5,2017,01,02
123,Great place to stay,"Location is excellent, service and personnel very helpful, great restaurant, full English breakfast terrific too.  We stayed there in early October and again in December over the Christmas school break with 5 more members of our family.  They also enjoyed the use of the gym and swimming pool. We highly recommend the hotel and area when in London.",5,2017,01,02
123,Excellent Service,"Stay for 2 + 3 nights recently. 

Location Rating - Average. Need some walking to the Oxford st.

Room Rating - Good. First 2 nights. Room small but toilet big. Room clean, bed comfortable and extra room service in the evening. Second stay of 3 nights. Room big but toilet very small.

The door is heavy as you can hear alot of door noise from the other rooms. Need to check their alarm system. Give me a shock in the middle of the night on the first night there and a couple of times in the morning during our stay. They have comfortable and good quality bedroom slipper.

Service - Excellent. From Doorman to the reception. They are very attentive and helpful. Especially the 2 young Doorman who always greet us when they see us. They are very helpful when we ask them for any information. Well done..",4,2017,01,02
123,Extremely attentive and friendly staff,We had 3 rooms and were there for my husbands 50th bday for 2 nights. The rooms were absolutely lovely with a walk in closet. Gunther helped us to sort out many things and even sent champagne up once he knew it was my husbands bday. The concierge also helped us book good restaurants and i would definitely stay there again. Also location wise very convenient and close to oxford street.,5,2017,01,01
123,Amazing,"Stayed in hotel for New Year, I accidentally booked one night instead of two which I wanted, room was beautiful but a little on the small side. Gunther at reception without haste added on one more night for us and upgraded the room with no hassle, can't thank him enough, made our stay amazing. Beautiful venue with the most friendly staff.",5,2017,01,01
123,Amazing,"My partner and I had a wonderful 3 night stay at the Marylebone between Christmas and New Year, I would highly recommend this time to visit London and The Marylebone.

Oxford Street was a very quick 5/7 minute walk down the quiet Welbeck Street and the exit left you directly next to Debenhams on Oxford Street and opposite Bond tube station. Likewise Regent Street was a quick 15 minute walk.

The staff were polite, helpful and filled with knowledge of London so happy to point you in the right direction and give advise (especially one doorman, unfortunately didn't get his name)

We ordered room service one evening, a little over £50 for 2 meals and 2 wines which would be similar to eating out. 

The location of this hotel is perfect, the food was lovely and the room was small but very clean and modern.

I would 100% recommend this hotel and will more than likely be returning in the near future.
",5,2017,01,01
123,Best personalized service ever experienced ,"I was in London for a long weekend with a friend, we stayed 5 nights at the Marylebone hotel. From the arrival until departure in taxi, it was a pleasure to be welcomed so warmly by the team. 
From the doorman ""Jean""/John to check-in ""Fabrizio"", Room service, restaurant (which was very tasty) ""Justyne"", housekeepers (pampering us with water cookies and chocolates), everybody was just so smiling, attentionate and helpful. To highlight specially as he was ""la crème de la crème"", was the most professional, serviceable and friendly concierge I have ever met:""Jack"". He was simply amazing!
The hotel room we took was standard, so its size was small as we could expect but well designed, functional and super clean. We did not feel in a shoebox at all! 
I would recommend this hotel to all my friends as the location and value for money were excellent.
I am looking forward to being back there soon!",5,2016,12,30
123,Overnight stay,"Came into London to see a show, and decided to book an overnight stay. Having used the Marylebone for meetings thought I would see what the rooms were like. Booking on line was very easy and got a great price. Arrived and found the hotel all very festive with the Christmas decorations looking fantastic. Check in was quick and was advised we had been upgraded to a Jnr Suite. Stayed in room 386 which overlooks Marylebone lane. The room is very large and everything you need is included, struggled to find the TV in the lounge at first until I realised it was built into the very big mirror. The bed itself was huge and great night sleep. Went down to the 108 pantry which is there breakfast room, Large counter of cold buffet and hot food all ordered and cooked fresh from the kitchen. Service as always was very good, friendly staff with a big smile, I have always been impressed by the Food and Beverage but equally impressed by the rooms now. Well worth staying.",5,2016,12,30
123,Excellent stay with a nice upgrade!,"Great hotel in a great location. I had booked for my parents to visit at Christmas and as I had spent quite a number of nights in this hotel during the year, the hotel staff kindly upgraded my parents to a suite. 

Overall, great stay for my parents, with great service. I recommend highly! ",5,2016,12,30
123,Excellent ,"This hotel knows how to make guests feel special. They did everything they could to make sure the stay was perfect! Spacious room, clean and a lovely touch with the turn down. Door men are super friendly. Thank you we will return.",5,2016,12,30
123,Another wonderful stay,"It was wonderful to come back to the Marylebone Hotel again, our 5th stay now over a few years and it keeps getting better. The staff are so well trained but genuinely lovely people that not welcome us back every time, they remember my 3 children and make a fuss of them and we feel like we are at home. Gunther especially went out of his way to welcome us on arrival and made sure our rooms were ready as quickly as possible even though we arrived early. I cannot fault the warm reception and homely welcoming feel of this hotel while being extremely professional at the same time. The rooms and food were lovely as always but I really notice about the hotel the more we go is just how fantastic its location is. Marylebone seems to be only 10mins from every where I go..winter wonderland, natural history museum, Covent Garden, primrose hill, Mayfair - and is the nicest high street I've seen. Brilliant!! Thank you again, We will be back.",5,2016,12,29
123,Great!,"We had a great experience at the hotel. The location is perfect! A big ""thank you"" to the doorman who helped us with taxi's, directions and the perfect recommendation on 12/18 at a nearby wine and cheese restaurant.... the fondue was just what we were looking for. 
I wish I could remember his name... he was wonderful.
Overall great stay and hope to return soon.",5,2016,12,29
123,Amazing hotel ,"Wonderful hotel with a very ""like home feeling""  I want to mention two lovely people - mr Gunther and mr Zan  They both absolutely professionals , very nice and kind with of course an excellent service. Very recommended! ",5,2016,12,28
123,Best service ever,"Stayed here at Christmas.  As we only had a shower and wanted a bath we were up graded to a suite.  Very clean and quiet.  Only one moan was no heated towel rail
in bathroom.  Service was first rate.  Any request was quickly dealt with.  Room service was very quick although you do pay £4 per tray.  Food in restaurant very good again
service good here.  Door men always there to open door for you call taxi etc.  The area is also very nice with some lovely shops, and near many attractions. Would definitely stay here again.",5,2016,12,28
123,The Best Or Nothing,"The Best Or Nothing - this is what comes to my mind after I spend time in this hotel.
The Best Service and The Best staff  I ever meat in London Hotels. I would say super  friendly staff.
Next time only -  The Marylebone Hotel. 
",5,2016,12,28
123,A Gem!!,"Never have I ever felt so pampered. 
I spent five days in London over Christmas and every moment spent at The Marylebone Hotel was a true blessing. 
The staff is extremely kind, smiling and helpful. The property is clean. The food is delicious. 
On my birthday which fell during my stay, a bottle of champagne and a card were waiting for me in the room. What a lovely surprise when I opened the door. 
Everybody at The Marylebone deserves a note of appreciation. However a special note goes to those I personally interacted with, who made my long weekend getaway especially unique: Jack, the concierge who went so far as walking outside to wave goodbye while we were leaving the hotel (I hope that you're having a much deserved great vacation); Justin at breakfast room whose accommodating smile made our breakfast experience lovelier than it could be; Maria, Dayana and Fabrizio at the reception desk who made the check in and check out process easier than one could ever imagine and last but not least the two doormen, whose names I failed to write down (sorry!!), whose greetings made getting in and out of the hotel a ""let's do it again"" experience. 
Thank you. 
I'll be back. Hopefully soon. ",5,2016,12,28
123,Small rooms made to fit,"A lovely hotel with great lounge spaces. The rooms are quite small, the bathroom is very small and made to fit exactly what you need with no extra space to spare. Very thin walls so you can heat your neighbours well. Breakfast was a bit dissapointing in available choice, but the pool and fitness area made up for the shortcommings. Great location for shopping!",3,2016,12,27
123,Comfy hotel with gym & spa,Bed linens and quality were superior. Bathroom top clean. Nice cosy hotel with relaxed atmosphere. On the improvement side - continental breakfast could be richer in selection. Access to high-end gym is also one of the reasons why would stay again.,5,2016,12,27
123,Well-located smart 4-star Hotel,":) Warm welcome, comfy beds, delicious & varied breakfast, smart décor, close to London Underground & shops/restaurants, good/sized rooms, reasonable price especially for Christmas period

123,Professional ,"This was our second stay at The Marylebone this year. 

All staff at the Marylebone are professional, courteous and efficient. Reception was handled quickly and hotel was very helpful when we requested a late departure.  Room service was quick and breakfast was good.
Hotel is ideally situated for Harley Street and Oxford Street. It is in a quieter part of the city so there is less street noise and I would recommend the hotel.",5,2016,12,26
123,WOW this is amazing location property and great breakfast,"Loved the stay here .
breakfast is amazing.. fresh fruits and lovely omelette  .. free water from reception .. located near oxford street .. easy to walk down .. 
Hotel fish and chips are good and enjoyed wine in the bar .. Good Service ..",5,2016,12,25
123,Magnificent experience ,Me and my wife were treating ourselves by staying to the hotel on our 2 days off. Was a last minute decision  and just went with it . We wanted a nice room to stay in all day but the process generally is a little complicated especially when you just go in a hotel and you ask for a room. Never know what you're getting! We approached the front desk and lovely Maria Ramon came to the rescue as she was quite helpful and made the whole process smooth and quick.  Maria also recommended us restaurants and other places we could do around the hotel. Needless to say that the whole expereince at the hotel was amazing.Thankyou Maria and all the lovely staff of the hotel.,5,2016,12,22
123,Great place to stay ,"Once again a memorable trip to London mainly due to Marylebone Hotel. The location and hospitality both are just too good. 

When it comes to hospitality from the doorman (Mohammad) to everyone are just amazing. It feels like coming back home. We had 5 rooms this time for 11 days and service through out was outstanding. 

One person you need to look for is GUNTHER at the front desk. One word for him ""AMAZING"". The only reason we came back to Marylebone is because of him. The rooms were what we requested and because of him things were so smooth and easy. He is truly an amazing host and always smiling. He is everyone's 'to go to person'. I will again come back to London and will definitely stay here for the third time just because of him. Well done Gunther 100 marks for your hospitality. ",5,2016,12,22
123,Most friendly and cleanest ,"We are still enjoying our stay at the Marylebone hotel and Gunther helped us at every step making it the most comfortable stay at this ideally located and cleanest hotel.
Thank you so much Mr.Gunther!!!",5,2016,12,22
123,A Truly Special Christmas Party,"I would like to extend my thanks to The Marylebone Hotel for all of their hard work in making our office Christmas Party so fantastic! The events staff, Keeva and Kevin, made planning the party so easy and helped us create a tailored package.

On the night, the hotel's pantry area was made up to look very Christmassy and Emmanuel and his team provided unbeatable service.

10/10 5 Star experience! Thanks everyone at The Marylebone!!",5,2016,12,22
123,Best Location,"This is a great hotel perfectly located behind oxford street exactly behind John Lewis and House of Frazer. ST Christopher's Place is a minute away.

The hotel has a modern contemporary decor and the rooms are beautifully appointed. We booked a deluxe room and it was spacious with underfloor heating.

We didn't book the room with breakfast but the brasserie serves delicious breakfast.

Overall it is a perfectly located hotel for those who want to shop and be at oxford street and bond street within minutes.

We will definitely go back to this hotel!",4,2016,12,22
123,Fantastic position wonderful staff,"Arrived in the boiling heat of September and we were welcomed with cold towels and cold drinks ...
Wonderful attention to details spent a week at the hotel and found it to be close to everything . 
Definitely recommend it for serious shoppers  as it's so easy to bring your bags back to the hotel .",4,2016,12,22

123,another great christmas party event,we have returned to this venue for the past few years because it is local and the service is always excellent. the food remains consistently good. Our party  usually range from 60-70 guests who never turn up at the same time because they come from various hospital departments theatres etc so cant rush off to party whilst patients need them. Its great to have a venue that is sensitive to our needs and copes with the many changes and late arrivals seamlessly. For 1night our guests get the great care and attention they usually lavish on their patients and its all down to the excellent team at Marylebone. we get requests from our guests every year to return to this venue so I have no reservations recommending it especially for large groups.,5,2016,12,21
123,"Great location, service, and accommodations!","Took a couples trip to London just before Christmas. The Marylebone was beautiful (and always smelled delicious) plus there were xmas trees everywhere. It was 15-25 minutes walking distance from Oxford street (shopping), tons of great places to eat, and close to SoHo (aka all the shows). Breakfast was served from 6:30-10:30 (which was great for our varying schedules day to day from early tour days to sleep in days while trying to adjust from jetlag). Breakfast on site was fabulous. Yummy drinks and pastries and a delicious full menu to order from. Their gym in the basement is a little off the beaten path but has anything you could possibly want, plus a pool and a steam room. Room service was quick and delicious and was served 24 hours. Staff was friendly and helpful and started to recognize us at breakfast and they were all so nice...overall a great trip with the Marylebone!",5,2016,12,21
123,Another Wonderful Stay at The Marylebone Hotel,"Our hotel of choice in London!  We have stayed at The Marylebone a number of times and continue to be impressed with the staff and property.  In particular Jack McKie, Assistant Front Desk Manager was of great assistance.  Jack went out of his way to ensure all our needs were met and our stay was memorable.  All staff are very pleasant and it is obvious much detail on customer service is given in training.  We have recommended The Marylebone Hotel to numerous friends and all return home with rave reviews.  Keep up the good work and high standards!!",5,2016,12,20
123,Simply Perfect !,"This was out first time at the Marylebone but certainly not the last ... 
Location: as if you're literally on Oxford / Regent streets... within our 4 days stay, we used the tube one once ...
Rooms: the standard rooms are fairly small however perfectly maintained, comfortable and pleasant !
Food: we had the (full) breakfast included and in one word -- awesome !  
Staff: ultimately most important IMO... The Marylebone staff was without execption - outstanding.

We got the recommendation to stay at the Marylebone from a good friend who lived in London for many years and I couldn't be more happy we followed her advice. 
Highly recommended !!! ",5,2016,12,20
123,Excellent place in a nice neighbourhood,"I have been a frequent visitor to this hotel for business reasons.

123,Excellent hotel and location ,"I stayed at this hotel for a conference. The hotel accommodation and location are superb. The meeting rooms are well equipped and the food hits the spot.

123,back and things seem a bit run down...,"back here after a good six months and things seem a bit run down... the elevator to the gym is not working, and the solution is... circle the hotel outside in 1 degree Celsius in your short dry fits to get to it, no signs or nothing. so much for warm up. 
returning guests are not offered upgrades or better rooms, asked for a room not overlooking a wall or parking, got one facing the street but VERY small
still a good return on your money but needs some managerial attention to make sure slip is arrested",3,2016,12,19
123,Corporate christmas party,Great venue and space. Friendly staff. The food was good but very small quantities so difficult if you are also offering people a lot of alcohol. Unfortunately there are noise restrictions so you are asked to leave by 10.30/11pm. Would be better for a lunch or sit down dinner but not so much a party. Overall a good experience.,4,2016,12,19
123,Fantastic city centre hotel ,"My wife Caroline and I had the pleasure of staying in this fantastic hotel. With helpful and friendly staff, spacious rooms, lively (& trendy) bar and top food.

We had a great stay & look forward to our next visit. 5 stars from us",5,2016,12,19
123,Great hotel,"Stayed there for 2 nights and it was a great stay. A very nice and clean hotel with very service minded personal. The breakfast was great (but maybe to expensive). The gym and the pool were also great. The location was central with walking distance to many places. The only ""irritating"" thing was that the floor was very uneven so you cold almost feel ""drunk"".",5,2016,12,18

Kevin Passon, the events sales executive, is an asset to this hotel. He organised our evening with such professionalism, care and positivity and I had every confidence in him to deliver a wonderful evening. Which it was!

123,My favorite hotel in London!,"I've been a recurrent hotel guest at the Marylebone, and love staying there. Nice rooms, gym/pool, great location and super friendly staff. Best of all, their fidelity program gives you occasional room upgrade. I stay there whenever I can, as I feel it's the best value for the money.",5,2016,12,13
123,Overnight break away from mummy-duties,"I stayed here last week for one night. It was a gift from my husband to have a little break away from being a mum & wife etc. I had a fantastic overnight stay - the Spa facilities are excellent and the restaurant and the bistro are fantastic. Gunther at Guest Relations helped to get me the latest check-out possible as he understood how short my little holiday was. 
The specific micro-location of this hotel is one of the best things about it. I am a Londoner so I know the City well and it was great to be so close to Bond St etc but yet far away to feel peace and quiet. Proximity to Marylebone Village is the most fantastic thing. 
My room was small and average and the price wasn't particularly cheap as we booked last minute. But if you are willing to pay and book ahead you can get far better rooms and prices. 
Highly recommend.",4,2016,12,13
123,"Perfect experience, couldn't be happier!","I organised to stay here the night I proposed and I couldn't of been happier with the service. Aurora was extremely helpful and pleasant. She went above and beyond to make our day even more special. 
Dinner was delicious and the great service continued into the restaurant. The waiter recommend all the dishes and they were beautiful. 
It was amazing and we want to thank aurora and the staff. We will definitely be back again",5,2016,12,12
123,A lovely stay at a lovely hotel,"Just returned from 3 great nights here.

The hotel is great...Great location. Great staff. Really well done. I was hoping for just a little bit more on the rooms though, and by that I mean the look of them.

We had a suite, which was very small, but then, this is London. However it was still basically just a room, rather than a closet :) Bathroom was very nice, but the decor of the rooms is pretty basic, nothing special here.

The rest of the hotel is really cozy and eclectically done.

The gym (fitness center), was amazing—mainly because it was a real health club, not just part of a hotel, as in most cases.

The continental breakfast was OK, nothing great and in my opinion, not really worth the price paid, but the restaurant and bar area are very inviting.

Overall, a really nice stay, in a cozy hotel that's well located with great staff.",4,2016,12,12
123,"Great Hotel, really nice staff","We stayed there for 2 nights and it was a perfect stay. The room was really spacious. The breakfast is also really good.
The plus was the staff who was really helpful. Aurore was lovely and gave us many pieces of advice to have a perfect stay.
Again, great stay",4,2016,12,11
123,An excellent stay ,"My partner and I had an excellent overnight stay at this hotel this weekend. The staff are very welcoming and friendly and are always looking for ways to help you. We stayed in a superior double room and although a little compact (and the bathroom very compact!) the quality and cleanliness was exceptional. The hotel is in a brilliant location and has a lovely bar towards the back of the hotel that is worth knowing about. Upon checkout we were even given complementary bottles of water for the journey home, a lovely extra touch. ",5,2016,12,11
123,Excellent all round,"In short, there is nothing to fault about this hotel. All of the staff are extremely attentive, helpful, and a credit to the hotel. The room we stayed in was of a good size and to a high standard (with the comfiest bed I have ever slept in). Breakfast was excellent, with a everything you could hope for on offer. All of this combined with the fact that you are just two minutes from Marylebone high street and it's a no brainer.

Having stayed in various places across London when the parents have come to visit and inevitably been disappointed (and ripped off!), we've finally found the place that ticks all the boxes and provides excellent value for money. 

(Sadly did not get chance to try out the pool and spa but it looks very impressive)

Highly recommend to all.",5,2016,12,11
123,Service,"This Hotel is very good located for visiting London by feet and all the things for a friendly and good organised situation is given. Especially a kindly Guest Agent called Gunther Schildwachter help us every time very friendly in all things, for example we ask for restaurants or any else.",5,2016,12,10
123,Servicr,"Very good service, good atmosphere, very friendly staff and special thanks to Gunther!!
The bedroom is just beautiful. Very nice bar. There are many, very nice furnished, possibilities to sit and relax on the ground floor. The hotel is very close to Regentstreet and Oxfordstreet.  Absolutely worth coming back to!",5,2016,12,10
123,Superb experience from booking to departure,"This is the second time i've stayed at the Marylebone. I'd be surprised if i stay anywhere else after this. Reservations, on the phone were excellent--good service and an excellent price for our six night stay. On arrival the staff was fast and efficient, literally waiting for our arrival. Room was ready quickly and it was excellent in all aspects. The staff was of very high quality, positively surrounding us with help or suggestions. (i'm not kidding!) Breakfast, part of our package, was excellent, fast coffee and the Int'l NYT right there. We were on holiday, so i was paying out-of-pocket, so the value was important. Great location 7 minutes from the Underground at Bond Street. Great shopping at Selfridges and M and S--really all along Oxford street just six minutes away. Only wrinkle was printing boarding passes in the business center--broken equipment and it took a while to fix, but fix it they did! So all in all just a superb experience, and after 6 nights that's saying something!!",5,2016,12,09
123,Superb Hotel!!,"I have the task every year of organising our corporate Christmas Party.  This year I made enquiries to hold the event at The Marylebone Hotel, and from my first meeting with the events team (Kevin and Keeva) I was completely sold.  The fabulous customer service I have received started at that first meeting and has continued even after the party finished!  We held our 'do' on the first floor and we were the first people to use their newly renovated event space (which I signed up to based on seeing some plans many moths ago!), as you can imagine I was slightly nervous as I hadn't actually seen the completed space until a few days before our event, however it was absolutely stunning!!  Everyone who attended the party said it was by far the best event we have held and couldn't speak highly enough of the venue, the staff, and the food and drinks.  Thank you to all at The Marylebone for making it such a great evening.  Special thanks to Keeva and Kevin who took all the pressure off me in terms of organising everything, to Ben the sommelier who helped choose some fabulous wines, and to Cally and her team who looked after us all on the night!  I can't recommend this hotel highly enough!",5,2016,12,09
123,London day out,The Marylebone area is a great place to visit. It takes you away from the hustle and bustle of the city.it reminds  me of a quaint English village plenty to do and if you like walking this is the area to be..,5,2016,12,08
123,"Fabulous hotel, wonderful staff","Excellent hotel the staff are so helpful in every way from start to finish they couldn't do enough to help us make our stay wonderful, a very special thank you to Jack on reception he was so very kind and patient when helping us noting was to much for him to do. All the hotel staff are a credit to the doyle collection. Excellent experience,staff & beautiful hotel. Looking forward to my next stay 😀",5,2016,12,08
123,Really great hotel with lovely attention to detail,This is a lovely hotel in London where we were treated really well. We were greeted by a bottle of bubbly in our room to celebrate a birthday and a hand written card which was very much appreciated as a wonderful welcome. Our room was really cosy yet smart. We were very well looked after. My only slight criticism is that the cocktails in the bar were not the greatest we've ever had.,5,2016,12,07
123,Beautiful hotel - interior designer's delight,"The main lobby in the hotel is beautiful and well-appointed. We stayed for one night at the beginning and one night at the end of our trip and we were in two different suites. The rooms themselves were small (which is typical for London) but beautiful and had everything we needed. The bathrooms were lovely. 
My only complaint was there was no hospitality suite to change and refresh from a long overseas flight before our room was ready so I ended up having to change in a bathroom stall.",5,2016,12,07
123,Great location and very good front of house staff. ,"The visit to London was for my wife's birthday and the staff at the hotel were very helpful with any request. The complimentary bottle of Prosecco a charming touch!
Even the taxi drivers make compliments about the door staff and quite rightly so!
Thanks to the Concierge who also did everything to make our stay enjoyable. 
",5,2016,12,05
123,Another Great Visit,"Always welcoming and feels like my second home. The staff, the breakfast, the GYM, the rooms are second to none for the value. I never stay anywhere else and will continue to make the Marylebone my hotel of choice when I am in London!",5,2016,12,05
123,Exceeding expectations,"Instagram led me to this gem in the heart of London, and so happy I found it.

From the moment I arrived it felt special and the team made me feel at home and very much like I had 'arrived'.

The suite is quite simply spectacular, not so much for size or fit out, which both are decent, but because of the terrace which is better than it looks on social media.

This would be an amazing find in central London for the hot summer days, and I will look forward to getting the chance to try it out, although it wasn't half bad in December, once the sun was out. Fully equipped with outdoor fire place and string over head heaters it worked perfectly to temper the chilly air. with the windows down and the roof open it kept the chilly breeze away and allowed me to absorb the sun as well.

The large screen TV's are perfect in both the lounge and outdoor and yet another one to watch the X factor result whilst in bed too finished the entertainment effect well.

Bathroom was a decent size, good walk in shower, and again only one sink which can be challenging if a couple travel, we can make do I am sure. The bedroom had quality bedding , pillows and whilst the bed was OK for just me, if I was traveling it may well be a little small for my partner, even if she was not as portly as I...worth thinking about. The bed also seemed to move, which could create challenges if traveling as a couple for various reasons.

Grooming products were good, and well stocked, mini bar and so forth all good, nice touch for endless bottled waters, Nespresso machine and some nibbles provided as well. The English champagne I didn't sample, maybe next time...

All up, very happy with my choice and a massive improvement on the disappointment I got staying at the Flemings Hotel recently. 

Well done Team Marylebone...",4,2016,12,05
123,I returned and was even more pleased,"Often one is disappointed to return to a venue, but the staff are even more welcoming than last time I stayed here, and the overall experience is excellent - comfortable room, good food, and great staff (Diana on reception in particular)",5,2016,12,05
123,Overall pretty good,"Firstly - staff were absolutely brilliant; from the lovely smiley and helpful guys on the door, the excellent reception team through to the room service and housekeeping - all top notch. Hotel OK. Team make it.",4,2016,12,03
123,Excellent service in this hotel,"Comfortable and clean superior rooms, excellent service, service minded and friendly staff, fantastic room service with delicious food, clean and high quality lounge area...highly recommending this hotel to anyone visiting London",4,2016,12,03
123,Super kind reception,"Great hotel, great location, but in particular great staff, supportive and kind, thanks Elena Salvatore!

They treat you like a friend. 

There is another hotel nearby, Hotel M., which costs almost the double with 1/3 of the service quality provided.",5,2016,12,01
123,"Very good hotel, little to complain about","This is the 2nd year we stayed at this hotel during black friday weekend and both times we have had consistent good service and very friendly members of staff (although most don't seem to be of English mother-tongue resulting in a few communication glitches). The beds are amazingly comfortable and the breakfast was good. There's a nice tea-room to have tea and cakes/scones and a bar should you wish to go for drinks. My only issue is with the restaurant who's menu has not really changed in a year (shame) and also is extremely noisy as it is in the same room as the bar. The hotel is also greatly located =)
The bathrooms of the superior rooms could be a bit bigger too ;)",4,2016,11,29
123,Excellent!,"Stayed at this hotel for the third time this year. Great location and still quite.
Chic ambiance in lobby and bar.
Staff is very helpful and friendly.
Gunter from the front desk is simply amazing!
Looking forward to my next trip to London,surely will stay here again.",5,2016,11,29
123,Older Couple Very Satisfied,"My wife and I stayed in the Marylebone during a short visit to London last week.  We had a lovely stay.  The location is top class, the staff were most obliging, the lobby area is very comfortable and roomy, the  bedroom was a lovely size, the breakfast was excellent.  All in all, a thoroughly enjoyable experience.  ",5,2016,11,29
123,Excellent service from staff,"Having previously stayed here in June, when a slight incident flawed our stay, the enchanting guest relations manager, Long Voong, was hugely apologetic and kindly offered us a complimentary breakfast of our choice and a free night's stay which we recently took up.  On arrival, we were efficiently allocated to the room we'd booked by Gunther. Shortly after we got to our elegant, comfortable room, the phone rang and Gunther explained that he'd checked our booking history and realised our previous experience hadn't been as The Marylebone would have hoped and offered us an upgrade to the recently refurbished Roof Terrace Suite, to 'make this stay a special experience'.  Well that turned out to be a bit of an understatement!  We were escorted to an enormous suite of rooms, with a balcony to match (all protected by retractable covers and heated so that we could sit out and either look at the view or watch TV under one of the snuggly blankets).  The rest of the suite was elegantly and comfortably furnished in a stylish yet understated way, with everything we could have wanted (and a lot more besides).  After an evening of indulgence and a fabulous night's sleep (I'm often an insomniac, so the 7 hours straight through was both unusual and very welcome), we were provided with a delicious breakfast (fabulous array of options both on the buffet and a la carte).  My only suggestions for improvements would relate to the breakfast room, where tables were often impractically small and staff very, very busy, meaning that the same standards of service could not be adhered to as we encountered in the rest of the hotel.  That said, they were all unfailingly polite and clearly doing their best - as did all the staff we encountered.  Even the porter went well out of his way to track down a spare newspaper for us (we'd not expected to be wanting to spend a leisurely morning enjoying such fabulous surroundings!) on the Sunday morning.  He went well beyond being professional and didn't give up at the first hurdle but determinedly tracked one down for us.  I would highly recommend this hotel for business, couples and groups of friends.  It's not cheap but it's still good value.",5,2016,11,28
123,Another excellent stay,"Stayed last week after a busy travel schedule, so it was good to see a familiar face and a very pleasant greeting.  Gunther checked me in, was efficient, as usual, and gave me an excellent room.  Staff at this hotel deserve recognition for their warmth and their smiles, they always seem happy!",5,2016,11,28
123,Great venue for a company Christmas lunch,"We organised a lunch for 70 people at the 108 pantry which was thoroughly enjoyable. The food was delicious, guests were able to choose a selection, it wasn't just one meat and one veggie option. There were lots of staff on hand on the day, so if you needed anything, there was someone to ask. The staff on the day Kelly and Andreas were helpful and kept us informed of our spend! Kevin, who worked on the event with us was very organised and flexible. He was in touch with us regularly prior to the event and made sure everything ran smoothly on the day. I would recommend it as a venue for a corporate function.",5,2016,11,28
123,A great find!,"Stopped here overnight for a mini theatre break with my 11 year old daughter.
We received a warm welcome from Gunther who made a real fuss of my daughter as it was her birthday! 
The rooms were fab, beds comfy and quiet at night. Although the bathroom was small it was nicely appointed and the shower with gorgeous smellies made it so we didn't want to get out of it!
Breakfast was yummy, I had traditional and daughter had blueberry pancakes.

Would genuinely recommend and will use next time we stay overnight in London!",5,2016,11,27
123,Very nice service,Our room was upgraded to penhouse suite for the first night. Elena at the reception provided very good service. Regular room is small but cozy and clean. Breakfast included provide continental buffet and can pay extra for English Breakfast.,5,2016,11,27
123,So lovely for children,"While I saw few children in the hotel, which allowed for quiet, the staff and especially Gunther went above and beyond to make my child feel delighted and appreciated. The turndown service brought milk and cookies when we had returned in the late afternoon, so thoughtful and Gunther provided  most helpful directions for best sights for children and presented my child with a hotel monogrammed bear and a coloring book to ensure she'd stay entertained during dinner. Memory of a lifetime. Thank You. ",5,2016,11,26
123,One of the best quality/price ratio in central London,"We spent last weekend at the Marylebone together with my 7-year-old daughter. It was the first trip for her to London so I wanted to make sure the experience was going to be nice. I had the opportunity to stay at this hotel before during business trips and when I started organizing our trip, this is the first hotel I checked because it offers great value for the money you spend, which is not always the case in London where lots of hotels aren't worth what they charge. 
The experience at the hotel started with the check in and we were very warmly welcomed by Elena - thank you again for being so nice to my daughter - who also assisted us with our check out and was the perfect example of the great service provided by the hotel. The room was not very big but the size was good for the two of us, and it was nicely decorated and very clean, especially the white marble bathroom. 
We had the opportunity to have dinner late on Saturday evening, the restaurant was pleasant and food was good. For having stayed at this hotel before, I know breakfasts are excellent, there is a lot of choice and you can really enjoy a true English breakfast there. 
The swimming pool was closed for works I think so we couldn't use it but I've tried it before and I remember it is quite big and there is a jacuzzi as well.
Lastly, it is very well located, near Oxford St and Regent St, several tube stations and close to shops and things to do and see. 
I would highly recommend the hotel both for leisure and travel.",5,2016,11,23
123,Perfect boutique hotel,"Had a lovely stay in the Marylebone, beautiful clean rooms, great interior decor particularly loved the cobalt velvet chairs in the low lit reception. Gunther in reception and Kelly in the restaurant made my stay a perfect treat after a long day! ",5,2016,11,23
123,A great hotel to stay in Central London!,"If you are looking for good hotel and value for your money in Central London, stay at Marylebone Hotel. Good Food, Clean Rooms, Friendly staff and just a short walk to Regent Street & Oxford Circus. Rooms are fine, amenities are good as well. Jus bring some of your toiletries (toothbrush kit, comb and shaver) as you might not have these in your room. but overall it was a good stay and you will get your money's worth.",4,2016,11,23
123,An absolute gem,"A central London boutique hotel not to be missed. You feel looked after the moment you step in front of the hotel. The rooms are very clean, comfortable and quiet (you can actually sleep with the window wide open even if you are in the centre of London). The staff is genuinely friendly and attentive. But maybe the best part is their breakfast. At last somewhere offering the full range from a truly healthy and delicious choice all the way to a full English. A mention goes to Petre' and his team for the best cappuccino this side of Italy (actually better than in most Italian bars).",5,2016,11,22
123,We had a wonderful stay!,"The entire staff was welcoming and helpful. We had a wine and cheese pairing with Ben that was informative, casual and fun-and worth the cost. One of the top rated places for fish and chips, The Golden Hind, is on the other side of the street from the bar. The location made getting around easy!",5,2016,11,21
123,The hotel is good but the concierge is just perfect,"Have been there for work, trying to find a nice hotel in central London with decent size rooms. My last experience has been a nightmare. This time I took my family with me. Everything went smooth, the room was big enough to fit two adults and a toddler who enjoyed playing on the floor. Nice service (even though they forgot to clean the tea mugs..), perfect position, but what really has been outstanding was the concierge. Now, usually the people at the front desk are nice, but this was just another level. They took care of us and they loved and played with my 7 months daughter every time we passed by. Everyone has been great but Elena has been outstanding. She took care of us, she even helped me retrieve my phone, forgot on a cab while going to the airport (thank you nice taxi driver!). All of us loved staying at the Marylebone and you Elena made it an even better staying. Thank you!",5,2016,11,20
123,Awesome staff!,"I spent 8 nights here in November and the staff was simply over the top awesome.  The concierge the bellman, the wait staff - everyone was so kind making sure I had everything I needed for this business trip. I'd like to personally thank Elena, Rahem, Ryas, Rama, Michael, Zan, and Nico  - they were over the top professional and certainly gave the Marylebone a great reputation in my book.  This hotel is close to the underground (Bond) which made traveling London easy.  It is in a great location - very close to Hyde Park.  The rooms are a little small but adequate.  I will return!!  The picture is of the bellman as he greeted us for the first time.  Thanks for making my trip special.",5,2016,11,17
123,good and cozy hotel.,"I arrived at the hotel to visit the wtm exhibition,
After 9 pm.
the staff Greeted me with a smile, my  room was ready with a great smell,
I had a problem with the booking but they told me pleas go  sleep and will take care of of it tomorrow make me feel  at home.
The hotel is walking distance from bond staisen  5 min walk.
the hotel is, highly recommended for both business and vacation.
The hotel's bar is recommended for lunch and diner 
the  breakfast is very good  with a great staff.",5,2016,11,17
123,Ever so slightly underwhelming,"I found my stay there ever so slightly underwhelming. Rooms are small, even upgraded ones, while the limitations of a 1970s building (low ceilings, lack of light, windowless corridors) undoubtedly impinged upon the experience. Great location, but expensive for what it is.",3,2016,11,17
123,Great Service and location!,We usually stay in more expensive hotels when in London - but as this was part of a longer trip we wanted something at a lower price point but still of good quality.I just loved everything! And it was a real great experience. Thank you Gunther!!!,5,2016,11,17
123,Top service ever in London,The start of the check in process was with Gunther and I could not believe his customer service. He was very concerned with asking how our trip was and if there was anything he could do to make our arrival more pleasant. The room we received was as we requested and it made my stay very pleasant for 3 days,5,2016,11,16
123,Could not have been better,The employees of the Marylebone simply made our trip the best we have ever taken.  Elena at the counter when we checked in was so helpful and very patient.  After4 days there and being greeted so charmingly we ask for a place to go watch the FSU football game.  She tried to get it at the Marylebone but instead found this little sports bar for us to go to after we had gone to a show.  She even called us that day while we were out to let us know where to go.  She printed tube/walking directions from our play to the sports bar.  This was huge for us and so much appreciated.  Thank you Elena for being so willing to help us - it made our trip - to be able to watch our football game while in London.  Can't say enough about the Marylebone staff.  We had a family room for 3 people and it was very nicely arranged.  the location is within walking distance to the tube (Bond) and we were able to get around very nicely.,5,2016,11,15
123,London hotels are expensive and this is no exception,"This is quite a bit more to than an average chain hotel. But its location, the quality of the rooms, super comfy beds and outstanding staff, mean it's worth every penny. So lovely!

Room service was excellent food, but very pricey.  If I was going to skimp I'd go out for food - and it is London after all so plenty of choice - but would still choose to stay here every time.

Be warned though - once you've stayed her it'll spoil you and you'll never want to downgrade!",5,2016,11,15
123,Great Service and location!,"My stay at the Marylebone great.  The location is convenient to the Underground so it is easy to get around London as well as lots of restaurants and shopping close to the hotel - check out St. Christopher!  The staff were welcoming and helpful - Elena, Mohammad and Fabrizio were great when I checked in - tired after a long fight it was nice to see smiles and receive great service.",5,2016,11,14
123,Too small to be really comfortable,"I would like to write a positive review as most others have previously done but unfortunately this was not my personal experience at the Marylebone Hotel.  I had a ""superior"" room which, although it had superior fittings and furnishings, was really too small to be comfortable, certainly not suitable for two people.  The TV had limited stations and some of these, including at times the BBC, had ""no signal"".  Come on, no signal for the BBC in central London.?  I would describe the bathroom as tiny rather than small.  The door only partially opened and you had to swivel round it to gain access to the toilet or shower.  There was no bath but on a positive note the giant bath towels were great.
At check in I was asked if I wished to have a newspaper.  Got the paper and a bill for it which was rather a surprise and perhaps rather mean.
Used the express check out system and requested a copy of the account to be forwarded to me by email.  After waiting a week, had to phone the hotel and remind them that my account had still not been received.
In summary, the Marylebone is not a bad hotel but I would not return to such a small room.",3,2016,11,14
123,Business Meetings and Executive dinner,"I love working with Kevin and the team at The Marylebone. We have held numerous meetings of multiple sizes in the hotel over the last few months and nothing is too much trouble. The team are attentive to your needs irrespective of how small or trivial and are always on hand to help.  The food is superb and afternoon tea is not to be missed.
I would recommend everyone to try the Marylebone either for business or pleasure. It's a little gem in the hectic world we live in.",5,2016,11,14
123,Great stay ,"I've been to London before and the standard in most hotels are pretty low. But the marylebone is clean, the staff is excellent and the room was very nice. Even the sitting areas in the hotel was cozy and tastefully decorated. The hotel bar is also worth a visit, have a drink before you hit the streets of London! Just a perfect stay! Would stay again, no doubt! ",5,2016,11,14
123,Everything you could wish for in the most convenient spot!,"This is not the first time we've stayed at the Marylebone and it most definitely won't be our last.  The hotel continues to live up to its reputation for first class service with a tireless smile, a high standard of cleanliness, attention to every detail, a polite and extremely obliging staff - from the ever smiling bellboys, to the helpful Front Desk staff - Gunther did his utmost to help us at check in and every time he was on duty.  The hotel is situated in attractive Marylebone Village, less than 10 minutes walk to Oxford Street, Bond Street Tube Station, Oxford Circus, and a couple of minutes walk to attractive Marylebone High Street with an abundance of eateries, cafes, shops and supermarkets.  This is an exceptionally friendly hotel with a unique management that makes your stay a true pleasure.",5,2016,11,14
123,"Great hotel, small rooms - but take a studio suite!","We have stayed here a few times. The hotel is well-located near Marylebone High Street and Selfridges. The service is also good - especially the doorman ""John"" from Romania was very helpful, went out of his way.

After check-in, I had a bath and hung the ""please clean room"" on mh door at 11:50 am. Unfortunately this had not been done by 17:45 when I returned...

Whereas the normal rooms are VERY small, the studio suite I stayed in (which goes for £434 pn) are great, ask for one with a view.

The toiletries are very average.

The room service hamburger I had last night was great, promptly delivered - at £23.69.

Over-all a good hotel, good attitude from most staff.",4,2016,11,14
123,Relaxing solo visit,"I stayed in this hotel before going to Luton airport, it was a sad moment of my life, I was going to a funeral, I felt very welcome, I would like to thank the girl from the housekeeping  (I don't remember the name, I think she was polish) for being so nice to me even if I was a little bit upset for personal reasons...
She just made my day.
Thank you very much",5,2016,11,13
123,Gunther is a great ambassador for The Marylebone,"I am a very regular guest at The Marylebone and usually arrive late at night, after a  long day. Gunther is usually working on the front desk when I arrive. He recognizes me by name straight away and always remembers my room preferences and even thinks to ask after my children. He is a lovely gentleman whose warm welcome and attention to detail make a big difference to my stay at the hotel, and I can see how is like that with other guests too. He's a real asset to the hotel.",5,2016,11,12
123,Great Hotel!,"Very nice hotel! 
We were received by Gunther who took great care of us the whole stay and were available at the hotel all the time!
Super fine hotel and excellent.
There were also a lot of the piccolo's who were extremely kind and very service minded",5,2016,11,12
123,Fabulous hotel,"Stayed here for 2 weeks in Oct/Nov and found the location, staff, and overall service superb.  Deluxe room is the minimum size you need.  The gym in this hotel is also a great bonus - fabulous 18 meter pool and nice range of machines.  If you do stay here and need anything at all, ask for Guenther or Elena - they are both outstanding.",5,2016,11,11
123,Weekend breaks in London,"I have stayed in this Hotel nearly 20 times in the past few years.I find the location fantastic, the staff are wonderful and facilities are superb. It offers direct access to the main shopping areas and theatre town. The 108 Brasserie offers high quality beers and light meals in a wonderful relaxing atmosphere. Pool, leisure & spa treatments are available to costumers after a hard days grind on the pavements of the West End. Gunther & Long have always been extremely helpful to me on my visits to this Doyle Collection Hotel in fashionable London.",5,2016,11,11
123,Use of hotel for business meetings and events,I can thoroughly recommend The Marylebone for business meetings and events. Kevin Passon and the team provide what can only be described as an excellent level of service with the personal touch. I have used this venue on a number of occasions and this would always be my first choice.,5,2016,11,11
123,Excellent Service In Lobby,Visited after work for food and drinks.  Service was excellent in the lobby by Peter.  Very polite and helpful and was always on hand to refresh my drink. Atmosphere was relaxed which was what I was after. Highly recommended ,5,2016,11,10
123,Way of the mark for the price,"No curtains on windows so light poured in, complained so we got moved to an up graded room they said Which was exactly the same size only difference's was it had curtains, a wall papered wall  & larger tv .... BUT it did have the same table as the other room but with no chair!!! with a pot that over 20 pencils in it. ( bizarre!!) 
Way to expensive for the size of room ... plus each morning we got a bill for breakfast & had to go through the same process each morning explaining that we were B&B  & having to wait at least 20 mins each morning for them to double check this info.
We have stayed various times in the sister hotel in Knightsbridge... much better value for money & a more sumptuous feel.. I understand you can pay a premium for location but what we paid here wasn't far of what we have paid when staying at the Landau hotel .. which knocks spots of this place.",2,2016,11,08
123,Amazing customer service!,"My most recent stay at The Marylebone Hotel happened to fall during college football season.  And, since I'm a huge college football fan, I needed to figure out where I could watch a game that started at 11pm on ESPNU.  After trying several locations with the help of the concierge, it was clear that I wasn't going to be able to find a place to watch the game.  

But just as I was giving up hope, Gunter suggested that perhaps I could live stream the game on the business center computer.  After helping me search out the options and paying ESPN a small fee, I was able to watch the entire game.  Talk about going above & beyond -- he really helped me out!  I won't forget his kindness, and service like his is the kind that will ensure my next business trip to London will include a stay at The Marylebone Hotel.",5,2016,11,06
123,Nice modern hotel in great location,Marylebone is a great area to stay - near the centre and lots of nice amenities like shops and restaurants. Hotel is modern and clean and comfortable. Why does Tripadvisor continue with this policy of 200 minimum words! Its a pain.,4,2016,11,06
123,"Superbe location, tiny rooms","I was on business in London for a few days and was booked intonthe Marylebone.
A great location, clean hotel with access to a gym, a pool and a sauna.

The rooms were absolutely tiny and felt very much crammed. Long hallways, which could do with more signs indicating where the room series are as it got a little confusing. 

Cleanliness was great, nothing to be added. The housekeepers fid a great job and would bring you little chocolate in the afternoon.

Check-in/out and reception desk in general was quick, a tad impersonal and somewhat a bit cold. 

Guest relations manager was very professional.

All in all, for the price you pay, reception game could be upped a little with more consideration for the customers. 

A nice, classic hotel a few minutes walk from Oxford street at around 300$ a night. ",4,2016,11,06
123,Great location ,"I've stayed here several times and the location is super if you're on a shopping trip to London. 

Liberty and selfridges are an easy walk .... and Knightsbridge is a quick taxi ride away ( or on a nice day it's a lovely 30 min walk through the park ).

Lots of restaurants -including locando Locatelli - nearby too. 'Social wine and tapas ' being a new restaurant I recently tried & I happily recommend.

The hotel staff are excellent and very accommodating. For example I needed a late check out and there was no problem arranging that. The front of house staff are consistently friendly and helpful.

A few things didn't run as smoothly on my  2 night trip unfortunately 

- noise from a late night Halloween party across the road ,on a private terrace, meant that I couldn't sleep ( a quick thinking hotel would have gotten the party noise addressed .... or dropped off earplugs to the guests). 

- I ordered newspapers which weren't delivered - When ordering I was offered a sign up to their guest programme & was told that as a result my newspaper was free ( it never arrived ).

- my husband had ordered wine for our room- it was delivered but unfortunately there wasn't a corkscrew in the room  (& despite multiple calls to the reception desk that night the corkscrew never arrived ).

- I got £20 credit with my booking but only £10 was recognised. It didn't matter but it was odd. 

It may just have been an off day at the hotel which resulted in some operational challenges , and as a result my usual 5 star experience / score needs to reduce to a hotel rating of 4/5 this time.

Based on previous experiences I'll happily return again. ",4,2016,11,06
123,Second time not so charming,Great location but high price for typical small room. Still we stayed once before and liked it. This time people all nice but daily cleaning was quirky. Why replenish toilet paper but remove wash cloths. Why chocolates some times not others. Disorganized upstairs. Rest was as we remembered.,4,2016,11,05
123,The hotel remains a good one but loyal clients should be recognized!,"This hotel remains my London's first choice but it's irritating to note that they apparently not recognize their loyal clients. I always ask for a specified type of room and each time it's a fight to have the desired one. And i don't always succeed. At the big data area, I think it would not be very difficult to provide what loyal clients want, specially when you practice such rates.",4,2016,11,05
123,Perfect experience especially 108 bar is amazing.,"My first time in this hotel. Amazing atmosphere & kind people.
Especially experience at 108 bar was amazng. Supervisor Lala was attentive, making great cocktails, and really beautiful.
Highly recommended both hotel and bar. Find Lala there you will have a great cocktail and amazing time. : )",5,2016,11,02
123,Fab hotel ,Had the pleasure of staying here for two nights while visiting family from start to finish it was fantastic the staff made it all from the minute we got there we were  pampered a big thanks to kelly in restaurant she was very helpful cant wait to return ,5,2016,11,01
123,Amazing luxury hotel just yards from Oxford Street,"This little gem of a hotel was found via an internet search. I booked based on its location but turned out to be one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in. (I travel a lot for work). 
The rooms were small (expected - it is central London!) but oozed luxury right down to the Nespresso coffee machine in the room. The bed was incredibly comfortable and bathroom well equipped and have I said luxurious? 
The hotel staff were incredibly friendly and the food in bar and restaurant area was superb. Cant recommend this hotel highly enough and will be returning as soon as I can next time for a romantic break!",5,2016,11,01
123,Happy customer ,Picked this hotel by chance. Stayed three nights. Totally enjoyed it. Good location close to Oxford Street yet urban village atmosphere with lots of restaurants and pubs close by.  Pleasing decor. Very clean rooms. Excellent quality beds. Excellent staff. Good bar and restaurant. Good gym.  Swimming pool was closed but opening soon after refurbishment. Would return and pleased to recommend it. ,5,2016,10,31
123,Very special stay,"We stayed two nights with family whilst in London to celebrate our wedding. The staff were the highlight here - friendliness is very important to us and the staff did not disappoint, particularly the man who checked us in and worked very hard to secure us a room upgrade (even though we hadn't asked and weren't expecting this). We also received a bottle of bubbly and rose petals to mark our special occasion - a lovely surprise when we returned home that night. The room was very spacious and comfortable and had plenty of in room amenities. I'm glad the windows opened as it was a little stuffy at first. Breakfast was delicious - both in-room and in the restaurant. The lobby was very comfortable, and the street level bistro was nice but it is very busy - not great for families. Fantastic location - nice area and walking distance to many places. Our stay here was very special and memorable and I would not hesitate to return or recommend. ",5,2016,10,30
123,Overnighter,"Fab hotel right off oxfords street with a village feeling , staff very professional , hotel trendy and hip 
You can't go wrong with this choice especially with the spa after a hard day walking around London .",5,2016,10,28
123,"Nice hotel, great location.","Nice, quiet, clean and modern hotel. Very close to Oxfort str etc. Friendly and service minded staff. Nice restaurants close by, and a healty breakfast place in the street on the back side of the hotel. Very good gym facilities. Could have been a full score for the hotel, but some details take it a step down; staff did not know if it was a breakfast buffet or not or when the gym opened in the weekends (when I was trying to take the elevar down Saturday morning), the gym opened first as ""late"" as 08AM in the weekends which is too late and since the bed only had one big duvet we asked for a second one but then just got yet a big one wich then ment we ended up with a lot of duvet in the bed. Anyway a hotel I will return to if suitable in the future.",4,2016,10,27
123,Joanna,Joanna was excellent. I have been to the Marylebone 3 times in the last 6 months and every time Joanna is fantastic in the restaurant. The hotel is very organized and the service is really splendid. I would not stay anywhere else.,5,2016,10,26
123,"Great Service from very friendly, efficient staff","Although the hotel is very upmarket and in an expensive part of London the hotel was very welcoming , its very homely and staff are really helpful and friendly..I really enjoyed my stay..My TV didn't work but the main part of my stay was excellent",5,2016,10,26
123,Always made to feel welcome on every trip ,Always very well looked after here...a second home. Excellent welcome from Gunther at the reception desk including a lovely loyalty reward at reception desk upon check in this evening. A real treat upon arrival ,5,2016,10,25
123,Very welcoming,"Stayed for one night but were made to feel like we were regular guests.
From the Doorman's welcome, taking in our case and presenting us to Reception, we were offered a refreshing flavoured water and hot flannel after our journey and check in.
Our main purpose was shopping so the location was perfect for Oxford Street, Regent Street and Bond Street.
The Consierge recommended an excellent Chinese restaurant for our evening meal, even calling them to make a reservation, which was one of the best Chinese meals we have ever had, and very reasonably priced too.
Will be our first port of call next time.",5,2016,10,24
123,"Perfect location, contemporary, efficient staff","We spent three nights at this contemporary gem, in the charming Marylebone area.  Fairly off the beaten path, yet very convenient to a variety of shops and restaurants.  A two block walk to Bond Tube Station, on Oxford Circus. Our room included a very extensive breakfast service. Beware: smothering heat in restaurant--dress accordingly! Staff very well trained and accommodating. Will return.",5,2016,10,24
123,"Great location, service and facilities.","Stayed for a weekend. Location was perfect and foot and all services were great. Really enjoyed it and will be back.
All staff were very helpful, and informative. Room was great, with very comfortable beds. Always love a hotel with Nespresso machines in the room.",5,2016,10,24
123,A second home away from home,"I would rate the facilities as 'Above Average'. So if you are looking for a super luxurious Six-Star hotel... The Marylebone may not be your cup of tea. What I did find most attractive was the genuine warmth of the frontline staff. From the courteous and helpful doorman to the guest relations manager, Gunther. My family felt very welcomed and totally at home from the minute we stepped through the front doors.  Gunther, our Guest Relations Manager kindly let us view several room choices and we eventually selected a newly renovated room facing the rear of the quieter Bulstrode Street (which is higher prized for a Central London location).",5,2016,10,23
123,Amazing location and room,"We stayed in the studio suite and it was perfect. Great big room with a king bed. The breakfast was too good!! And the location a winner. !!! The staff is great and very kind and helpful. Will definitely come back. 
",5,2016,10,21
123,Fantastic hotel,"Great hotel, excellent service, room, , breakfast  , gym, sauna and pool. The restaurant  serves delicious food, good options for healthy meals.
Perfect location - to sum it up the best vacation. We will definitely return!",5,2016,10,21
123,Great Hotel,"26 nights this year already and never let down once ... staff are always impeccable and responsive, rooms are good, gym is fantastic.  Special thanks to Gunter at the front desk who is always at the top of his game.",5,2016,10,20
123,First class stay,"Super hotel, a real gem in central London at a reasonable price.
The staff were extremely friendly and attentive and couldn't do enough to help. 
Rooms were very clean and a good size and Oxford Street is only a 5 minute walk away so perfect for shopping. 
We will certainly be back next year",5,2016,10,20
123,Lovely lovely place,"Feels like home in London... Kind and helpful staff, always wanting to do more... Bottles of water, hot beverages and croissants- all free in the morning. Excellent location, lovely warm decor. Many good restaurants near by. 
The only thing is, we came with a baby and rooms are quite small (but beautiful), so if you are more then two people, go for the suit...
Thanks for everything, the Ostashinsky- Hanam family.",5,2016,10,20
123,Another Exceptional Stay,"We have stayed here a number of times and have enjoyed every visit. The greeting  on arrival is exceptional. Having stayed at many many hotels across the world, their impressive entrances are usually matched by a stuffy reception -  not here. From the door staff, front desk and concierge you are always welcomed with smiling faces and friendly greetings. The atmosphere is of a well-integrated and happy team. Gunther, and  Riyas stand out as excellent ambassadors for the Marylebone and truly give it a heart.
We had a super room, recently tastefully furnished. In common with other rooms the beds and pillows are luxury quality and no problem having a good nights sleeping.
It's a busy place, but breakfast is comprehensive and unhurried.
Very Highly recommended.
October 2016",5,2016,10,19
123,"Service, Style, and Amenities","Elegant hotel, wonderful turn-down service, and excellent staff.  If you want a place to relax yet be able to enjoy the amenities of excellent wifi and a great health club then this is the place.  If you want to stay at a place that is not easily accessible to public transportation, has poor food, and uncomfortable beds then please do not stay here.  You will be disappointed.",5,2016,10,19
123,Amazing stay,"I just wanted to  say what a wonderful stay my friend and I had on Saturday, it is one of the nicest hotels I have stayed in the service, the room all the little touches were lovely. 
 
Thank you so much for prosecco it was a lovely surprise. 
 
I look forward to staying again and will be recommending to all my friends",5,2016,10,19
123,Perfect Location,"My friend and I stayed here last weekend and could not have booked a better hotel. The location was perfect, being just a short walk to Oxford Street. The staff were attentive, friendly and more than helpful. Check in was prompt and we were able to check in early. Not only this but the cocktails were amazing and the beds so comfortable. Possibly the best nights' sleep I have ever had!",5,2016,10,19
123,GREAT London experience for business or pleasure,"I organized a two-day business meeting for international colleagues and we had a GREAT experience.  The meeting facilities were great, the bedrooms very comfy, the food was amazing and the staff was superior.  From organizing by Bianca, to the high quality service we received from Otto, Gergo and Ester, I have to say it was the best support I have received for a team event.  Even though our team was just 12-16 people, we were treated as though our meeting was the most important thing happening at the hotel.  Our last minute changes were handled impeccably, by Otto, in particular, and it made our meeting seamless in its execution.  I would recommend the hotel and the neighborhood to anyone visiting London!",5,2016,10,19
123,Lovely place to stay,"Just back from another stay at this lovely hotel where I usually stay about once a month.
Super place and very helpful staff especially Gunther and Antje.
Very well situated for Marylebone / Oxford Street.",5,2016,10,18
123,Excellent Service,"We hired the Howard De Walden room on the ground floor for a business meeting. From start to finish, Kevin was only an email away to answer any questions we had and help organise the day to the highest standard. 

The room was light, airy and exactly what we wanted. We got the delegate day package which included a 3 tea breaks, with teas and coffee, a huge lunch that consisted of sandwiches, hot foods and also fruit and dessert and everything else we needed in between. George was on hand for any assistance on the day of the meeting and very helpful!

I would recommend this room/package to anyone looking for a smart and sophisticated area to host a meeting in. And I would definitely use them again for any other similar needs. Hope to see you again soon!",5,2016,10,18
123,A Splendid Stay At The Marlebone,"My husband and I enjoyed our three week stay at the Marylebone. Our room looked over the rooftops and chimney pots of other buildings and it was bright, very clean and well furnished. We loved the space that we had, the cupboards and drawers to put our clothes in and the small area for making tea and coffee. The sun would stream in the morning and there was a lovely ambience in the room. The bathroom was most suitable as we had a walk in shower unit and a bath as well There was a trolley in the bathroom for us to put all our toiletries in place. The Hotel has a well equipped gym, sauna, steam room and a pool. I thoroughly enjoyed using the Pool and the sauna. The spa provides various services and I had an excellent manicure there. The laundry service at the Hotel was excellent. Both the restaurant and Bar at the Hotel were excellent.
The staff of the hotel, from cleaners, doormen, porters, receptionists, concierge, managers, waiters and waitresses,  were very courteous and friendly. They did their work well and would go the extra mile to please us and our friends who came to see us at the Hotel. They made the Hotel most inviting and each time we came back to the Hotel we felt most welcomed. The doormen would get taxis for us and they made us feel good each time we saw them.  In particular, we found the following staff exemplary and an asset to the Hotel: Diana Corbu on the Front desk who was efficient, courteous and who went out of her way to make us feel comfortable throughout. We will always remember her friendly and warm personality. Riyas Kallan the Asst Head Conceirge gave us advice and directions as well as obtained theatre tickets for us and made restaurant reservations. He was always willing to help. Long Voong, the Guest Relations Manager who was always there to listen to us and make us feel happy at the Hotel.  
The Marylebone is close to Marylebone High Street which has interesting shops and restaurants. One can walk to Oxford Street very easily and shop at the departmental stores. The Hotel is close to the Wallace Collection.",5,2016,10,18
123,"It's location is perfect, within walking distance or short cab ride to many of the areas we love in London","The hotel is well located, well staffed, with all the amenities you will need. Lots of restaurants, shops and galleries close by. Bond st. tube is a 5 minute walk. The room was quite spacious and had the very cool boutique hotel feel. Highly recommended.",5,2016,10,17
123,You notice Brexit,"As regular guests at this lovely hotel we can't help noticing a decline in service quality, probably ¨thanks¨ to Brexit which means it's much more difficult finding really nice young staff (as the hotel use to have). With this said, the regular people working at the front desk, such as Super Concierge Rahim and Gunther, are outstanding in their way of addressing guests. It's still our favourite hotel but we look forward to better performance specially in the somewhat chaotic breakfast room.",4,2016,10,17
123,English customer service is inproving,"Gunther at the reception desk was super poilte, attentive  and on his game.
The team and food in 108 Pantry (the hotel restaurant) was fab.
In this ideally located hotel I was made to fee extremly welcome.
Highly reccomend",5,2016,10,17
123,Home away from home...,"When I travel to London for work (4 - 8 times a year), I come to The Marylebone as it has an excellent location (Marylebone High Street has all amenities from lovely shopping and restaurants, 5 minutes walk from Oxford Street, 15 minutes walk from Old Bond Street,  15 minute taxi ride from Paddington/Heathrow Express), good service, breakfast is nice, the gym in the basement is excellent, and the 108 Brasserie Restaurant on the premises is surprisingly good.",5,2016,10,15
123,"Perfectly located, wonderful staff and amenities","In on business and 1st time at this hotel: well-appointed and very clean rooms, courteous and helpful staff who went extra mile to make sure I was well taken care of. The location is ideal for local shopping, eating, and access to the big tourist sites. Extra plus a great breakfast and tea spot and really good restaurant all attached. Will definitely come back for business and pleasure. A real gem!",5,2016,10,15
123,London Break,"Excellent hotel. Good location, adequate room space, nice bathroom. Breakfast was first class and staff/service five star. My only criticism is that the window cannot be opened properly as the recently fitted venetian blinds prevent this. As we detest aircon this caused a problem in obtaining fresh air.",4,2016,10,13
123,Show and overnight stay,"Fine hotel with top class rooms,amenities,excellent service,friendly front desk personnel,highly trained staff and a most exciting cocktail,bar and restaurant area.
As a seasoned London tourist I with out any hesitation be back.
And tell you what I can not wait,plus location is close to oxford street,tube stations etc",5,2016,10,12
123,Conveniently located,"This is a nice, albeit very expensive hotel in Marylebone. Our 'superior room' was very small but adequate for the two of us. The decor is elegant and tasteful. 

The wardrobe wasn't big enough for my outfit for the wedding and OH's suit. The bath is tiny. The steam room and changing rooms for the gym are tatty and look like they need a good clean.",4,2016,10,11
123,Swimmer's Winning Choice,"Our top two reasons for selecting the Marylebone for a recent visit to London were its location, close to the venue of a conference in Regent's Park which my wife was attending, and its having an indoor pool.  It did not disappoint on these or any other counts.  It's a short walk to Oxford Street for shopping and transportation (and a somewhat longer walk to The British Museum and Bloomsbury).  And its own immediate neighborhood is charming and well-supplied with an array of enticing dining options.  The indoor pool is part of a fairly elaborate health club, with good opening times (6:30 AM on weekdays).  Our room was small but well configured (could have used more storage space).  The hotel's restaurant is a good bet for drinks and light bites (besides a more elaborate menu, of which we did not partake).  The concierge was affable and pro-actively helpful.  A daily newspaper can be delivered to your room (options include the International New York Times) and if you get enrolled into the hotel's loyalty program at check-in, it's complimentary (at least I think that's what I was told when the check-out staff person removed the nominal newspaper charges from my bill).  An affordable, comfortable hotel  with an indoor pool in a nice part of central London; what more did we need?",5,2016,10,11
123,London Hotel service did have changed ?,"After being a travel agent for alsmost 30 years I must admit that my judgement becomes harder and harder each year mostly because of the nature of my work as I can see things in hotels that normal travellers do not bother to see... 
I am not going to judge either the location nor the amenities of the Marylebone Hotel as most London Hotels at these standards do offer all these in abudance..
All the years that I was going to London, I have travelled in many travel status... as a student trying to have fun, as an exhibition visitor to The World Travel Market , as a husband with my wife, as a father with my son but mostly as a travel proffessional with all sorts of groups blended with all social status participants...
The permanent issue with London Hotels was the stiff, cold and completely typical staff where everything had to be by the book , always with the same pretentious smile and manipulating politeness with complete lack of imporovisation whenever there was a case out of the ordinary and not in the ""reception manual""....
I was completely astonished with the ""human approach"" that I had experienced during my staying at the Marylebone Hotel mostly by Mrs. Elena Salvatore (my apologies if I did not remeber the last name correctly) at the reception desk. My initial surprise was when I made a phonecall to the hotel and Mrs. Elena answered, I asked for a few details about the location and when all my questions answered instead of the usual polite cliche telephonecall closure she had a very human and warm conversation with me about all things that could possibly offer as a receptionist and travel proffesional in terms of making my staying memorable. When I entered the Marylebone Hotel to check in I felt like I was entering a friend's house. Apart from Elena, all the staff at the reception and the Consierge was more than helpful and above everything human and totaly friendly.
My special thanks also to the fine gentleman at the Consierge (the tall english guy with the short hair) whose name I do not recall for his patience and help with the theater tickets.
In my opinion London Hotel staff is changing to the best and I believe that this medley of different nationalities, coulture and country origin of hotel staff is the one and only reason ........

123,Terrific Hotel,"I had a 10 day stay at the Marylebone and my pleasure at the Hotel grew with the days.  The staff are exceptionally friendly, related, and sincerely cheerful.  The location is great, in a quiet area, convenient to everything, and full of good restaurants. My room was very comfortable. The common rooms are attractive and the restaurant and bar have a great energy.  the Hotel stands out!",5,2016,10,09
123,Birthday treat at the Marylebone,"We thoroughly enjoyed our night's stay at the Marylebone (which was for a birthday treat) - excellent service, a lovely room and delicious food.  The staff couldn't have been more helpful.  We'd definitely recommend the hotel and are looking forward to our next visit!",5,2016,10,08
123,Great hotel!,"Located in a quiet area parallel to Oxsford street, and close to the bond station. The rooms are clean and pleasnt. There are nice restaurants and bars in the streets next to the hotel.
Amazing breakfast, great service as well. I I will happily come back :)",5,2016,10,06
123,"Great location, luxory, and price","The Marlybone is a must stay, the hotel is beautiful and the rooms are efficient and comfortable, with impeccable detail. It's a wonder for the price.  The staff very extremely friendly and professional, I would definitely recommend for others and looking forward to my next stay. ",5,2016,10,04
123,"When ""Thank you"" is not enough..","Spent last weekend with my husband on our wedding anniversary at this marvellous hotel & we could definitely not have made a better choice ! We were granted a room upgrade, champagne & chocolates were waiting for us in the room as well as a wonderful handwritten card, which is now back with us at home ! The staff from the first to the last one were all smiling, helpful.. Special thanks to our dearest Elena at the reception ! The location is great & close to almost everything, but in the same time quite & surrounded by many lovely small restaurants & cafes, so cute & romantic ! The rooms are spacious, the cleanning service is always there (twice per day), the breakfast is more than words can say and.. the bar is one of the hottest places to be in London !! Great music & excellant cocktails ! In other words, no more alternative choices in London for us from now on ! And yet, ""thank you"" is not enough !!",5,2016,10,04
123,Striking the right balance : Comfort/ Central/ Reasonable but most of all AGREABLE Staff!,"We arrived at what seemed to be a very busy time. Despite the density on the reception counter & a hick up on our reservation ; we constantly felt we were being taken care of the staff conveying a real sense of hospitality . Elena was particularly amazing , with the right sense of professionalism and humor she managed to transform the situation and make us feel at home!
Along with the night down service ( and chocolate ) The Manager note on our bed, concerned for our next day experience of the Breakfast was also very much appreciated.
The Gym and Spa are a real perk in this property as they mesh your journey with the locals hitting the tread mills every Sunday morning .
A simple suggestion to the Management is given the popularity of the hotel, wear and tear signs on the elevator push buttons at the lobby should be repaired ever so often , as could the counter of the reception desk take a layer of copper ( a stronger material than the wood finishing )  ...my two cents
Thank you again Elena for a wonderful stay , keep the spirit up !",5,2016,10,04
123,Fantastic hotel in a great location,"Concierge service met us and escorted us into the hotel reception. Swift check in and room available early. We stayed in a junior suite which was ample size for two of us with little extra luxuries. Pool / Spa area was a nice addition for a central London hotel. Oxford st and Bond St tube was a 5 minute walk away. 

Check out was also very prompt. Would highly recommend this hotel.",5,2016,10,03
123,"Very adequate, large rooms for London, quiet","Was thankfully able to get a room during very busy fashion week. Great part of town, rooms not special but meet all needs, front staff attentive. Try and get a room facing the mews- was very quiet. Bed was comfortable.",4,2016,10,02
123,Nice place.,"Good hotel, especially for business trip. Very good location. Rooms are nice and spacious. Lovely brassiere and bar. Good service. Gym, SPA, concierge service. Good area, very calm but very close to many London places.",4,2016,10,01
123,Great hotel & service,"I have been at the Marylebone Hotel for 3 days meeting and have a great experience. The hotel is very beautiful and the staff very helpful and professional. I would like to thank Kevin for his huge help, and Jan and Nicola to be very nice and kind.
Also the food is excellent!",5,2016,09,29
123,Great hotel. Highly recommend it. ,"Had a 2 night stay with friends. Found a good deal on line which included breakfast. Service was really friendly and efficient especially the doorman. The room was well equipped with mini bar, safe, iron, tv, wifi and a Nespresso coffee machine. The breakfast was amazing. Good choice of cold food to help yourself too and then a freshly cooked hot breakfast of great quality. The restaurant staff were very helpful and friendly. Nothing was too much bother. The hotel is just behind Oxford street near house of Fraser and a short walk to Regent's Park. There's some short stay parking outside the hotel but we parked in an underground Q car park 2 blocks away with a discount card from the hotel doorman. We parked for approx 40 hours and it cost £66 which I didn't think was too crazy for central London, very secure parking. Can park outside the hotel for free in a Sunday. Juices from the juice bar are expensive but worth it. ",5,2016,09,28
123,"Great Location, Friendly Staff & Great food","We stopped here for one night for my 21st Birthday - the hotel reception is very welcoming, however the room size was very disappointing. Even for 2 people we struggled to get around the room whilst getting ready. The bed was very comfy. The pictures of the Superior Room are very misleading! We couldn't shut the bathroom door without stepping to the side of the toilet and as for the marble heated floors?! 

Our view from the room was also disappointing - for my first trip to London I am not impressed by the value for money. The staff are friendly, the food was great but the room was not ideal.",3,2016,09,28
123,It depends on what you need,"I spent 3 nights at the Marylebone while on a combined work/fun escape to London. The reviews are accurate: it’s a lovely hotel in many ways. But I guess their priorities are different than mine. The staff was great, the room was made up a couple of times a day, I found little chocolates left in the room, there was somebody to open the front door for me every time that I left the building. You definitely feel that you’re being looked after. But the (free) wifi was crushingly slow when faced with higher loads (mostly evenings). The in room fridge was one of those old fashioned mini bars rather than something you can actually use for stuff. And the temperature control didn’t really give you control. So I felt like the hotel was bending over backwards to provide services that didn’t really care for, while leaving aside things that make a big difference to me while traveling. The clientele seemed to be mostly older tourists, and so the hotel may be doing exactly what their target market wants.",4,2016,09,28
123,i like this hotel,"the hotel was very close to oxford st. and all the shopping area.
in the hotel breakfast was very good food and very good service.

123,"A very nice hotel with a good location, welcoming staff and great hotel facilities","I stayed for 3 nights. It was a pleasure to stay in Marylebone Hotel. The staff was very nice and showed sincere interest. The rooms were very satisfactory. A good location for shopping, reaching the main roads and dining. Thank you so much for this experience.",5,2016,09,26
123,Good hotel for business,"Great location - near a lot of offices but also in a great neighborhood.  There's lots of shopping and dining within 5-10 blocks of the hotel.

The hotel had great service.  Everyone at the front desk and the doormen and bellhops were extremely friendly and efficient.  I arrived early and they let me leave my bags and by the time I came back my room was ready and the bags were up there already.

Rooms are on the small side, like many in London.  They are very well furnished.  Beds are nice, desks are nice.  The bathrooms are small but well appointed.  Insulation is great. There was construction out my window and I could barely hear anything while sitting at the desk despite the workers cutting rebar right outside the window.

Overall, it was a great place and reasonably priced.",5,2016,09,24
123,brilliant few days in Marleybone,"Very cosy and warm hotel. Excelent healty food options for breakfast and dinner. Helpful staff and great service from everyone at the hotel. Brilliant location for shopping, dining and walks in the parks. ",5,2016,09,24
123,Amazing hospitality in london - feel at home for weekend,Just back from visiting hotel at weekend with my wife and baby son. The team were absolutely superb from start to finish and def worth visiting as superb location - 30 sec to oxford high street. Special stand out mention for Jack in Guest Services as was credit to hotel.,5,2016,09,23
123,Very nice hotel ,"Stayed at the hotel recently for 3 nights. Very well appointed rooms and comfy bed. We had a very lovely breakfast in the pantry one morning and the bar does an excellent cocktail. The only downside to the stay were the fire alarm activations in the night during our time there. Apart from that the hotel was excellent. If it hadn't been for the fire alarms we would have given it full marks. The hotel is ideally situated for Oxford Street shopping and Bond St tube station is only a 5 minute walk away. 
Would we recommend this hotel yes.
Would we stay at this hotel again yes. ",4,2016,09,22
123,Efficient and helpful staff,"My wife and I stayed for 3 nights and enjoyed our stay.  The hotel is convenient and the staff was great.  Very helpful, concerned and interactive.  Since we were from out of town, they always asked what we were planning for the day and gave suggestions and ideas.  Breakfast was adequate, but not excellent.  Overall, very nice.",4,2016,09,20
123,"beautiful hotel, exellent service","It was the second time me and my husband went there, we visited from 16/9/16 to 19/9/16. Our good feeling started the moment the doorman opened the door with a smile, and then the recption lady served us (thanks orura) and then we entered to our lovely room. we love london and use all the time the underground, and the way by foot to bond station (on Oxsford st.) was 6 min by walk. the hotel has a swimming pool and a sauna and it's a bonus. we were served by diffrent exellent person (thanks gunther) and we will continue to come!!",5,2016,09,20
123,25th wedding anniversary trip,"We stayed for one night, the decor of the hotel is lovely and it was extremely clean.  Staff good but a little stressed at reception.  Rooms were extremely small and this is not obvious from the website.  Had breakfast in the pantry and it was disappointing as cold and tasteless.  however nice feel to the hotel and would give it another try.",4,2016,09,20
123,Great hotel,"The Marylebone is very conveniently situated for the main shopping areas of London and yet is in a quiet location. There are many restaurants close by.
Hotel staff are very friendly and helpful and the rooms are clean and comfortable. Have now stayed here twice and would go back again.",5,2016,09,19
123,Business Trip Combined with Family,"I am a frequent guest of the Marylebone hotel spending around 1 week each month for the past few years, choosing to stay at the Marylebone hotel each and every time. The hotel has a very warm feeling which is what makes all the difference for someone who spends so much time abroad like myself. I would like to praise the entire hotel stuff with particular emphasis and thanks to Mrs Antjie ans Mr Gunther for their excellent care and flawless service which made this hotel feel like a second home to me, and to Mrs Elena for her great attitude towards customers.

Noy Dor",5,2016,09,19
123,Excellent stay,My husband and I celebrated our two year anniversary over the weekend and chose to stay at The Marylebone. I had spent quite some time in the neighborhood and knew it was the right location for us. The staff was incredibly warm and welcoming from the moment we got there. The upgrade to a better room was seamless (thank you Gunther!); the restaurant recommendation Jack gave us was perfect (Cecconi's) and we were right at home for 2.5 days. Thank you to all! We'll definitely be back! ,5,2016,09,19
123,A great welcome from staff but a few small issues re the room...,"We stayed here one night when at a party in town (we live close to London). Good value room on a last minute booking and we even got upgraded thanks to Gunther who was incredibly helpful. The doorman was equally lovely and very 'natural' and unfussy compared to other places. So we had a quick in and out as we headed home the next morning and didn't do the full experience of the restaurant, spa etc. My only neg was slight lack of attention to details such as only 1 bathrobe provided and no reply when we called down to request another. We were in a hurry so couldn't wait. Plus the loo seat was wonky. And for me the big problem was lack of a magnifying mirror and having to put my make-up on wearing my specs! Quite funny really but not ideal. Perhaps not the place to stay if you're long-sighted!",4,2016,09,18
123,Exquisite service!,"I have been staying at this hotel for the past few years, and the service has been one of the highlights.  Very personalised, they actually remember you when you arrive! Particularly Gunther at the front desk has been superb!  My home away from home.",4,2016,09,17
123,EXceptional Staff,"My stay was in May but it seems as if my review did not publish.
I once again would like to commend the highly competant staff who collectively are an exceptional team, that bring my family back, every few months, my previous visit was in March, with our family and grandchildren, the staff could not of been more welcoming, thank you Rody on arrival for the teddy bears, such a lovely thought.
Our grandchildren enjoyed the very nice pool in the afternoons after a day of sight seeing. A nice added touch the hotel offers.
The gym is one of the nicest hotel gyms in London, with many different machines, also can sign up for classes such as spinning.
The Concierges who include two excellent concierges Rahim and Raos, your attention to all our requests is always appreciated.
Rebecca Conlon, you are the one who creates such an excellent team, you are always so wonderfully attentive to our needs and I know that it is because of you that the front desk team is so strong, and efficient. You are a very strong leader creating anexcellent team that continues to have guests returning to the Marylebone Hotel, your personal touch is always so professional and appreciated.
Gunther you are one incredible person, I know when I need anything, even meringues for my grandchildren, you make sure that every request is done so efficiently and expedited, you are an incredible team player and much appreciated, I know that your hard work does not go un noticed.
Julian in the breakfast room, breakfast is never the same without you, an excellent waiter always. Your amazing service and knowing our needs is always appreciated.
Long Voo your recommendations are always spot on, your care is so noticeable to all details and requests.
The hotel has an outstanding location, on an elegant street with wonderful shopping such as Selfridges close by and the Bond Street tube station a two minute walk away.
DOnt miss the lovely St Christopher's Square nearby with a great Middle  Eastern Restaurant called Sofras.",5,2016,09,15
123,"Highly recommended - go, stay and have fun! You won't regret it","My grandmother and I stayed here for one night last week. The breakfast was the highlight with the best black pudding in London... 
Doing everything right in my opinion- we stayed at The Ritz the next night and wished we has stayed at the Marylebone again! Your breakfast fry up was better! Seriously

All round a fab stay from the room, staff and toiletries !! We really loved the hotel and the location couldn't really be better! 

The changing pool area was AMAZING as was the gym, but the pool was a bit of a let down. When we went there were just regular local gym goers and there was not a relaxed atmosphere. People were more there for fitness and we certainly didn't feel like we could just float around and relax as people were doing their lengths. Although it is amazing that the hotel has a pool at all! 
Will be back, but would like to stay at other Doyle hotels first !!",5,2016,09,15
123,A fabulous place!,"We had an overnight stay ( weekend) at the Marylebone and had a wonderful time. It's in a great location , near to Oxford Street but it feels like being in a village.The restaurants and shops in the immediate area of the Hotel are all superb.The staff are great- absolutely spot on - they can't do enough to help you make the most of your stay.",5,2016,09,13
123,Lovely boutique hotel in a great London neighbourhood,"This is a great hotel in a very central London location that won't break the bank. My partner and I wanted to enjoy a bit of a 'staycation' in our own city and this was a great option for us. We loved everything - the room was lovely, the swimming pool in the basement was a nice bonus and the bar offered a great spot to sit outside and people watch. There was only one small negative to our experience: we decided to book directly with the hotel, on their own website, but we did have a small issue in that when we tried to add a spa voucher to the booking (something they offer on the site), it didn't get added to the reservation. I ended up cancelling and making a second reservation, but this meant that when I arrived, there were two bookings in my name. The front desk staff were very good and said they would fix this for us. However, when it came time to check out the next day, they had added two sets of spa vouchers... They fixed it again, but it happened one more time after I left the hotel. This was the only downside for us - I think it's an issue to do with the computer booking system not 'syncing' properly with the actual staff at the front desk.  While the staff were very good about fixing it, this was supposed to be a pain free staycation and it was frustrating having to go back and forth to fix the invoice three times for a one night booking!",4,2016,09,13
123,"Location,location","Stopped here a few times and has never let us down.clean modern and in a fab location .walking distance to many of London delights.staff always spot on,we were upgraded as London was not to busy during our stay .some confusion over breakfast in our room rate so in steped the manager ,bang upgraded to a full English .thats how you deal with an issue .first class.love the bar area they have got that just right .ok value for this part of town .our first choice if in London .",4,2016,09,13
123,Excellent meeting facilities,"We booked the Howard de Walden room for a 2 hours evening presentation for a Scandinavian client. Everything was excellent from the reservation to the final dinner. Very helpful events team, delicious dinner in The Snug and good service. We will for sure come back.",5,2016,09,13
123,warm welcome and comfort in central London,"I was travelling with my 14 years old niece, all the staff was really welcoming  and kind - from reception, to housekeeping and the concierge. Sometimes the staff in upscale hotels can have a haughty  attitude towards children  but  that was definitely not the case. The hotel is elegant yet not overtly formal.Our room was large, well refined and comfortable. We had breakfast in the Pantry: it was very nice and somewhat special.",5,2016,09,13
123,Staff were faultless from the word 'go'!,"My company hired the Howard De Walden room in the business centre for our Pop-Up clothing shop. We wanted to be central in Marylebone and we loved the boutique style of the hotel, plus the room was on the ground floor, had a wall of windows onto the street and ticked all our boxes. The events team were a pleasure to deal with but on the day they were just fabulous. Otto gets a particular mention as he helped us unload, and was on hand all day to help out with anything we needed. I never had to wait more than 10 seconds for his smiling face to appear and no ask was too great for him. We didnt really have much contact with anyone else as we were busy with customers, but whole ambiance of the hotel is just blissful, classy and flawless.
I am saving up so I can spend a weekend there with my other half so we can truly experience all the hotel has to offer, but from a business point of view, we can't fault it.",5,2016,09,12
123,Excellent hotel in a great location,"This hotel is EXCELLENT. Fantastic staff, great location - very central but on a quiet road and equidistant from the bustle of Oxford St and the calm of Regent's Park. Very comfortable rooms and great bar, thoroughly recommended",5,2016,09,12
123,Nice gem in a crowded market,"This was my 5th stay at this hotel which is perfect for a central London visit. Its always been competitive on price, has a great swimming pool and facilities and excellent service. Upgrade on my last visit was a nice touch too.",5,2016,09,12
123,Great boutique hotel,"Location absolutely fantastic. Gym facilities out of your dreams, with a pool. Breakfast, a bit expensive but very good with a large choice of everything. room are fab, even the tiny ones. Staff is very friendly and always there to help to make you feel comfortable. The concierge is a real star if you are looking for some tickets etc.",4,2016,09,11
123,Excellent! 2nd stay in 6mths,"This is a great hotel. The location is superb (easy to walk to Marylebone High St, Oxford St/ Selfridges and do loads of great restaurants, pubs and bars) but what makes it really stand out is the excellent service. The staff work extremely hard to anticipate and accommodate your needs. I have to give a shout out to Jack, one of the doormen, who my 10yr old son took 'a shine to'! Jack allowed him to hang out with him, help carry bags and then gave him a Marylebone Hotel teddy bear. My son still talks about him! The rooms are not large but are comfortable, with nice decor. Would absolutely recommend.",5,2016,09,11
123,Best option in the area,"Due to my job and frequent business trips to London I have stayed now already more than 50 nights at the Marylebone. I tried also other hotels in the area (near my office) but I can tell you that this is by far the best option. 

All the staff is really really nice and always making their best to make you feel like a vip. My last stay now in September has been for 10 nights and I want to specially thank Gunther at the reception who made everything at his hands to ensure a perfect stay.

Fully recommended hotel, I'm sure it won't disappoint you. ",5,2016,09,10
123,Outstanding Customer Service,"From check-in to restaurant to bar to concierge running down the street to find me a taxi, all staff were fantastic. I would like to thank them all on behalf of our family group for making our stay a memorable one.",5,2016,09,10
123,Wonderful Hotel ,"My partner and I stayed here for 3 nights. During our visit, we felt welcomed and the hotel staff went above and beyond to meet our needs. Reception and checking in was straightforward and we were informed of things to do in the area. The hotel is close to Oxford Street so, if you don't mind a short walk, it's in an ideal location. The hotel and room was impeccably clean and facilities were first class. 

The only reason I give it 4* is that room service was very overpriced. Breakfast  that was delivered was expensive for what we received. The mini bar was ridiculously pricey and extra charges were put on top- I'm not quite sure why. Then, after all of that, we still tipped the people delivering our food (even though there was a tray charge + 12.5% fee) because that's just what you do. 

Other than that, we really enjoyed our stay. We would return but maybe choose to eat out for breakfast and avoid the mini bar. ",4,2016,09,09
123,Best Hotel in Town ,"This is my second time staying at the Marylebone. No discussion: this is the best hotel in London. The manager, Mr Gunther Schildwachter is always helpful, very professional and take every step to make us the most comfortable possible. He treats us like VIPs and trust me.... He will do the same for you. From the amazing gentle doormen until the general manager you will be welcomed as the royal family. The hotel installations are extremely comfortable. The breakfast is very good, including that I'm into healthy food and they have smoothies and superfood omelettes. The gym is all that I wanted in my life!!!! Professional gym!!!! Went everyday!!! All the Marylebone surrounds is perfect. Very active people, charming and with plenty of restaurants and walking distance from every London highlights. 
The Marylebone is my home in London and I will never change. Keep work like that guys. Thank yo very much. 
   ",5,2016,09,09
123,Consistently brilliant hotel - always delivers 5 star service,"Marylebone consistently provides a very high standard of service, their staff in particular Gunther remembers you from one trip to the next. The rooms and facilities are always perfect and when travelling away from home on business it is completely refreshing to have the same experience time & time again.
Location and proximity to the West End also a major bonus.
Many thanks.",5,2016,09,09
123,Accessible,"I needed a wheelchair accessible room and this hotel provided superb accessible facilities in the bathroom, both the room and bathroom were also  very spacious . No steps anywhere in the hotel , except to the gym and pool areas.  ",5,2016,09,09
123,Excellent location and Impeccable Place to stay,"Booked for us by a travel agent, this hotel was a lovely place to stay.  We didn't need all of the services available/offered but appreciated how close it was to Oxford Street, the Bond Street station and lovely eateries at all price levels in the area.  Our room was very nice though it had the smallest bathroom we have ever seen! And the breakfast that was included was outstanding.",5,2016,09,07
123,Amazing service and hotel!!,"I went to London for a sad reason (Father's funeral), and my green card had expired so needed to copy papers, death certificate etc., and Gunther took such good care of me, I will never forget it.  He changed my room to a specially quiet one (even though I didn't request this)--I hadn't slept in a few days), helped me with paperwork and could not have been more generous.  The hotel itself (I've stayed there before) is charming, luxurious, and so well placed, in the heart of everything.  I would never stay anywhere else-- couldn't recommend it more highly, for business or for pleasure.  and ask for Gunther!!",5,2016,09,05
123,Living London,"You feel that you live in London given the iconic location of this hotel.  Amenities, staff attentiveness and personalized service, greatly overshadow the relatively small room.  Hallways are a bit dark by design, but that's a matter of personal preference.

The concierge and the hotel staff are the best - one of the most knowledgeable anywhere.  I'd go back in a heartbeat.",4,2016,09,05
123,London Visit,"Wonderful hotel!  The location is the simply the best.  Staff was very warm and welcoming. We did have a few small issues with our room: the safe was not working, the television was experiencing technical problems.  We reported the issues to the management at the front desk.  They did bring us another safe.  Television was looked by the maintenance staff but was not repaired nor replaced.  Overall, we had a wonderful stay at the Marylebone and will visit again!",5,2016,09,05
123,Great service and lovely hotel,"I had the pleasure of staying a night at The Marylebone Hotel earlier this week.  From check in with Gunther to the quality of the room, my experience was nothing but fantastic.  I will certainly be back again - from the location through to the staff and room, there is nothing I could fault. ",5,2016,09,05
123,Amazing,"I stayed this weekend with my husband and it was a really good experience. The hotel is just five minutes walking from Oxford street, the room was very nice, breakfast was also included and all the staff was really friendly and helpful, specially Gunther from the reception, who solved any issue very quickly and professionally. Fully recommended hotel.",5,2016,09,04
123,One Week of Fun and Adventure,"The Marylebone Hotel is located in an area with lots of small shops and restaurants within easy walking distance.
The hotel staff is extremely friendly and helpful, especially Gunther, who always had helpful hints of places to go and things to see.",5,2016,09,04
123,Extras included,"Beautiful hotel, room spacious, clean, modern. We were greeted with 2 personal welcome notes and a bottle of wine and teddy bear. May have been been because we used a travel agent booked the room. Excellent breakfast is included. All staff are helpful. Nice bar. Health club here but we didn't look at it. Situated near Shefridges. Taxied to sights. Great housekeeping, our beds were always turned down with the added chocolate and yummy cookies and water left every day. Highly recommend.",5,2016,09,04
123,"Comfortable, great gym and pool",This hotel is very close to Oxford Street and Bond Street Underground station. The room was comfortable and quiet. The staff friendly and efficient. The best attraction for us was the complimentary access to the substantial gym and 18 metre indoor swimming pool - fantastic!,5,2016,09,03
123,Marylebone,"We have stayed at the Marylebone hotel for one month,and it wasn't our first time.it was an amazing stay,we really enjoyed it.
The rooms were amazing,the staff were  nice,polite and very respectful,especially Gunther,he was very helpful to the family,and he helps us to make it feels like home.

Best regards

123,Great for Families,"We came to London for a week for a holiday and this hotel was the right choice! from the start they gave teddy bears to the kids, clean room and very good beds, 5 minute walk from Oxford St, 5 min from the Tube ! every night they help us to find a great restaurant, just a great hotel and stuff !",5,2016,08,31
123,Excellent Experience,"Excellent location, good room and very helpful Manager Gunther. Excellent cost benefit. The restaurant and Bar also have a great atmosphere and good food. We had an excellent impression of the Reception Manager Gunther !",5,2016,08,31
123,Quite small ,"Stayed here for a weekend very clean staff very friendly and helpful but the room was rather small for my liking especially the bathroom couldn't shut the door easily once in. Lovely white towels robes and slippers provided . The air conditioning unit was not efficient in cooling down the room on a very hot day, needed more tea and milk in the room but they did provide more when asked, the remote for TV wasn't working properly probably needed batteries, couldn't get the coffee machine to work . Didn't get chance to try out the spa and pool facilities or the gym maybe I would have if staying longer . Had a comfy sleep the beds very comfy but maybe too soft for some. Overall lovely to stay , meals were quite expensive to be honest and so was the mini bar and room service so didn't use either.",3,2016,08,31
123,"Second visit, And I will stay here again","Excellent hotel with excellent service! 

The rooms was rather small, but for one person it is more than enough. The Bed was extremely comfortable. 2 bottles of water every night by the bed side was nice. Having a gym and pool is a rarity in central london and is one of the reasons I chose this hotel. It is at the most convenient of places: just 10 min walk from selfridges and just next to marlybone high street! 

The Fridge has automatic detection when you remove drinks inside. So if you have taken out the drinks in order to put your own things in, make sure you tell the staff when you check out",4,2016,08,30
123,Anniversary romantic time,"Each hotel has a strong identity that is closely connected to location. what was easy to access and close to some many attraction, we expended a amazing time celebrating our 3 year anniversary at The Marylebone Hotel. 
Very welcome staff, Gunther threat as very well, we were delight with the luxury accommodation.

We deeply recommend!!!!",5,2016,08,29
123,Frequent Visitor,"I have stayed at The Marylebone over the last 5 years probably on average 6 visits a years and could only really mention the small size of some of the rooms as an adverse comment. They are fine for a single individual on a  one/two night business stay but if you were a couple with luggage  staying longer some (not all by any means are fine).
Good service from Gunther on reception on most  recent  visit  last week .",4,2016,08,29
123,Amazing hotel,"This hotel was absolutely amazing. Great staff, delicious breakfast, comfortable bed and the room service was great. 
The only thing I was missing,, but it's not very important, was the lack of a fridge. It would be nice to have a bottle of water or something. But overall it was truly amazing! ",5,2016,08,29
123,Great value for money,"The Marylebone is very centrally located yet provides fantastic value for money.  Business travelers will appreciate the size and comfort of the rooms while the health conscious visitors can make use of the well-equipped gym with indoor pool, a rarity in central London.  Staff is friendly and helpful and there is plenty to visit due to the excellent location.  ",5,2016,08,29
123,"Amazing hotel, a faultless stay!","We have just returned from a wonderful 2 night break at The Marylebone. We had a absolutely faultless stay, the staff were so attentive and could not do enough. Some luxury touches really put this hotel above any I have stayed in before. We were offered a free upgrade on arrival and the room was stunning, the bed was very comfortable and extra's like the nespresso machine made the room a home from home. The breakfast was lovely and the gym and spa were of a great standard. I had a lovely chat to the general manager Roderick. He was always present in the lobby and reception area and went out of his way to to check all of his guests were happy. Thanks to the whole team at the hotel, We will definitely be back!",5,2016,08,28
123,"""Amazing place to stay""","This hotel is wonderful for so many reasons, the staff are amazingly helpful and friendly. The service as you would expect from a 5 star hotel. The food was second to none. The room was delightful and exceptionally clean. This is truly a remarkable place to stay. I don't think you can find a better hotel experience anywhere in London. 
Thank you. ",5,2016,08,28
123,Excellent quality with a great location,"We stayed at the Marylebone in August 2016 and thoroughly enjoyed so many things, including our super comfortable king-sized bed, complimentary nespresso machine, free high speed wifi, impeccable room service, high quality towels and bedding, breakfast buffet and an excellent location. The hotel is walking distance from Regents Park, SoHo, West End, etc, and it's very close (5 min walk) to the Bond Street tube station. The best part was the staff with service was so great we felt like celebrities.",5,2016,08,25
123,London location with bijoux luxury ,"I stay here quite often when in London with work and it is of a consistently a high standard of quality and service. The porters and receptionists are especially welcoming and very efficient. You are offered a hot towel and water at check in which is a nice touch. I usually hate check in / out as it takes forever but this hotel has it down to a fine art!  This is a great central location - Wigmore St and close to Oxford St / Mayfair and far nicer than the Holiday Inn just up the road.  The rooms are lovely, clean and comfortable, the bathrooms are very small (especially for 2 people) but well equipped. There is a nice restaurant / bistro although pricey if you are on a business expense budget. Good room service and a very nice spa and pool if you have some down time. After 10 stays you get an upgrade. Parking is easy as there are 2 NCPs close by. ",5,2016,08,24
123,"Helpful staff, well located hotel","Staff generally friendly, found chap at front desk, Gunther I think his name was, very helpful. Some basic rooms can be very small, especially if there are two of you, so worth upgrading if you can. Very well located,lots of different types of restaurants close by and interesting shops on Marylebone Lane; also close to Oxford Street Bond Street and Wigmore Hall.",4,2016,08,24
123,Comfortable,"Warm welcome, efficient check in, helpful friendly staff.  Room rather small, very comfortable quiet and bright (road works stopped by 5pm but started again Sunday morning for a short time, not hotel's fault) Lovely bed linen, tiny, tiny bathroom although very clean with everything that you need.  We enjoyed our swim in the subterranean pool, great steam room and fabulos changing rooms, didn't use the gym.  No offer of Sunday newspaper.  Mini bar useful, although you have to remove items if you want to put in your own bottlles, milk etc.,  automatically charged but you can resolve that at check- out. Outside of building is ugly......in a street of fine architecture.  Great location since Marylebone is one of my favourite parts of London.",4,2016,08,23
123,Great hotel in the middle of London,"My family and I stayed at The Marylebone for 4 days and it was great! The staff was superb. It was my daughters 16th bday and they brought a piece of fantastic chocolate cake and chocolate covered strawberries to her room. The rooms were clean and spacious. The location was perfect, close to many great restaurants, shopping and a tube station. If you are going to London, definitely check this hotel out. By the way they give you chocolates or macaroons in your room each night.  Thanks for a memorable stay!",5,2016,08,23
123,Few days in Central london,"We decided to spend a few days in London away from the heat of Dubai and just before school are scheduled to open. London is at is best in summer and we were looking for something close to oxford street , with easy access to the London underground. Our daughter managed to find a couple of options and we managed to decide on Marylebone. It's designated as. 4 star hotel and is located on Welbeck street just behind Debenams on Oxford Street. Welbeck street is a quiet street with mainly well finished buildings that are offices or apartments. The Hotel itself is part of a chain called Doyle that comprises boutque hotels in UK and USA. The check in was handled quickly and the checkin clerk noted that we had requested a roll a away bed for our  daughter who was 12 years old. As we arrived late in the afternoon, we decided to make the most of the day and left the hotel after dropping off our bags in our room. The room we had selected was a "" superior room"" however we were slightly surprised at the size (as we were expecting a room that would ideally allow for space for a roll away.The rollaway was not in place and wondered how it would fit in. Nevertheless we left it to housekeeping to do the needful. However on our return to the room later in the evening we found the roll away still not placed in the room This was a bit disappointing as we had been traveling all day and then spent our time in central and really wanted to get into bed as soon as possible. The reception was informed about the missing roll away. Housekeeping then delivered and placed the roll away adjacent to the main bed dis allowing any access to the main cupboard. The bathroom although well finished was quite small. It did however have all a full bath. But everything was a tight squeeze. The room itself had a desk and ample lighting and outlets that would cater for European users as well. The Flat screen TV was not large but adequate. We had some issues with the availability of channels. "" with no signals"" at various times. Good thing about Internet access. Easy and relatively good speed for all. The bed was large and comfortable The room itself was clean and presentable. The hotel has a fitness centre and pool and a restaurant and room service. I would 

advise you not to choose room service unless you really need it. Very expensive. Also I would have like to see Tea/ coffee making facility in the room  The hotel staff were generally welcoming and helpful and would like to make a 
special mention of the reception staff Ms Arora who was very helpful and efficient in amending our reservation to satisfaction. As always the staff of the hotel do make a difference and this experience will may  me consider visting Marylebone again",3,2016,08,23
123,Excellent Service again,"I stay at Marylebone frequently and yet again I had tremendous customer service. Gunther in particular on reception was incredible welcoming and personable and throughout the hotel the staff go out of their way to help.  It makes a difference working away from home to feel so welcome in a hotel as many are to clinical, not the Marylebone.

123,Great hotel!,"We booked 2 rooms for a family of 5. The location is central, you can walk to Oxford Street in less than 5mn where a subway station is located. There are plenty of bakeries, express groceries and restaurants nearby. We stayed for 5 nights in December 2015. The service was excellent, my 5 years old daughter was offered a beautiful and fluffy teddy bear of the Hotel. She still has it and she still loves it, thank you for the teddy bear btw ! Coming from Toronto, the only heads up we would have wanted to get is that the rooms were tiny! Other than that, it was clean and we will go back without hesitation !!!",5,2016,08,22
123,Lovely stay,"I like this hotel, it was near of many tourist places, in addition it was clean and tge stuff was friendly, they reseive your order and do it promptly, i like to stay on this hotel again and i recomend it to my friends .",5,2016,08,22
123,Outstanding staff,"The location of the Marylebone is very convenient to Oxford Street/Harley Street; a bit away from the noise and bustle, but close enough to be practical. A taxi from Paddington station was less than £10; a taxi queue is conveniently located at the front of the hotel.

Our standard room was well appointed, clean and comfortable. A kettle (including a nice selection of teas) and a nespresso machine were welcome features. Free wifi in the room was consistently strong. Sufficient power points for our electronics.

Breakfast was lovely; the scrambled eggs were freshly prepared, and perfect. The Guinness toast was memorable in the best possible manner.

The outstanding feature of this hotel is definitely the staff. Everyone we encountered was sincerely pleasant, helpful and, happy. The tone in the hotel seemed to be one of warm professionalism - it was thoroughly a pleasure to stay at the Marylebone. Would be pleased to revisit.",5,2016,08,22
123,Great hotel. Wonderful staff,Stayed two nights Staff were fantastic all very friendly couldn't do enough for us.Can't fault it. Great location try the Marylebone cocktail. Very clean good turn down service rooms were modern and well equipped.,5,2016,08,21
123,Very comfortable hotel in a central location,"In London on business and I needed a good hotel near to the Oxford Circus area. The Marylebone was very comfortable and ideally situated. The room was a reasonable size and  very clean as were the public areas , only suggestion would be to increase the lighting in the corridors leading to the rooms . The staff  were friendly , polite and helpful. Overall I would recommend The Marylebone and I intend returning  there on my next overnight trip to that area of London.",4,2016,08,21
123,Superb hotel and stellar custom customer service,"This was my first time in London and I couldn't have chosen a better hotel than the Marylebone.  Not only is it located in a perfect and central area but the room was very comfortable, the bar and food were excellent and the gym and spa were to die for. The staff was great but I was especially impressed with Gunther at the front desk.  He always made me feel as though I was the only guest in the hotel. Very attentive and eager to help. I felt like he was my best friend upon check out. The hotel is super charming and everything is within walking distance-great restaurants, boutiques and public transportation. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone that is demanding of a perfect place to stay and an unforgettable experience. Ask for Gunther!",5,2016,08,21
123,Great Hotel in perfect location,"Having had a cocktail in the bar a few weeks before
We  decided  that the Marylebone Hotel was in a perfect location to spend a my birthday weekend which it was. The staff were all a credit to the hotel, friendly, knowledgeable and helpful.",5,2016,08,19
123,Excellent stay,"Needed a hotel close to Harley Street in a hurry (again) and found this one just up the road from the Holiday Inn I wasn't keen on for just £20 more. Very well decorated inside, cleanliness was good, standard of rooms was excellent and the bathroom was well done. It was small but had a great shower. Breakfast was really very good and would definitely stay here again.",4,2016,08,19
123,Feels Like Home at The Marylebone,"This is my third stay at The Marylebone Hotel. First of all, the location is unbeatable. It's like a local village with high end  and unique shops and quaint eateries that would please any palate. Regent Park is a ten minute walk from The Marylebone.The hotel lobby has various rooms with an art deco feel where you can sit comfortably on many different couches and enjoy a cup of tea or drink of choice. The restaurant has a delicious afternoon tea and the pastry chef makes luscious desserts. The beds are very comfortable and I love the warm tile in the bathroom-nice touch. The concierge Reyas is as welcoming as you could ever hope for and willing to help in any way. ",5,2016,08,18
123,Lovely business hotel - tiny bathrooms!,"This is the preferred London hotel for my company so I didn't pick it but I would definitely enjoy going back.

The hotel's open spaces were all lovely with lots to choose from. The bedroom was spacious and nicely decorated (I had a standard room). The bathroom was tiny though! I was quite impressed I have to say as maximum use was made out of the tiny space. I'm a size 8-10 and I had to basically squeeze in and out so maybe check to see if upgraded rooms have larger bathrooms. 

I skipped breakfast and just had a coffee so cannot comment on the food but the breakfast room was lovely, service was good, as was the coffee!",4,2016,08,17
123,Nice boutique hotel in a great area,"The Marylebone is a nice boutique hill in a great neighborhood. You can walk to Regent's Park, Oxford Street and Marylebone High Street from the hotel and the Bond Street and Baker Street tube stations are both about a 10 minute walk away. The rooms are a tad on the small side, but that's pretty typical for London. The furnishings are nice and modern, the bathrooms include sizable bath tubs and the turn down service adds a nice touch. The front staff are very nice and eager to please.",5,2016,08,16
123,"Perfect location, staff and hotel",We spent 6 nights at this hotel and everything was perfect. The quality of the staff makes a big difference with other hotels. Everyone welcomes you with a smile and they're always ready to assist you. The location is great too in a beautiful central area.,5,2016,08,16
123,OUR STAY AT THE MERYLBONE,"This is a great Hotel with excellent service, the staff is very friendly specially the concierge supported us in a professional way. the rooms are clean and well maintained the breakfast is good, staff is friendly.",5,2016,08,16
123,the marylebone,"my wife and i have stayed at thir hotelt for 7 nights. Upon our arrival we encountered an accomodation problem.in the reception lobby we were greeted by. jack who was very courteous,friendly and very sympathetic of our problem.the problem was eventually resolved to our satisfaction.jjack during our stay was effecient,always appropriate with his conversations and information of the city.it has made our stay very pleasurable together with the quality of breakfasts and cleanliness of our room and the hotel as a. whole.",5,2016,08,15
123,Excellent place for business or shopping,"This Hotel is located close to the main Oxford district, excellent location for a week-end of shopping or for business. Subway stations (Bond Street or Oxford Circus) are at a reasonable walking distance. Area is pretty quiet, but several interesting restaurant nearby. Rooms are pretty well organized, not extremely large for the superior rooms, but with all amenities you can expect from a five stars hotel. Breakfast is great with an excellent service. This is definitely a good choice and you not be disappointed.",5,2016,08,15
123,A real find in central London,Just got back from one night stay to celebrate my husband's birthday. We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. From the moment we walked in and joined the short check in queue the staff very attentive. We were greeted with glasses of chilled water and hot towels. We were given a very nice well appointed room on the fifth floor (see pic). The hotel is fantastically located 5 mins from Oxford Street (Selfridges) in one direction and 1 min from Marylebone High Street in the other with it's lovely array of boutique shops and restaurants. We found ourselves having a late lunch at the Ivy Cafe (practically next door) which was very good. There is a very well equipped gym and decent pool in the basement which we utilised. In the evening we had dinner reservations at Galvin at Windows on Park Lane (fabulous) which was a 5 minute cab ride. All in all we really thought this was the perfect hotel for a stay in central London. Only slight disappointment was (despite being told) they didn't manage to leave a card or any small token in the room for my husband's birthday! Anyway we look forward to returning the next time we get the chance and would thoroughly recommend.,5,2016,08,14
123,Our home away from home,"The Marylebone has become my place to stay when in London. The location is great (a great neighborhood away from the tourist areas), the rooms are a good size and they have a nice gym. The entire staff is extremely helpful and accommodating. The staff at the front desk were particularly helpful when we needed to change rooms (I forgot to ask for a shower without the tub when I booked the room--sadly I can't recall the name of the young woman who helped us) and when our bill got messed up (thanks Gunther!). I've stayed here before and each time the staff impresses me with their helpfulness.",5,2016,08,13
123,Marylebone hotel,The members of staff were very helpful. Breakfast was excellent. Being vegetarian I found more choice. Location was good. Room a little small. Otherwise an excellent stay. Drinks from the bar served outside was lovely as the weather was sunny. ,4,2016,08,13
123,Great hotel for this location,"We were very tired when we arrived and were immediately offered something to eat and some drinks.  Our room was very spacious and comfortable.  My son did not feel well, so we ordered dinner in and we had great food service.  Breakfast is offered at the back of the hotel in a very comfortable quaint setting. The concierge offered us some great restaurant choices.  This hotel is close to Bond Street and easy to walk to Piccadilly.  It is is in a great location to walk to quite a few great restaurants.",5,2016,08,13
123,"Showing some wear, but service is as terrific as ever","These were my 3rd and 4th visits to the hotel. I choose it because of the outstanding friendliness and service of the staff, in particular this visit, Gunther and Diana. I also choose to stay at the hotel for the very well equipped gym (with a variety of classes) on site, and the location (not far from Bond Street, near Marylebone High Street and the super healthy Good Life cafe is around the corner).Finally, the beds and linens are quite comfortable and the rooms are relatively sound-proof. I was near the elevator and had windows to the street but never heard any noise despite being a light sleeper. 

On these trips, I stayed in the less expensive hotel rooms (Superior, I think they're called) and these are starting to feel a little worn - desk drawers don't close, bathroom tiles are showing some age and there were problems with the desk outlets in both rooms I stayed in (223 and 425). Also there was dark hair in both bathrooms. I alerted the hotel to the issues and I suspect given their level of service, they will attend to these things. 

These are not major issues and are easily overlooked given the continued stellar service of the staff at The Marylebone. I also see it as excellent value for the money and recommend it to friends and colleagues needing a place to stay in central London. ",5,2016,08,12
123,Perfect Hotel,"The Marylebone is an excellent hotel. The staff is on the ball. The concierge, Rahim Ismail handle all our needs; he guided us and booked restaurants and shows. He was very attuned; he asked all the right questions which enabled us to have a terrific vacation.",5,2016,08,12
123,Excellent Hotel in a Great Location,"Great hotel with everything I needed it to be. Perfect location, good service and comfortable room.  I read that the rooms were small, which they were but I thought the layout was very well done so that it catered for everything I needed.  I would definitely recommend staying here. ",5,2016,08,11
123,Great family visit,"Spent three nights here in August in a family room.  Staff were terrific and very helpful, especially the concierge Rahim!!!  Excellent location, clean modern rooms, and a nice bar in the evening.  Didn't eat in the restaurants but they looked quite nice. Highly recommend this hotel!!!!",5,2016,08,11
123,Wonderful hotel for a family holiday,"We had a wonderful stay with our two young children at The Marylebone.  They have a nice set-up of adjoining rooms and were incredibly accommodating in finding a room set-up that worked well for our family (we preferred side by side rooms, so we could leave the door open at night, rather than corner rooms that connected through a vestibule).  The location is perfect - away from the crowds but a short walk to the tube, bus, and high street.  Another huge bonus was the pool - it was so nice to let the kids swim for a bit in the afternoon as a break between sightseeing and dinner.  

The staff couldn't have been nicer, learning the children's names and always offering help with directions or water or an umbrella.  The concierge was also great.",5,2016,08,11
123,Stayed one night,"Me and my brother had a twin room booked. 
We were only staying for one night I wish it had been for longer. 
I was so impressed with the staff and their genuine kindness and how helpful they were. 
The room was lovely it comprised of twin beds, a desk and chair and comfy chair to sit in. It has many mirrors and a lovely marble bathroom. 
The hotel had many seated areas downstairs which were very classy. 
It is in a perfect location not even a five minute walk to oxford street. 
I would say the nearest station which is Bind Street is about 5 mins walk on Oxford street. There are many restaurants and shops nearby. 
We actually stayed here for Wembley stadium as the tube (underground) for Bond Street is direct to Wembley stadium. 
I was told there was free access to leisure facilities and free access to a computer room. However I didn't have enough time to enjoy these features. 
Either way I would definitely stay here again! ",5,2016,08,11
123,Fantastic service in an amazingly pleasant and beautiful hotel,"Our fourth visit to this hotel which has taken over as our favourite stay in London. Great value for money in this beautiful and classy hotel with the most friendly service we have encountered in London, which says a lot in this service minded city. All staff is fantastic with a special thanks to Gunther who made our stay very memorable.",5,2016,08,10
123,Great location and enjoyable stay!,"Would recommend this hotel, good location,  5 minutes walk from Bond Street tube station, Oxford St. Marylebone High Street close by with lots of restaurants and shops. The staff were very polite and service minded, even helped with booking events and restaurants. Hotel invited us to guided tour of the local area which was very enjoyable and much appreciated. Rooms clean and tidy, excellent room service and housekeeping. Didn't eat at the hotel except for breakfast, continental included, full English available at extra cost.
Overall an enjoyable stay and would definitely go back.",4,2016,08,09
123,"Great bar here, excellent staff","I'm a regular guest here. Love it.

The bar and staff in the bar are second to none. 

Front reception team are very polite, diligent and welcoming. 

The facilities are great although admittedly I have not ventured to the pool or gym as I'm having too much fun in the bar. Bar staff make excellent cocktails and take pride in their work.

Being a regular guest here I feel like part of the family.

The restaurant is good but I rarely eat here due to the variety of good places nearby.

5 minute walk to oxford street and Bond Street tube station. 10 minutes walk to Oxford Circus.

",5,2016,08,09
123,"Perfect location, Amazing staff","I came here with my husband to a vacation for a week. 
The caring and warm treatment I found within the great staff was outstanding.
The location is perfect and the breakfast was very good.

Among the front desk staff, a very special thanks to Gunther for his help and care.",5,2016,08,08
123,Amazing stay at The Marylebone,"My wife and I had an amazing week stay at The Marylebone on August.

The rooms and hotel are beautiful, the location is perfect, and the staff is very nice and welcoming.

The English breakfast is very recommended.

And lastly, a very special thank you to Gunther who was very understanding and helpful in a honest and friendly manner. every hotel should have a Gunther.",5,2016,08,08
123,Liverpool v Barcelona,"This is a modem hotel in a traditional area and street in Mareylebone.  
We are a family of 4 who were visiting London to watch Liverpool v Barcelona at Wembley. Hotel is in a great location close to oxford street for shopping , and easy access to tube trains direct to Wembley stadium. 
The room facilities are pretty standard for a hotel of this type, very clean and a decent size.
Staff could not have been more helpful, offering free drinks when we arrived, and bottles of water to take out on a hot day. , we didn't eat at hotel, but would have been happy to do so.  Great hotel great location.",5,2016,08,08
123,The best hotel with the best staff,"I came here with my daughter to recover from an injury. The caring and warm treatment I found within the great staff was outstanding. 
The guest relations agent Gunther was attentive and treated me as if I was the queen of England. 
Whenever I'll be back in London - this is the hotel I will choose. ",5,2016,08,06
123,Amazing. The best hotel and service ever,"We were so surprised by the kindest service we got here. In the rooms, room service, restaurant and smiling faces all over. The best staff! Gunther the guest relations agent especially! He helped us with any request we had at the reception office. ",5,2016,08,06
123,Very nice hotel,"I've stayed at the Marylebone for business two different times.  The staff are very pleasant and helpful.  The location is great...easy to get around, but not on an overly busy street or area.  The rooms are all a bit different.  On my first visit the room was a  small...but then again it's London.  On my second visit I was given a bigger room that was much brighter and laid out better.  One thing I really liked was the gym.  My first time using it, I was a bit shocked...let me explain why.  The gym has a separate elevator.  So at 6:00 am I got on the elevator and as the doors opened I walked into the middle of a full gym...spin class and all...not your typical hotel gym with the one bike, one treadmill and 4 weights.  Apparently, there is a gym for the locals in the building that as a hotel guest you have access to.  It was a pleasant surprise, but boy was I confused at 6:00 am and still working through my jetlag.  My brain just couldn't register what was going on!  In summary, I would highly recommend this hotel...and it's gym!",5,2016,08,05
123,Outstanding,"Excellent location, service and sleep quality . It is always a pleasure to check in. Friendly staff, very nice areas for sitting in , breakfast area could be improved , it is always very well booked and crowded sometimes ",5,2016,08,04
123,Always special,"The Marylebone is my mainstay when visiting London - I think I've stayed maybe a total of 10 times - sorry the review's a bit late!

Apart from the awesome location, I can't say enough about the staff. It's nice that the staff know I come back all the time and appreciate it. My early check-ins are always accommodated as far as possible, as are last minute changes and late check outs. For business travellers who need a gym, the Third Space gym in the hotel cannot be beat. The 108 Pantry restaurant is great for breakfast, serve a mean tea and perfect for lunch. And a special call-out to Gunther who helped me navigate some last minute travel changes.

See you all soon.",5,2016,08,04
123,Fantastic Suites in a fantastic location,"After a hic up with check in we had the most fabulous stay, the hotel is beautiful and in the best location which is so quiet considering its a stones throw away from Oxford St. The food was amazing and the cocktails even better! Gunter and Jack especially are a credit to your hotel, witty and personal are qualities you just cant teach.",5,2016,08,04
123,Shirley Fabian,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at The Marylebone, the location is superb, the staff
very pleasant and extremely helpful in particular 
Guest Relations Agent Gunther Schildwachter.
They are very good with children as we were a big family.
We will be returning there on our next trip to London!",4,2016,08,04
123,Best hotel in London,"Had an exceptional stay here. The rooms were fantastic, the staff amazing, and the gym beyond perfect. Couldnt have been happier. The location is also amazing as it is not in the center of the tourist zone yet close enough to walk to. Made lots of happy memories here.",5,2016,08,02
123,Very nice hotel!,"Very nice hotel - gives a luxurious feeling. Friendly and attentive staff - the doormen especially. I had an incident in the room which was dealt with professionally and sweet from the staff.
The room was very small for a Superior room and the bathroom was extremely small. I could hardly close the door while on the toilet... And also the bathroom didn't have a makeup-mirror which I had in a different room a different stay. 
The AC worked nicely and the beds are great!!!
I don't like that you can't put your own bottles in the minibar though but it wasn't a big problem. 
All in all, a great hotel, really nice location, quiet and very cosy area.",5,2016,08,01
123,Very nice stay and exceptional service,"We stayed 2 nights and we had a great time. I stay in many 5* and I can definitely say that the service is exceptional. For a hotel in London, the room size is good. The breakfast is very nice and at a reasonable price. Definitely recommend the hotel!",5,2016,08,01
123,Perfect location super nice hotel,"The hotel is located in a lively neighborhood surrounded by pubs coffeeshops and shopping. Lots of youngsters generate good vibe in the streets around.
This modern hotel offers very good service, nice bar and restaurant. The hotel team are very professional, always polite, kind and affective.
We will definitely return.  ",5,2016,07,30
123,Good location for shopping,"Modern and comfortable room with a small bathroom but it did have a bath with a shower. Having not used a Nespresso machine before, I had to Google what to do and I had to call down to reception when the lights wouldn't turn on at the main switch (apparently the switch by the bed needed to be on as well?). I didn't eat in the hotel as there are so many different places to try in London. It is in a good location for shopping and a 10 minute walk from the tube. I personally prefer hotels with more character but this is a quality hotel with all that I needed for a one night stay.",4,2016,07,30
123,Great location - but not worth the price paid. ,Stayed here for a short stop in London - the suburb Marylebone is great and location of the hotel is perfect for walking to Oxford st etc - the hop on and off bus stops are close too. Marylebone offers great places to eat and explore so you don't have to walk far. For the price we paid to stay at the hotel I would've expected a little more - hotel was clean and staff were lovely but the size of the rooms were TINY - we upgraded also but still found the rooms far too small - like a shoebox then adding two suitcases. The bathroom is even smaller. From the pictures you see advertised it just didn't have the same appeal in person. It's fine for a short stay but check your pricing. ,3,2016,07,30
123,Outstanding Service,"I love this hotel. I stay here every time I come to London. It is smart and sophisticated and so very comfortable. Very easy to get anywhere in London from here.
But the main reason I love this hotel is the staff. Amazing, friendly and helpful.
Especially Gunther on the Front desk. So attentive to every need-the perfect guest liaison. 
I will keep coming back to this hotel.",5,2016,07,30
123,It came as a pleasant surprise,"This review should have written much earlier but it is never late to share my experience.  My trip was in December 2013.  

The decision to stay in Marylebone was due to its location which is near to Oxford Street, ideal location for Boxing Day Sales. 

When it comes to hotel, it is not about the number of star that is awarded but the overall experience.  The ability to make the guest feels at ease is very important. 

In this aspect, Marylebone team has done it.  

Three things that I enjoyed during my stay 
1) The gym - although it is not managed by the hotel and I could only go there once or twice due to public holiday, it is a good place to sweat.

2) The team was very helpful and the conversation went beyond the hotel services.  The team was from all over Europe and it was a great experience  and conversation for an Asian to understand what the country has gone through. 

3) Honestly I am not a food person but the experience at the breakfast was something I looked forward each morning.  The short conversation with the breakfast team and the simple and yet yummy breakfast made my day. 

I would love to come back to this hotel one day",4,2016,07,29
123,back again,"I recently returned to the Marylebone and can honestly say the stay was even better.  The staff seem more and more like family, especially Gunther, who seems to be on top of each guest's stay.  I watched him make recommendations and reservations, and just generally check on everybody as they returned after a log day.  I also overheard other guests commenting on him and his ability to make the hotel seem more like a home.  The only negative I can say about the hotel is that they will enter your room and clean it, even if a ""do not disturb"" sign is on the door.  I often unpack and scatter my things around the room while I run out to shop.  I was horrified to find my things placed into neat piles when I returned.  I'm sure this is done because so many guests have inadvertently left the sign up all day, but I do find this practice disconcerting.  Besides this, I couldn't possibly recommend this place more!",5,2016,07,28
123,Excellent central London lodging!,"The Marylebone is a lovely hotel.  Good location.  Stylish without being OTT.  And considering its quality and location it is good value.

Bar is nice.

Breakfasts excellent.

Rooms comfortable - some are a bit small -  but that is typical of Central London. ",4,2016,07,27
123,Fantastic Staff,"In excellent hotel was a 'great service. The staff at the reception desk is always professional and friendly, especially Miss Elena Salvatore super friendly and professional ready to risoslvere every situation. Very good and friendly even the staff of catering for both breakfast and dinner.",4,2016,07,26
123,Hired Bulstrode Suite for seminar,Lovey hotel. Return to host all our seminars here  twice a year as very professional and helpful staff. First class service. Highly recommended.  A big thanks you to Rohini and Otto who looked after us so well.,5,2016,07,26
123,Yet another great stay....,"On our annual trek back to the homeland, the Marylebone has become a fixture for us. We love this hotel. Location is about 4 streets from Oxford street so getting to anywhere is easy, whether by taxi, underground or walking. It is great to walk into a hotel and be welcomed back. The front desk staff are always pleasant and friendly. The hotel has a luxurious feel in some aspects and then old English with a living room setting and a fire   They offered us hot towels and bottled water, a nice touch. Our rooms were ready. They were nicely decorated, bright and modern, and quiet. And if you happen to be in London when it is warm (those 2 or 3 days a year), the air-conditioning is awesome!

The breakfast was nicely done in the hotel's restaurant. A choice of continental or full English. A good selection of food, breads, cereals, and juices. And for those who enjoy smoked or pickled fish (not me for sure), it is there. The staff is polite and friendly, and the service was very good. 

We didn't go to the restaurant, but sampled the bar, which was nice, but that night, the music was extremely loud so we did not spend long. Room service was good; a smaller menu, but from order to eating was 20 minutes.

Sometimes it is the little things that you remember. On finding out we needed a taxi, the doorman actually ran up the street to a larger road, and got us a taxi, which he then brought to us.

All in all, another great stay. Our home away from home across the pond.",5,2016,07,25
123,Great location and lovely hotel,"This hotel is located in a quiet, yet centrally accessible area. The staff are friendly and helpful. There is a wonderful gym and pool as well as a variety of food service options. We would certainly consider staying here again when we return to London.",5,2016,07,25
123,Very good convenient location,"Good & convenient location with standard rooms and clean facilities. The hotel is 10 mins walking distance to Hyde Park and Regent Park, which is very good if you want to take a walk or run. 

The key negative was receptionist asking for any newspapers for the morning during check-in and then when I saw the bill at the check-out, the hotel charging the newspapers to my account. The receptionist should inform me that the newspapers were not complementary, which was a big miss I believe and stg I have never experienced before at any hotel.",4,2016,07,25
123,Great place ,"A very good hotel well situated and at a decent price for London 

A special thanks to Anass who has been very helpful.

Rooms are very comfortable and the place very quiet even at busy hours.

The Swimming pool is very pleasant and gym great
 
At the end a very good place to stay for the week end We shall come back with no doubt 

",4,2016,07,24
123,Absolutely wonderful,"Stayed a couple days at The Marylebone with my wife, on our way to Greece. All I can say is WOW. We have really enjoyed the Bloomsbury previously, but this may be our new favorite London hotel. The location is fantastic - just a short walk to several Tube stations and, Soho, shopping, etc. The hotel has an excellent breakfast and probably the best hotel gym I've ever used. 

The real key to our stay, however, was the incredible staff - especially the Bellman/Concierge/Security/All Around Amazing Jack. He's impossible to miss and impossible to not absolutely love. He tirelessly helps guests with anything and everything that he possibly can and does it all in good cheer. Truly great people really make a great hotel experience, and The Marylebone really has that. 

I'd give it 10 stars, if I could. ",5,2016,07,24
123,They know how to turn it around,"We arrived for a one night stay on a Saturday evening and after dealing with London traffic we just wanted to relax but unfortunately our rooms weren't ready. This could have put a real downer on the weekend but Gunter sorted us out and between him and Jack on the front they made the rest of the stay an absolute pleasure. The rooms were fantastic, the service is second to non, the bar is pricey but they were willing to make cocktails that aren't on the menu and do them well so after a lovely breakfast and a dip in the pool we are unfortunately having to leave but we are almost definitely going to return.  ",5,2016,07,24
123,Great small family function,"We booked a 12 person family birthday celebration at the 108 Bistro. The food was fabulous, the wine selection more than ample and the wait staff brilliant. They sourced us a perfect cake and the night was a hit with everyone. Many thanks to all involved. ",5,2016,07,24
123,Amazing hotel and staff,I have just returned to Ireland after spending two nights with my daughter and another mum and daughter in the Marylebone Hotel. On arrival the girls were given teddies to welcome them and from then on our stay was wonderful. The staff were so helpful and friendly and nothing was too much trouble. The service and food was excellent and obviously the location is ideal. I can't imagine staying anywhere else when next back I. London.,5,2016,07,24
123,Good until...,We were having a great stay until we had gone to bed after 11.00 pm then a member of staff let themselves into our room! Unbelievable and then the night shift manager lied as to the reason why. Feel violated and palmed off. Cannot recommend.,1,2016,07,23
123,Perfect London base,"We returned recently to The Marylebone after previous visits to this and other Doyle Collection hotels. This has become our preferred London ""home away from home"". The hotel is lovely. Attentive staff, comfortable beds, good lighting (even a light over the bath perfect for reading while enjoying a long soak), efficient room service and very pleasant bar/restaurant facilities when we wanted to eat in. The Marylebone is in a great location with shopping, restaurants and cafes within walking distance and theatres and major attractions easy to reach by bus. In the hustle of busy London the hotel is an oasis of calm which offers a warm welcome and a sense of security and comfort from which to explore, or just pause and put our feet up. Thank you to the staff for another very pleasant London interlude.",5,2016,07,23
123,"Amazing Staff, wonderful accommodations and great location","I had a brief but wonderful experience at the Marylebone in May. From the moment I got there to I left the staff was more than happy to accommodate any question I had and go out of their way to point me in the right direction.  
The rooms were gorgeously decorated and very comfortable. The location had a lot to offer walking but also very close to trains to get anywhere in the city.  I had further assistance needed after I left and the hotel's concierge responded quickly and were extremely professional. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a wonderful experience in London.",5,2016,07,21
123,Thanks for a great visit,"From check-in to departure, the service was great. Neighborhood is fantastic with a good selection of pubs and restaurants nearby as well as shopping and entertainment. Some rooms were small so it's worth taking a look at options upon arrival. Facing Marylebone Lane is quieter and 4th floor or above gets you a rooftop city view and sunny room. Restaurant was very nice and the fitness facility stocked with latest equipment and lots of space. ",4,2016,07,20
123,A tour of London ,We had an amazing stay @The Marylebone. Made particularly great by the head concierge Rahim Ismail. He planned and mapped out our days sorted out tickets for us and did anything and everything he could to make out stay unforgettable. Thanks so much!,5,2016,07,20
123,4 star trying a little too hard,"The Marylebone seems to be a hotel not sure of its identity. I would describe it as a 4 star that's trying so hard to be a 5 star that it's actually a 3 star. 
The wifi in my room was poor, reception didn't seem too bothered about that. My TV remote only half worked (First world problems, but for the price of the room I expect everything to work as it should). Breakfast service was a little slow and the service was not up to what I'd expect of a 4 star hotel.
There were some positives but everything you'd expect in an expensive London hotel. The decor as a whole was nice, the room simple but modern. 
Would I recommend it, yes, but at a lower price only.",3,2016,07,19
123,"Good Location, Small but modern rooms, worth a stay",I really like the Doyle Collection and this was my first stay at the Marylebone. Service was excellent as was the breakfast and the restaurant. The rooms are the only drawback as very small and the bathroom barely navigable for my 6.2 foot frame. Fine for one or two nights. The common areas were excellent for meeting purposes. The next time I will book a larger room. This will stay on my list of repeats for London.,4,2016,07,19
123,Very nice Hotel ,"My husband booked this hotel for my birthday and it was an absolute gem situated just off Oxford St, it's positioning is perfect to get everywhere quickly and conveniently. We had tickets to the theatre and this was only about 6 minutes in a cab.  The room was bright, spacious and clean. The only downside for us, even though my husband paid for an upgraded room, the bathroom was really small. Everything In the room to make it a comfortable stay, bathrobes, slippers and fridge. We also had a lovely breakfast which was inclusive of the price. Cooked Breakfast is made to order so was fresh and hot. Continental breakfast looked very nice too. We would definitely stay here again and would definitely recommend. ",4,2016,07,19
123,a beautiful hotel set in the heart of Marylebone,"5 stars is hardly enough for this gem of a hotel.

My room was beautifully furnished ,with a very comfortable bed with lovely bed linnen and toiletries.
The staff are exceptional. The first greeting from the doorman set the very friendly  tone 
which was evident in all the other departments.
The breakfast was one of the best I have had in any hotel.
Great location to explore Marylebone and a very easy journey to Lords for the cricket.
A real treat.",5,2016,07,19
123,Very nice hotel in heart of central London.,"I came here yesterday. My room was on the first floor. I like the room a bit small so was the bathroom. I like the TV and there was tea/coffee tray. I love the bathroom colour too. The room has comfortable surroundings. There power showers no bathtub.
There was lots of hand towels and bath towels and slippers too. There also a gym.
I walk around London than take bus or underground. I love this hotel, I be back!!!",5,2016,07,17
123,"Great staff, nice hotel","Spent one evening at the bar during an earlier trip and fell in love with this hotel.  Next trip to London was sure to make a reservation.  The rooms were small, but well appointed and the staff was wonderful.  The only downside was that although quiet, it's a bit of a walk to the main street (Oxford).  If you prefer a quiet hotel off the beaten track, this is perfect.",5,2016,07,16
123,Great location,"Great hotel, perfect location. Friendly staff. Rooms a little small for a family of three (7). Noisy air conditioning. The room wasn't ready when arrived. The rest was perfect, including breakfast and staff",4,2016,07,15
123,A well positioned hotel.,"The Marylebone Hotel is well situated in Welbeck Street to walk to most sights in London.  The staff there are very friendly and helpful.  The rooms are rather small, especially the bathroom.  The water and chocolate at the turn down service is a nice touch.",4,2016,07,13
123,Great location,"Excellently located hotel, just off Oxford Street, with friendly helpful staff.

we stayed in a queen size suite on 7th floor and was super quiet with excellent air conditioning. Only grumble was the windows had wooden slatted Venetian blinds that look great but were not fantastic at keeps the light out in the morning. We ate at the brasserie on Friday night and was impressed but did not have breakfast in the hotel as we found the Ivy Cafe, just round the corner that was superb.
Would certainly stay again.

.",5,2016,07,13
123,A Warm Welcome,"Having stayed in a number of different hotels in London for business,I have finally found my hotel of choice! 
From the moment I arrived to the moment I left it just felt like a warm and comfortable place to be. It was so nice to be able to go for a swim after a long day of travel & work followed by a sauna - all whilst being right in the heart of the city! It was also fantastic to be able to attend hot yoga in the well-equipped gym downstairs before work in the morning - free of charge! Breakfast could not have been more welcoming and relaxed. The staff here are very welcoming and friendly.
I have stayed in trendier,more contemporary hotels in London as this is usually my style of choice - however, this hotel has something special. It is a place where one can truly ""switch off"" while travelling on business.",5,2016,07,12
123,Great location,"Love the location, it's got small cafes around the neighborhood and 2 blocks away from shopping 
great staffs, reasonable price and big swimming pool and gym facility . I can walked to Oxford street and New Bond street within 5 min but at the same time, hotel location is very quiet and safe 
",5,2016,07,11
123,Perfect event location in London,"Our company held its bi-annual Senior Management meeting here, were we had full meeting days for 5 days with approx. 30 people. Both during the planning process, as well as during the event, we received excellent and professional support from both the Sales & Events team, as well as all the other staff in the hotel. They were excellent in catering for our every need, including our last minute changes and requests. The sense that ""anything is possible"" was a very pleasant way of working and ensured that our group experienced a very successful event. Food options were extensive and of very good quality. The hotel is kept in a high standard of decor, comfort and has a very pleasing atmosphere for both the business and leisure traveller. Due to the many different seating areas, it feels cosy and you don't get lost in the masses of a large hotel. Personal attention and helpfulness from staff is what stands out throughout, were special mention should be made of the concierge staff Riyas and Rahim. They greatly assisted us with our extensive transfer needs and connected us to an outstanding transfer company that offered an impeccable level of service. We were very well taken care of and would without hesitation book The Marylebone again for a London event. We highly recommend it to any company looking for a well-positioned venue with a high level of service and personal attention.",5,2016,07,11
123,1 Night Weekend Visit ,"Location very good, reception very efficient and we received a very warm welcome. Small walk to oxford street , probably a further walk to your room as its a bit maze like. Our room was a superior room, I wouldn't quite say that, it was good but nothing special the air conditioning was working correctly and the room was small if anything. Overall still worth a stay. ",4,2016,07,09
123,London gem ,"Great service. Rooms were clean and spacious. Staff was very helpful. Would stay here again for both business and family trip. Highly recommend the restaurant for dinner too. If traveling from US, make sure to bring your adapters as that was one that didn't work. ",5,2016,07,08
123,An Amazing Hotel,"We visited this hotel for my partners birthday, it really was a great find! The service was second to none and nothing was too much for them. Our room was a good size for the location and was very well decorated.
If you are looking for a luxury hotel then this is most definitely for you.",5,2016,07,08
123,Another incredible stay at The Marylebone Hotel,"This is the fifth consecutive year that we have come to London and stayed at  The Marylebone Hotel. As always, the reception and welcome were superb. The room (626) was very quiet and had nice outlooks. TSA alway, the bed was super comfortable with a pleasant seating area. The marble bathroom, while not huge, was nicely done and excellent toiletries were supplied. The evening turndown, with a bottle of water (and delicious chocolate) was appreciated. The in-room Nespresso machine was also great.

Fantastic location just 5 minutes from Oxford Street and the Bond Street station and asp a block from High Marylebone Street with wonderful boutique stores, cafes and restaurants. Highly recommend the Caldesi restaurant behind the hotel and also Orrery which is a beautiful space with fantastic food and less than a 5 minute walk on High Marylebone Road.",5,2016,07,08
123,Absolutely wonderful ,"We've stayed at the marylebone for 5 nights and it was a great stay. The hotel is about 5 minutes walk from oxford st (Debenham) , the service and complementary water always welcome us back every day. The gym is outstanding- state of the art with equipment and very friendly staff. The hotel is quiet and although it's quite big it gives you the impression of a boutique hotel. Definitely recommends this hotel    ",5,2016,07,08
123,Started our Honeymoon off Amazingly...,My wife and I flew in from Boston and stayed here for the first three days of our honeymoon. The staff here is what truly makes this a great hotel. Raheem from concierge was the best and his enthusiasm for his job is clear.  We were greeted in our room by a chilled bottle of pride comes and a card congratulating us on our honeymoon. Now for the hotel itself: well appointed rooms and restaurant 108 was excellent. Location in the city is excellent with easy walks to Oxford Street shopping and Buckingham Palace. Would recommend this hotel to anyone wishing to stay in London for a reasonable price with excellent facilities and service. Thanks to the whole staff for making our stay so wonderful!!!,5,2016,07,06
123,Marylebone Hotel,"I have stayed at the hotel before,the best hotel I have been to in London. Very well situated,not too expensive,rooms quiet and comfortable. Staff very friendly and helpful,breakffast superb,best I have had in any hotel,better even then Hotel Sacker in Salzburg ! Highly recommended.",5,2016,07,05
123,Super Nice Stay,"Room was nice and very spacious! It is super good located, 2 min walking to Oxford Street. Staff is helpful and smily! Aurore from reception was very helpful before our stay and the n she welcome us tot he hotel and give us a beautiful room!",5,2016,07,05

 very very nice design super friendly and helpful stuff , great breakfast and very good location !!!
For sure I will be visiting this hotel again !",5,2016,07,04
123,Neighborhood Gem!,"What a wonderful find this was! We had quite a long stay at the hotel so we really got a chance to experience it's charm. It is a small but well appointed boutique hotel. The service is truly amazing from the guest relations manager Long V, to the concierge Raheem, to the housekeeping staff especially Daniela.  Our daughter got sick during the stay and the staff including Raheem the concierge were so attentive, caring and helpful that they made us feel at home.  The staff at the restaurant especially Chris and Santos made our breakfast experience every morning exceptional.  The staff at the front desk go above and beyond to make your stay incredible. Cocktails at the bar in the evening are fantastic and worth an evening.  I forget the bartender's name but the gentleman with the beard makes the best old fashions across the pond! The rooms are on the smaller side but as expected for a European hotel.  The quality of linens and the bed were excellent. The location is close to Oxford and Regent Streets which is very convenient.  Also the Marylebone surrounding area is worth a walk.  Great restaurants in the vicinity such as Fairuz, Trishna and the Daylesford Organic are in waking distance.  This a must stay whether you are there for business or pleasure!",5,2016,07,02
123,Very nice but a bit expansive,"Very well located in Marylebone area. The design of the hotel and room was pretty nice too. Very comfortable bed but the room was very small so was the bathroom. So comparing to the rate we have paid for each night (more than 200 euros breakfast not included) I found it expansive. View on building walls from our windows. There are better opportunities in other hotels in the area. Staff was nice and careful. 
",3,2016,07,01
123,Perfect Family Hotel!!!,"We had an AMAZING experience at the Marylebone!  From the moment we arrrived the service from the doorman (Jack), the concierge (Riyas), the restaurant service and the entire staff was excellent!! .  They were friendly, helpful and knowledgeable about the city. We had adjoining rooms because we were traveling with our 8 and 10 year old.  The rooms were very comfortable!!
Thank you for making are stay so enjoyable for the whole family!!",5,2016,06,30
123,Great location and charming staff,I enjoyed a great weekend in The Marylebone with my 7 week old son - the baby cot and baby accessories provided where fab and the location is absolutely perfect - close to my favourite street - Marylebone High Street! I will definitely be returning very soon. ,4,2016,06,30
123,This hotel is certainly worth a visit. ,"From the moment I booked this hotel till our departure the staff were incredible and most accommodating. They certainly made our short stay very memorable. I have stayed in many luxurious hotels that are extremely expensive but I have to say that the Head Concierge  Rahim would befit the best of any of those!! We will most definitely return soon. 
",5,2016,06,28
123,loved it once again,"loved our second stay in one year once more. this time we had a superb suite with views of london! the location close to oxford street is great and also marylebone high street is worth a stroll
once again gunther and raheem helped us with all their information and kindness.
we will come back ! thanks a lot for all",5,2016,06,28
123,Wonderful experience in London,"Lovely hotel and excellent staff!    We arrived very jet lagged early in the day and they went out of their way to make us comfortable until our room was ready.  The room was very comfortable and nicely furnished.

The hotel was wonderful too.

Will definitely return on our next trip.",5,2016,06,28
123,Perfect location ,What an excellent location and a perfect hotel for our most recent stay in London. We were walking distance to fantastic shopping on High street and Oxford street. We walked to dinner at the Chiltern Firehouse for an amazing dinner experience. We ate breakfast every morning in our own hotel and loved the baked egg omelet and breakfast buffet . Very good price point and very comfortable room and bed.  Would absolutely come back . Everyone recognized us in the lobby each day and remembered our name which always impresses me.  ,5,2016,06,27
123,Short break,"We chose this hotel from the reviews and its location. We weren't disappointed it was a very pleasant hotel and the staff couldn't do enough for us. The room itself was very nice and had all the mod cons we could wish for, although three cartons of milk a day is a bit tight that's not even two cups of tea each! To be fair they bought more every time we asked but not sure we should have had to ask every day! The bathroom was tiny, well equipped but tiny, there was no way of drying in there you had to dry in the bedroom. 

Having said that we had a lovely time and would return. ",5,2016,06,27
123,Tight rooms but high quality service and environments,"Just loved how friendly the staff were at this London boutique hotel, as well as the cool interiors. Absolutely loved the pool and steam room, don't miss them.  The restaurants are great for drinks and snacks (didn't have dinner there). Location is ideal for strolling in Marylebone.  The rooms are smaller than you might hope, but then again, it's London.",5,2016,06,27
123,Third year in a row,"The best location. excellent service. Comfortable  room . perfect Breakfast.
We stayed at the hotel for a week. In close proximity to the hotel are bars restaurants and cafes. Of course the hotel near shopping centers.
I must mention the outstanding service of the desk clerk Gunther ,who gave us a feeling of home.",5,2016,06,26
123,Great location,"Lovely hotel great bar. Felt welcome and relaxed. Junior suite was an upgrade and a well presented room. Service was good. However our kettle leaked so we could not use it, and the iron was old and leaked staining my shirt. On leaving we told the ft reception, there was no apology or any further action, just a polite thank you for informing them! Really poor response as the hotel is not cheap.  A real pity as the hotel and location are brilliant.",3,2016,06,25
123,Could not fault,"Stayed one night as son was getting married close by. Requested an early check in and the room was ready on arrival. Rooms fairly compact but spotless. The hotel is located just 5 minutes from Bond Street station and is tucked away on a peaceful one way street. Did not experience the restaurant, but the bar was efficient. Would stay again.",5,2016,06,25
123,fantastic family break!!!,"We stayed at the Marylebone Hotel during the May half term this year with our 3 young children. We couldn't have asked for a better hotel, the staff were very accomodating and helpful especially Roddy at front of house who was absolutely lovely and couldn't do enough to help us. Our children were also made to feel very welcome when he arranged for them all to have a hotel teddy bear and arranged milk and cookies at turn down and his kindness also stretched to a nice bubbly suprise for me and my husband 😊. We had two deluxe rooms (one king and one twin with an extra bed) that were adjoining which was great the rooms were beautiful, very clean, spacious and modern.
The hotel has a gym, spa and pool, and for families there are set times for childrens swimming, but that was great as it was never busy and our kids just loved it!! 
The hotel is based at the top of Oxford Street just 10 minute walk to Hyde Park, 20 to Buckingham Palace if you want to get to Westminster I would recommend the tube from Oxford Street station  which is a 5 minute walk from the hotel. All in all we had a fantastic time the children loved it we loved it and can't wait to return.
thank you to all the staff for making our stay as great as it was. 
DiMambro Family xx",5,2016,06,24
123,Very nice hotel and great staff!,"We had great service at this hotel, especially from Jack.  He gave us great recommendations on where to eat, shop and how to get around the city.  He made fast friends with our 6 year old son.  We will definitely return to this hotel on our next trip to London.",5,2016,06,24
123,Class and comfort in a great location,"As a couple and a teen aged daughter who know London very well, we were happy to return to The Marylebone. We love the personal attention we get from the useful and friendly staff and the general calm and comfy atmosphere.
With the great location between Oxford St. and Marylebone High St. we will certainly return to The Marylebone when we next visit London. As long as the prices will remain in their current range.",5,2016,06,23
123,The Best Hotel Secret in London,"We found the hotel when walking around and found the Marylebone neighborhood.  It is the prefect location in a quite, close in neighborhood and a truly wonderful hotel.  The only thing better then the hotel was the tremendously friendly and helpful staff.  This is where we will stay every time we visit London.  I have paid much more for a room in London and gotten much less.",5,2016,06,22
123,Very nice hotel,"Excellent service at this hotel. Room is very nice and clean. Bathroom was en suite but small. However did not spend much time in the bathroom. This hotel is very close to most of the tourist areas. We spent a lot of time walking and also figured out how to do the underground. Good breakfasts and wait staff was excellent!!!! The doorman was absolutely wonderful. I lost his card. But he was fabulous for helping with directions and encouraging us to explore. Also encouraged us to make sure we had water when walking.  We walked easily to the parliament and Thames from the hotel. Maybe 2.5 miles or three depending on route. We took the underground to kensington and walked that whole area. Loved the chocolates with turn down, Bar was excellent. Definitely recommend that you stay here.",5,2016,06,21
123,My best choice in London!,"I stay in this hotel for years and will never change. Even if the standard room are tiny and the price of the room relatively high (but it is London), everything is perfect in this hotel. i would never exchange it for another!",5,2016,06,21
123,A Very Nice Hotel,"This is a really fantastic hotel in an excellent location.
It is a 5 minute walk to Oxford Street, there are many bars and restaurants within a 5 minute walk.
We thoroughly enjoyed our stay.
The staff were very friendly and welcoming, the rooms were clean and to a very nice standard.
I would highly recommend this hotel.",5,2016,06,21
123,Great stay,"We stayed for 4 nights.
Great location, clean, comfortable.
Each night the hotel suplied fresh water bottles for drink,
Ambrela if the weather was rainy.
Its the little things...",5,2016,06,21
123,Meetings and Events,the hotel were great to deal with from start to finish i felt like we were in good hands. The service levels were consistently high with everyone front front desk staff to cleaners interacting and helping guests. The food was delicious and healthy which made such a nice change from the normal stodge that you get in other hotels. i would really recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a great central london property.,5,2016,06,21
123,Very friendly hotel,"Nice room, not too small, Queen sized bed. I booked directly with the hotel for the best price. Shelf in closet for bag. Good air-conditioner. Very high sided tub/shower. Chocolates with evening turn down. Free Glass water bottles. Spectacularly helpful and personable people at the desk at all hours of the day and night. Nice doormen. Lovely location near lots of shops and pubs. Very near Selfridge's. Very nice breakfast buffet.",5,2016,06,20
123,Great stay for business and leisure alike,"I was there for a night on a business trip, but could easily see myself coming here with my wife over a romantic week end. Very conveniently located, the superior room is extremely comfortable and well equipped. I'd come again. Also, the breakfast is fabulous and very high quality (even compared to hotels of similar standards). 

Bang for your buck is what you get here.",5,2016,06,20
123,Excellent Hotel with Outstanding Service and Attention,"This hotel, centrally located in London, is the best hotel I have ever stayed in and I have stayed in many fine hotels around the world.  It is very clean, comfortable, and quite, but it is the individual attention that sets this hotel apart from others.  From the services of Long Voong, the guest relations manager who gave wonderful advise on places to see and how to best get around the city economically; to the head concierge, Rahim Ismail, who made reservations for tours and the theater, tasks I have always done myself in the past; to Peter, the restaurant manager who frequently stopped by our table for friendly conversation, and finally Chaita, our breakfast waitress who served with a smile and cheerful attitude each day.  A wonderful surprise was the phone call the first evening asking how our day had gone.  This is a hotel that I would recommend to everyone and will return to again and again.",5,2016,06,19
123,Great weekend in central location,"This was the last of the Doyle hotels in London that we have visited in the last 12 months and like them all before it didn't disappoint. Friendly professional service from all the staff, excellent breakfast and bar service. Comfortable modern furnishings, plenty of comfortable corners to sit around. The only criticism was the bedroom and bathroom were small but then you don't spend long in your room when you are in such a fabulous location just off Oxford St and Marylebone High Street. Certainly it will be our go back hotel when in London",5,2016,06,19
123,Great People,"We loved our stay at the Marylebone.  The location was great, on a quiet street which we really liked. My husband said the gym was the best hotel gym he has ever been to.  We traveled with our teenage daughters and they loved it too, we had afternoon tea at the restaurant downstairs and it was the best afternoon tea we've had.  James the concierge was very, very helpful and so nice.  He helped us make dinner reservations every night and all the restaurants were great. ",5,2016,06,19
123,"Great restaurant & service, small rooms","The best thing about the Marylebone is the restaurant and the people working there. Food is great and breakfast is tops, but the rooms leave a lot to be desired.  Small and cramped, there is no space to even park your suitcase.  The bathroom door cannot be opened if you are seating on the toilet.  Two people don't fit in the bathroom.  If you are not planning to spend much time in your room or have a short stay, it is okay.  If your visit is longer than a couple of days, I would chose another hotel. Location is good too. ",4,2016,06,19
123,great stay,"All round great place to stay in town when on business, friendly staff, good food in bar and a good range to choose from on the menue,  room service really good too. Pool and spa worth a visit after a long day 15 minutes in the steam room helps too.. will be back when in town.",4,2016,06,18
123,Efficient ,"The hotel is efficient, if I asked to summarize it in one single word.  Everything worked well and the gym is quite good.  They would put some indications to the swimming pool.  Very well located, with good accommodations.  Highly recommended !!! ",5,2016,06,18
123,Where 5 star meets 2 star,"They say first impressions count, but these are now a distant memory.

Check in was perfect. Concierge offered a bottle of water whilst we waited no more than a minute. Receptionist was so friendly, professional and polite as well as offering some hot towels which were great as London was quite humid.

We booked a superior double. And when we arrived in the room it was small. Probably the smallest hotel room I have ever stayed in other than yotel.

No case stand, so suitcase is on floor. Tried to put it in wardrobe but that's too small to take a case. There is 2ft clearance between bed and wall on 1 side. Same at end of bed between bed and desk and case on floor, and 3 foot between bed and window. So moving about room has to be co ordinated if there are 2 of you. The bathroom is the same, toilet right by wall, with fixings where you're knees are. To shut door you need to manoeuvre in small area. The only feature if room that is a normal size is shower which is stunning.

Well stocked mini bar but no price list.

I had requested prior to booking no feathers in the room. This had not been done, but in fairness it never is. 

I went out to see a show and asked reception to change bedding. Receptionist phoned whilst I was there to house keeping.

Upon return at midnight bedding hadn't been changed. So back down to reception to query and a mis understanding. It was eventually done 15 mins later.

The only non feather pillows are hard shaped pillows which are horrendous. Sad that premier inns have a better choice than a 5 star hotel! I've had to take feather pillows back and take anti histamines so can not drink on my birthday - thanks a lot!

Day 2 and no white sugar in coffee tray - again it's stuffed in a small drawer so as with everything in room a total faff.

Both room keys failed day 2. More faff!

No usb chargers which are common in most hotels now, but very good free wifi.

Just the whole visit has felt like we're staying in a cheap hotel where you expect these types of issues.. 

Hotel itself and furnishing and fittings is lovely. Loads of areas to sit in hotel. Room itself is well furnished and has a lovely feel, if only it was larger.

So I'm afraid this is a 2 star overall. 5 star let down by tiny rooms and sone really poor attention to detail. (Pillows, case stand, sugar, bedding not changed twice).

123,Excellent,"Great Hotel!!!  Staff was wonderful. Jack the doorman especially helpful and knowledgeable. All staff very helpful and wonderful. Location very good. Room comfortable, great shower. Restaurant has great food, although expensive. Staff there was great.",5,2016,06,18
123,"Great location, fabulous staff, must-stay in London","The hotel is in a terrific location and the staff are just great. Only downside was the incredibly small room. Had I known it was that small, I would have booked a bigger room. Other than that, I would highly recommend this hotel and I will definitely stay there again albeit in a bigger room. ",5,2016,06,18
123,Mrs. Kelleher,"I'm fortunate enough to get to travel all over the world and stay in 5 star hotels. But it doesn't mean that I always get 5 star service. And as a former VIP manager I can say that I got the best service ever from the very friendly staff at The Marylebone. 

Thank you Gunther and Michael you're the best!

Kind Regards,

Vera Kelleher

123,Amazing Stay,"Many thanks to The Marylebone Hotel, we had a wonderful time staying with you. We stayed for 2 nights and was allocated to a upgraded room on the top floor, 7th floor. When we arrived the room wasn't ready but we did arrive early approx 10am, so we left our bags and went out for the day. On our return Aurore the Senior Receptionist organised a bottle of prosecco chilling on ice with 2 glasses because it was our wedding anniversary. She is a lovely young lady very approachable and friendly, The Marylebone should be proud to have Aurore working for them! We found all the staff friendly. Nice service from the breakfast team and also from the staff in the bar. Overall a great stay, location Excellant, rooms lovely and cleaned with fresh towels daily. Would definitely visit again when we return to London hopefully towards the end of the year. Many thanks to team at The Marylebone for a pleasurable stay and making our wedding anniversary rememberable 😊",5,2016,06,17
123,Nice hotel ,"I stayed here first one night celebrating my friends birthday. 
The staff were all friendly and welcoming. The hotel was 8n a good location within walking distance of alot of attractions. 
The room was modern and comfortable and the facilities there were excellent.
They included a gym and swimming pool. 
Had a lovely stay. ",4,2016,06,16
123,"Yes, the rooms are small BUT....LOCATION LOCATION LOCATION!","We arrived exhausted at the Marylebone Hotel mid-morning on May 19, 2016 after travelling all through the night.  They kindly offered us a room right away and explained that the location may not be as quiet as we had requested since it’s near the elevator but it was the only room available immediately.  They offered us the key to check it out and while in the room they called to say another room was now available that is quieter.  So we returned to the lobby to pick up new key and went back up the elevator with our luggage (we insisted)  to another floor.  The room was close to the elevator too which sort of surprised me (but not AS close as the other). It didn’t matter as it was quiet.  

The room itself is small as everyone reading reviews already knows.  We knew this in advance but booked it anyways as we wanted the location and felt if the room size was the only negative issue then it wasn’t a big deal.  We stayed 3 nights and despite knowing how small the room would be, if I’m totally honest, I will tell you that it was awkward and a bit more uncomfortable than anticipated.  We could barely fit one suitcase on the one side of the bed and the other had to sit on top of a chair. We couldn’t really open our luggage for any period of time.  But it was super clean, the bed was really comfortable and the location was great.  

We could walk to all the shops and restaurants.  Bus stops are very close and the tube is about a 10 min walk away which isn’t an issue except we walked SOOO much in London that walking back from the tube was a little tiring after a full day out.  

If you like traditional English fish and chips then check out The Golden Hind.  It is a block away.  There are lots of pubs nearby too.  Also, on Sundays, the Marylebone market takes place and it was nice to visit as well.  We had dinner one night at La Frommagerie and it was wonderful.  

We did not really see or talk to the staff at the hotel very much.  They sort of just leave you to it which I’m fine with.  The cleaning ladies were very friendly.  We had a drink (or 2 or 3) in the bar on the main floor and it was really a nice spot and very busy.  Excellent drinks, pricey but well worth it and they give you some yummy olives and almonds. 

Would I stay again? Yes! But, I would not stay longer than 3 days as it was just too cramped in the room for me with medium-large sized suitcases.  I’m still giving it a 5 star as I cannot fault the hotel. We knew the rooms were small already and could have upgraded but it’s central London and it’s pricey enough for a smaller room.",5,2016,06,16
123,Everything went to plan,"We recently booked two rooms for our children birthday celebrations over the weekend.

We booked directly with the hotels own reservation team, specifically Aurore the senior receptionist. We requested interconnecting rooms due to the children ages and were delighted to not only have this request accepted, but also to be informed of the arrangements prior to arrival.

The rooms were perfect with the added bonus of birthday cake and soft drinks for Lucy and Harry.

As a side note the breakfast was excellent .

Thanks to all the team at the Marylebone we will be returning soon.",5,2016,06,15
123,Lovely place,"We were all delighted with our stay here. Two of us aunts brought nieces for their 16th birthdays, and we had a spectacular visit. Jack was extremely helpful in getting us settled in and giving us directions for our adventures. The hotel itself is just simply beautiful and very welcoming. Highly recommended.",5,2016,06,15
123,Exceeded our expectations in every way during our 2 night stay at the hotel,The service we received from all areas of the hotel was outstanding. The quality of the food was excellent and the cleanliness throughout of a very high standard. The head conciege Rahim Ismail was particularly helpful in sorting out a problem for us.,5,2016,06,14
123,Perfect for a City Break,"Really fantastic hotel in an unbeatable location just minutes from Marylebone High Street and Oxford St/Bond St/ Regent St and convenient for the tube and buses. The staff were unfailingly polite and friendly, my room was well equipped, clean and comfortable, and the breakfast was delicious (choice of buffet and a la carte). I was also given an early check in, which was much appreciated as I arrived at 6am after a long haul flight. Guests can use The Third Space gym in the same building, which also has a pool and if you want to rexercise outside, you can be in Hyde Park in 5 minutes. Even though the hotel is really central, it's located on a quiet street, so there's no significant noise at night.",5,2016,06,14
123,Great Hotel with everything,"My wife and I stayed here for the final night of a two week vacation to London and then Amsterdam. Since it was the final night, I wanted to get a great hotel, something with no unwanted surprises in store, and we were not disappointed! This hotel is beautifully furnished with all the amenities.

After a six hour train ride from Amsterdam, we arrived at the Marleybone and were greeted by Jack the doorman who quickly got us set up and asked if we wanted coffee (which I did), a small gesture but very appreciated! That night he directed us to nearby restaurants and the next morning guided us to local place to get sandwiches for the flight back home that day. He was extremely nice and helpful and got us a cab. As soon as we got there we felt like we were home.

While this room was a little pricey for our standards, its actually pretty reasonable for such a fine hotel in an expensive city like London. Book a room here, you will not regret it.",5,2016,06,13
123,"Beautifully sophisticated hotel, ideal location ","Only a short review as it was a quick business trip, however the hotel was beautifully decorated, very clean and impeccably located for the heart of Marylebone! Surrounded by independent boutiques, fabulous eateries, great bars and a few rarely seen but pleasantly welcomed traditional English pubs! No noise on a weekend from hotel room but still close enough for nice night life if you are staying for leisure. Just 10 minutes taxi ride from kings cross. Would most certainly recommend and will be sure to stay again when in the area.  ",5,2016,06,13
123,"Excellent hotel, service and breakfast; too much noise at lowest floors","Very British hotel, very friendly personnel, excellent breakfast, nicely working wifi. Excellent location in an elegant part of town. 
For runners, Regent's park is 1km away. 
Would be 5/5 if the first floor was not that noisy from the street. ",4,2016,06,13
123,Nice hotel but room did not live up to expectations,"We stayed for one night as my husband was booked in early for a medical operation the next morning.  The staff at check in and checkout were lovely.  We had room service dinner which was lovely and could not be faulted, neither could the waiting staff who delivered the food.   However, the room itself was disappointing.  

We had booked a Deluxe room.  The bedside unit on one side of the bed had a drawer which remained open and would not shut.  The plaster on one side of the window was all cracked, a rather large crack with the wallpaper coming off.  There was a broken tile coming away over the toilet flush button and under the sink some of the trimming was coming away and had been stuck down with tape but had come away again. The bathroom was tiny, you had to close the door to get to the toilet as it was behind the door.  Certainly not what we expected for the money spent and it was a very disappointing experience for us.

",3,2016,06,13
123,Excellent service!,"Arrived to smiley faces and a very helpful service desk. The hotel was not able to find my booking and the problem was that I had booked and paid up front the day before. Totally my mistake! A extremely service oriented guy, name Gunther, sorted it out and I was given a room with no extra charges. Thank you so much - I already know were to stay next time!",5,2016,06,13
123,A beautiful hotel for a beautiful occasion!,"My partner and I stayed at this hotel last weekend for our anniversary. As well as being upgraded to a suite and having a bottle of Prosecco delivered to our room as a kind gesture, the staff were friendly, polite and jovial. The interior of the hotel is exquisite, especially on the ground floor. Stylish, modern and very comfy. The juices were fab too, a real elegant touch!

The only slightly negatives is that the fuse went in our room due to a faulty iron and I think the swimming pool could do with a re-vamp. Nothing to ruin our trip though. I also agree with the other review, the  rooms are a little small - again nothing really complain about as there is plenty of space elsewhere. Although £255 a night, the luxurious experience we received was great value and the hotel is in a perfect part of London.",5,2016,06,13
123,Great hotel in a Great location,"Amazing hotel, great service, in a brilliant location. I have stayed here several times now, and every time is as good as the last. The rooms are not overly large, so if you want a big room, book a suite. The hotel is big, but still boutique. The best Hotel Gym I have ever seen - it is brilliant.",5,2016,06,12
123,A Lovely Stay and Friendly Staff,"The Marylebone wil be our home when we travel to London - that is how much we enjoyed our time at the hotel, Our stay was memorable for the fabulous, friendly people even more than the fabulous hotel itself. Special thanks to Long, whom we enjoyed becoming acquainted with and sharing stories in addition to his superb customer service. Also, thanks to Jean, who helped ensure that we could easily accomplish our goals on this visit to London. I could go on and on. Thank you all and we hope to visit again soon.",5,2016,06,12
123,Great location,"Very comfortable hotel just a few minutes walk from Oxford St, and the quieter Marylebone High St which contains a number of good pubs and restaurants.    We walked to Lords cricket ground which was easy and the walk back later via Regents Park was nice on a sunny Sunday afternoon",5,2016,06,12
123,Lovely hotel in great location,"I have stayed at this hotel for both business and leisure.  The location is superb with wonderful bars and restaurants and amazing shopping just minutes away and a stones throw from Marylebone high street and Oxford Street. 

The quality of breakfast is good although there could be more choice.

The staff are friendly, welcoming and helpful.

The beds are very comfortable and rooms and quiet ensuring a good nights sleep.  On a downside, with price in mind - some of the rooms are quite small, as are some of the bathrooms where it can be difficult to close the door when inside.",4,2016,06,12
123,Great stay,"We recently stayed at the Marylebone just one night but had a fab stay. The staff were very friendly, in particular jack the concierge was excellent. He gave us great restaurant recommendations and was helpful w our small children. It's right around the corner from great shops/boutiques and I would definitely stay here again. The only negative is rooms are slightly small but that's London! ",5,2016,06,11
123,Wonderful Stay,"My husband and I have just returned from this wonderful hotel.  It is in such a fantastic location, with friendly local pubs and cafes around and so close to the busier Oxford Street area if you want to go there.  It was relatively straight forward to find from Victoria on foot and we were delighted to be offered a room upgrade on arrival!  The staff were so friendly and nothing was too much trouble.

Our room was incredibly spacious and modern and the bed was huge (my only gripe being it was two single pushed together but a very small gripe).  It was very quiet (I hate noise!!!) and the turn down service was a nice touch.  

The 108 Brasserie which is the hotel restaurant was also fantastic!!!!!  We had a gorgeous meal in modern surroundings and having previously noted on the booking it was my husband's birthday, we were presented with a complementary glass of champagne, a really lovely touch.  

I would/will definitely stay here again.",5,2016,06,11
123,Verry nice hotel! Great personal.,"a nice and welcoming hotel . Robert the receptionist did everything possible to feel great. Thank you!
We recommend this accommodation!",5,2016,06,11
123,Perfect!,"Great hotel. Really nice staff always ready to help. They would even lend you an umbrella when you are going out in the rain. Nice rooms. Full of details like comfy sleepers, new like towels, nice tea & coffee amenities, cold flavoured water at the recepción desk, lovely chocolates waiting for you at night time. Conveniently located, close enough to Oxford St, etc.
Would love to come back to this hotel!",5,2016,06,10
123,"Great guest service, amazing food and fantastic location","I have recently organized an event at The Marylebone Hotel for 20 guests for a three days seminar. Everyone at the hotel has been extremely efficient... and no words are found to thank the events department! Every request has been resolved and the words ""No we cannot do this"" just do not seem to be found at this hotel! 
The food is healthy, fresh and very tasty! The rooms are clean with lots of natural light and spacious.",5,2016,06,06
123,Can't Beat The Location,"Nice hotel, clean rooms, comfortable and beautiful bar/restaurant to have a drink at the end of the day. Can't beat the location. 5 minute walk to Oxford street to get the train or stroll the streets of Marylebone to eat and shop. This hotel can't be beaten for location. Marylebone is beautiful.",5,2016,06,06
123,Great value and service,"My family and I spent a week at The Marylebone in June 2016.  We had two junior suites on the sixth floor, which I would highly recommend because this floor's rooms have larger windows and, thus, more natural light.  

The hotel, bar, and restaurant employees are superb.  They made our stay extremely pleasant and fun.  We utilized the concierge service extensively for restaurants and other details.  

I have stayed in many other London hotels, and The Marylebone is an excellent value if you are looking for a 4-star+ experience.  

The Marylebone neighborhood is very safe, convenient, and provides a significant number of restaurant, pub, and boutique options within a short walk from the hotel.

I will certainly return to The Marylebone",5,2016,06,05
123,Another excellent stay,Always a great choice for a London stay. Small but well appointed rooms in a terrific inner city location. Clean quiet and stylish. Only one minor quibble on this stay: i needed some dry cleaning done same day. But I called after 8.45 am  (8.55!) and was told it was not possible. Yet there are two cleaning services two minutes' walk from the hotel. So I arranged it myself! (A tip for travellers - one of these will do travel laundry for you). Not the end of the world but certainly something that could be brushed up on. Otherwise though a thoroughly professional hotel.,5,2016,06,02
123,Doing the London Thing!,"After getting married we decided that we would go on Honeymoon later in the year. We had some tickets for various places to see in London so I booked a night in the hotel as a surprise for my new husband! We had a suite on the 7th floor, it was fabulous, he loved it!
We arrived early but was able to check in & drop our bags & get a taxi to our first haunt! Had a fantastic time & came back to our lovely room to relax, got ready and went out again! 
On arriving back we went to the bar, it was really buzzing, friendly staff and a great atmosphere! All in all a great place.",5,2016,06,01
123,Amazing Staff,"We didn't stay at this hotel but I just wanted to let others know what amazing staff they have. We were booked on a Evans tour on May 4th, our hotel wasn't a pickup point The Marylebone was. We arrived at 7.15am and stood outside waiting, a lovely man came outside and asked us if we were waiting for a tour and would we like to come inside and wait, we said we weren't staying at the hotel, he said we were more than welcome to come inside and have a coffee while we waited, we had a chat about London then he went back in. Someone else come to wait for the tour and he came back out and asked them to come inside for a coffee. The lovely man (tall, young, beard, not much hair) then came back out and said he would call the tour company as we had waited nearly 30 minutes, he came back out to say they were running late and we could wait inside, we declined. He also offered us a bottle of water to take with us. To be treated so nicely & not to be even staying in the hotel made this hotel a very attractive place to book next time we are in London.",5,2016,06,01
123,Loved the Marylebone Hotel ,"Wonderful hotel,staff and location 
The lounge area is great for relaxing,meeting friends
The room was small but beautiful and had great light
Great bed 
Really nice gym and pool
Location was perfect, great little restaurants and easy access to everything
Will stay there again",5,2016,05,31
123,"Great staff, small rooms.","Thankfully, as ever, I was on my own. I'd hate to be sharing a standard room with a lady. I can make enough clutter to fill that size of room.
The bathroom was very cramped and to towel dry I really had to come out of it. From what I saw of the breakfast room where I met my friends on arrival, it was also cramped and chaotic (0900 on a Saturday.) By way of contrast the lounge areas are comfortable and welcoming.
The real plus side to this hotel are the staff, who could not have been more helpful or efficient, many thanks. Iced water on reception was very welcome.
The hotel is a great location for shopping being only five minutes walk from shops on Oxford Street.
Overall - good location , superb staff but overpriced because of room size.
I have stayed at better value hotels in London.",4,2016,05,31
123,Great place to stay in west london,"The Marlyebone is a very nice hotel and a great place to stay.  The hotel is in a great location near Marlyebone High Street.  The hotel itself is great.  Nice and very clean rooms; very helpful and well informed staff.
Despite being in a very ""happening"" neighborhood, the street is very quite. I had a room over the main entrance and it was perfectly fine (and I am a light sleeper!).

Their restaurant and bar: bistro 108 is very good - much better than you would expect from a hotel restaurant.  Breakfast is very good and a really nice plus is a juice bar.
Taxi service is easy to/from Paddington, and Bond Street tube station is a 5 minute walk.
All good!  I will be back the next time that I am in London.",5,2016,05,31
123,Marvelous Marylebone,"Just spent two delightful nights here celebrating a special birthday with my friend.  The Marylebone is a stylish, modern hotel in a great location.  On arrival the staff were exceptionally courteous and attentive, in particular the senior receptionist and the concierge. The hotel is tastefully decorated throughout with subdued lighting in places and subtle fragrances giving an air of restful ambiance. We had a room on the fifth floor and found the size ample for two.   Enjoyed a cocktail (or two) in the trendy bar downstairs but sadly had no time to check out the pool and spa facilities.  That's a definite maybe for next time.",5,2016,05,31
123,"Pleasant stay, attentive staff",Gunther was very accommodating at reception and assisted me with a room upgrade. All staff during breakfast and room service were very polite and remembered me by name. Good gym with good equipment. Would stay there again.,4,2016,05,31
123,Lovely boutique hotel ,"We loved this gem! The staff were so accommodating from arrival to departure, making reservations, giving directions, offering suggestions for touring and always a cold bottle of water when you leave. The room, while small by american standards , was clean and comfortable and well maintained. The breakfast is a highlight! Lovely buffet plus whatever you want 
From the menu included in our room price. Try avocado toast with poached eggs and grilled tomato. Coffee is good and service very attentive. I would stay here again for sure. ",4,2016,05,30
123,Excelent Hotel,"The Marylebone Hotel has a excelent location, near Oxford Streed,Bond Street. The construction ie new, then the bathroom, room etc...are very nice and clean.The wi-fi is very good in all spaces of the Hotel.The breakfast is very good with many options. The staff of the Hotel is very friendly and helpful, Mr Gunther helped us ( he is Brazilian too) and explain many things of London.",5,2016,05,30
123,Fabulous Marylebone,"We stayed here on the weekend to celebrate my friends birthday. This hotel is amazing from the outside it looks quite ordinary .... til you step inside. Location could not be better central for most things, it has a great ambience with lots of lovely chill out areas and a superb bar with great cocktail makers..... Our favourite being the signature Marylebone Cocktail. From the minute we arrived all the staff were so attentive, special mentions must go to Aurore and Raheem The Concierge, thank you both for being amazing and tending to our every need!.... We will certainly be back and would highly recommend the Marylebone as The Place to stay !",5,2016,05,30
123,Very small rooms,"I stayed in this hotel last year for business trips. Great location - that is definitely a plus.
The rooms are very small. it was difficult to move in the room  having a baggage. Breakfast is good, you can choose if you would like to have a buffet or order from the menu. But waitresses are not friendly unfortunately.
Wouldn't recomment to stay here.",3,2016,05,30
123,"Convenient, stylish hotel in a nice neighborhood ","Nice, stylish hotel and a good a là carte restaurant in a quiet area of the city, and yet close to lots of attractions. Standard rooms/bathrooms are rather on the small side but the hotel also impresses with a fitness club and a swimmingpool (surroundings/fittings of the pool area need some refurbishings).",4,2016,05,29
123,amazing hotel with perfect location and staff,"This Hotel ist amazing ! The rooms are lovely designed and the bathrooms are beautiful as well.  Also the room service every day was polite and great. I really liked the fresh water in the entrance area. The staff was that polite as i rarely seen it before. The Marylebone is located between Bond Street Station and Marylebone High Street. Its perfect for shopping, Sight Seeing and everything else you can do in London because you're able to reach various tube stations within minutes .. or just order a taxi at the reception.
I'll defiantly come back again!",5,2016,05,29
123,Great location and great staff,"This is my second stay here.  The location is just great.  Lots of restaurants and bars nearby.  My new best friend, Jack at the door is incredibly helpful and has great suggestions for restaurants etc.  would recommend this hotel and brand for everyone.",4,2016,05,29
123,Excellent location and service,"The place was recommended by friend. Location was perfect. Very cozy and romantic. Staff booked restaurants and was very useful. Great concierge, especially Aurora. Gunther was also very efficient (not to mention he is Brazilian!). I will go back.",5,2016,05,28
123,Excellent Experience,I stayed at the Marylebone Hotel for over a month. The staff were excellence and very helpful  making recommendations for restaurants and other activities in the area. I highly recommend this property and would be my first choice when returning. ,5,2016,05,27
123,Great hotel with very friendly staff,"This is a lovely hotel in a very convenient location. We stayed here to go to the London Palladium and it was just a few minutes walk. The room was small but very comfortable and the pool and gym were added extras. The ambiance in the bar was really nice and cocktails were delicious. Our only note of caution is that although a very nice buffet breakfast was included, if you want a hot breakfast it is extra and very expensive (£7 for scrambled eggs and £14 for a not huge full English) so if you are not a hot breakfast person, this cant be beaten. ",4,2016,05,27
123,Comfortable elegance,Fine room with comfortable bed - the hotel has a pleasant design while based in a rather  unappealing  building. Breakfast with somewhat limited choice. Staff is friendly enough and room ate of decent size. It's a big hotel so sometimes your room can be pretty far from elevators.,4,2016,05,26
123,Excellent location and service,"Excellent choose in London  due serveral reason: location near by Oxford street, good service, nice bar and restaurant and all the staff its very helpfull always specially Guther always beyond of expectations.
My new home in London.",5,2016,05,26

I came with my mom, that doesn't speak english, and Gunther, at the reception, resolved all our request.we",5,2016,05,26
123,First class hotel,"i stayed at The Marylebone hotel for business. Great location, first class service and beautifully decorated. The only slight negative was that a newspaper was shoved under my door in the early hours of the morning - I am a light sleeper but apart from this minor detail the stay was perfect.",5,2016,05,26
123,Excellent hotel in a lovely location,"Excellent service from well trained & friendly staff. High quality amenities in the rooms and throughout the hotel. Restful, calm atmosphere. Good value continental breakfast, with a wide choice of fresh items. Very convenient location for Marylebone High Street & Oxford Street, but in a quiet side street. Loved the floral decoration on the front entrance, for the Chelsea Flower Show. Definitely hope to return.",5,2016,05,26
123,Feels Like Home,"My wife and I have stayed at The Marylebone Hotel at least 30 nights a year for the last three years.  We stay here for the following reasons:
- Neighborhood feel of the area, walking distance to everything in the west end but in a quiet area.
- Great service by friendly staff, particularly Gunther at the front desk, who makes everything simple for us, and Christos in 108 Pantry, who anticipates our needs!
- Good value as the studio suites provide a reasonable room size necessary for long stays at a fair price for London.
- Full service gym free to hotel guests.

We look forward to arriving each and every time!",5,2016,05,25
123,Wonderful!,"Me and my husband spent 5 nights in this amazing hotel and we loved it! Very well located, near the subway, many good restaurants and shops (Oxford Street). Very comfortable and beautiful room, everything clean and new. Nice staff, always willing to help. A nice touch is to offer complimentary water (in the lobby, every night in the room and even when we left the hotel). The bar is also very good. The only points that could be better are the pillows and the matress, that were too soft for us. Besides this, we highly recommend this hotel! ",5,2016,05,24
123,"Great location, great service.","Booked the Marylebone for two nights last week; it was very convenient for an event I attended.
Expensive, but not any more so than comparable hotels, and the location is superb.
Rooms are small, which is normal for London, but the Queen sized one I had was adequate and well equipped. It was quiet too; I heard no traffic or other noise and got a good sleep.
Breakfast is one of the best of any London Hotel I've been to. Great buffet selection and the hot food is cooked to order and served to the table. Tip: Order hot food immediately you are seated if you are tight on time -- as with anything freshly cooked, it takes time.
I will definitely use the Marylebone again.",4,2016,05,23
123,Fine Hotel in a Great Location,"My son and I came to London to see a concert at the Palladium and booked this hotel as it is an easy walk to the theatre. It's also an easy walk to many other venues too numerous to mention--a quick check on the map will make that clear. The hotel is in a particularly quiet part of central London--very nice if you are a light sleeper. The rooms are also well sound-proofed. Another reason I booked the Marylebone was that is has a 20 metre indoor pool (in addition to a well equipped gym which is included in the room price).  If you don't want to eat in the hotel (breakfast is a bit pricey) there are many fine restaurants only minutes away from the hotel in every direction. The rooms are well furnished, with a fair number of complimentary items. All of the staff are friendly and helpful. I would certainly stay here again.",5,2016,05,22
123,Great Place,This hotel has a great location.  The rooms are a little small but I guess for London standards it is average.  The room was nicely decorated and beds comfortable.  The bar was very nice and food was good.  Service was great.,4,2016,05,18
123,"Nice and quiet, good location - and a bit overpriced","A nice hotel in a quiet street, only a few minutes walk from the busy Oxford and Regents streets. We did not try their breakfast (not included), but the lunch plates from a varied menu were excellent and not overpriced - good service.",4,2016,05,18
123,Great location,Stylish hotel with very comfortable rooms. Very attentive well trained staff. Excellent facilities with cocktail bar and brasserie. The fantastic shops of Marylebone just around the corner. Ideal location for central London with a London village feel.,5,2016,05,18
123,Good place to stay in the City,"This place is nice and central close to nice restaurants and shops but quiet at night. 
Ask for Gunther, one of the guest relation agents - he's the best! He has helped me out on a number of occasions with calm courtesy..",4,2016,05,17
123,Fantastic hotel and location. And thank you Jack Mckie!,"Our hotel stay at the Marleybone was exceptional.  This was our first trip to London and found the location perfect for walking to just about any site.  We had one frustrating day no fault to the hotel.  Jack Mckie immediately responded to our concerns without hesitation.  He got us back on track right away and made what could have been a bad day in to one of the best.  He is professional, knowledgeable and very eager to see that your needs are met. He made us feel very comfortable in such a large city.  He also made sure that when he saw us that we were headed to the right places with the shortest walking distance.  I highly recommend that you stay at the Marleybone and be sure to ask for Jack Mckie.  They made a smart decision when they hired him.  Cheers!!",5,2016,05,17
123,Couldnt do enough for us!,Hotel was booked for us by a company whom we were visiting.  The room was ready early and was a lovely spacious twin room (no 633).  The corridors were quite dark but nice and wide and spotlessly clean.  The room had all we could and again apart from a dirty dressing gown it was spotless.  It was also lovely and quiet.  The swimming pool and spa facilities were excellent.  Staff couldn't do enough for us especially Concierge who was so helpful and friendly.  The local area appeared very safe and we had no concerns walking back on an evening.  Although rates are high would not hesitate in returning even as a single lady travelling on my own.,5,2016,05,17
123,Stay here,"Me and my sisters travel to London about twice a year and since we've found this hotel we only stay there. It's beautiful, modern, clean, in a great location close to Oxford st. And Baker, but most importantly the staff is incredible and so friendly. On our first visit the airline had lost our luggage and for two days the guys at the front desk got us everything we needed. On our latest visit we bought a DVD (yeah in 2015...), Now I don't even own a player and we were thinking well what are the odds we'll ever watch this? But of course just ask the front desk and a player magically appears in your room :) excellent hotel. Definitely stay here.",5,2016,05,17
123,Great place in the centre of the city,"Every little detail in this cozy hotel is thoughtfully placed so that you can enjoy your visit to London. Rooms are comfortable, commodious and spacious. And cleaned twice a day. Everyone, from the reception to the restaurant, is smiling, offering help and contributing to the great experience.
And the location is simply - excellent.",5,2016,05,15
123,My hotel in London,"For many years I stay in this hotel. It is central and has all the facilities. 5 minute walk from Oxford street. Quiet at night which is amazing as the hotel is very central.
The front desk manager Antje is super, she remembers my requests from previous visits and makes sure all is pre-arranged in the best way possible.",5,2016,05,15
123,Lovely hidden gem!,Stayed here last weekend for our anniversary.  Loved the hotel will definitely be back!  The staff are are very friendly and helpful.  The room was lovely and clean.  Make sure you have cocktails in the 108 bar they were very nice.  The atmosphere in the bar was excellent and service fantastic.,5,2016,05,14
123,Excellent staff,"I want to acknowledge the outstanding and very helpful staff at The Marylebone. Every one of them have been courteous, friendly and extremely helpful.  When I arrived after a 9 hour flight, I was originally placed in quite a small room on the 2nd floor.  I was so exhausted I didn't think much of it as I just wanted to sleep.  But when the next day came, I realized that I really couldn't work in this particular room because there just wasn't enough space so I went to the front desk to ask if I could change rooms.  The staff made no issue at all and quickly assisted me in relocating to a more appropriate room for my business trip.  

In particular, I want to acknowledge an extremely helpful deskman named Gunther. He took time to make sure I viewed the new room in advance and he never once made me feel like I was being unreasonable asking for the room change.  I'll be back in London in another month and I'll definitely be staying at The Marylebone again...and hopefully I'll see Gunther again and thank him for his assistance.",5,2016,05,13
123,The Marylebone Hotel ,"Stayed one night in the Marylebone hotel in May 2016 but it was my second visit. Excellent location for visiting the sites of London. Great bar and restaurant in the hotel but also plenty of bars and restaurants nearby. The staff were very friendly and helpful making our stay very pleasurable. Hotel very clean, comfortable and modern. Would have no hesitation recommending it to friends and family. ",5,2016,05,12
123,Would definitely return!,"
Having stayed in several London hotels, this has been the best so far within our price range.  Our room had a light and modern feel, with a comfortable bed and decent shower.  Service was exemplary, particularly in the 108 bar which had a great atmosphere.  Location is also a real plus. ",5,2016,05,11
123,"Very good hotel, in perfect location, with great service","We stayed at the Marylebone on April 22nd and 23rd for our son's wedding. Several of the wedding party were there, including the bride, the bride's parents and other relatives. 

From doormen to chambermaids, to the desk staff, the service was smiling, friendly and efficient. When I needed our room made up quickly on the Saturday, so that I could get changed for the ceremony, the housekeeper put two chambermaids on it at once, so that it was completed extra fast, which was much appreciated. Other room service requests also received immediate attention. The hotel even lent us an armful of umbrellas so that the main wedding party wouldn't get wet on the day of the wedding and all this was at a weekend when I know the hotel was full.

This was the third time we have stayed at the Marylebone and will not be the last. It is a stylish and well designed hotel that is run very well.  It is a perfect location if you like to be central but also in a quiet calm area of London.The hotel bar is lively and popular. We didn't eat in the restaurant as there are so many superb restaurants within five minutes walk.

A couple of caveats - as the rooms are all very different, it is worth discussing your needs with the front desk. If you need a lot of clothes hanging space do say so, as some rooms really have very little.The space in the rooms varies a lot too and I would also avoid the rooms at the back overlooking the heating and air conditioning pumps as these are quite noisy.

A big thank you to Mr Voong the customer services manager and all the other staff who helped make our stay so memorable that weekend.",5,2016,05,09
123,Yet another great business trip,"I've been using this hotel for the past 8 years on business and visit about 8 times a year.
All the staff at all levels are always so welcoming , it's now a home from home. There's always a welcoming wave from Gunther when I walk through reception and a friendly catchup chat when possible. As a regular visitor then I am offered double upgrades ( when available) and late checkouts. The rooms are really comfortable and the gym, pool and classes very well run and well kept.
The hotel is really central for amenities such as shopping and entertainment and handy for transport links. It ticks all the boxes for me.Well done to everyone at the Marylebone hotel and I'll see you soon for a 3 weeks stay",5,2016,05,09
123,The best customer experience ever,"I booked the hotel as part of a package, so didn't really know what to expect. The hotel was lovely, but the staff were amazing! I've never had such exceptional service. It's the little things that make a big difference. Zan (on the front door) was amazing - we asked for directions to Covent Garden and he went and printed off a street map and gave us a bottle of water each for the walk. Nothing was too much trouble - they really do pride themselves on customer experience! I would highly recommend this hotel and will be going back as my 'choice of hotel to stay'.",5,2016,05,09
123,A really great hotel!,"I enjoyed my stay at this hotel. The staff were all welcoming and friendly, and the rooms were clean, light-filled, and very comfortable. Also, the hotel was very quiet. It was located in a nice neighborhood with plenty of shops, restaurants, and cafes. Also, it was always easy to take a cab right from the hotel, or walk five minutes to the tube. My room was always cleaned when I returned. The rooms have a desk, easy chair, and big windows, as well as a very comfortable bed and heated floors in the walk in shower. Great!",5,2016,05,08
123,"Nice boutique hotel, in one of the most charming London area","Very nice hotel. 
Extremely conveniently located, in one of the most charming London area. Loved the ambiance and the hotel style. 
Common areas are tiny, but functional. Warm welcome. Only issue is the room size: they are extremely small. Very good breakfast. Would like to be back again!!!",4,2016,05,08
123,Lovely hotel with better staff.,"Stayed for the night in a superior room, the room was nice, clean but not very spacious however the best was super comfy and the bathroom was lovely! Also the little touches like free bottles of water was lovely. Only negative is the lighting was a little bit dim in the bedroom. Upon arrival ( after walking for ages on a warm day with luggage ) we were given warm refreshment towels and again cold water. Our reason for the stay was to use to spa facilities, the pool area was nice and clean but there wasn't much space to sit ( only two loungers ) the steam room gym and changing room were also very nice and clean and overall we enjoyed the use of facilities. We booked in for two full body massages at the spa, i deffo recommend them especially dimitra she was lovely, made me feel so comfortable and her massage was amazing! On the evening we ate at 108 restraunt- again the staff were lovely very friendly and pleasant and the food absolutely beautiful! 
Room service was also great, the man who bought it to our room ( can't remember his name ) was lovely very kind and very helpful. The hotel is situated close by Oxford street and Mayfair and about a 20 minute walk from the Marylebone train station. Overall a lovely hotel with staff who are very helpful and welcoming. I would recommend this to others and would definitely return.
Thank you for our lovely stay :) ",5,2016,05,07
123,Fantastic Spa Day,"My friend and I booked a spa package at The third space at the Marylebone Hotel, I have to say, it was a great experience from start to finish, very clean, comfortable and luxurious. The swimming pool was warm and enjoyable, the steam room perfect and the treatments were the best we've had in a long time, we finished off with an inclusive light lunch in the brassiere which was wonderful, we will defiantly be coming back for more
.",5,2016,05,06
123,Marylebone memories,Stayed again at this boutique hotel close to all central London amenities. Conducted most of my business in the hotel where there were relaxed meeting facilities and good coffee. Staff were friendly and accommodating throughout. Particular thanks to Antjie and Gunther who welcomed me personally and offered to manage my luggage until the next stay in long term storage. Great service again.,5,2016,05,06
123,Perfect!,"We came for a three night break to celebrate our birthdays. Upon arrival we were greeted at reception by Gunther, who made us feel very welcome. He and the rest of the staff have been so friendly and attentive during our stay here. The hotel is ideally situated for shopping, theatres, restaurants and sightseeing. The rooms are well appointed, very clean and quiet. The beds are very comfortable as well. The bar is very animated and stylish and breakfast is very good. The swimming pool is surprisingly big, allowing you to have a proper swim. Many thanks again to Gunther for your great service and for making ours a wonderful stay. We will definitely return and we highly recommend this hotel.",5,2016,05,06
123,Going back,"Everytime I come back to Marylebone I feel I´ve come to London to meet old friends and enjoy their house, where I feel so welcome!
Every year it´s possible to testify the hotels efforts to offer the guest the best experience. It unites high quality service and facilities with the most warm attention towards the guest. Not to mention the charming and cozy breakfast !
I would like to thank Gunther and his team for such formidable experience!",5,2016,05,05
123,Excellent,"Nice hotel with comfortable, clean and quiet rooms. Good location near Oxford Street. Breakfast is great.
The staff were very welcoming, friendly and professional especially Antge from reception clerk.",5,2016,05,05
123,Great quality hotel with good value in city centre ,"Great hotel, nice rooms and bathroom, good breakfast with plenty of choice, easily located 10 min from bond street underground station. Warm welcome with good background on my travel history and status. Fast and easy check-in with excellent service of Gunther.",5,2016,05,04
123,Bedroom and bath ,"Wonderfully comfortable and clean upgraded room and bath and caring staff with wonderful attitudes and very helpful 
Would highly recommend to anyone for an enjoyable and comfortable stay in a wonderful area of central London. Room was cleaned twice daily and bathroom floor was heated ",5,2016,05,04
123,Exceptional and Unique,"My husband and I have just returned to Australia after our third stay at The Marylebone Hotel, which was like coming home.  A very special thank you to Rahim for making us so welcome and our stay so comfortable and pleasant.  Also, what a wonderful team Rahim has who are always ready to help no matter what you need.
This hotel is so unique and comfortable with beautifully decorated lounges in niches around the hotel where you can sit and have coffee, afternoon tea with scones and cream or high tea.

The breakfasts are fantastic with such a variety of food for every taste.  The restaurant and bar have excellent food and are very comfortable and pleasant with friendly efficient staff.

The rooms are excellent and beds so comfortable - we could not have been happier.

We would certainly highly recommend The Marylebone to everyone visiting London, it is in such a wonderful area and easy to get to all attractions - we know you will not be disappointed and will love it as we do.

Thank you again Rahim for such a memorable holiday also thank you to your wonderful team who made us very welcome as always.",5,2016,05,04
123,Great stay at The Marylebone,"The hotel is centrally located, with only a few minutes walk to Oxford Street, yet the hotel is located in a very nice and quiet area. The rooms are small, but cozy and offer everything you need. The quality of the bed is very good. Room service was efficient and the food we ordered was fresh and tasty. We were very impressed by the senior receptionist, Aurore, who sent us an e mail in advance of our stay asking us questions about the time of our arrival and if we had any requests. She also organized a very welcome surprise in our room, as we were celebrating out birthdays during the stay. The only downside was The Third Space Pool and changing rooms, which was very run down, compared to our stay a couple of years ago. ",5,2016,05,03
123,Better than ever,"This is the third time we have stayed at The Marleybone Hotel over the last few years and we continue to be impressed by the excellent service and location. It is just a short walk to the shops of Oxford Street and Marleybone High Street. You are made to feel welcome as soon as you enter the lobby. The accommodation is highly satisfactory with nice touches such as the turndown service. One of our party was celebrating her birthday and the staff made an extra effort to recognize her special day. During our stay, we enjoyed drinks in the bar, a lovely dinner in Brasserie 108 and a great breakfast. We would recommend The Marleybone to our friends and would certainly book again when we are next in London. ",5,2016,05,03
123,Weekend Break,"Hotel was in an excellent location to all the shopping facilities, walking distance to the theatres and in a very quiet street to enjoy a peaceful night's sleep.  Staff were exceptionally nice.  We were welcomed at the hotel by a very nice young porter who took our bags and offered us complimentary coffees whilst we waited to check in.  One of our 2 rooms was ready early.  Room was clean, fresh, well stocked with tea/coffee making facilities, bathrobes and slippers.  Bathroom was on the small side but perfectly adequate and clean.  Would certainly recommend anyone looking for a very central hotel to stay here.  The only other comment would be that for £159 per room, breakfast could have been provided.",5,2016,05,03
123,Fantastic Stay,"I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a clean, comfortable, and luxurious stay in central London. I was very satisfied with every aspect of the experience. I am looking forward to returning to the Marylebone soon!",5,2016,05,02
123,Hotel service and stuff,"I am a frequent/ return costumer of the Marylebone hotel in last 2.5 years. i am comming to london between 6-8 times a year and i am staying at the Marylebone hotel everytime. I would like to specify to praise the hotel stuff and  in particular i would like to mention Mrs Antjie ans Mr Gunther for their excellent care and flawless service.

123,Exceptional hotel in great location,Everything was fantastic. Service top notch. Best fish and chips in London was at the hotel restaurant.  Located easy walk to Hyde park and metro stations. Several nearby streets offer excellent dining and pubs. The rooms are small but reasonable for this area. Next time in London I'll want to stay here. ,5,2016,05,01
123,Lovely staying in London ,"I love this hotel very nice and the staff there very friendly especially ELENA in the Front desk is lovely girl and helpful every thing there amazing really , I will be back ..
Even my mom loves this hotel ...the location is good to go every where in London ...

 ",5,2016,04,30
123,Overnight stay ,"We stayed in this hotel overnight recently ( as part of a large party ) . We found the staff to be incredibly helpful, and friendly (especially jack ☺️👍🏻)and happy to direct us tourists :). 
The surroundings were luxurious but without being overwhelming, and the location of the hotel was perfect to capture the sights of the city. Would definitely recommend and will definitely be returning ",4,2016,04,30
123,First time in London,"I stayed at The Marylebone for 4 days with my wife to celebrate our anniversary. It was my first time in London, and I really enjoyed my stay there. Hotel is in very good location, many cool spots are walking distance. Hotel staff was friendly, Elena from reception helped us out in many things during the stay. Definitely will try to come back to London and The Marylebone!",5,2016,04,30
123,Very bad experience,"Booked two rooms for a family vacation after agent recommendation.
It started on the wrong foot with the rooms not being ready for several hours after we specifically ensured early check in (and found ourself wondering in London after a long night flight).
The first room we got was so small one can reach everything from the bed (and entering the toilets was a real challenge)
After one night we were offered to move to a bigger room just to find that it is in the part of the hotel that is still under renovations and the drilling and banging killed our nap ( the girl in the reception thought that since it is only 9am - 5pm it's fine...)
The third room was a small suite, although it was a bit bigger, had almost no closet and the water in shower were hardly drifting...
At this point we decide that three time unpacking in one week at the same hotel was enough for us...
We definitely not going to visit there again  nor recommend it...",1,2016,04,29
123,Blown away by the incredible service and stylish hotel,"I stayed at the Marylebone with my husband to celebrate our Anniversary . We were originally going to stay for one night but we were so impressed with the standard , luxury and unbelievable staff that on arrival to our room we booked an extra night
So glad we did
The hotel is in a fantastic location in the heart of Marylebone , great restaurants/ shops nearby - including the hotel's own Brasserie
When we arrived at the hotel we were greeted with the warmest welcome and a smile which lit up the lobby  - the lovely Aurora .  She could not have been more attentive and took the time to show us two rooms so we could decide which one we wanted 
Nothing was too much trouble for her - I""ve worked in high end customer service for 28 years and stayed in many hundreds of hotels  and must say it's rare to come across someone as customer orientated as Aurora
The Marylebone is very lucky to have her on their staff 
I just can't praise her enough . Our trip to London was great but what we'll remember is  the Marylebone Hotel and her thoughtful, kind  demeanour and every request met with a smile 
We came to our room on the evening of our Anniversary to find a bottle of Prosecco on ice waiting for us
What a wonderful , wonderful experience we had at the Marylebone
Can't remember staying in any hotel and having had such a memorable experience 
Next time to London , we'll be back here , there's no question
The gym and spa are great too
The concierge Rahim was also fantastic and even got us a table at the famous Chiltern Firehouse restaurant - quite an amazing feat
Both Rahim and Aurora were happy to chat and offer recommendations in London
We were already impressed at check in and then Roderick McGrath  offered us a few suggestions . He was equally charming , friendly and helpful
Where do these guys get the energy to be so nice to everyone - they clearly take great pride in their jobs
Still glowing from our lovely stay at the Marylebone and I haven't even left yet 
I've never been compelled to write a review on Tripadvisor before but Aurora , Rahim and Roderick really went above and beyond 
What a fantastic hotel and wonderful  staff",5,2016,04,28
123,The Marylebone Hotel,"The Marylebone Hotel is a lovely hotel in a good location,
Nice bar and restaurant 
also good for afternoon tea in the lounge.
Staff are always friendly and helpful a special thanks to 
Gunther Schildwachter for all help.",5,2016,04,28
123,Marylebone Hotel,"I stay at this hotel regularly. The rooms are comfortable, the location is convenient, the staff are friendly and helpful, it's reasonable priced and has an excellent gym for a London hotel. I would and have recommended to other friends and family.",5,2016,04,27
123,Amazing staff! Gorgeous location! First class Accomidations! ,"Let's be clear, hotels in London vary greatly. But one thing is for certain, The Marylebone hotel offers you everything you could want on a personal or professional trip to the city.

Location is stellar. You are away from the tourists but close enough to enjoy the sites, if that's your bag. It's a beautiful, friendly community with loads of restaurants. Oxford Street is a five minute walk, as is Selfridges. Rooms are comfy (European small) but elegant and well situated. You get chocolates and water every night with turndown service. How nice!

Accommodations are perfect. Great (and I mean GREAT!) gym. Delectable restaurant. Room service is on par. You can't have a bad meal, drink, event, or casual evening.   My parents visited one Saturday night, we didn't have a reservation, yet the hostess fit us in for dinner. So helpful!

And let's talk about the service. Absolutely, hands down (and I travel extensively) some of the friendliest staff I've ever had the pleasure meeting. The doormen are polite and always there to help with luggage or a cab. Room service, as afore mentioned, is quick and courteous. And front desk staff are just brilliant. I think I chatted with most everyone during my two week+ stay, but the one that comes to mind most is Gunther. He was above and beyond helpful, provided incredible service and he truly made our stay the easiest experience possible. I can't say enough positives about Gunther, or our stay. 

A true five-star experience. We will be back! ",5,2016,04,26
123,Vary Helpful staff,"We booked a superior room with disabled facilities for my 60th Birthday.  The WC and bathroom were of  a high standard with a non-slip floor, the only fault was the bed was very high, I am 5'2 and found it impossible to transfer from  my wheelchair onto the bed, without help . Apart from  this the room was spacious, complimentary bottle of Sancerre on ice on arrival and very well stocked mini-bar.  The reception, front of house staff, were very pleasant especially Jack. who was really knowledgeable regarding parking and access.  The 108 restaurant was excellent and all areas extremely comfortable and airy.  We would recommend this Hotel  to any able-bodied person or perhaps a bit taller guest!",5,2016,04,26
123,"Grreat hotel, great service","The hotel is generally very nice and the location was perfect for us, close to all we wanted to do or see but in a quiet street. The standard is high and the rooms were clean and comfortable. What really made the time we spent there great was the service. Everyone working in the hotel was very friendly yet professional and when we ran into some minor issues with the driver service or our room, it was taken care of in an exemplary manner, which is really what matters in my opinion. Special thanks to Riyas the concierge for exeptional service.  
We wished we had more time to also try the fitness center and the pool but that will have to wait until next time.
I can warmly recommend this hotel.",5,2016,04,26
123,Fabulous staff and great hotel,"Stayed here for three nights, first night was on business but I was joined at lunchtime on Friday by my family. We are a gay couple and have an adopted three year old.   The room was reasonable sized for central London but the personal touches were lovely - complementary sweets and juices arrived shortly after my family did. We had a lunch in the bar, and the food was of a very high quality. The bar is a great spot and clearly used by the chi chi locals also. The gym and pool were also very high quality. The hotel is classically modern of that makes sense and in a great spot 1 minute from Marylebone High St and 5 minutes walk to Bond St tube. The thing that really impressed was every single member of staff bar none was professional and friendly - there is clearly a high performance culture in this hotel and the prices were remarkable for such a high quality hotel in this part of London. It feels very five star although I think it is a four star. We will definitely be back. ",5,2016,04,25
123,Excellent service and wonderful amenities,"I am a regular visitor to the Marylebone hotel.  The location of the hotel is excellent and its amenities (spa, gym and restaurant) one of the main reasons I always return.  

I feel it is more than note worthy to mention that the service received at the hotel is exceptional.  During my last two visits Guest Relations Agents, Gunther Schildwachter, on both occasions, provided absolute exceptional service and went out of his way to ensure my stay at the hotel is as comfortable as possible.",5,2016,04,25
123,"Good service, great location, laughably small rooms","Stayed here for one night (luckily) in one of their standard rooms. Whilst the location is great, be warned if you have any luggage or desire to move around your room, you won't be able to do so here. Their standard rooms are the size of a large cupboard, with the double bed taking up about two-thirds of the room. 
My bathroom had a shower/bath, in which only small children or animals could bathe. To stand at the sink you have to shut the door as the bathroom is the size of a wardrobe. You get the gist - the room is tiny. 
Great service and a good location though so if you aren't spending your own money, it's not a bad hotel. If I was spending my own money I would definitely shop around a bit.",3,2016,04,25
123,Excellent service,"We stayed here for my husband's birthday and would definitely stay again. From the moment we walked in and were welcomed by Aurora, we were made to feel very welcome and we thought the extra touches she arranged to make my husband's birthday special were wonderful. All the staff were friendly and helpful, the room was lovely and the hotel has a lovely ambience. Thank you!",5,2016,04,25
123,Great Hotel ,"I booked this hotel as it was quite central and I made a great choice. Walking distance to most places and 5 min uber to Mayfair. 
Not much to look at from the outside, but once you're inside you're pleasantly surprised. Decor and the warm feel of the hotel as well as smartly dressed staff all welcoming. 
We had a couple of minor hiccups, the room not being ready on our arrival and were then told our bags were in the room, and they weren't haha! Anyway the young lady at the desk gave us vouchers for complimentary drinks at Bar 108 which was a really lovely gesture. 
The superior room we booked was small and the bathroom even smaller but nicely styled out and more importantly clean! 
The staff were great too, always there to help. The Bar 108 is great to start for pre drinks or even to finish the night off, the cocktails are a must. 
Would I stay here again...YES! 
",5,2016,04,25
123,Extraordinary.....Elegant...Magnificent!!!,"My wife and I spent 4 days in one of the best hotels we've ever been in London. 

Extremely well situated, two streets behind the Oxford street, nearby restaurants, bars, breakfast pubs and much more. Never needed any public transportation. Everything you can do by walking. 

The staff were so sympathetic that we got vey impressed. Beginning with the extraordinary Mr. Zan, the doormen. Every time smiling, giving all the informations possible and being proud of his new promotion (before he was the bag carrier). Pay attention on him. I think he will be shortly promoted and soon be in a management position at the hotel. Thank you very much, Mr. Zan. We loved your amazing good mood and knowledge. Afterwards, at the check in, the staff did all that was possible to make us comfortable. Our room was very good, well decorated, small bathroom, but with good lights, cafe and water gratis, but too warm. Normally, in Europe, in April, the hotels have a policy that they can not change the A/C to the cold position. I was seeing myself in trouble, cause I love to rest with 17C temperature. No problem, immediately, on the contrary of my low expectation, the technician came and changed the warm A/C to the cold position! At this time I became a fan!
Mr Gunther Schildwachter, a Portuguese speaker from Brazil was incredible helpful, giving us the best city advice possible and making sure that we got the best stay at the hotel. Thanks Mr. Gunther. We liked so much the Marylebone that we got immediately our next reservation on August at the hotel. Mr. Gunther handled everything perfectly. We were not just a number, but people. The gym is professional. The hotel has a serious gym attached and is free to use. Comes also with a semi-Olympic warm swimming pool. The breakfast is ok for the London patterns, but not much special. We did not ate at the restaurant, but the menu seems good. The lobby of the hotel has different rooms. All very cozy and with a fireplace. Extraordinary. It will be our London hotel forever! 
Thank you guys!",5,2016,04,24
123,Most comfortable stay!,"Located on a quiet West End street close to restaurants, transportation, concerts at Wigmore Hall, shopping and museums etc. The staff were exceptionally helpful and responsive to requests (special thanks to Jack). A very comfortable room, the only quibble being that the heating was difficult to regulate, it was either too hot or too cold, but this didn't stop us from really enjoying our week here. The general ambience is one of relaxed but attentive hospitality.",5,2016,04,24
123,Excellent service and great location!,"The Marylebone is a great hotel. The location is good and the staff is always very helpful. The atmosphere is very nice and the service is excellent. Gunther is always friendly, welcomes you back and make sure your stay is as good as it can be. He is always very attentive to requests and helpful. The hotel is also connected to a very good gym which is a great plus. Absolutely recommended for private or business stays in London!",5,2016,04,24
123,Great place to stay!!!,The hotel is very well located with spacious rooms and very friendly and helpful staff specially mr Gunther and Elena from the front desk. Since the arrival until my departure the service was perfect. I'll certainly be back!,5,2016,04,23
123,"Another solid visit, perfected by all star customer service","This hotel remains my go-to business and personal destination hotel in London.  The key is that the service makes the stay seamless allowing me to focus on business or enjoying time in London.  Gunther remains the most professional front desk person that I have ever dealt with.  He takes note of personal preferences and goes out of his way to accommodate them, and makes it seem as if he personally is invested in me having the best stay possible and taking advantage of the best parts of the hotel, the GHA loyalty program, etc.  It is a credit to the hotel management that they are able to retain top talent which is really what continues to separate this hotel from the many similarly priced options.",5,2016,04,23
123,Superb staff once again,Just wanted to say a huge thank you to Gunther and Jack.    Nothing is too much trouble and they go that extra mile to make certain that your stay is perfect.   My husband and I have now visited the hotel many times.  It is always a pleasure and everything is to the highest standard.  Can't recommend this hotel highly enough and of course the staff!!,5,2016,04,22
123,Wonderful hotel with lovely staff,"I stayed at The Marylebone on a Saturday as part of a hen party and had the pleasure of meeting Jack on arrival.  He gave a great first impression of the hotel, advised us where to have lunch, sorted taxis for us to our evening venue and gave us directions when we went shopping.  The hotel is in a great location, the beds are very comfy with crisp white bedding and fluffy towels and all the staff are very friendly.  I look forward to visiting again",5,2016,04,22
123,A three day weekend is just too short...,"We went to see London, my mum and I, as she turned 80 years old. This hotel is located with easy access from the airport, and very close to shops, restaurents, parks, tube and bus. On three days we did experience, The tower of London, Tower Bridge, sailing on Thames, Oxford Street, Hyde Park, Museum of Science, visit of a friend, Buckingham Palace, Big Ben, Westminster Abbey and Westminster Cathedral. Eating well at the hotel and around town, and Marylebone as center of activity. I shall return some day. We are still dizzy by impressions.",5,2016,04,22
123,My new favorite London hotel,"I came across The Marylebone Hotel as I was searching for an alternative hotel to the one I stayed in the month before in Mayfair. I was familiar with the general Marylebone area having gone to University close by (so many years ago) so I knew the location would be ideal in terms of shopping, restaurants, and accessibility. 

When I booked the hotel, I emailed directly to request early check-in for my colleague and I as we would arrive by 8am. The hotel immediately responded letting me know they would do their best. When we arrived to the hotel, we were informed that our rooms were ready! Immediately, the Marylebone won huge points with me and that was before being shown to the rooms. The hotel I stayed in last month (Marriott Grosvenor Square has a 4pm check-in! Completely unacceptable and they were inflexible). 

Antge, who checked us in, was absolutely warm and professional. She immediately set the tone for a wonderful stay at The Marylebone and went out of her way to accommodate me when I pointed out that I had wanted to stay at the studio flat but didn't when I noticed the a/c was left off the room description on the website. She informed me all rooms had a/c and that if I don't like my regular room, she would move me to a studio that would be available in a few hours. All I had to do was use the room I was given to refresh and rest. When I went to see my room, I found it too small for my comfort and I let Antge know. 

Within minutes of sitting in the room and logging into the wifi, I received news of the death of my uncle. I spent an hour and a half calling family and crying and was unable to shower or rest as I felt unsettled. I called down to reception and spoke with Antge and told her I just need to get into a room I can finally settle in. She heard the tears in my voice and asked if I was ok. When I told her what happened, I was transferred to a new, and better room within minutes. 

I cannot say enough about Antge and how much her sympathetic and swift action was appreciated. She really is a fabulous representative of The Marylebone. 

My stay has been wonderful thanks to all the staff (the porters were all very kind as well) and the rooms were excellent and I had the rest I needed. 

Definitely my new favorite London hotel and I will be coming back. ",5,2016,04,22
123,Excellent place to stay.,"I go back again and again.   One of the best aspects of the hotel are the staff.  In particular, Brendan is simply outstanding.   He remembers me; ensures I am very well looked after and is a pleasure to deal with.  Gunther is also brilliant and the lovely man in room service.    I highly recommend this hotel.",5,2016,04,21
123,The Marylebone ,"Great location, fantastic staff and service! I went to the gym everyday and also got my nails done. 

My room was always clean and the staff was always ready to help.
The hotel also had a great restaurant, where I had breakfast everyday. 
Thank you Kashif for helping me with my bags :) 
",5,2016,04,21
123,GREAT LOCATION,"A true boutique hotel on a quiet street and an outstanding location, barely 7 minutes walk from Oxford street. Reception (lobby) hall and ambience in need for a significant renovation. There are many different sitting rooms spread out around the lobby area, which is a big plus. They allow for a more intimate feeling and more privacy for meetings.
Breakfast was plentiful with many different options from continental to a smaller buffet or a la carte. Service always quick and friendly. My room (333) sort of a mini junior suite is in urgent need for a new carpet, closet space was more than enough in contrast to the bathroom which is extremely small and can only be used by one person at a time.
The sitting chairs in the room are in very bad need to be replaced. Bed and linens OK.
There is a large swimming pool which is part of a private gym. However there is no space
al all around the pool to place even a small chair. It is strictly swim and leave. But better than a hotel without pool if you wish to have one.",3,2016,04,20
123,Just consistently great,"Good hotels are great when they consistently give great service and this is why I've stayed at the Marylebone for the past 20 years. It's warm in every sense, convenient, and quietly goes about its business to make a stay great. 
From Gunther and Antje on the front desk, the food and beverage crew  to the housekeeping team it is just a pleasure staying here.",5,2016,04,20
123,First Class All the Way,"My stay at the Marylebone came at the end of an Around-the World adventure lasting six weeks and I could not have been more pleased to end end the trip in such a fine location. All the staff I came into contact with was supremely courteous and professional but I must make special note of Kashif, who greeted me so very warmly each day and seemed to be genuinely interested in me (as a solo traveler) enjoying London to the fullest. Those things are appreciated! As many others have noted, the hotel (in the neighborhood of the same name) has a wonderful location. So very peaceful at night, yet you are within very easy walking distance of many interesting shops, pubs, boutiques, etc. And the Bond Street Tube station is just a quick stroll away...putting all of London within very easy reach. My room was spotless and I found all the amenities to be first-rate. Also of note is the wonderful (large) pool and fitness facilities. What a treat for a dedicated swimmer like myself to be able to enjoy that each day! London, of course, is a famously expensive city and it's difficult to find true ""bargains"" there but given the level of service, the location, staff and amenities I found the Marylebone to be a great value. I would certainly not hesitate in returning!",5,2016,04,20
123,Last 2 days in UK,"After traveling though Birmingham, Stratford upon Avon, the 
Cotswolds, and Bath we arrived at the Marylebone for a few days in London before returning to Miami Beach. The hotel staff was warm and friendly helping us to our Superior Room, which was contemporary and extremely comfortable. They arranged great theater tickets for the evening we arrived and made great recommendations and reservations for dinner.
Jean did a fantastic job shining our shoes and Kudos to Emilian Toader who found a giclee print we left behind and forwarded it to us back in the US.
Thanks to everyone at Marylebone...we will return.
A&P",5,2016,04,18
123,Excellent all round,Had a very enjoyable stay at the Marylebone Hotel.  All staff were friendly and helpful and there were some simple touches that made us feel welcome and special.  The restaurant/pantry/brasserie was super quality and value and we will most certainly be returning,5,2016,04,18
123,Excellent experience ,"I booked this hotel months ago for my girlfriends birthday and we weren't disappointed. The level of communication between myself and the manager, as I required early check in, was great she couldn't have been more helpful. As it was my girlfriends birthday celebration we were also upgraded and given complimentary champagne in our room. I could not be more grateful for the little touches. This hotel will now be my go to place to stay in London. I can't speak more highly of it. ",5,2016,04,18
123,Amazing customer service,"Just come back from a superb stay at the Marylebone. The staff were amazing and we were treated like royalty. A special thank you to Jack in Concierge who was so friendly and helpful it made our stay even more special.
The standard rooms of the hotel are small so if you want a bit of luxury and have the cash to do so, upgrade to a suite as it's well worth it,
Location is amazing - 5 mins walk from Oxford St and plenty of cabs about if you want to go further afield.
Will definitely be back and will keep recommending this fab hotel",5,2016,04,18
123,"The place to be in London. Great Hotel, hospitality and amazing staff","I travel to London very often on both business and leisure. The Marylebone Hotel became my second home because of several reasons: location, design, F&B service and, above all, hospitality and friendly staff. 
I would like to highlight the reception service, always taking care of my needs. If you need help as for MR Gunther Schidwachter who will give you the greatest support ever.",5,2016,04,18
123,Another good visit,"I've stayed at this hotel six or seven or more times. It's modern, convenient to Marylebone High Street ( a good boutique shopping and dining area ), and the Bond Street tube station. I like it especially for its wonderful big swimming pool that is splendid for relaxing after a hectic day.
The hotel has a nice lounge area on the ground floor, good for drinks or coffee with friends.
The concierges Mr. Long and Rajas (I may have misspelled their names) were kind and helpful.
I asked for a room with a walk-in shower, which I prefer. I've been in some rooms with walk-in showers seem to be more basic but quite fine. This time I got a disabled room (130) which was huge so as to accommodate a wheel chair and I had an amazing amount of space.
I had a second--only one-night stay--at the hotel/. I was in room 289, a room where I had stayed before. A nice big room, near to the elevator to the spa/gym/pool, but a walk from the lobby. No walk-in shower, just the usual bath tub with shower.",5,2016,04,17
123,"Well placed, great gym , small rooms","Handy for oxford street and Harley street, friendly staff and the gym is top notch but the room was very small, as indeed the rooms are in several hotels we have stayed in near here but the upstairs interior is so dark, quite claustraphobic , dark narrow walls and low ceilings.",3,2016,04,17
123,A great hotel in a quiet part of the city,"I'm a creature of habit normally and have been staying at the same favourite hotel in London for years. However, since I recently earned elite status in the Global Hotel Alliance programme, I decided to try a different hotel for my theatre break for a change.
And what a find this was. It is tucked away in Marylebone village, an area of the city I rarely visit and a bit further out of the way than I would normally go, but I'm glad I did. The hotel is elegantly decorated and furnished throughout, with plenty of social spaces.

Having status in their programme got us an automatic upgrade, and the room was considerably larger that the one I'd booked. The room was well appointed, very comfortable with a large comfy bed; the bathroom was a little on the small side, but then this is London and is the norm. In room mini bar, tea tray and a nespresso machine as standard.

Breakfast was excellent and plentiful with multiple options from a simple continental breakfast to a full cooked breakfast or range of small hot breakfast dishes, and fresh brewed coffee.

All the staff we met and dealt with were friendly and did a great job, and we'd discussed it and compared it with our usual hotel and decided they were equal and we'd definitely stay here again (although our plan is to try one of the other two hotels they have in London on our next trip).",5,2016,04,17
123,Wonderful Experience ,"My husband and I have just spent a week in London at The Marylebone with our 4 children.  I can't rate them highly enough, we have stayed in many hotels around the world and I have never felt the need to write a review, but our stay was flawless. The hotel itself is a beautifully designed boutique hotel in the perfect location for a holiday in London. But what made the experience so special were the staff, every staff member we encountered was extremely friendly, courteous & helpful from lobby staff to restaurant staff and housekeeping - nothing was too much trouble. And in particular John & Kashif who were so helpful and lovely with the children. Perfect!! ",5,2016,04,17
123,A perfect place to stay...,"Wonderful friendly and helpful service from the start. We arrived early in the pouring rain, having left our theatre tickets at home and following Google maps the wrong way up Oxford Street, the start of our weekend away celebrating our birthdays could have been better! However as soon as we went to check in, the receptionist wished us happy Birthday and told us we'd been upgraded. Then we explained the problem with our theatre tickets and the concierge stepped in and sorted that out and helped us de-stress with a complimentary drink from the bar.  Everyone we met in those first few minutes was absolutely lovely.

Our room was stunning. Immaculately clean and the bathroom was amazing.

We went to the bar to have our complimentary drink and a snack (the small plates are delicious and a bit different,  salt and pepper squid, mozarella, pea and mint arrancini for instance) and returned to our room to find a bottle of Prosecco and a birthday card. How to make you feel really special!

The beds were comfortable, breakfast was fabulous, and we used the Spa and swimming pool. The pool, sauna, steam room and gym are free for guests to use.  Then we had afternoon tea in The Pantry as we really couldn't have found anywhere better.

Great location too. Just an 8 minute walk from Oxford Street and Bond Street station but very quiet.

We will be back to celebrate again next year. Really don't think I'd want to stay anywhere else.  Thank you very much to everyone at The Marleybone.  We had a wonderful stay. 
",5,2016,04,16
123,Great Cocktails and Wonderful Staff,I went to the Marylebone in March for a weekend break. The hotel is in a great location and reasonably priced! Cocktails in 108 bar were amazing. Rupert behind the bar was great. I would like to thank Brendan for all his help! He was excellent throughout! Would highly recommend to anybody! ,5,2016,04,15
123,My favourite hotel in London,"This is my favourite hotel in London. I come to The Marylebone at least once a year for vacation and business. What I love about the hotel is the location, everything is just so closeby. I love the hospitality always offered to me. The staff is always looking after me especially Gunther, Mohammed. The rooms are great. The Marylebone, keep it up!",5,2016,04,15
123,Amazing. Service is extra ordinary.,"I have been in this hotel for more then 10 times. Each was a great pleasure. I feel home.
Thank you Gunther for a personal and great service. You should use this hotel for more then business, i brought my family once and they where very satisfied.",5,2016,04,12
123,Most welcoming staff,"All of the team are great but I wanted to highlight Gunther in particular who is always warm friendly and always tries to upgrade me whenever possible. The Marlybone is my home from home as I stay almost every week, and the staff always make me feel very welcome.",5,2016,04,11
123,Absolutely recommendable,"Chose the hotel above all for its location, and felt really surprised about the quality and attention to every detail. The staff is incredibly friendly and was there to help with everything. The rooms are not tremendously spacious but the furniture, quality of materials and fabrics and lighting are outstanding. Will definitely come again.",5,2016,04,11
123,Fantastic night away,"We booked a superior double at The Marylebone, having spent New Year's Eve 2014 there, we knew we would once again enjoy staying there. 
Upon arrival we were upgraded to a luxury or deluxe double by one of their affable and polite reservations personnel.
All the staff were exceptionally polite, greeting you with a salutation when passing you.

Our room was very good, exceptionally clean and pristine. The bed was super comfortable and the bathroom well equipped.

We didn't use the restaurants however, upon return from our night out, we went to the lower bar and spent a dilghtful hour or two enjoying the atmosphere. The staff were prompt and attentive and once again, not a thing out of place. Drinks prices were reasonable and a good selection of bar snacks.

All in all an excellent stay and I would highly recommend staying at The Marylebone. It's location is fantastic, just a stone's throw away from Marylebone High Street and its fantastic shops and eateries and also a 5 minute walk to Oxford Street, if the need takes you. It has a quiet location but still so close to anywhere one would need to go.",5,2016,04,11
123,Outstanding Hotel and Service,"We booked this hotel for a weekend stay, do not be put off by the outside of this hotel, the inside is stunning and very contemporary and unique. The service was outstanding, the staff very very attentive and genuinely wanted to help. All of the little extra details and services this hotel provides makes it memorable from the cleanliness of all areas to being offered a bottle of water every time you leave the hotel, makes you feel very special. I would definitely recommend this hotel and will definitely be staying there again. To sum it up everything about this hotel is perfect even the location.",5,2016,04,11
123,Visit for partners Birthday weekend,"I would urge anyone visiting London to stay at this hotel, I booked for my boyfriends birthday weekend away. I emailed before hand to advise it was his birthday and a lovely lady named Aurora emailed me back to ask his name and what sort of room I would prefer i.e. view, close to elevator.  
When we arrived at the hotel we had been upgraded for free. We were greeted by name, shown to our room and made to feel so welcome. 
We went to Camden for the day and when we came back we had free prosecco in the room with a card for my boyfriend wishing him a happy birthday - it really made our stay so special. 
We will no doubt return for another Birthday or Anniversary.",5,2016,04,11
123,Excellent Stay,"Me and my girlfriend stayed here for a romantic weekend. We had a fantastic time, the room and facilities were superb. Gunther Schildwachter made us feel extremely welcome, and made sure we had a fantastic stay; we will definitely be coming back.",5,2016,04,11
123,Just as good as I'd expected,"My sister and I had an overnight here at the weekend. I'd previously worked nearby so was familiar with the neighbourhood and the hotel itself, having been in for dinner/drinks. We got a warm welcome upon check-in and were very happy with the room. Cocktails in the bar after dinner were a treat (personal favourite is the 108 Park!) and the bar staff were friendly and helpful. Particular mention to Catherine at the front desk who was warm and charming. The whole experience was great and we're already plotting our return visit.",5,2016,04,11
123,Great stay,"I stayed three more times at the Marylebone this last month of March due to business reasons, and I must say that the stay was really pleasant and as usual the staff of the hotel was great, specially the guys from the Pantry during the breakfast time and also Gunther from reception.",5,2016,04,11
123,We love this hotel is on great location plus very Good staff,I am speechless by Gunther(front desk) hospitality and very warm welcoming to us everytime plus rooms are booked much in time we get prompt replies if any changes requires even then we get fast track response from this gentleman ! We wish him great success and also best of luck to marleybone team warmest regards Salahuddin ,5,2016,04,10
123,Hotel exceeded our expectations,"Stayed two nights in this hotel. All the Staff was extremely nice and helpfull. Room was cleaned often and complementary water was brought. We had continental breakfast which was worth to buy (many cheeses, fresh fruit).
Location was perfect for us, just two blocks from Oxford Street.
We did not have the time to enjoy Spa or Sauna this time.
All the little details were thought in this Hotel. Thank you very much. We enjoyed.",5,2016,04,10
123,Amazing service,"Fantastic London hotel with the most incredible service , my stay was just perfect from the check in handled by Gunther to the lounge, restaurant, room, and lively  bar ... The location is also perfect.",5,2016,04,09
123,Birthday in London,"Just had another great time at this Hotel and Gunther again has looked after us so well all credits to him, I'm sure he will be up for a pay rise at this hotel, he is so good and looks after you so well with lots of attention to make your stay so good.
The hotel itself very very very good, we love it there and an excellent base to be in the centre of London.
I hope every body who read this will agree with me...
Can't wait to come back Gunther.
Keep up the good work everybody.",5,2016,04,09
123,"Good value, great location, everything I needed","I came for a conference nearby and was attracted to the location, the boutique look (despite being a larger than boutique hotel) and the swimming pool/gym facilities available. The hotel was as good as I expected, with the only three (minor) disappointments being (1) a somewhat more old-fashioned vibe than I expected (and very slightly musty smell, especially in the common areas), (2) the relative lack of bright room lighting and (3) the fact that at night there was no cold tap water (I presume because of the way the central heating was set up).

Otherwise, the bed was super-comfortable, the linen great, the desk great for attending to business, the bathroom excellent (with a great shower), and everything kept super-clean. The room had more than sufficient shelves, cupboards and hangers for all my stuff (and probably for a couple — this was a really excellent surprise) and was pretty spacious. For the price this was all a terrific level of comfort, amenities and attention to detail.

I didn't use the on-site dining or bar facilities.

A small issue with the room heating was attended to very quickly by staff.

And the adjoining gym with spa and pool was fabulous and added to the great value of the whole package.

Overall I would be keen to go back. An unexpectedly nice find in central London.",4,2016,04,09
123,Great hotel in the Marylebone area,"We stayed there twice during our trip, with a few days in the middle in Scotland.  The hotel staff was fantastic.  Everyone was so attentive.  The rooms are on the small size but fine for me and my husband.  I loved the heated floor in our bathroom in our first room.  It's in a quiet neighborhood, so if that's what you are looking for this would be a great choice.  I would definitely stay here again if in London.",5,2016,04,07
123,"Excellent, high class service","I've stayed at The Marylebone Hotel a few times and each time my previous experience has been surpassed!
The rooms are a very high standard  and the service, from the reception to the restaurant staff is very friendly, attentive and they are always there to help.
I have had the same experience, whether staying on my own or when hosting a conference of 25 people
I was recently with a party of 6 and late for a dinner reservation and despite a very busy restaurant the table had been held and the service from the restaurant staff was excellent.",5,2016,04,07
123,Simply Splendid,"I had the pleasure to stay in the Marylebone Suite recently, the space with particular regard to the terrace was superb and one of a kind; just like the very accomodating and kind staff that went above and beyond to assist with every whim! Looking forward to staying there again in the near future and highly recomend it to anyone!",5,2016,04,06
123,Hidden gem in London's best neighbourhood,The Marylebone was a revelation on the occasion of my two night stay following my wedding. And given I was born a few streets away and know London very well that's saying something. The staff couldn't do enough for us including a generous upgrade and bottle of bubbly to celebrate our marriage. The location simply cannot be bettered and the public areas of the hotel are wonderful. This is a Mayfair Hotel for people who don't need to be seen to have a good time. It's a Sanderson with as much substance as style. Absolutely perfect,5,2016,04,05
123,Top hotel with great facilities and location,"This is our preferred hotel when we are on business trips to London and I have never been disappointed while I have been here.

Centrally located in the Marylebone area, and only a short walk from Oxford Street, this hotel have great facilities like gym and pool. The staff is very friendly and it is easy to feel at home when staying at The Marylebone. Only cons is that the rooms are small and it is a bit expensive, but that is something this hotel share with most hotels in London.",5,2016,04,04
123,Great hotel in central London ,"The exterior isn't pretty but don't let that fool you.

Inside this is a great hotel. The reception areas are large and there is a Virgin pool accessible by hotel guests in the basement. 

The breakfasts are outstanding and evening meals in the bar are a cut above. 

An excellent value business hotel in central London. ",4,2016,04,03
123,Excellent stay with very efficient staff.,"Very comfortable stay in a great location for West End Shows,shopping etc.Will most certainly stay there again and a special mention for the concierge Jack who was a great help!!
Highly recommended in every aspect!!",5,2016,04,03
123,Wonderful Central London Hotel,"We stayed at this hotel for a Saturday night, rather than waddle home after a dinner in town (see my review of Fischers)

The hotel is located a seven minute walk from Bond Street tube, far enough from Oxford Street to be quiet but close enough to still feel part of things.

We had a cosy compact room on the second floor which had everything you could need from a kettle through to underfloor heating in the bathroom.

The staff are fabulous, helpful and polite and the facilities excellent with entry to the gym and swimming pool in the basement, included in the room price. The pool and steam room are lovely and the changing rooms very luxurious.

We booked directly with the hotel and received a fantastic weekend deal rate with twenty pounds bar credit (enough for two delicious cocktails in the plush bar) and a free full English breakfast which was delicious and absolutely monstrous (we couldn't finish it all!)

An excellent hotel offering superb value for money if booked direct. Really very highly recommended. We will return soon.

123,"Honorable, Considerate and Compassionate","My wife and daughter were booked to stay at the Marylebone for 3 nights. I opted to pre-pay for the reservation which secured a more favorable rate. The reservation was, therefore, non-refundable. Of course, issues cropped up. My daughter broke her foot just 10 days before the trip, and then the tragedy in the Brussels airport occurred, prompting the US State Dept to issue a warning against European travel.  The combination of the two led us to cancel the trip. I only hoped the Marylebone would be kind enough to offer a credit to be used at a later date. I had no illusions of receiving a refund considering the policy. Much to my surprise, we were offered a full, unconditional refund for the three nights. I was blown away. In an age of diminishing customer service, the Marylebone was a true breadth of fresh air. Our family will most DEFINITELY be re-booking a holiday at this hotel.",5,2016,03,30
123,I stayed at Marylebone Hotel,"Great hotel, comfortable beds, great location, great staff, excellent breakfast. Many good restaurants are walking distance. Museums and shops are also close by.

Best of all, staff like Mr. Gunther Schildwachter is superb, he can recognised us when we walked into the hotel. Since 2014, we kept on returning to Marylebone Hotel annually because of him. He has been showing us where to eat, go for short trips and even directed my husband to find a good haircut place. What more can be asked of from any hotel. He helped made our visit happy, comfortable, trouble free and feel at home in a different city thats not offered from another hotel.

123,Great stay. ,"Stayed at the Marylebone on Good Friday, was a great stay. All the staff were helpful. Rooms are lovely, bathroom was a little small, good shower. Breakfast was fab lots of choice! The one reason we booked this hotel was it had a spa, as a couple we do enjoy to spend some time in the spa and sauna together etc, that was the only down side, even though the gym and pool looked great and all very clean, it's not very couple friendly, with only a pool and steam room to use together, we were disappointed there was not a jacuzzi! 

Location was great, 5 mins from Oxford street. We do hope to return one day for sure! ",5,2016,03,27
123,Great gem in ideal location,"pound for pound best value for money. spacious rooms, a great English breakfast, the 108 is a cool bar for after-dinner drinks, excellent gym (which is an actual gym, open to the public). friendly staff and no issues when we arrived very late",5,2016,03,27

Do not miss the Golden Hinde across from the hotel for the best fish and chips ",5,2016,03,26

123,"Fabulous Hotel, Superb Location, Wonderful Service, Highly Recommend","really close to lots of shopping and yet quiet. First impression is of really helpful staff and that continued throughout my stay. 
Well appointed rooms, comfortable beds, tv straight in without loads of layers to find channels you want! 
One of my bugbears in hotels are complicated shower and bath controls (how many different types can there be!) here they were simple and easy to use! Yeh!
Easy access wi-fi also important.
Good breakfast.
Recommend!",4,2016,03,26
123,Just about perfect!,"Perfect location close to small local shops and restaurants, tube stations and Oxford street.  Short cab ride to Paddington and Kings Cross.
Perfect service , breakfast, sumptuous bedding..felt very welcome and looked after, would highly recommend.
Central yet very quiet.",5,2016,03,24

Gunter has been a great help in sorting out the accomodation for our stay.

123,Exceptional and personal service,"The weekend began with the warmest of receptions I've ever experienced. Roddy was so generous with his time and welcome, Gunther was the most exceptional host throughout the weekend and really made all the difference to our time in London. All the staff were wonderful, the food in 108 was amazing and the help we received for our activities beyond the hotel was extremely thoughtful and considered. A wonderful stay that made a wonderful trip, I would highly recommend.",5,2016,03,23
123,Excellent facilities,"On a trip with my daughter, check in was  easy and sufficient.  Room was ready early.  The room was quiet and very clean. Pool and steam room/sauna amazing and quiet.  We had room service one night of our stay and was excellent.  The only negative i could put on was the claustrophobic small bathroom for a superior room.   Overall a lovely stay.",5,2016,03,23
123,Exceptional,"I cannot commend highly enough the amazing hospitality of the entire staff, who are the reason we keep returning to this exceptional hotel. The genuine  welcome and caring  of each guest, is so evident by the exceptional five star hospitality.
Rebecca at the front desk, you show exceptional care to guests, I have never met such an efficient front desk manager who takes her guests requests and needs so seriously executing so efficiently all that is needed, you are what illuminates the quality of service that has our family returning regularly together with your incredible team.
The concierge Rahim, you are extremely efficient, always organizing wonderful transport dinner, excellent suggestions for dining together with your excellent team.
I must mention Julian, in the dining room, who is so exceptional, always remembers exactly what I like, makes our dining experience all the better with his fantastic service.
All the food is exceptional, love the healthy fruit juices, with a huge variety offered.
A very good buffet is offered at breakfast with a good al la carte selection, in a lovely dinning room, which is airy and bright.
I also must mention Christian in the dining area, always so efficient, Charnice, Ruben, and Vilo, amazing staff members.
Accommodations are excellent, with generous amenities, in the rooms, I also love the kettle in the room to make tea in the morning, with coffee and tea supplied.
The location is excellent, close to Bond Street tube, less than five minute walk, and the Marylebone high street has all one can ask for, high end shops, restaurants, cafes etc
I should also mention the wonderful afternoon tea, the hotel serves daily, delicious scones, which I thank Julian for giving me every morning, such a treat.

123,Lovely in the center of London!,"Thank you, Marylebone, you made my stay something special. I loved your rooms, your service, your food, your friendliness and all in all total comfort. I will recommend this to others. The hotel is a true gem.",5,2016,03,22
123,BEST HOTEL,Spending most of my time living in hotels I was amazed at this splendid hotel. The front of house staff were lovely and the room was quiet with everything you could need. Plus a traditional turn down service was cherished. Stunning hotel. The decor was gorgeous and relaxing. My only Disappointment was that i have never stayed in this hotel in the past. ,5,2016,03,20
123,perfect London bolt hole,"I stayed at the Langham Hotel for years, but it's become too over-priced. This hotel is in a wonderful location just around the corner from the BBC, the staff are really delightful and keen to help, the rooms are pleasant, and there are plenty of places to meet people. A couple of different bars and restaurants. Really Good food and coffee. Best of all, no airs and graces. There were a couple of hissy territorial fights between restaurant staff, but if they can settle that down this place is a cracker.",5,2016,03,20
123,No complaints,"Good location, clean hotel and very helpful staff (specially Gunther at the desk). Nice Gym and decent swimming pool. Spa treatment was great. Would definitely go back (specially if a good deal came along on booking).",5,2016,03,20
123,"Two great stays, one great hitel","Stayed two separate nights mid March, as usual the staff were excellent.  Gunther was able to upgrade my room and all of the staff had their usual welcoming smiles.  This place is really well run and you are made to feel special.  Room was excellent, hard to beat. Thanks to the team, it's a pleasure to stay in your hotel.",5,2016,03,20
123,Lovely hotel,We stayed here for two nights as we had a show in Covent Garden. The reception team were really helpful with directions for the local area and we actually ended up walking every where which was much nicer than getting the tube. Breakfast was delicious and we look forward to using the spa and gym next time were in London. ,5,2016,03,19
123,A good hotel for a WE in London,"Well located hotel near both the trendiest part of Marylebone and Oxford Street. Works well for a London week end. Staff are attentive and overall service levels are good. Very clean and functional, the only fault in our stay was a smallish room",5,2016,03,19
123,Thanks Steven for your hospitality!,"I am gone with my friend at the Marylebone Hotel. I am been accepted by an italian boy called STEVEN. He was really good and professional in advise good drink. The food it was very good and drinks so amazing.
I will come back!",5,2016,03,18
123,"Optimum location, service, food and comfort",This was a real good surprise. Rooms are not big but very well organised and comfortable. In room breakfast was just delicious and service both friendly and efficient throughout. I shall certainly come back.,5,2016,03,17
123,A Warm Place in a Chilly City,"We recently stayed at the Marylebone Hotel on Welbeck Street in London.  It's in a nice location (near the high street shops and restaurants, close to all the excitement of West London).  We stayed in a studio suite as we stayed for 10+ days and needed a little more space.  It fit our 3 large suitcases and gave us a little sitting area which worked out nicely.  While not the largest hotel in London, it has everything you need for a pleasant stay. Gunther at the front desk gave us guidance on the rooms and helped us with bookings and extending our stay.  He was a great help on helping us sort out details of our stay and billings.  The hotel houses a fitness center which is amazing.  Most classes are complimentary to hotel guests (TRX, Yoga, etc.).  Equipment is modern and fairly new with trainers available for extra help on your workouts.  There is also a small spa that can accommodate facials, body treatments, etc.  Perfect for the first day after a long flight!  The Pantry 108 has a good selection of breakfast buffet and made to order dishes.   We got to the point where Christos knew our orders and just placed them.  All in all, it's a warm and welcoming hotel with a wonderful staff!  Definitely recommend this to everyone I know!!!",4,2016,03,17
123,Compliments to the place and the italian boy STEVEN,"The Marylebone hotel is a fantastic place in the heart of London. I was amazed at the service. The Italian boy named Steven has been able to make me feel at home. My congratulations to Steven for his professionalism, kindness, preparation, knowing how to advise and for the great service. I will return again.",5,2016,03,16
123,First Class in a good location,"A good hotel at a walking distance from high street and Oxford street. Great service and attentive staffs. Room sizes are tiny, typical listed london properties. Breakfast is fresh and healthy kind, but of limited choices. was surprised to see the room charge included only Continental breakfast and yo have to pay for eggs or any add ons! The budget way of selling in a five star hotel.",4,2016,03,15
123,"Very nice hotel with great service, rooms and well located","I spent 5 days, the hotel is very nice and very well located. Breakfast is very good with a very broad menu. The rooms are very nice decorated and with very good space. 
I had dinner at the restaurant the last day, the place had a great atmosphere.",4,2016,03,14
123,Just fine,"The Marylebone Hotel is located in well, Marylebone. Nice borough, close to some shopping areas like Ofxord Street. Reception is good: staff is attentive and friendly. The hotel is bigger than you would assume at first sight. The hotel has a pool and spa, as well as a fitness area. As I stayed only one night, I have not made use of those.

The hallways have very low ceilings and are quite small. The (superior) room is on the small side, but everything is there and the room is clean. The bathroom is one of the tiniest I have ever seen, but again everything is there in good quality. Free and stable wifi.

We had some drinks in the next door Brasserie 108 which yoy can reach without leaving the hotel. Not too attentive staff, but a relaxed atmosphere. If I understood correctly, breakfast is also served here.

When we checked in staff told us we had a GBP 20 credit for drinks and food bought in the hotel (108 included). However, our drinks were charged in full. Staff changed this after I reminded them of their earlier promise, without discussion.

Apart from this and the small size of the room as well as the rather claustrophobic hallways, our stay was pleasant and the hotel was just fine. No material weaknesses, but also no exceptional items (but then again I didn't completely make use of all the facilities like the pool). I would certainly consider revisiting.",4,2016,03,14
123,Lovely hotel with everything you need:),"Lovely hotel, friendly staff, a bit small rooms, but very cozy and clean. Great restaurant 108 Brasserie and lovely Afternoon tea and breakfast! Close to shopping and near restaurants. Will be returning for sure:)",4,2016,03,14
123,Excellent stay,"We spent two nights and were overwhelmed by the friendlyness of the staff and the superb cuisine. Was not expecting such a lovely breakfast and our most memoreable meal in the restaurant. 
Antje in the reception assisted us with every query that we had!
The room was big and cleaned two times a day.",5,2016,03,13
123,Great choice for the heart of the Marylebone District,"This is a modern hotel that was very accessible. The rooms are small but very adequate. 

The bathroom is smallish, especially the bathtub which is somewhat narrow. 

Michael, one of the concierges, was especially helpful. The remainder of the staff was also very helpful.",4,2016,03,13
123,"Nice location, fair price and elegant design","It is always difficult to find an hotel room in London, mainly in Mayfair and Soho, without paying crazy prices or accepting cheap quality. 
The Marylebone might be a very good compromise between good quality and fair prices.
Rooms are not that big (if you want to remain in the 300/350€ budget), but staff is welcoming, prices are reasonnable, location is very convenient.
The hotel interior design is also a good balance between fancy design and more traditionnal British touch.
Then if you can afford higher rates, it looks like bigger rooms allow you to come closer to a luxury experience (which i haven't tried so far...).
Anyway, i would definitely recommend this hotel.",4,2016,03,13
123,My second trip and can't wait to return,We spent a family weekend here in Feb and it was super. Very nice staff and good lounging facilities.  I spent a lot of time out over the weekend but next time I plan to hold court in the bar ! Breakfast was top class .,5,2016,03,12
123,Fantastic Hotel in superb location,"We spent a night at the Marylebone Hotel for a birthday treat. The service of the staff was second to none and they made our stay very special with an upgrade and bottle of bubbly for my birthday. The room was very stylish, clean and comfortable. The location is quiet and in the heart of marylebone with lots of fantastic bars, restaurants and cafes around. We had breakfast at the Ivy cafe - sister to the Ivy which was a treat. Would definitely stay here again.",5,2016,03,12
123,Fantastic,Stayed in the Marylebone early February. It is a beautiful hotel in a great location close to the centre of London. 108 bar had a great atmosphere. Thank you Brendan for looking after us. We will be back!,5,2016,03,11
123,Event held in the drawing room,"Excellent service and friendly staff, which allowed us to concentrate on enjoying the excellent food, wine and ambience of the hotel and its surroundings. Our package was extremely good value for money.",5,2016,03,11
123,ccombine business and recreation trip,"our stay was superb. the staff was extremely helpful and kind, breakfast was excellent, facilities - clean and great. the location is really good - walking distance from Bond St station and Oxford Street.
we had an excellent room - top floor at the back of the hotel - very quiet.
dont be mistaken by the blanck uninviting exterior of the hotel - it is abselutely excellent!!!",5,2016,03,09
123,Great service and facilities,Our company recently held a seminar at the Marylebone hotel.   The standard of service was excellent as were the food and facilities.   I can't fault the hotel at all and would highly recommend them to anyone looking for a meeting venue in central London.,5,2016,03,07
123,Loved it,"After 4 nights spent in the Marylebone I can definitely say it was one of the most enjoyable experiences I have ever had in a hotel. And I've been in quite a lot.
I was in London for a business trip but when I saw the room I immediately regretted not having my GF with me as I am sure she would have loved it as much as I did.
Location-wise the hotel is in the very heart of London. Be it you are here for shopping or sightseeing or business, you are close to everything you need. For instance, Bond street U station is just 5 minutes away, Oxford street shopping avenues - 5 minutes away, Madame Tussauds - 10 minutes away and the list can go on and on.
The room was much more spacious than I would have expected for a hotel in London and luckily for me it even had a 2 holes socket for my charger, unlike other British hotels I have stayed in. And I think that the pictures that come along with this review tell the perfect story.
The best thing about this hotel, however is the staff. I can only say thank you to Gunther, Catherine, Piotr and each and every member of the Marylebone team that made my stay a most enjoyable one.
Breakfast was great.Alas, had no time to visit the SPA area so I cannot comment on that.But it is there so do try it.

Will return over there ? Most definitely !",5,2016,03,07
123,Perfect Bastion for a Day Away,We had a very wonderful one night stay at The Marylebone Hotel. The hotel surpassed our expectation in every field. Customer care and cleanliness of the hotel was at the top of everything.  We would certainly recommend to anyone willing to spend a weekend at the heart of London.,5,2016,03,06
123,A Sardine In A Tin,"Having visited London on two occasions in 2015 I had the pleasure of staying in a sister hotel last July,and what a pieasurable experience that was,Not just quite as good a location as this property though.
On check in I was informed that I was allocated a superior room.My little heart thumbed with delight at the thoughts of being upgraded ! In my humble opinion superior equates to something better than standard.And was I in a standard room ?.I was put into a room that can only be described as a linen closet.A prison cell would have been bigger ! A smaller bathroom I 've never been in.It was shamefully tiny,.and the room itself  wasn't much better.
On reporting my annoyance, it would appear that they the staff are well used to people complaining about the room size, they all have a very standard answer.""Well you do know that this is a converted office building""!!.Sorry but not my problem ! However after much protesting I did have my concerns addressed and they were handled in a professional manner.I would be very reluctant to choose this hotel as a venue of choice next time in London.Fantastic location for Oxford Street,but has some shamefully small rooms.  
",3,2016,03,03
123,Amazing 1-night Stay at The Marylebone ,"Recently returned from an amazing one night stay at The Marylebone where I was fortunate enough to be put up in the spectacular Harley/Wimpole Suite.  This was a particularly memorable day for me as I had planned to propose to my girlfriend that night.  From the minute we arrived at the hotel, Long and the Marylebone team received us with the warmest of welcomes and attended to all our needs with nothing but 5-star quality service!  I have stayed in many the hotel over the course of my travels but never felt compelled to leave a review for any of them.  However, I feel that it is my civic duty to share my experience at this little gem with my fellow Tripadvisor users.  We returned from a late dinner to a romantic setting replete with rose petals, champagne, chocolate-coated strawberries and candlelights, all thanks to the Marylebone team's hard work in making this night a truly memorable one for us!  How could she not say yes!  :)  Suffice to say, we are already looking forward to our next stay there - will be sure to return!",5,2016,03,03
123,A true Gem in the heart of London ,"I travel a lot but somehow don't find the time to share reviews, The Marylebone Hotel on the other hand deserves one!!!
From the moment we were greeted at the front door to when we checked out we were treated like royalty!! To find customer service that is of 5* quality and a relaxed atmosphere is rare ( I know, I'm in the hotel industry over 10 years!!). 

The rooms are spotless, nice touch with a Nespresso machine and short bread biscuits everyday. Very well stocked mini bar. And the mattress was clean and very plush for a good nights sleep! 

The bathrooms had plenty of space with a bath/shower and good water pressure. 

The main bar has a lovely atmosphere for a late night drink before bed and is very tastefully decorated. 

The location of the hotel is right around the corner from Selfridges / 10 minutes walk from Madame tousains / regent park. 

If you are looking for a welcoming hotel in the center of London with a bit of luxury, look no further!!! 

Thank you to ALL the team In the Marylebone for looking after us all weekend :) ",5,2016,03,02
123,A hidden gem and excellent service,"My family and i loved our stay at The Marylebone Hotel. Given it's trendy location, it had the potential to have the predictable, unfriendly, ""too cool for the room"" types as staff, but it was far from that. They were all warm, friendly, professional and welcoming. Everyone from the front desk, to the wait staff, to the doorman. Excellent stay in a great location. Highly recommended.",5,2016,02,29
123,Great location - average rooms,"The Marylebone Hotel is located in a great neighborhood for food, shopping, walking to The Regents Park and public transportation.  The hotel amenity spaces are very nice. The lobby lounge, 108 Brasserie, and the fitness center are high quality.  Where the hotel falls short is in the rooms.  Lighting levels are too low especially in the bathroom and in front of the closet.  The sink and shower are poorly designed.  The faucet is too far back and off center from the basin causing water to collect on the counter.  The shower is in a step up tub leaving only a few inches of headroom.  The shower head is low and hits about chest height.  There is a half glass door to the shower allowing water to spray out of the enclosure, wetting the floor.",3,2016,02,29
123,"Nice hotel, good location","Ten minutes walk from Oxford Street. Nice, welcoming, clean hotel with friendly staff. Rooms are small but very comfortable indeed. I was not booked in for breakfast, so cannot comment on the food, but the hotel itself is recommended.",4,2016,02,28
123,First time visit to London,"What a lovely treat to find the Marylebone Hotel in London. The entire experience far exceeded our expectations while visiting for the first time. Location to shopping, tube station, attractions, parks, and museums was perfect. The lobby spaces were inviting and comfortable, the rooms although small were very well appointed, and the options for drinks and food was fine.",5,2016,02,28
123,Great boutique hotel away from the bustle but close to the action ,"This is my second stay at The Marylebone, and upon arrival I felt it was a better reception than the first and had a nicer general feel as soon as I walked into the lobby. 

They sent me an email a few days prior to my arrival to see if I have any request and my approximate time of arrival. As I landed early and got to the hotel about 8.30am, where normally hotel rooms are not ready yet, my room was ready for me to occupy and I can freshen up after my 24hr flight from Sydney. I also requested a quiet room via the email and it was fulfilled.
The hotel has a nice feel, the room and amenities are so clean and feel new, the bed and pillows are super comfortable. The room is small but not uncomfortable or awkward. The staff attend to you when you need them and very friendly and efficient. 

It is located on the inside street away from Oxford St about 10min walk (or less) to Debenhams Oxford st. It is certainly my hotel of choice when I'm in London. ",5,2016,02,25
123,"Great location, nice service!","I was very happy to see a very welcoming door person, meeting us politely and friendly, making a conversation while escorting us to the check in desk. Little thing but how nice!  Later on the day I noticed that all door-bell ( I think that how they called) were nice and polite meeting people from their walk. Personalised service. 
The room was nice, we carefully looked at the pictures before booking and did not want to upgrade on arrival as we wanted to check our original room first. I personally liked it! Either people ho complain about room space were unlucky with their rooms ( I obviously cant say for all rooms) or they haven't stayed at London central hotels. The space is tiny everywhere, and for big spacious rooms you have to pay big bucks. 
The best thing about staying there is location. It is very nice to be able to WALK to Oxford street, shops and restaurants in Soho. 
Check the rooms pictures online, and see sq meters and you wont be negatively surprised! ",5,2016,02,24
123,3 1/2 out of 5!! ,"Good location, huge hotel with great communal areas and decor but the rooms are small with road noise all round.
Unfortunately we did have a few problems. 1 of our 2 rooms wasn't ready although we were checking in after 3pm and due to continual noise above us which sounded like a water tank refilling all night we had to move room in the middle of the night to a much smaller room. As an apology we were offered drinks at the bar the next morning but declined as it was too early!!
We were also a little disappointed that the pool didn't open until 11-30 as we were hoping to use it before we had to check out at 12 o'clock.
The staff were very friendly but little things made for not such a great stay.",3,2016,02,23
123,poor air quality,"I like this hotel, I have stayed here many times. However, a couple of things really irritated me.  They have sealed up the windows,  no fresh air.  And in a room near to us someone was constantly smoking.  I complained to a member of staff, but nothing was done.  This is a no smoking hotel after all. and because I could not open the window, it was made far worse.   The air con in the room is not working properly either,  this made for very poor sleep.

Also they have a couple of maintenance issues in the bathroom.

That being said the staff I had dealings with, were really pleasant and in particular an Irish chap on the front desk made us feel very welcome.  For me to come back they need to sort out the windows and enforce the non smoking policy",3,2016,02,23
123,Medicore,"After a fanatistic stay a year ago i went back this wk-ed, but didn't feel it was as good. Mainly because the toilet door wouldn't close properly as well as the wardrobe. There was no place to put your suitcase & in the early morning I could hear a person walking in the corridors.",3,2016,02,21
123,excellent hotel in an excellent location,"this hotel is in an ideal location tucked just behind Oxford Street.  It is extremely good value, with excellent facilities and the staff could not be more accommodating.  The breakfast is particularly good!",5,2016,02,21
123,"Excellent location, great staff, well operated","Nothing was a problem to this amazing team. I emailed them prior or recommend parking and received an informed reply. Concierge, early check in, refreshment towels, all upon landing. We arrived with a 4 month old, and looked for a booking in the restaurant that evening. We were sat in a quiet corner, served brilliantly and had a meal that was of terrific quality. The bed was very comfy and roomy and the bathroom was finished to a high standard. The hotel was one of our most enjoyable for a long time and we will certainly return quite soon. The location is really convenietn to Oxford Street, 5-6 min walk",5,2016,02,20
123,Very nice hotel,"The hotel is well located in a pleasant area.Stayed in a studio suite-large room good bathroom good towels. very comfortable bed good bed linen .staff very polite and pleasant.nice public area with a country
House
Feeling.not enough light in room and bathroom .no drawers in the cupboard .all in all very good stay.",4,2016,02,18
123,Great property,"Although I arrived at 7:30 AM, the staff made sure that I was in my room within a couple of hours, which let me shower and change after taking a long walk.  The bed was comfortable, although the bathroom was quite small.  The staff were friendly and helpful, although it took a couple of reminders to have a morning paper delivered and to get the cup of coffee that was promised while I waited for my room. Although it was a bit of a hike to the Tube station, the neighborhood has lots to do.  There are always a couple of cabs waiting outside if you need one.  There is free wifi, although the network is not password-protected.",4,2016,02,18
123,Excellent Hotel in a beautiful part of London,"Stayed with two friends on 12th & 13th February. Welcomed at the door by concierge and assisted with luggage, welcomed at reception with hot towel and chilled mineral water. Check in was efficient and directions given and services explained in a friendly manner. Bedroom was beautifully appointed. Went out on Friday night with large gang of friends to a restaurant we retired back to the bar at the Marylebone and enjoyed the range of spirits, cocktails and the barstaff. Was out all day Saturday and did the same on Saturday night we retired back to the bar and enjoyed the banter with the staff. Breakfast on both mornings was excellent and so were the staff. Hotel is beautifully presented and the staff are a credit to the hotel. Will recommend to all.     ",5,2016,02,18
123,Wonderful Father and Daughter Visit,"The Marylebone Hotel gave my daughter and me a wonderful welcome when we stayed at the hotel earlier this week, on a visit to London to visit my other daughter, who works in London.  Everything was memorable:  the helpful staff, excellent service, complimentary drink when we arrived as our rooms weren't quite ready (they were ready within 5 minutes of us sitting down), delicious food, spacious reception area, and excellent facilities (unfortunately, I had business meetings, but my daughter said that they were first class).  As a special bonus, the cost was very reasonable.",5,2016,02,18
123,A really special stay,"My dad and I stayed here overnight and we were so impressed we will definitely return. The highlight was the staff, who did everything possible to make us feel welcome. The rooms are lovely, with a nespresso coffee machine, loads of towels, bathrobes, slippers, a powerful shower and gorgeous bath products along with a really comfortable bed. The room was small enough but having stayed in a number of London hotels, is is still probably larger than most.
We didn't eat in the hotel but we did have a drink in the 108 bar, which was lively and had a good buzz. The wifi was excellent and of a really high quality throughout the hotel. There are plenty of quiet and comfortable seating areas if you need somewhere to work.
Another highlight for me was the health club. As a guest you have access to the gym, pool and classes. I attended a Deep Work class - a mix of yoga, cardio and strength work and it was superb - i am really feeling it today though! There are classes on throughout the day and they include yoga, dance, trx, spinning, etc. 
The hotel provides lots of little special touches which i think really add to your stay - fruit-infused water available in the lobby, hot towels on arrival, a turn-down service (free) including chocolates on your pillow. What more could you want?!",5,2016,02,18
123,Nice boutique hotel,"This's a very high standard boutique hotel, very good for business travellers, stayed there only 2 nights but staff are friendly, breakfast nice, the Wi-Fi  is the strongest I've ever seen and very steady.  Nice art work around the lobby which brings good taste, the smell of the candles at the lobby makes me look for White House candles.  Only improvement need is the shower, a bit weak.  But overall is a very nice hotel.",4,2016,02,17
123,Excellent Customer Service Makes This Hotel,"Although I travel frequently to London, this was my first stay at The Marylebone Hotel. The hotel itself is perfectly located and an excellent and comfortable hotel. But the friendly customer service is what makes them really outstanding! I will definitely return and will recommend the Marylebone to friends and colleagues.",4,2016,02,17
123,Shopping trip,"Wonderful hotel, with extremely helpful staff and excellent service!
Nice and clean rooms.
Close to shopping and Ox Circus metro st.
Really good breakfast! Good, but a bit expensive restaurant.
Definetly recommendable

",4,2016,02,17
123,Very Helpful People,"I booked the Marylebone Hotel for my friends who were visiting from Taiwan.

The hotel is nice and conveniently located close to Oxford Street but what made it outstanding was the amazing helpfulness of the guys behind the desk, in particular Gunther Schildwachter who went out of his way to help.

One of my friends left his wallet in reception and it was picked up by a woman who eventually handed it in but in the meantime Gunther did absolutely everything he could to sort things out and to constantly reassure us.  Together with the duty manager he eased what could have been a very uncomfortable episode for a frost-time visitor to London and that left a great impression.

London is packed with hotel staff who really don't care but Gunther and his colleagues showed a truly professional and memorable side that will ensure we use the hotel again.",5,2016,02,16
123,Fun central boutique hotel,This hotel is located just off Oxford Street. It is boutique in nature and feel and is well run. Funky shops and nice restaurants are located just around the corner of Marylebone High Street. Its rooms are a good size and a clean and quiet. Breakfast is good.,4,2016,02,16
123,The Marylebone Hotel,"What made my experience amazing.. even more... was the Head Concierge Rahim. I felt as if I was with family. He helped me find a place to buy jerseys for my boys and asked me after... also helped me with transportation, beyond his responsibilities.
Great hotel. Perfect Location to great restaurants and pubs",5,2016,02,16
123,Luxury boutique Hitel,"Beautifully refurbished over the past few years, standards are very high. Friendly and efficient staff throughout the hotel. Speedy and effecient check in handled by Gunther, hot towel supplied while check in completed. Dining room and bar area are buzzy with great choice for food and drinks.",5,2016,02,15
123,Fine for one night but TINY room!,"Myself and my partner booked a Superior Double Room for February 13th so we could spend the Valentines weekend in London. We wanted a hotel central to everything so we could walk. I cannot fault the location, it was perfect for walking to Oxford street, restaurants and London Zoo. I have stayed in hundreds of hotels round the world and the service and cleanliness of this hotel was great (except the service at breakfast in the restaurant). I must warn anybody looking at staying however, that the room was absolutely tiny. I was shocked at how much you pay for such a tiny room. It felt almost cupboard like, nothing like their pictures portrayed. So we personally couldn't of stayed longer than one night, and we made sure we spent most of our time out of the room. We booked on Booking.com which said breakfast was an additional £16 each which we chose to add to our booking. For this you get to use a extremely limited, tiny continental buffet. If we had known we could order a cooked breakfast on the day for only £14 we would have. We also waited about 25 minutes for one tea and toast, before the waitress came back to basically take our order again. We won't stay there again, as for a little more money you can stay at incredible hotels with spacious rooms in central London.",3,2016,02,15
123,"Tiny room, tiny bathroom, good location","I'm a little surprised that this hotel gets such good reviews. We were hugely disappointed with the room, which was a shoe box (bathroom was also tiny, two people could not stand in it at the same time).  Our rate, €260 per night, also did not include breakfast. We booked directly with the hotel but this didn't seem to make any difference in value/ experience. I realise that London is expensive but this, in my opinion, represents shockingly bad value. Service was ok, we really only interacted with housekeeping as we did not eat in restaurant/ bar. The pool is fine if you are swimming for fitness, it is not a spa pool. Likewise, there is no relaxation area in the spa. There is a relatively large gym (this is public).  I must be the only person who feels that this hotel does not offer value for money as most reviews are positive.  However overall I was very disappointed with the hotel and feel that the only positive is the location.",3,2016,02,15
123,Outstanding customer service,"On a recent trip to London I stayed at the Marylebone not once but twice. On both occasions I recieved outstanding customer service. The first time receiving a refresh kit so I could grab a shower and change before my room was ready, and the second when my booking had disappeared but being accommodated with not only a room but also an upgrade. Once would be great but twice tells me this is the standard that is expected by the team at the Maryleone. Excellent job, keep up the good work!",5,2016,02,14
123,SUPERB HOTEL,My wife and I were delighted with our stay at the Marylebone hotel. The staff were exemplary  and the meals were first class as always. We have stayed at this hotel every year for short breaks for the past five years.and we will certainly return again next year.,5,2016,02,13
123,Great Choice,"It was great choice to stay at Marylebone hotel,very good location ,beautiful room 
and excellent service ,Gunther ,the guest relations agent made us fill at home ,We will be back back soon. I highly recommended.",5,2016,02,13
123,Very Nice hotel!,"Well located, cosy, nice to stay and excelent service! Gaunther, the guest relations agent, made us fell at home. For sure we will Be back soon and recomend it. 
The breakfast is very good, with healthy choices, there is a Nice spa and swiming pool that makes your stay more confortable. I strongly recomend it. ",5,2016,02,13
123,Nice but Small rooms,"The hotel is very nice and all the staff are great, but the rooms are small.  My travel agent told me we had been upgraded on the room...well would not want to see the entry levels.  I do wish they kept the morning coffee service out longer.  It all was taken away at about 8 AM",5,2016,02,12
123,Pleasant stay,Very nice hotel and very well located for business and for shopping. Close to the main shops in Oxford street. Staff members are very friendly and happy to assist specially at the front desk Mr. Gunther,4,2016,02,11
123,Great location,Great value. We stayed four nights and everything was wonderful . Book larger rooms as standard rooms are really for one person. My wife fe love fed the spa. The staff was extremely helpful and pleasant ,5,2016,02,11
123,Business Trip,"Close proximity to central London, with excellent meeting facilities. Quiet and peaceful atmosphere conducive to a good night's sleep. Friendly and efficient staff across all areas of the hotel. Highly recommend for mid-week business trips to London.",5,2016,02,10
123,Great stay,"Stayed for a three night weekend and felt pretty much at home. Great helpful staff, very nice restaurant for breakfast - and breakfast is great too. Convenient location not far from Bond Street Tube. Would have preferred a feather duvet (but also did not ask housekeeping if they would provide one). Will be returning....",5,2016,02,09
123,Excellent location and wonderful staff,What a find! This hotel is very understated  and ticks all the boxes for a mid range hotel is a fabulous area of London. The staff are extremely helpful and nothing was too much trouble. The rooms are very nice and the bar in the hotel is very trendy with a dj at weekends. Great restaurants within walking distance .,5,2016,02,08
123,2nd Visit,This is my second stay at the Marylebone Hotel. I stayed there both times on business and had a great experience both times. The gym in the hotel is wonderful and the restaurant is lovely. The public spaces are all cool and intimate. As a woman traveling alone on business it is important to me that I feel safe and comfortable I a foreign city and I definite feel both here. The rooms are on the small side which is not uncommon in Europe. All the rooms and bathrooms are well appointed. On my first visit I found my bathroom to be too small but I emailed ahead of my arrival to make sure that would not happen again.  Gunther who was at the front desk when I arrived made sure I could see several rooms and choose the one that suited me the best.  He was great. My only disappointment on this visit was that for some reason the lovely buffet breakfast was not included in my rate. It had been included in my previous visit and I am not sure why it wasn't in this visit.  I will make sure I am clear the next time I visit about the things that are included in my rate.,4,2016,02,07
123,Hidden jem!,"Can't rave enough about this hotel. It's in a great location just a short walk from Oxford St. The decor is lovely and had the best nights sleep - comfy bed and pillows and black out curtains = perfect combo!

The bar was very nice and did some great cocktails and we had breakfast here in the morning which was a lot cheaper than in the main hotel. Loved all the healthy breakfast options and they had a great range of juices and smoothies. 

The gym and pool was well above average. Really nice OZone treated pool, cold enough to really wake you up, good steam room and sauna and loved the complimentary designer hair products. Changing rooms had everything - towels, straighteners enough space to get ready and good make up/ hair drying area. The gym was very well kitted out and gutted I didn't have time to do a class and workout.

Can't wait to come back to London so I can stay here again! ",5,2016,02,05
123,"Lovely, high standards hotel","Superb hotel, with efficient staff (welcome, check-in, check-out, cleaning staff). My room was tiny but very comfortable, with everything I needed in it. Wi-fi easy to access wherever you are in the hotel. Food is also great.
A little expensive (count around 330€ for one night), but you know why (location, comfort, staff, facilities...).",5,2016,02,05
123,First Class,"My wife and I came to London for 5 nights to celebrate my 50th Birthday. A  good friend that visits London 3- 4 times a year insisted that we stay at the Marylebone and he was right. The location is great and the staff is first class. The breakfast was fantastic, don't miss it, a great start for your day. Gunthar, Sandor, Michael and Muhamed went out of there way for us, we really felt at home. The room was nice and they pampered us with champagne and sweets. We came back from a day out to a clean, neat room with fresh bottles of water. We shall return !",5,2016,02,04
123,Staff make it special ☺️,I absolutely love this hotel. The location is absolutely ideal. To get to the main part of Londons best shopping street it's a 5 minutes walk. Although i was staying at the hotel for a business trip I have stayed here plenty of times and have absolutely complaints. Gunther at reception makes it even better and this time round Kashif at concierge really helped us too. Thank you to these two for personally making it a amazing stay. ,4,2016,02,03
123,Great base for London,We stayed here on business. The staff are efficient. The rooms are well invested and comfortable.  The bar was nice and lively and the breakfast was highly restorative!  It's a five minute walk to Oxford St and the tube. The rates are reasonable for London so it's highly recommended all around.,5,2016,02,02
123,Lovely weekend stay,"My first stay in a central London hotel, definitely set the bar high!

Me and my partner stayed in a standard room for three nights and had a lovely time. Staff were very friendly and helpful from start to finish. We brought along a bottle of champagne from home to celebrate my birthday and one of the doormen was very helpful, fetching us an ice bucket and 'nicer' flutes, even carrying it all up to our room for us.

The room was nicely furnished with good facilities and best of all, we both slept very well all weekend. Location is good, Marylebone is such a nice area and only a short walk from Regent St.

We didn't eat or have breakfast here but enjoyed a couple of drinks at the bar, which was absolutely beautiful. I had great fun watching the barstaff at work, they were very talented. 

Overall, a thoroughly enjoyable stay and we hope to be back.",5,2016,02,01
123,Birthday treat,"My boyfriend booked this hotel for my 30th birthday. The hotel was lovely. Warm welcome on arrival and hot towels to freshen up.
Room with a lovely view and nice comfy bed. 
We had champagne waiting for us in the room which was lovely. 
We really enjoyed our stay. ",5,2016,02,01
123,Hard to find a fault to this Hotel,"Arrived Christmas Evening, sat at the beautiful hotel Bar and enjoyed the special fixed price Christmas dinner.  Amazing wait-staff and bartenders.  I had breakfast down in this area as well and it was perfect.  

The rooms were great, comfortable, and had a nice view.  

I was solo but I could see this being nice for couples and my parents :)",5,2016,01,31
123,Amazing breakfasy,"The hotel has nice (small) rooms, everything is very clean! There is a real gym inside the hotel which means you have access to a lot of machines, and also a pool and steam room. 

Try the amazing juice bar and gluten free choices for breakfast! Juices for take away as well.

The staff is nice and professional and the location of the hotel is perfect. ",5,2016,01,31
123,"Excellent stay, don't go any further!","We had an excellent 2 nights stay in this fantastic hotel. What makes it most special is: 
THE LOCATION, THE SUPERB STAFF AND THE SUPER COMFY BEDS!

We can not thank Jack (porter), Gunther (receptionist) and all the other staff more for making us feel special and well cared for. 
What we also liked is that the hotel rooms are really quiet and clean.
The location is great for shopping, restaurant and cafes. Oxford street in close proximity!

Just go, you won't regret!

Breakfast is also a must do",5,2016,01,30
123,High style in excellent location,"Stayed here for four nights and loved this stylish hotel.  The hotel is designed with gorgeous textures and hues, beautiful furniture and art all put together to create a calm, rich atmosphere.  I stayed in the junior suite, the bed was very comfortable with crisp bed linens and good soft towels.  The bathroom was beautiful, very large and modern with black and white marble.  House slippers and cotton bathrobe provided.
The desk amenities had every type of electrical outlet - including US.  Very nice tea kettle and nespresso machine to make and enjoy while relaxing in the room.  

 The night manager Mr. Mufti was so very nice and helpful when we checked in - but the whole staff was very friendly, attentive and professional.

The hotel has a very nice cafe and bar/restaurant and cocktail service in the lobby.",4,2016,01,29
123,Modern hotel in a fabulous location,"We stayed at The Marylebone for 5 nights and would definitely return next time we visit London. The hotel has a very modern design with all room and hotel facilities working perfectly. The porters and reception staff are very friendly and happy to help, and the turndown service was a lovely touch. 
The location is superb - easily walkable to Oxford Street and Bond Street tube station for all transport options, but quiet and secluded for a restful sleep. As two women travelling, we felt quite safe walking back to the hotel after the theatre as well. 
The breakfast buffet is very expensive, which encouraged us to explore the area and experience its numerous and delicious breakfast options (particularly Marylebone High Street in both directions). On the same token, you'll never be stuck for dinner options either!",5,2016,01,29
123,Stylish & Friendly,"- stylish hotel at a very nice location
- very friendly and professional staff
- rooms are stylish and modern, nevertheless comfortable and cosy
- great restaurants and a nice bar with great food and great atmosphere
- would definitely come again",4,2016,01,27
123,Lovely hotel,"Nice room only fault is small bathroom.
Breakfast above average.
Close to Oxford street and st Christopher place where there is lots of nice restaurants..
Free coffee and small cakes in reception which is a nice touch.",5,2016,01,27
123,Exceeded expectations,"We stayed for one night for a short leisure break. The hotel was chosen due to location and competitive online rate. We arrived at 1pm and the rooms were available. Small rooms but very well furnished and equipped. Very small bathroom, but again very well finished. Comfortable bed and bedding. One of us had breakfast in the room and it was very well presented. Delicious fresh orange juice, watermelon , freshly cooked sausages, hot tea. The breakfast served in the restaurant was also excellent. The service was first rate. The largely foreign staff very polite and efficient. Couldn't do enough to make us welcome and comfortable. Our only criticism would be that the air con units, probably on the roof above our rooms, were exceptionally noisy, and did not allow for a good nights sleep. The hotel has comfortable lounge and public areas, which is unusual for a central London hotel. We were glad of their use before catching our train home. We would have no hesitation in returning to the Marylebone, but would request a quiet room next time.",5,2016,01,24
123,Still Great,"Revisited for a three day winter break and received a really warm welcome from Gunther, Anji and the reception team. They are always prepared to go the extra mile to ensure visitors stays are as smooth and pleasant as possible. There is an excellent rapport between the staff. Any problems are tackled and solved immediately, always with a smile. You can stop and talk to any of the staff and you will be treated warmly. It's a friendly place.
We have stayed in many different rooms on a number of occasions, they have all been clean and well-appointed. The beds are excellent. Food in the restaurant for breakfast, lunch and dinner is excellent, tried all three. Lunch is popular.
We come to London several times a year and now wouldn't stay anywhere else.
Finally, In other posts you may read of compliments to Gunther. Any problems, call on him. He is exceptional. If I was a hotel owner I would definitely poach him!",5,2016,01,21
123,Excellent,"Superb hotel.  Beautiful room and very well equipped with lots of little extras.  Extremely comfortable bed! 

Wonderful service from staff,  particularly at check in.  Slightest blip on check out was followed up within half an hour with a lovely email,  nothing is left to chance. 

Beautiful lobby and restaurant areas with a very comfortable and calming ambience.   Great location too, I'll be back! ",5,2016,01,21
123,Great Service at check-in,"Nice hotel in a good location in London, close to the city and Regents Park. Good for a morning run in Regents park before work. The service is always very good and professional, particularly at the check-in desk. At my last stay, due to late arrival I was assigned a room across form the elevator. My preference is away from the elevator but there was no room available. Gunther at reception gave me an upgrade to make it possible to get a rom away from the elevator. Very much appreciated, thank you!",4,2016,01,20
123,Excellent hotel,"Stayed from Friday to Sunday in December, nice room, excellent breakfast and overall cozy atmosphere. Location in the middle of everything. Room had a separate wardrobe, brilliant to be able to stow suitcase away.",5,2016,01,19
123,Weekend break,"Lovely hotel in good spot,the rooms are ok the bathrooms a bit smal ,service very good breakfast good ,the room was spotless and cleaned every day,20 minutes walk to west end  5 minutes to Oxford street,this is the fifth time stayed there ,price has become a bit steep but thoroughly enjoyed stay again",4,2016,01,18
123,Lovely central location,"Modern, stylish hotel. Excellent location in a quiet, safe and upmarket area but still only 5 minutes walking distance to oxford street, shops, tube etc. The immediate area also has lovely restaurants, bars and independent shops, lovely to wander in the area! 
The hotel was welcoming, clean and the room was lovely, comfy and had all the amenities expected. Would recommend this hotel.",4,2016,01,15
123,Nice experience at Marylebone Hotel,"Ideal location to discover London culture, shopping and gastronomy. Very nice pool, friendship of staff. Standard room too smal even if comfortable. The Hotel is very elegantly decorated. We recommand!",4,2016,01,15
123,Another great stay,"Our family based ourselves in the Marylebone Hotel for 10+ days over the Christmas Period. Special compliments to the wait staff on the lounge area (near the fireplace), the wait staff in the restaurant and concierge. We stay there twice a year and will be back.",5,2016,01,14
123,Top Service in a Charming Hotel,"I've stayed at many boutique hotels in London and I finally found the best one.  My office is in the Fitrovia area - about a 10 minute walk.  The Marylebone Hotel is in a charming, wealthy and residential part of London.  High Street shopping area is only 2 blocks away.  

The rooms are contemporary but warm decor.  My room, 442, was bright and had a view of Wellbeck street below.  

Upon checking in, the bellman took care of my bags, personally led me to the check-in counter, introduced his front desk colleague, asked if I wanted a bottle of water and waited till I was all checked in and then helped me with my bags and settled me into my room.  Wow!

It was rainy one of the days, and was promptly given an umbrella to borrow.  Check-out was 12 noon which was nice.  

For the rate I paid, 220 BP, it was great value for the service and room.

The rest of the hotel was quite interesting - there were LOTS of little rooms and nooks for sitting and hanging out.  I've now found the hotel that I will be staying each time I come for work in London.

I definitely give The Hotel Marylebone two thumbs up!",5,2016,01,12
123,Fabulous hotel,"Very cosy and elegant decorated hotel. Kind and professional staff (in particular Gunther, Dimitri, Sondor, Roberta..). Great residential and central location. Very good quality breakfast and restaurant. Excellent service overall. A pleasure to regularly come back.",5,2016,01,12
123,Nice stay!,"We spent only 2 nights here, even if at the beginning we got couple of issues since instead of an extra bed they put a baby-cradle, at midnight they finally brought us the required one. Good restaurant/bar with fantastic smoothies, not super cheap though!",4,2016,01,11
123,Nice hotel,"Very cozy and warm hotel, nicely done areas in ground floor, friendly and profesional staff, good location and tasty breakfast. Maybe just rooms could be a bit bigger. Will recommend this hotel to others.",5,2016,01,09
123,"Fabulous Location, great amenities and outstanding service","Our arrival at the hotel was immediately off to a good start with fabulous service from Gunther at the Front desk - he was attuned to our needs, friendly and professional and continued to be so during our stay.  On top of this, every staff member we engaged with during our stay was excellent and delivered service to the highest quality.

We stayed at the hotel for 6 nights as its location was close to family we were visiting. The hotel exceeded expectations, and our room was excellent.  We enjoyed eating breakfast there daily, plus the room service, bar and dinner experience there were brilliant. 

Only point of improvement we'd like would be to have in house movies available for rent. Otherwise massive thumbs up.",5,2016,01,08
123,Another Great Stay,"We have stayed at the Marylebone Hotel many times and are never disappointed. The location is perfect, close to many great restaurants, pubs and both Hyde and Regent's Parks. Shopping is within walking distance. Cab service and the Underground Transport Stations are convenient for travel to other areas of London. ",5,2016,01,08
123,A really good hotel,"I stayed in the hotel in October 2015. I was travelling for work. Hotel has perfect location; it is near to Oxford St. and Selfridges, if one wants to do some shopping. The Marylebone district is really nice, lots of bars, restaurants and shops. Hotel is modern, with really nice rooms and a good breakfast. A very nice surprise to me was the gym. Hotel has access to a very good external gym The third space - a place worth visiting. I will definitely return to this hotel when I travel to London again.",5,2016,01,07
123,Great location and good hotel,"We stayed at the Marylebone in December. We took our staff away for the night and had rooms for 26 people. All was organised well and we got a fair price for the rooms. The hotel itself has a good feel about it, a bit cool and kitsch nice rooms (a little small even for the better standard, but good enough for central London) location was great and bar and restaurant were really good. Pool area was ok, I went for a dream and sauna with my wife only to find that the saunas are in each changing room so not shared. Steam room next to pool so that was ok. I really long for a hotel where the windows open in the rooms rather than having to have air con on. And biggest let down was no late bar, when I say no late bar it was past 1pm, but as residents we couldn't carry on the lovely evening we had and I thought that was pretty poor. All in all, comfortable, cool and would stay again. Just allow adults to open a window a bit, and sort out the option for residents bar!",4,2016,01,06
123,Great family stay,We stayed here for 3 nights with our 3 teens. We had two adjoining rooms and although the rooms were a bit small they were very nice. The beds were comfortable and the service was helpful. We liked all of the cozy nooks in the main lobby area. The location was away from the bustle of London but still close to everything. We enjoyed staying here because we felt like we were in a neighborhood and it had  lots of restaurant and shopping choices. Would definitely recommend it.,5,2016,01,06
123,Holiday stay,"Our stay at the Marelebone was delightful!  The rooms were modern, clean and the beds were comfortable with fluffy bedding. Every staff member we encountered was courteous and helpful. The breakfast was delightful.",5,2016,01,06
123,Very good Hotel in London,"The location is great, just few minute walk to Oxford street.
The rooms were clean and had everything you needed, although the rooms were small.This was my third time on this hotel and the staff was friendly and ready to assist you.",4,2016,01,05
123,A pampering accommodation in London,"I stayed for four nights at Marylebone hotel, along with my wife.
The hotel is located just 5 minutes walk from the Bond underground station.
Since we did not eat at the hotel, I will refer only to the room.
We were staying in a superior room. It is a pleasant, modern room, although a bit small.
The bed is large and wide. Bed linen are soft and luxurious.
Accessories that are in this room include coffee and tea kettle, an espresso machine, a minibar, flat-screen TV, safe, hairdryer and iron.
Our room turned into the courtyard, but there are rooms that face the surrounding streets.
The bathroom has a toilet, a sink and a spacious shower with no bath. The towels and robes level is excellent.
Wi-Fi is free throughout the hotel and the room, which works very well.
The hotel staff in general, and the reception staff and concierge particular, very friendly and always willing to help.
The hotel has a  professional and large health center. It includes treatment rooms, a gym, pool, and sauna.
We would be happy to stay at Marylebone, in the future.",5,2016,01,04
123,Wonderful hotel in London,"My family and I just returned from London. The Marylebone Hotel is a little gem. 
The location of the hotel is wonderful. It is in a neighbourhood setting but only a 5 minute walk from Oxford Street and the tube. Close enough to the hustle and bustle of the city but nestled on a quiet street. The best of both worlds.
The rooms are small but very well appointed. Nothing is missing and they are very confortable. 
The service is excellent, starting with a very friendly checking in staff, very knowledgeable concierge, efficient room service and very good cleaning staff. 
I would definitely recommend this hotel and most definitely stay there again when in London.
Enjoy your stay!
",5,2016,01,04
123,New Years Eve,"Just had another good stay at this hotel, celebrated New Years Eve at the hotel and some lovely drinks in the local pubs.
Our room was a suite again and many thanks to Gunther again and Happy Birthday too you.
Look forward to see you all again very soon.",5,2016,01,04
123,Brilliant Friendly Hotel,"I stay at the Marylebone Hotel on a regular basis for work and occasionally pleasure. Great Hotel, try the pool and the fabulous Vanilla Martini in the Cocktail Bar. 
On reception Antji is always gives you a cheery smile and welcomes me back. This week however she was great, having booked for Tuesday the 17th and then tried to book for the 18th and 19th November to be informed they were full. However, when I arrived on Tuesday am to leave my bag I asked if there had been any cancellations. Antji then called me as soon as there was a cancellation which meant I didn't have to move hotels. Thank you Antji.",5,2016,01,04
123,NYE Stay,"4 of us stayed here on NYE as we had a party nearby. I was pleasantly surprised at how good the hotel was, big rooms (for London), attentive staff and lots of small areas to sit - and of course it was in Marylebone, so a great location.
The room was also quite, a major boost since it was NYE in central London.
The only criticism I had was when checking out. Our booking ( from booking.com) explicitly said it included breakfast - the hotel said it did not. At £64 extra for the 4 of us, it was not a small difference. The fact that it took over 30 mins to resolve this was almost worse.
I'm tempted to blame Booking.com as this is the 2nd time in my last 4 stays through booking.com that my reservation says one thing and the hotels reservation is different or incomplete.
Putting that aside it is a great find, in a great location. I'll use it again ( but maybe not booking.com)",4,2016,01,02
123,Overall Product,"Both  my wife and I felt we had an excellent experience in the hotel, which is matched by very few..   We haver stayed at many hotels.   An overqall pleasurable experience to be repeated whenver we are in London.",5,2016,01,02
123,Brilliant hotel ,Great hotel in a fantastic location so close to oxford street. The staff really went above and beyond for us when we were staying there helping with recommendations and bookings. The breakfast that was included in the price was exceptional and really set us up for the day! The access to the gym and pool beside the hotel was brilliant and we loved it. The room was slightly small but this is to be expected from a city centre hotel in London. The room was very clean and the bathroom was functional. Perfect for a city break to London!! ,5,2016,01,01
123,Hotel that made our trip to London!,"Amazing service from the moment we arrived, the staff are so welcoming, sincerely polite and attentive, and make you feel valued. We arrived early but the reception staff made sure our room was ready for us within 30 minutes even though we were happy to wait. The room was fully equipped with everything we needed, complete with the most comfortable bed!
It was our first New Years in London and our anniversary and the hotel staff went above and beyond to make our trip that extra bit special by sending us a bottle of bubbly and returning back on the evening to a room of scattered rose petals! 
After our stay here we don't ever want to stay anywhere else in London. The hotel and the staff are both amazing! We would highly recommend. 
",5,2016,01,01
123,Amazing family stay,We came up from Liverpool me my boyfriend our baby and my grandparents the hotel was gorgeous the staff could not do enough for us especially Jack  he was so helpful and polite made a fuss of us would definitely stay again. The bar downstairs is brilliant.,5,2016,01,01
123,"Good Hotel, in a great location ","Stayed here during the run up to the Christmas festivities. The rooms are well equipped and the bathrooms are very clean and modern. The rooms are not huge, but this is the norm in London. The staff are friendly, I got a good rate booking in their website direct.",4,2015,12,31
123,Nice pleasant stay,"Stayed for two nights, room was clean and well equipped. Comfortable bed and spacious. I would not have normally stayed here as my regular hotel was undergoing refurbishment. Front desk was welcoming and accommodating.",4,2015,12,30
123,Amazing service & attention to detail,We stayed at this excellent hotel for our wedding anniverary. Its location is perfect & it has a nice style & atmosphere. Gunther at reception was superb and really looked after us! Good cocktails at the bar too.,5,2015,12,29
123,"Lovely staff, great location","Very little to complain about with this hotel. The rooms are slightly small, the bathrooms a bit of as squeeze. However the location is magnificent, the staff delightful from check in to the bar staff. The breakfasts are marvellous. A very classy hotel very much worth a visit. Highly recommend.",4,2015,12,28
123,The Marvellous Marylebone Hotel,"Once again I had a wonderful stay at The Marylebone Hotel. The ambience is very relaxed and luxurious- beautiful furnishings and high quality bathroom products. Breakfast is a real treat with everythinf freshly cooked and beautifully presented. The gym facilities are terrific with long opening hours.
I travel a lot with my work and this hotel is my favourite!
All of the staff are extremely friendly and professional.",5,2015,12,27
123,"Welcoming, well located and comfortable hotel","We've just returned from a 2 night stay at the Marylebone Hotel. We were impressed with the helpfulness and friendliness of the staff, the comfy beds and the cleanliness. Someone has put a lot of thought into this hotel and it has paid off. We loved the location. We won't hesitate to return. We'd love to try out the other Doyle collection hotels.",5,2015,12,24
123,"Nice Stay, Hotel listens to voice of Customer","We stayed recently for four nights, near the Christmas period.
Room was Deluxe rather than Standard: more spacious, slightly better equipped. Recommended if your budget will stretch.

I have stayed at this hotel previously and rated it badly due to noticeably poor maintenance and badly organised breakfast experience. Truly unacceptable considering the hotel's rating.
Hotel management is to be congratulated for responding to me personally and assuring me that they were of aware of some problems and would act on the concerns expressed. I was not expecting any form of response, so a personal reply was already a nice surprise.
And on this stay I can say that they really do seem to have addressed the issues! Although I'm for sure not the only guest to have pointed out the problems, it's a rare thing to see concerns genuinely taken on board and actually fixed. Gone are the nasty looking half-repairs in the public areas. Gone was the breakfast room stress and panic. 
The hotel is warm and welcoming, and up to scratch once again.
The personal touch with me on customer service has been great, and is something that should never be undervalued.
The restaurant and bar remain fabulous.
Recommended for a good stay, great food and an excellent location.

123,Noisy Sleepless Night,"I've stayed at this hotel before and it was very good so rebooked for earlier this week. The room was nicely presented with an awful view over rooftops and air-conditioning units although not the smallest or cheapest on offer so I expected that it would provide a satisfactory stay. Unfortunately this was not the case. There was a constant droning of machinery/equipment all night above the bathroom ceiling which was very irritating and made a good sleep difficult. In addition, as I realised at 6am when it commenced, we were next to the lift shaft with constantly opening and closing of doors. I am really disappointed that I was provided with such an unsatisfactory experience. In addition the arrangements at breakfast were a little chaotic with too many people in too small a space for a hotel of this rating.",2,2015,12,23
123,Nice Hotel Near Oxford St,"I just spent 12 nights here. Here is what I liked and disliked:

Liked:
1- Modern and cozy.
2- Close to Oxford. Less than 5 minutes walking.
3- The best Housekeeping I've seen with 2 room visits , one in the morning and one at night.
4- Complimentary water and chocolate replaced every night.
5- Free Wifi.

Disliked:
1- Mattresses : My wife and I woke up every morning with backache.
2- AC is old type which shuts down completely when a cretin temp is reached. I am the kind of person that wakes up when the AC is shut down, so I wasn't happy with it.

I really like the hotel and wish to come here every time when I am in London but  their Mattresses will make me look for other options.

P.S. At least book a Deluxe room. The standard room is very very small and does not have curtains.",4,2015,12,22
123,Disappointing ,"Overall we just weren't impressed with this hotel for the price.
The room was very underwhelming,  not cosy or luxurious, with tiny bathroom with no bath. 

The breakfast included is continental and did not compare to other full English/buffet we have had for similar (and less) price brackets. We even called to check we were in a superior room as it seemed so basic. 
The advertised iPod dock was nowhere to be seen, we called reception but they didn't have one that fit our iPod/phone (5)
The 'spa' is a small pool and steam room, the shower outside the steam room did not work so people were just going straight in the pool sweaty. There are saunas in the separate changing rooms but we assumed that we could enjoy all the facilities together. There is a direct lift down to the spa for hotel guests, it was out of other one day so the options are through the lobby or through the outside door (in your robe)
There was a mix up with our breakfast at the fault of reception, after some questioning of us by staff and is trying to explain,  Chris in the restaurant took control of this and sorted it out in a manner you would expect from a hotel of this standard. 
Our tv kept losing signal which was annoying on the night we stayed in to watch a film. Reception said there was nothing they could do. 

The bed was comfy and the location great, but for this price at other central London hotels, we have been treated like VIPs and had access to the executive lounge and had full breakfast options. 
This was a treat by my partner for Xmas and I felt bad for him that it didn't live up to expectation. Go to the Charing Cross! ",3,2015,12,22
123,Excellent and as spacious as the Tardis!,"The Marylebone Hotel proved to be an excellent choice for an overnight stay to attend an appointment in Harley Street the following morning. The ground floor is unusually spacious, with many comfortable nooks and crannies to sit or have a drink. The bar was heaving a few nights before Christmas, but service was attentive and cocktails were mixed and poured with aplomb. Thankfully, the 108 Bistro restaurant was quieter, and with the same friendly service and a good variety of reasonably priced dishes. Our deluxe room on the fourth floor was smart and comfortable. The queen size bed was a little smaller than we're used to and it would be good if a bedside clock was provided. The flat screen TV was a decent size. WiFi was complementary. The bathroom was only large enough for one and a more attention to cleaning wouldn't go amiss: the ledge under the side of the bath had accumulated a white crud. Breakfast (not included in the room rate) was served in the 108 Pantry. A full English was available, but the continental breakfast selection proved fine for us. One good thing about the hotel is their 12:00 checkout which is ideal if you want to do some shopping or attend an appointment before leaving.",5,2015,12,22
123,Great stay,"Fantastic hotel and staff, great food and choice of restaurants right in Marylebone village with plenty of restaurant and shopping options around. Access to third space gym and pool was a real bonus. 

The overall feel of the hotel was very high end,  with 2 French style restaurants internally for morning breakfast and then lunch and dinner. Staff couldn't have been more helpful. Room not a bad size for London and the price you pay. ",5,2015,12,21
123,Great location,Excellent location next to very good restaurants and basically everything you may be looking for. Also excellent gym and that was really an excellent surprise. The rooms are very good (at least the one I got... I understood that have not such good layout). Breakfast was not included and that was a down side. ,4,2015,12,17
123,Amazing staff and wonderful hotel,"We stayed in the Hotel for 6 nights now in December and we loved it very much. I worked in Hotels for many years so I’m always a bit critical, but everything was absolutely perfect. I have never seen such a clean room, the housekeeping did an amazing job. The staff at reception and the porters were wonderful so friendly and helpful. Everything we asked for they  helped us with.  It might be a bit pricier then other hotels but every penny is worth it. The good thing is also that its quite quiet where the hotel is but never less you are on oxford street in 5min walk, so perfect for shopping, and the tube station is close also. Thanks to thw whole team to making it an awesome stay!",5,2015,12,17
123,Great welcome and location ,"From walking through the door, check in and throughout the stay we received a very warm welcome. 
This was a family visit to sample
some Christmas atmosphere and to take my son to his first London show. 

First of all if using the tube, exit at Bond Street, avoid Oxford Circus. It's too busy! The hotel is a short walk up through St Christophers place. So apart from the smaller type boutique shops right next to the hotel you're only 5 mins from Oxford street and Selfridges. 

To get to the West End takes about 20mins from the hotel door. Again via Bond Street station, 3 stops to Holborn and you're there. Right by the British Museum. Short walk again takes you to Covent Garden.

The hotel has a lovely feel and great location in Marlybone 'village'. A teepee tent over an air bed went down very well with my 5 year old. As did the bag or jelly beans! One regret, we didn't bring our swim wear. There's an attached spa, gym and pool. Next time perhaps.  

I didn't get the chance to sample some of local pubs on the doorstep but we did eat in an Italian restaurant in St Christophers Place. Good food that hit the spot after great day. 

Anyway, the welcome and the location, great. Very enjoyable!",5,2015,12,17
123,Just fabulous!,"Fantastic location and the staff were simply the best I have encountered in London, they could not do enough for us. Lovely surroundings, we will return...soon.  

All at a very reasonable price, under £200. We stay in London a lot, so have a fair amount of experience, thank you to all the staff. ",5,2015,12,16
123,Christmas Weekend Away,"This is our third time staying in the Marylebone Hotel at Christmas Time.  We have just come home from our trip this year.  The hotel is in a superb location, the staff are top class, it has a lovely ambiance, the continental breakfast is excellent.   I would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel.",5,2015,12,16
123,Always a good choice of hotel,"This hotel is close to Bond Street shops and there is a tube station on Bond Street a few minutes walk from the hotel.  Taxis normally are good for this hotel, but at present, with all the roads either closed or down to one lane due to installation of many cycle lanes, it can be slow progress getting from A to B - for example I took a trip from Avequia near St. Pauls to the Marylebone Hotel and it cost £18.00 and it was a very slow journey.  Worth it in the end, as the hotel never disappoints.  The beds are extremely comfortable and the rooms are spacious.",5,2015,12,15
123,As you should expect,"Clean, comfortable and quiet hotel, i had no complaints but only scored ""average"" as there was nothing over and above what I believe should be expected from a hotel. 

Very short review but hopefully somebody finds it useful :-)",3,2015,12,14
123,Good value for money,"The location of the hotel is excellent, surrounded by very good restaurant and very close to some city sights. Also the restaurant is awesome and for those who like to start the day with a gym session, the spa and the fitness center were something that I was not expecting at all (used to be very small, but not this one).",5,2015,12,14
123,Charming warm hotel just minutes from Oxford Street and Bond St tube,"Stayed weekend, excellent staff, could not have been more helpful and attentive. Food is excellent, breakfast is ace. Great ambiance with lots of seating areas and quiet secluded areas as well as the busy bar and restaurants. 
Wellbeck street is quiet but so close to everything.
Our room 340 was small but perfectly kitted out and luxurious despite its size, 'small but perfectly formed'.
The manager gave out water bottles to those at check out on sunday morning and they kept our bags for us as`we went to the national museum, despite being very busy and full.",5,2015,12,13
123,Very nice central London hotel,"The only reason I'm not giving the hotel 5 stars is that they didn't accommodate my request for an early check in after an overnight flight, despite the fact my company had group reservation for 15 people for 2 nights. Hotel is very nice, the premium rooms were large for London with great amenities like robe and slippers, free wifi, nice fitness center and pool. Great location too in central London, 30 min walk to Covent Garden. ",4,2015,12,12
123,"Great Hotel , Great Servic !","Stayed for 2 days for business  , a misunderstanding in preorder was solved immediately by Gunther ,guest relations guy that took care  of us immediately and put us in beautiful and spacious rooms giving us best level of professional and personal service one would expect  .",5,2015,12,12
123,"Fantastic, intimate Hotel in the centre of London","Great service, quiet location but right in the middle of London. The food is wonderful and the staff are genuinely interested and helpful. Gunther at the front desk was able to organise an extra room with no fuss or stress for my mother to Join me in London and even got her a room next to mine even though the hotel was almost fully booked.",5,2015,12,10
123,Great hotel with friendly and helpful staff,"I've stayed here for work several times this year.  This hotel is clean and modern with all the amenities one could ask for: gym, restaurant, turn down service, etc.  The hotel is also located minutes away from soho and picadilly circus.  More importantly from the time you check in you are always greeted with a friendly staff, such as Auroroa and Isabella, with a smile on their faces.  And you have bellhops such as Michael always ready to help with anything you may need such as takings bags up to your room, open the door, suggestions on what to eat/do nearby.  I've also enjoyed my breakfast downstairs at 108 pantry.  Chalita has greeted my colleague and I every weekday morning asking how we're doing, and before we know it she has brought our drinks to the table without us even asking or ordering it.",5,2015,12,09
123,Superb,"I am not going to write very much because it has already been said by others, consistently. Tried booking sister hotel the Bloomsbury as stayed there a couple of years ago and found it really good but ended up here for 2 nights as Bloomsbury was full. What a fabulous bit of luck. This takes excellence to a new level. Rooms really comfortable and quiet; hotel full  but once inside room it could be empty - no noise at all!. Bar and brasserie great atmosphere and food really good - breakfast too. Lounges so spacious and  comfortable. The whole place is sophisticated without being pretentious. The hotel as a whole ticks all the boxes. Finally, credit to the management because every member of staff is 100% customer focused - the hospitality industry in England should take lessons from The Marylebone. Would not hesitate to return or recommend.",5,2015,12,09
123,Weekend in London,"If you are spending a weekend in London, Marylebone is a special gem with individual shops, great restaurants, coffee shops, and friendly pubs. The Marleybone Hotel is at the heart of this community and offers stylish interiors, lively bar, as well as swimming pool and Spa. Great rates too.

123,Birthday treat in the centre of London,We booked this trip as part of a package to see Hamlet at the Barbican. From arrival to checkout we were impressed with the hotel and the service was fantastic. A huge shout out to Jack on the door who made my birthday extra special with a big smile and a friendly face and organising a birthday bottle of bubbles. Decor is really good- only room for improvement would be the toiletries but that is being very picky.,5,2015,12,08
123,Excellent Hotel!,"This was our first trip to London and we were so pleased with our choice to stay at the Marylebone Hotel. It is in an excellent location, tucked away on a quiet side street, in a beautiful part of London, just one block from all the area's great restaurants and shopping, an easy to walk to most everywhere else, or just two blocks from the underground. The hotel was beautiful, clean, quiet, the staff were professional, genuinely nice and helpful. The hotel was always a pleasure to return to at the end of a long day of sight seeing and shopping. Our room was a comfortable size, quiet and clean, had a nice big comfortable bed, nice soft sheets, and a spacious and clean modern bathroom. There was a quiet lounge area, and an excellent restaurant (with room service) and happening bar as well.  I have already recommended this hotel and look forward to returning for another stay!",5,2015,12,07
123,Service is superb!,I stay at this hotel often and can highly recommend to the business traveller. The reason I say that is because the rooms are on the small side but immaculate and the beds are so comfy and dressed in lovely Egyptian cotton. Housekeeping pay particular attention to detail and my room is always perfect when I return. The staff are incredibly polite and cannot do enough for you. The gym downstairs is excellent. I would also recommend the restaurant as the food is divine. For such a large hotel I also think it is fairly quiet and can never hear anyone in the next room.,5,2015,12,07
123,Brilliant Hotel Marylebone - The Best Hotel in London,"We had the most brilliant experience at Hotel Marylebone - it felt like home away from home. This hotel has everything you could possibly want - gorgeous rooms, comfortable beds and fantastic restaurant and bar. We were in London on business for over 10 days and everyone at Hotel Marylebone were so accommodating. A very big special thanks to Gunther who totally took care of our every need. The Hotel is perfectly situated in a very cool area with great restaurants and shopping - Selfridges, and Oxford Street is just a couple of blocks away. Also only a 10 minute walk to Hyde Park. Fantastic breakfast, insanely great menu for dinner and perfect room service. Honestly I can't say enough about how much we loved staying at the Hotel Marylebone. It's our new Hotel of choice in London. Highly recommended.

123,Excellent interpersonal skills from staff,"I recently stayed at the Marylebone Hotel and was incredibly impressed by the warmth, professionalism and mutual respect demonstrated by all the staff. From the vry first moment at reception, nothing was too much trouble. The interpersonal skills of the staff were a first class, never fawning, but efficient and friendly - reception, porters and breakfast waitress. They made our stay an absolute pleasure.

123,The best hotel in London,"I have stayed at this hotel at least a dozen times over the past couple of years and it never, ever changes. It is just superb. I don't normally write these reviews as I don't have time, but I thought I should finally do one as it really is an outstanding place to stay.  I'd say there are five main reasons for this:

1. The staff:  exceptional level of service from ALL the staff here.  I checked in last Xmas having been at the Four Seasons in Hampshire and I can say the staff at this hotel are trained to the same standard if not better. Friendly, helpful, efficient and always going the extra mile. 

2. The location: I've lived in London for 30 years and W1 is noisy.  Not here though. Quietly tucked away in Marylebone, it is perfect as it's close to Oxford St but away from all the sirens and hoards of shoppers. 

3: The beds: have no idea why, but the beds and bedding are so comfortable and luxurious that I spend way too much time in bed here reading the papers and sleeping. 

4: The food: all room service is average to dreary, but not here.  Some really delicious dishes and breakfasts are great too.  Just well above what you'd expect.

5: Amenities: there is a Third Space gym downstairs (that I used to go to when I lived here oddly enough) with a beautiful pool and good equipment. All spotlessly clean and great for a work out or a chill out. Or both.

But probably the reason I keep coming back is, although not the cheapest place to stay, it is worth every penny. I've never once been let down. 

If anything it's the opposite.  I am typing this from my room, having got here too early to check in, but the front desk managed to find me a room three hours early. My luggage was then sent up less than five minutes later, despite there being lots of people checking in and out on a busy Sunday morning. It's just always like this: they get things right, are super efficient and nothing seems too much trouble. 

So bottom line: in my view, this is the best hotel in London if you want a great location, excellent levels of service, great rooms - and beds! - and to know you'll be looked after by people who clearly seem to enjoy their jobs and always have a smile on their faces.",5,2015,12,06
123,Nice place. Tiny bathrooms and horrible wifi.,"This is a nice place in a nice part of town, but when I checked in I was told I was getting a ""deluxe"" room. Well, the room was the size of a postage stamp and the bathroom was so tiny you hand to close the door to sit on the toilet. It was also the worst wifi I've ever experienced, which may sound trivial except I was there on business. I complained three times and they kept telling me to just restart my computer, which is is a big inconvenience. Then they had a tech guy call me, but his fix did no good. The signal the TV also went out half a dozen times while I was watching as well as the guide didn't work.",3,2015,12,06
123,Really Small Rooms,"I travel a lot, stay in a lot of hotels and I am usually very positive and definitely not one of the niggly types who sometime use this website. I stayed at the Marylebone Hotel for the first time this week having read very positive reviews on Tripadvisor.
 
I have to say that although the staff were very nice and professional and the location is good for the West End, I was truly amazed at how small the bedrooms were. It was almost as if the rooms had been designed to see how many of the essential requirements could be met in the least possible space. It was a bit like being in a monk's cell. I had to manoeuvre around the bed and could not open the wardrobe and get past it at the same time. The bathroom was equally cramped.

The price was not the highest for London but nevertheless I would usually expect a bit more than this for £240 per night.(and that was a discount!)",3,2015,12,03
123,Overall excellence in a great location,"From booking, to check-in, quality of bedroom, breakfast - all 5 star. Staff really care and Guest Relations Manager is extremely helpful and professional.  My wife and I have stayed at the Marylebone Hotel on numerous occasions over the last two years and cannot find fault - it is highly recommendable.",5,2015,12,03
123,Perfect Birthday Getaway,"The hotel staff were excellent, the room was lovely and the breakfast was amazing. Special thanks to Chris for taking time to answer random questions over breakfast and to the hotel for the birthday prosecco. We had a wonderful stay and little things made us feel very welcome, like the warm face clothes while we checked in a bit cold and damp. Slight shame the pool was closed due to a leak but otherwise perfect.
We had a comfortable and peaceful night and a relaxing morning. Thank you.",5,2015,12,03
123,great hotel in fantastic location,"friendly, helpful staff, great location.  Room quite small but well appointed with nespresso machine and plenty of hanging space. Hotel facitlities (bars, restaurant) were great. Breakfast was amazing, including juice bar, vegetable and fruit /juice smoothie options for health conscious (this was all included in our B&B price - no surcharge for specialist coffees either)
Fantastic location in heart of Marylebone and within walking distance of Oxford St etc
This is the second time we have stayed and will be back again",4,2015,12,02
123,Mum and Daughter trip to London,"Upon arrival at the Marylebone we were greeted by the staff who were extremely helpful, pleasant and informative.  I can not praise Jack enough for his help, he made our stay extra special, he went above and beyond his duty to enable our stay to be perfect.
The hotel was excellent, the room was clean, comfortable and everything we would have expected.  The breakfast was delicious, most of the people staying were business people so not too friendly but the staff made up for this.
I would highly recommend this hotel.",5,2015,12,02
123,"Have used this hotel on several occasions when meeting friends, family and for business meetings.","Lovely spacious hotel with many amenities, Spa, bar, restaurant, swimming pool and  gym.  Close to Marylebone High St. with individual shops, bars & restaurants.  Minutes from Oxford St., Regents Park, The Wallace Collection.  Near Bond Street and Baker Street Tube yet free from the hustle and bustle of many West End hotels.  Rooms serviced twice a day with free water and chocolates in the evening. Staff are excellent and one Gunther Schildwachter even provide a fridge in which to keep medicine at the correct temperature.",5,2015,12,01
123,Absaloutely Superb,"I would like to start off this review mentioning certain members of exceptional staff by name, after all, this strong well trained team are what brings our family back to the Marylebone on a regular basis.
Rebecca, manager of reservations, you are so exceptional in every way. You certainly listen to what your customers are needing and asking for and wave a magic wand, and all their wishes are granted. As a reservations manager you are fantastic, people like you who go about your buiseness in your own quiete  very efficient wayway are what gives this hotel five stars, you are the best and I thank you for making our last stay another perfect one.
Gunther, so much is written on trip advisor about you, for good reason, you are incredible, never needing to be asked to do something, you always foresee ahead, your service and care is amazing, and I know you are a highly valued member of this excellent team. Your care of my daughter was a stand out, we were so grateful to you.
You skills on restaurant recommendations were always excellent too.
Christian in the dining area, I know we were one of the first couples you waited on when you started your job, you are now a manager and I know why. Your service from the first day we met you, and when we were the first you waited on, was always professional, you always make breakfast so special..
I want to also mention Long, guest relations, in your very sophisticated elegant manner you always make sure your guests have every comfort they require, nothing is too much for you, loved discussing our trip to China with you, you are so accomadating and helpful. An excellent ambassador for the Maryylebone.
This hotel is in a wonderful location, close to Bond Street tube and Oxford Street.
The fashionable Marylebone area has all the high end fashion stores and great restaurants, especially love Golden Hind for the best fish and chips in London and Fairuz, close by for very fresh outstanding Lebanese food.
Accomadations in the suites are spacious with lovely marble bathrooms and nice amenities. ladies do not have to bring a hair dryer, an excellent one is in the room.
Food is very good and breakfasts are a delight, al la carte and buffet offered in the full breakfast menu, an excellent juice bar with a small additional cost with very healthy choices.
The gym is excellent on London standard s.
High tea is delicious and a treat.",5,2015,12,01
123,Marylebone hotel,"The staff were very helpful, and left us a bottle of prosecco as it was our anniversary.  We had a fantastic meal in the restaurant, the bar was buzzy and fun too. Treatments at the spa very good too, the hotel had a relaxed feel with lots of separate areas to sit. Excellent location close to shops/bars so no need to use tube. Would recommend staying there.",4,2015,12,01
123,Anniversary night in London,The Marylebone is a superb hotel in a fantastic location.  From the welcome from the staff at front desk to the lovely room and great breakfast.  The Marylebone is definitely a must for a stay in London!,5,2015,11,30
123,Great stay amongst the hustle and bustle of London,"We visited 26th to 28th November 2015.  Parking is not far away in an NCP carpark, walk through the other side of the carpark near the exit barriers and that puts you on Welbeck street.  

You can either book in advance for cheaper prices or the hotel will give a voucher for 15% off the rate if you haven't pre-booked.  The pre-booked rate was equivalent to that with 15% off, so decided to book to guarantee space in the car park.

5 minute walk to Oxford Street and extremely close to Marylebone high street where there is a small Tesco and Waitrose to stock up on snacks as well as nice restaurants.

On arrival we received a very warm welcome from a great concierge/doorman, can't remember his name but he was american/canadian?  

Again a lovely welcome from the lady at reception.  Felt as though we were at home straightaway.

We arrived earlier than the advertised check in time.  We were advised that we could either wait for room to be prepared (we asked for twin beds) or we could drop our bags and the beds prepared whilst we were out.  We opted for the latter as planned to head out straightaway.

Lobby very nice with lots of nice furnishings.  And beautifully decorated for Christmas.

The room which was a superior twin was lovely and had enough room for 2 on 4th floor.  The bathroom was very small, but had a shower which was nice.  Coffee machine and tea with a kettle.  Also a nice wall mounted flat screen TV.

We returned in the evening, and disappointingly the bed hadn't been split into twin beds.  The staff were very apologetic.  When housekeeping manager arrived she noted that actually we were in a room where the bed couldn't be split.  Which meant we needed to change rooms.  Again very apologetic.

I spoke with the manager who kindly said she had upgraded us to a Deluxe room on the 5th floor with twin beds.  I went to look at the room to make sure was ok and that TV wasn't miles away from bed (as had read this in another review).  All was fine and the room was lovely. A concierge kindly brought up alternative room keys, we had already been let in by housekeeping.

Deluxe rooms are much larger, with a lovely TV.  Bathroom was larger, lovely heated floor, which really makes a difference.  And I don't think I have experienced heated floors in some of the expensive London hotels I have stayed in.

We settled down for bed and TV as was tired from the day, and some of the TV channels didn't work.  Cue another call to reception and a maintenance man arrived very promptly.  Went to check the main box, then returned to re-tune our TV.  All worked very well after that, but there was intermittent signal loss from time to time.  We just hoped it didn't cut out at the wrong time during a crucial moment in a  programme! 

Rooms had 330ml bottles of water and there was also aromatherapy associates amenities (personally drying for my skin) but very nice all the same.  Free wifi in room too I joined the loyalty club Doyle Collection &Discovery beforehand.

We were on 5th floor and there was some pavement works outside (sorry can't remember the name of the road) not too disturbing, but they started at 0800 Monday to Friday only.

Beds very comfortable, with a quilt. However pillows are soft, I didn't request extras but will do this for next time.  Overall excellent cleaning, I did notice a small stain on lampshade and curtains in our room.

A La carte breakfast was included in the room rate and was excellent.  The first morning the restaurant (pantry) was not as busy the service was excellent, efficient and everyone was very welcoming.  

The next morning (Saturday) the restaurant (pantry) was very busy, and again the service was excellent if not better than the first.

The A La carte includes all choices from continental buffet, juices, hams, cheeses, bread, croissants, cereals and also an option of having a cooked breakfast too.

I opted for cooked breakfast which was delicious. I also spotted one of my favourite american actors at breakfast too!

I didn't get a chance to sample the gym or swimming pool, will do this for my next visit.

I really didn't want to leave.  Although there is an express checkout option I had to queue to hand in the envelope.  Would be great if there was a box at reception?

All in all a great stay, the environment, staff were excellent.  I have marked the stay as overall very good due to the small hiccups.  

This is certainly a hotel which has capability to receive excellent review ratings.  So I hope I will be able to rate as excellent after my next visit which will be for New Year 2015.",4,2015,11,30
123,Best hotel I've been to,"I visited The Marylebone last weekend with my mum having booked online directly with the hotel taking advantage of their special advance rate. 
From the moment we pulled up outside in our cab we were not disappointed. We were greeted by a concierge and our bags were carried in for us whilst we were efficiently checked in. 
The staff made every effort throughout our stay to make sure we had everything we needed and our weekend went smoothly. The staff are first rate.
The general areas of the hotel are beautiful and there is a really classy feel without it being either stuffy or uncomfortably trendy. 
The room was great. Lovely large bed. Complimentary robes and slippers, high quality toiletries and a coffee machine which was a great touch. 
We ate brunch, dinner and breakfast in the hotel and every meal was delicious and good value for money. We were so impressed that we invited guests to join us for dinner in the hotel to make full use of the facilities.
The wines are delicious and the breakfast deserves special mention as it was so well cooked and the buffet food was better than any other hotel I have visited and I'm pretty fussy.
The location is great. £6 cab fare from Marylebone station and £12 to Her Majesties Theatre (traffic was light).
The reception staff and concierge were knowledgeable and helpful and the restaurant staff were attentive but not overbearing. 
The hotel was spotlessly clean throughout.
I have already recommended this hotel to friends and family and I can't wait to visit again myself.
Thank you The Marylebone! ",5,2015,11,29
123,Amazing as always,It's our 4th stay with you and it's been fantastic as usual. The lobby areas are lovely and make our trip very enjoyable. Location is fantastic and the staff are so wonderful to our children. Special thanks to Gunther who sorted is a fab room and Anna at the lobby bar who made our children feel at home. We will be back very soon! Wonderful! ,5,2015,11,28
123,4th Stay at this wonderful hotel,"This is our favourite area of London and we are frequent visitors. We were rather unsettled by recent events in Paris so we didn't leave the hotel at night, deciding to chill out in the lovely luxury suite and order room service which arrived very quickly indeed.  The best thing about this hotel is the staff. So helpful,  polite and friendly.  A special mention to Roddy who is a star! We hope to see you again soon Roddy!!
      ",5,2015,11,28
123,Excellent service,"Very nice to return 6 months after our last visit and be recognised and receive excellent service from Jack, who could not have been more helpful, at front of house and also Dimittrie. 
Nice quiet and clean rooms, reasonably priced considering the very convenient location.  
Nothing seemed to be too much trouble for any of the staff, very good attention to detail, air conditioning and heating worked very well and so nice to be addressed by name in a large hotel. 
Looking forward to our next visit in March. 
Richard and Nikki Ball. ",4,2015,11,27
123,Friendly staff,"You know your in a top quality hotel when you are only there for 1 night the staff in the front desk, door and restaurant all great you by your name. lovely food and a great location just added to the experience",5,2015,11,26
123,Relaxed stay,Great place in very pleasant neighborhood. Ambiance of hotel is super and nice bar and restaurant. Good access to centre of London and lots of places to visit nearby. Large cariety of rooms so check what you book and consider upgrade options. Can recommend!                                                  ,5,2015,11,25
123,"Superior room? You said ""superior"" room??","The Marylebone hotel is located in central London, recently refurbished. It offers plenty of nicely designed lounges. But when it comes to the so-called ""superior"" rooms, i.e. the best price offer, here comes the disaster. The room is so small (probably no more than 9-10 square meters) that the hotel was unable to provide a side-table on both sides of the bed ( obviously rather narrow by way of consequence...). Same tihng for the luggage rack which could not fit in. Needless to stay that the closet is in line and that the bath-room fits one person only at time. This type of rooms would be perfect if rent as rooms for single. Terribly insufficient even for a slim couple.....
If you choose this hotel for its location or its services and amenities, please, don't be fooled by the ""superior"" rooms and opt for a real ""superior "" room at a higher price. But I have no idea if there is value for money in this case. For the rest, lounges, services and breakfast are fine.",3,2015,11,25
123,Why stay anywhere else!,"just stayed for the 4th time at The Marleybone and looking forward to my 5th stay. On arrival the room was ready, beautifully clean and comfortably warm. The attention to detail is legendary, nibbles on the table, bottled water by the bedside, chocolates by the bed, after that its onl;y personal preferences, I would have liked a firmer pillow needed three but no trouble I got three, maybe a magnifing mirror would help- my wife left hers stuck to the bathroom mirror. Breakfast was good, i love the served grill, standard london hotel sausages but tasty, the food in the restaurant was again forst class, the bar is very cosy, music was a little too loud for me and I miss the Friday night singer but no moans, to speak of.",5,2015,11,23
123,Looked fiarley good but poorly run,"Staff were delivering a script not speaking to a person, so they were nonsensical and inefficient, they were more concerned with completing their own forms than looking at me.  Porter 'looking after' the bags tried to give me someone else's as well so he was hardly looking after things!  Room was cluttered with furniture, not a cosy place to dwell.  Television was perfectly positioned if you stand up to watch TV.  Light switch by the door does nothing, lamps are easiest to turn off at the power point.  Shower was warm not hot and the the whole bathroom was totally setup for one person (one towel hook, place for one wash bag etc) not two.  The lifts would take you up even if you pressed the down call button.  Delivering a newspaper to your room is beyond this hotel.  At breakfast I was greeted by one clipboard then passed to another clipboard whilst your staff were busy with each other through us.
I'm not sure they noticed me check out.  ",2,2015,11,23
123,"Super friendly and helpful staff, great common spaces and location","We stayed at The Marylebone Hotel for 5 nights in early November, and we're so glad we picked it.   Not only was it in a great location -- walkable from both Bond Street and Oxford Circus tube stops, and to all the great shops and restaurants of Mayfair, Marlyebone and Soho -- but the staff is unbelievable friendly and helpful.  The restaurant and bar at the hotel are nice to have, as are many comfortable spaces in the lobby.  The gym and pool are very rare for European hotels.  The only slight negative was that the rooms were small -- not necessarily smaller than the average for a European hotel, but definitely small.  Since we spent very little time in our room, it didn't matter to us.   Would absolutely stay there again.",5,2015,11,22
123,Perfect Location,"Nice hotel, friendly staff, the location is perfect in a quiet street, very close to many good restaurants, shops and oxford street, it really can’t get better than that in terms of location. The room I chose was very tiny but that was the option I chose my friend’s room was specious, the bed is very comfortable, the gym and spa looked grate just didn’t get the chance to use them.",4,2015,11,22
123,Really helpful service,"We were impressed by the standard of service at the Marylebone Hotel from the moment we got there.  The sun wasn't even yet up when we arrived off a long-haul flight with our baby.  We had submitted a request for early check-in in advance, but didn't fancy our chances so very early in the day.  We were thrilled to be given a room immediately (a temporary one until ours was ready after lunch).  Also, they considerately gave us a teddy bear and some bathing products for the little one.  Aside from service, we found the location to be excellent.  Would definitely stay here again.",4,2015,11,21
123,"""A London Hotel With Supreme Customer Service""",I recently came to the Marylebone with my family to celebrate my 65th birthday. The location was perfect and the customer service outstanding especially in ensuring that our vacation was special! The hotel staff  went that extra step to ensure our comfort providing any needed help in getting around in London. I would like to specifically mention Jack of the Front Door staff for his attentiveness and welcoming spirit. In sum he helped make our trip more enjoyable and memorable. We'll be back!,5,2015,11,20
123,Recent visit,"I have stayed at the Marylebone at least five times.   I was surprised that there wasn't a telephone next to the bed in my room.  I would definitely request a room with a separate shower for my next visit.   I am 73 years old and found getting out of the tub/shower a daunting challenge. 
",4,2015,11,20
123,This is the Best Place to Stay - Excellent Service - Beautiful Hotel,"I have just stayed at The Marylebone Hotel and had an incredible stay. I can't say enough about this magical hotel and its wonderful staff. I have traveled extensively and have been a guest at the best places around the world. This is by far one of my favorite hotels, as it is spotless, beautiful, hip, and has an exceptional staff. This hotel is perfectly situated, walking distance from Selfridges, Oxford Street and anywhere else you need to go.  If you are like me and like to be in the action then this is the perfect choice for you.

On to the staff... They are incredible!  Everyone from the bell hop to room service is outstanding and friendly.  I would like to mention that Gunther Schildwachter what above and beyond to make my stay exceptional.  His warm smile, fantastic service and ability to help me navigate London was extremely helpful.  Its people like him that will make me want to come back and be a guest at this hotel.  I highly encourage you to find him and say hello if you need anything.

Additionally, Wei Chun Lee- Harris. is also very helpful and was a wealth of knowledge on all things related to London.  He was always there to help assist on things to see, places to eat and general information.  He made my stay excellent and is also a reason I would like to come back for a visit.  Exceptional staff!

Also, Rebecca the front desk manager provided excellent customer service.  She made sure everything ran on time, rooms were excellent and that we received everything we wanted.  Another great addition to the hotel.  Staff again, excellent.

The gym is very modern and has exceptional workout machines, for all you fitness buffs.

Safe travels and enjoy your stay!",5,2015,11,20
123,Fantastic hotel - great gym - great staff,Had a brilliant time.  Lovely place.  Riyas was very welcoming to my wife and baby boy.  The french girl on reception was very nice as well. So was the porter who shared his uber/halo recommendations. We had a nice clean quiet room and we used the gym every day which was great.  We had drinks and food twice in the hotel and the quality was excellent.  Very pleased and will be back.,5,2015,11,19
123,London's Gem of a Hotel,"I have been staying at the Marylebone as a regular visitor and have just clocked up my 20th stay this year. As an international business traveller and as my families favourite London abode, i thought it good timing to write a review.
The Marylebone is a very friendly, warm well run hotel. Excellent accommodation and attention to detail.
The rooms are very well planned, very comfortable and clean. All the guest areas have been refurbished to a very high standard and have been designed to entertain, relax and or do business.
The restaurant and bar gives a good and quality choice of menu.
I call the marylebone, Londons gem of a hotel not only because of its high standards of guest service and comfort, but above all its staff team are well trained and supported, this is evident as the international team are all long time employees.
I could and should mention the whole team by name for excellent service but there are too many. Gunther is however super efficient on the main desk",5,2015,11,19
123,Wonderful little boutique hotel,"I spent only one night in the Marylebone Hotel after a business trip and I went shopping :). Perfect location for both business and pleasure, I have to say. The location is calm and you have direct access to the shopping streets and city centre.
The rooms are very nicely decorated, I believe from the owner herself, and the whole hotel has a very personal touch. I liked the bathroom very much!
As many English hotels, the rooms are quite small.
The staff was very friendly and helpful.

Only one thing which holds me back a bit, otherwise I would have given 5 stars; the breakfast is great but there were extra costs for some dishes and also for the breakfast.As the hotel is quite pricey, I would expect this to be included. And you have to wait to get a table, especially on fully booked weekends. 
I can recommend this hotel very much and it will certainly give that extra luxury touch for your shopping trip!",4,2015,11,19
123,Excellent stay,"Stayed in The Marylebone Hotel on a weekend trip to London. The location is perfect, walking distance to shops and restaurants. rooms are spacious and the staff are great. A big thank you to Brendan for looking after us. Cant wait to return in the near future!
",5,2015,11,18
123,Don't stay anywhere else!,"This was our third visit to this wonderful hotel.  Extremely conveniently placed in Marylebone Village, five minutes walk to Oxford Street and Bond Street Tube Station, two minutes from Marylebone Lane, with an abundance of cafes, restaurants, boutiques and supermarkets to hand.  The hotel is perfect.  From the courteous and smiling bellboys to the polite and efficient housekeeping staff, the whole stay is perfect.  The rooms are well-equipped, the lobby is spacious with numerous sitting areas; everything runs smoothly and quietly, and there is always someone available to answer your every question.  I shall continue to recommend this hotel to friends and family, one should never really stay anywhere else!",5,2015,11,17
123,Amazing Afternoon Tea," I  have to say the afternoon tea was the best I have ever been too, the staff were just amazing, so attentive and helpful from the moment we walked in.
 
The explanation of the teas and cakes was an excellent touch, great decor and ambiance and I will definitely recommend it.
 
There was no shortage of food and they even gave us a doggy bag, I could not fault the food or service it was absolutely amazing",5,2015,11,16
123,What a stay!,"We booked this room through trip advisor (didn't know that was an option!) The Marylebone is in a perfect location for a London visit. It is a 5 min stroll from Bond street station which means it is also 5 mins from Oxford street, 10 mins from Regent street and 15 mins from Liecester Square... all on foot!!! Happy days.
We came here for the weekend for our anniversary. We wanted something special and this place ticks all the boxes. Although we arrived just before midday and checkin is at 2pm, the concierge took our luggage for us and checked us in so we could go to the V+A and then go straight to our room when we got back. Smiles aplenty, we could not have been treated any better. Having filled out the paperwork, we were offered a hot towel to refresh ourselves and some water to take on the journey to the Museum... very nice touch.
On our return, the room was immaculate and surprise surprise, a bottle of champagne chilling on the table for us on our anniversary.... what a considerate and totally unexpected touch! We checked out the room (as you do) the chairs were very comfortable and stylish, the bed even more so. The linen I think was spun from clouds it was so soft (and we have 800 thread Egyptian cotton linen on our bed at home)
We went down to the pool and sauna which was wonderful. Spent a very relaxing hour unwinding and working out all the tension from the sore feet.
Although we didn't use it, we went through the gym which is huge and superbly equipped and again the staff were amazing.
After eating out, we had a fabulous nights sleep, the air conditioning was quiet and efficient and there was no noise from the hotel at all (I sleep very lightly and the Hotel was very busy)
Tea and coffee in the room was great.. it took a few minutes to work out the coffee maker in the morning, but lovely...
Breakfast was an absolute smorgasbord... every taste fully catered for from the juicerey, to the fresh fruit to the cereals and cooked breakfast options, no-one was left wanting... oh, did I mention the staff??? Attentive without being overbearing. Amazingly, despite the room being packed, we waited less than 5 minutes from order to receiving our full English breakfast... cooked to perfection, which is not easy with poached eggs in my experience.
Sadly, one night was all we could do this time around.
Credit to everyone at the Marylebone, the people there are without doubt the greatest asset.
Will we return? just try to stop us!",5,2015,11,16
123,Super excellent hotel in London!,"Over the years, I have stayed in many hotels in London, and I have now converged to the Marylebone Hotel (47 Welbeck Street) that I think is overall the best (in terms of service, amenities, location, and value).

The location is ideal ... in a mini-French district in London, surrounded by good restaurants, cafes, and bistros.  Walkable to the Mayfair area, and very close to excellent shopping (Daunt Bookstore, Selfridges, etc.). Most places that you will want to go to are walkable, but the tube stations are nearby, and cabs are easy to find.

The hotel itself is top-notch. The rooms are bigger than most hotels, and the gym is first-rate. The business center is free, as opposed to hotels that try to gauge you for use of a desktop computer with internet.  

Best of all is the super excellent service by the staff.  The past time that I stayed there (which was in October 2015), I was greeted by Aurore who was polite, genuine, and helpful. The Marylebone does not have pretentiousness or stuffiness and is not snobby. It is a very fine hotel. I think that the staff make a very positive difference at this hotel.

I highly recommend this hotel. It is a high-end hotel, but the value is very good (it is much better than hotels in London that have a higher room price).",5,2015,11,16
123,Great value!,"The service is top notch!  Really nice and helpful staff. Rooms are not cheap and are small but the area is quiet and has terrific restaurants. One of the best health clubs in London. A great breakfast. Walking distance to Mayfair, Hyde Park and all central London locations. Close to Regents Park. Highly recommend it!",4,2015,11,15
123,"Great hotel, wonderful location, brilliant staff!","Apart from having a rather small room and tiny bathroom, we really haven't got a single complaint. The location, the staff, the customer service were excellent. Gorgeous toiletries, very comfy bed, clean, tidy and a cracking breakfast to top it all off. Would most definitely return and recommend.",5,2015,11,15
123,Home From Home,"Excellent location, close to many great restaurants in Marylebone and near the famous shopping area of Oxford Street and Regent Street, friendly/helpful staff and great facilities including a gym and pool. 

I have stayed here many times over the past few years - staff are always very welcoming - Gunther always very professional and attentive to needs/requirements.",4,2015,11,15

It was a great location, very welcoming and hospitable staff,clean hotel and a good breakfast
The breakfast was reasonably good, however would like a few more items
Great

123,Honeymoon hotel,"We stayed here on our honeymoon and had a wonderful time. The room was nice and they turned it down nightly.  They left a little surprise for our honeymoon on the first night.  The staff was super nice and helpful. The pool and gym are really nice which come with your reservation.  Also, money buffet was really nice.  Only few blocks from oxford street where tons of shopping.",5,2015,11,14
123,West end one night stay,"Stayed at this hotel when at a conference in the West End. Very striking retro 1960s exterior. Hotel lobby and common areas - bar, seating areas, restaurant all very well appointed. Was upgraded to a larger room which was great. Well stocked minibar (which I did not use). The room was very comfortable, including the bed. Bathroom - I was expecting a rainfall shower and a bit more shower pressure at this end of the market. Bath panel was coming loose slightly in a corner with warping woodwork which I was surprised to see at this type of establishment. Very stylish marble tiles in bathroom, fine Aromatherapy Associates lotions and potions a nice touch. A very good night's sleep. Breakfast was ok. Fair choices and clearly good quality items but not the variety I have had at other 5 star establishments. Extra charge for hot breakfast, which seems fairly standard in London. All staff were very polite and professional. Overall a very good stay but I can't say I was 'blown away' taking into account this is rated as a top urban boutique hotel in London. ",4,2015,11,14
123,"Very attentive staff, like being feeling at home !!","At reception I was received by Gunther, who took care of my checkin in a minute! At breakfast, I was seated to my table immediately. I am a frequent traveler to London and must point out the pristine professional staff who make the difference! 

If only more hotels trained their staff as well as the Marylebone crew! Congratulations.

Plus the location is also just perfect, being only a few blocks behind busy Oxford Street the ideal place to go for those last minute gifts.",5,2015,11,14
123,Great Customer Service,"I would like to say that I am extremely impressed with the service I received here.  Upon arrival, the night manager and  receptionist was greeted us most positively. Along with this, the staff ensured that all our needs where met as it was a special occasion. I very much appreciate this as the booking was made very late, and our requests where met on time.

The breakfast and spa where most enjoyable and above all I would like give praise to Gunther - the afternoon receptionist, who assisted us throughout our stay, and made a lasting impression with his great hospitality. 

Overall, I would like to say a many thanks, and I will certainly come back to stay at this hotel.",5,2015,11,14
123,Small Town feel in the Centre of London,"From arrival through to departure doors were opened for me. 

Every request was greeted as an opportunity to offer personalised customer service. I don't think their team use the word no. Very refreshing.

The breakfast room is one of the nicest hotel breakfast dining experiences that I remember in London. You would choose this as a breakfast destination, even if you weren't staying in the hotel.

Very quiet acoustics & a great night's sleep.

 I look forward to my next night over stay.",4,2015,11,13
123,Honeymoon in London,"For our honeymoon, my wife chose London as our destination.  Though I've never been - my wife had been to London about 8 years ago so she selected where we were going to stay.

Location was very good.  Off the major street so very quiet - though within easy walking distance to some of the major shopping streets.  

Unlike our other trips abroad, we stayed at the same hotel our entire trip (10 days) but with the easy access to shopping, restaurants and transportation we never felt bored or lacking of places to see/visit.  

Hotel was very clean and the staff was exceptionally friendly. We were never disappointed with the on site restaurant or bar.   

For those that want a gym - the hotel has one. The gym also serves non-hotel clients, so it might be crowded at peak times (it wasn't during our stay - but we went on non-peak times) Facility was a bit small, but multi-levels means a bit more space. There is also a indoor pool with sauna on site.

Overall a very pleasant stay with exceptional service!",5,2015,11,12
123,Excellent staff and welcome ,"Greeted by friendly staff on arrival,  and all the staff I encountered were excellent and friendly too - somewhat unusual in my experience in London. Room was a bit small, despite being a 'superior double'
Restaurant excellent too, if a bit pricey. ",4,2015,11,11
123,Best hotel in London,"I have stayed in The Marylebone Hotel many times and cosider it as one of the best hotels in London with a great location. Lovely rooms and excellent breakfast buffet. Staff is usually great with some exceptions. Last time we visited we had some small complains at the reception, but thanks to Gunther who was willing to help as always, it all ended perfect. Must say that he is one of the best at the reception.",5,2015,11,11
123,"Fantastic, family friendly hotel","Our Irish/Swedish family stayed here for 4 nights at the end of October. We all had a great time and were very well taken care of during our stay. A special ""thank you"" to Roderick Mc Grath and Piotr Piotrowski. This hotel is very comfortable, clean & quiet. There are several small lounge area's to relax in after a busy day shopping and sightseeing. The continental breakfast buffet was very good and the ""gluten free"" toast much appreciated. We will definitely recommend this hotel to our friends & family and look forward to returning in the near future.",4,2015,11,11
123,Fully recommended ,"I have stayed at the Marylebone already several times for work and can say that is one of the best hotels that I know in London. Very nice rooms and excellent breakfast buffet. Also special mention to the staff and to Gunther particularly, always willing to help when needed.",5,2015,11,10
123,A little gem close to Westminster and the heart of the West End!,"I very rarely write a review on things but my fiancee and I enjoyed such good service at this lovely hotel that I felt compelled to write a review - it was well deserved!

My fiancee and I stayed at the Marylebone last Saturday night. During check-in the staff found out that we were there for my birthday and immediately offered a cocktail each on the house! Everyone was so friendly and welcoming we had high hopes from the off and we weren't disappointed!

After being shown to our room we went to the bar to enjoy our cocktail before heading off to the theatre. The bar is lovely, comfortable fresh and airy and above all very well stocked with a great choice of drinks! The freeze dried fruits makes a lovely display and a novel addition to drinks!

When we wanted to head off to the theatre, one of the concierge/reception staff even walked right up to the end of the road to hail us a taxi - talking about going the extra mile!

When we returned later in the evening, we again visited the bar and both being whiskey drinkers fancied trying a couple of of the more exclusive whiskeys on the top shelf! After narrowing our choice down, one of the waiters even brought the bottles of the two whiskeys we had chosen to our table for us to make our final decision! We had both!

Our room was also very nice. The bed was comfortable and the room was a reasonable size and functional. The bathroom was lovely and very clean! The mini bar is the best I have ever seen! The room was very quiet - no noise pollution from other guests or outside - we had a great nights sleep!

Breakfast was exceptional. I think it was fair to say we enjoyed more than we should have done but the food was lovely, plentiful, fresh and the staff were all very pleasant and attentive when required! I also noted that there were plenty of staff adding to smooth efficiency of the operation!

All-in-all we would both highly recommend this hotel! We had an extremely pleasant over-night stay in wonderful surroundings, taken care of by happy and caring staff! If ever we look to stay overnight in London this is the first hotel we will check!",5,2015,11,10
123,Tea and cake on a rainy afternoon,"We stumbled upon the Marylebone on a drizzly day, looking for somewhere to escape the rain with a warming cup of tea. We were greeted by Rahim at concierge, who was very kind and helpful and found us a lovely sofa to relax on. He quickly organised tea and a selection of cakes for us, and was incredibly attentive and polite throughout the afternoon, making sure our every need was met. A delightful afternoon.",5,2015,11,09
123,Excellent tea,I recently visited London and had tea at the Marylebone. It was a wonderful experience shared with family which I would love to repeat.  Special thanks to head concierge Rahim who made sure we were very well looked after.  Thank you for a lovely experience.,5,2015,11,09
123,Bar & Resturant,"My partner and I had a lovely evening dinner, along with a selection of amazing cocktails and wonderful staff. We got greeted with a friendly smile and complementary glass of Champaign from the bar as we got comfortable at our table. The service from the staff was great, our waiter Met was extremely kind, genuine and helpful with recommending dishes and attending to our needs. The king prawns are amazing, a must try!",5,2015,11,09
123,Excellent,"Very good hotel in a great place. The team and services are very professional. They pay a real attention to make your stay comfortable. Services, people, great breakfast, what to say : objectives reach and absolutely a very good place where to stay ",5,2015,11,08
123,Dinner,"I visited the bar with my partner. The was exquisite! Carefully presented too! I found the service even better! Our waiter 'Meti' was attentive, friendly and very helpful in recommending dishes. Great service! I would go back again! 
A big Thank-you to the team!",5,2015,11,08
123,Really Nice Hotel Ideally Situated. ,"I booked this for my 8th Wedding Anniversary and it didn't disappoint. We arrived early so our room wasn't ready but it didn't matter as we left our bags at reception and went out to see London. The hotel is a very short walk from Oxford Street so it's ideally placed if that's where you want to be. We returned to the hotel at about 5pm and our key was waiting for us at reception, the room was quite spacious but the bed was only a double, there is room for a bigger bed. Our bags were in the room but my suit bag had just been placed on the floor rather than hung up, this isn't something that would have bothered me before but other hotels have hung it up previously. For our anniversary Room Service then sent up a complimentary bottle of champagne and fruit basket, a really nice gesture that was beyond anything other hotels had done in the past. The bed was a bit uncomfortable but not so bad it ruined your sleep and the rooms are very quiet meaning you will have an undisturbed night. My only major complaint is Express Checkout, we filled out the form but still had to wait in a queue to hand it in at reception as there was no box to put it in as you leave. All in this is a lovely hotel in a ideal place for visiting London. ",5,2015,11,08
123,Visit of WTM  London,"Nice hotel with very good and helpful staff, specially the Gunther! 
Clean and comfortable room, but with small closet.
I consider that you should renovate the buffet of the main restaurant, make one new, modern, convenient with better presence of all the items.
Thank you.",4,2015,11,07
123,I keep coming back,"I love this hotel and I've been back a number of times. This time I had to extend my stay because of a family crisis and I found myself in the only room available,  a large and very expensive ""studio"" room. It was bigger, but that was about it. The ""king-size"" bed was two twin beds pushed together but there was no foam pad on top, so there was an uncomfortable crevice in the middle.
The hotel is modern and comfortable, close to the tube (Bond Street station or Baker Street), and buses. It's a few steps from the stylish but friendly neighborhood of Marylebone High Street (shops, restaurants) and the world-famous Wallace Collection (think Rembrandts, Van Dycks, ancient armor, French furniture). It has a nice restaurant and pleasant lounge rooms on the main floor where you can have coffee, tea, or drinks. Room service is good and efficient..
Two things make this hotel special for me: the pool (large, not chlorinated, usually uncrowded) and the helpful and friendly  front-desk staff. Mr. Long was extraordinarily helpful when I had to extend my stay and change airline reservations.",5,2015,11,07
123,An amazing hotel,"Location is great very close to oxford street .
In the area there are great restaurants (James st.)
The gym is excellent and so is the swimming pool .
The buffet breakfast was very rich and tasty and made of high quality products.
The service is in high standards.",5,2015,11,07
123,Lovely Hotel,"I must say this would be one of the best hotels that I have stayed in, the facilities are great and there is nothing that the staff will not do for you. It is situated close to Oxford Street so is very close to the tube, shopping SOHO/West end and many great restaurant's.",5,2015,11,07
123,Good hotel in a very convenient location,"I am a regular here.  Hotel is not huge but rooms are nice.  Some bathrooms would benefit from sliding doors as they can be quite small.
Staff are polite and helpful - especially Gunther, Sinead, and Aurore (an Eva Green lookalike).",5,2015,11,06
123,Weekend Shopping,"We have just got back after a nice break at the Marylebone, we have been to this hotel many times and so much like this hotel, we visit it about four or five times a year, fantastic position for shops and for everything else.
It's not in noisy area, in fact it's perfect and peaceful.
Many thanks to Gunther he's our star, he recognises us every time we arrive and makes sure we have a lovely room for us, he recommends us a lovely restaurant every time too.
He's the best. !!!!!

Hotel manger,  you must give Gunther promotion??

We had a great time this weekend, after we checked out and done a bit more shopping, we went back to the hotel bar had a drink and decided to stay for one more night??
Many thanks again Gunther.  
Mark and Angelika. ",5,2015,11,04
123,"10/23-26, 2015","The hotel facilities were very nice, however many guest rooms were quite small. The staff was very helpful in providing advice to navigate the local transportation. Jack, the doorman, was extraordinarily helpful, and went above and beyond expectations on multiple occasions during our stay. He was pleasant, resourceful and exceptionally responsive to all our requests. ",4,2015,11,03
123,We will return........,Stayed for 2 nights in a pleasant room that met all our requirements. The hotel is well situated just north of Oxford Street in a quiet part of Marylebone. We were impressed with the friendliness and professionalism of the staff we met (especially Emma and Long at reception) We certainly intend to stay here again.,5,2015,11,03
123,Service from Gunther,"Arrived to this hotel after 6 hours of airport delays and immediately Gunther started to make things better.  Good service can be hard to find, and no matter what I needed, Gunther went above and beyond to make sure my stay was stress free and enjoyable.  I look forward to coming back here next week!",4,2015,11,02
123,Great hotel!!,"The hotel is very beautiful and worming, the service from the staff was outstanding!! 
The location of the hotel is just minutes from Oxford street and from bond underground. The breakfast is very good. Very recommended!!
The hotel street is very quite, and by walking five minutes you can get to an area cold Christofer, a very nice area with a lot of restaurants, the hotel staff recommend us to go there and they knew what they were saying!",5,2015,11,02
123,A fantastic hotel located in the heart of London.,"The hotel is located very central, with only a few minutes walk to Bond street underground and Oxford street. Although it's close to the shopping street, it's never noisy, so you will get a good sleep at the night. The staff is very profesional and friendly and the service is superb. The room is nice and cozy, and the housekeeping seems to be done at least twice a day. The breakfast is excellent, don't miss to order the pancake with pier from the menu. The bar has a nice atmosphere, and the drinks are good.",5,2015,10,31
123,Beautiful hotel,"this is a beautiful and luxurious hotel that is welcoming, cosy and comfortable. We really appreciated the stylish interior design of the whole hotel as we are in the arts. The staff are all extremely friendly as well. It is so close to Oxford Circus too which is amazing!",5,2015,10,31
123,"""Wonderful hotel"""," We have  stayed in the Marylebone hotel many times.
Lovely hotel,great location, a few min  walk to Oxford st. and city centre.Good location for shoping and  restaurants.
 The staff are friendly and the service excellent. Lots of variety at breakfast and 
Many thanks to Gunther  on reception for a great room and  and recomendations to resturants he is si helpful everytime we go to this hotel.
 We absolutely love this hotel and we would definitely recommend to stay there.",5,2015,10,31
123,The staff was outstanding,We were greeted warmly and given detailed information on the sites and local travel. One individual stood out on our two week trip to numerous properties.  Jack gave us the local color and very solid recommendations for our daily excursions. He was a hidden gem.   Thank you Jack !,5,2015,10,30
123,Great hotel,"This is are 3rd stay at the hotel. The location is excellent ice neighborhood , a few min walk to Oxford st. And the Bond tube. The hotel is cozy and more like a boutique 4 star hotel.The staff is great , breakfast excellent and rooms nice size- junior suite as well as bathroom , even though not new in great condition and nice decor . The only down side is the bathtub it self - a bit small and only a shower head . Tea and coffee in room and in lobby in the early morning until breakfast starts.",5,2015,10,30
123,Nice hotel - A tad pricey for what you get though,"We stayed for 1 night in a suite room.....the decor was 'nice' but not as nice as some hotels I've stayed in for an equal price....a tad outdated, the TV was at the far end of the room so hard to see (and I was conscious of turning up the volume so not to disturb our neighbours) 

The bathroom was well stocked and clean, although they have adopted the 'European Style' bath that is VERY shallow and not built for 6ft 2"" chaps such as myself.  The shower was outdated and wasn't a power-shower and was fixed.....so again I had to adopt the 'tall chap' stance of stooping down to get my hair wet!

Not worth the £450 odd paid and especially as you don't get breakfast included!

Nice hotel, but there are nicer, cheaper and better value for money hotels to be had out there.",3,2015,10,30
123,Great reception from Gunther,"Stayed at the hotel was greeted with a smile and a welcome back from Gunther and quickly checked in to an excellent room.  Great stay as usual with good food and service at 108.  Checked out this morning, Antje just smiles all the time and makes you want to stay longer! Thanks to the staff, they are the heart of this place.",5,2015,10,28
123,Reasonable ,"I stayed at this hotel twice in one week. The staff are friendly and the hotel is situated in a quiet area of central London. The hotel is close to many central London tourist attractions.

The price for a room at the hotel is fair, the first room I had was clean and quiet. The second room I was allocated on my return was extremely small, so small that when I opened the room door, the door hit the only chair in the room. I entered the room and immediately left. The room was so small it was claustrophobic. 

The reception was able to give me another room and they were polite and friendly. I have stayed at this hotel for many years and on one stay I was there for 3 months but due to this experience I would be wary of returning to stay at this hotel.",3,2015,10,28
123,All Good,"There was only one thing that stopped this being 5 star and that was the size of my room.  It would have been incredibly cramped for a couple but I was on my own.  The silence outside at night made up for that.  Perfect for the Wigmore Hall.  Very comfortable.  I had an early flight and a lovely man brought me the best ever continental breakfast at 5.00 am.

The guys at the door were also very helpful when my taxi -- booked the night before with Radio Cabs, take note-- didn't turn up.  That's another story.  All they do these days is say they can't find a driver and do I want them to keep looking?  No, not ever again.  I watched others jump into their Uber cars.

But the doormen got me their own taxi.  This is a beautiful hotel with caring staff if you can afford it.  I was given it as a treat.",4,2015,10,27
123,Good for shopping,"I was delighted that this hotel was only 5 minutes from Oxford Street yet it didn't have the hurried feeling of the city centre. 

I highly recommend the English afternoon tea after a long cold day out shopping!

Only stayed 3 nights but the staff greeted me as a regular.",5,2015,10,26
123,"Bells, whistles and marble!","A lovely hotel with an air of grandeur. Lots of marble, soft lighting and statement ornaments and artwork. I was mesmerised by the dragonfly piece by the downstairs wash rooms. 

The experience in the restaurant was a particularly pleasant experience, brought to life by our lively waiter Thomas who was the right side of attentive and passionate about the food he was serving. I had baby beets, the butter nut squash risotto and as recommended, the pineapple with lime sorbet. The Guinness bread was surprisingly flavoursome.

I hope the hotel recognises the value that this employee adds to the organisation.

Will definitely be returning.",5,2015,10,26
123,Great stay,"I stayed at The Marylebone hotel for the first time. Gunther got me a great room and was very helpful altogether. I would definitely come back! The hotel is very clean an has a lot of sitting areas on the ground floor, which is also great.",5,2015,10,26
123,Exceeds all expectations on a continuous basis!,"As someone who travels continuously for work I have the privilege of getting to stay in the Marylebone almost every month sometimes on a weekly basis. Even on the weeks I do not feel like travelling I get excited knowing I will be staying there. Having stayed in almost all categories of rooms they are all wonderful and offer everything you might need for a short or long term stay, they are comfortable and luxurious. The gym is fantastic and it is an added bonus to be able to attend the classes all of which are of a very high standard with fantastic trainers. The juice bar and restaurant never disappoint and breakfast is a wonderful treat.

But quite simply what makes The Marylebone so special is the staff - Roddy and his team look after you in every way possible it is like coming to a home away from home. I recently stayed for a personal visit to go wedding dress shopping and Roddy went above and beyond to make the weekend extremely special for my mum and I. From beautiful flowers in the room to surprises with handwritten notes almost each time we came back to the room it was a weekend neither of us will ever forget.

A home away from home in central london is very special and I cannot wait to return!",5,2015,10,26
123,my review,"very nice hotel and very professional staff.I enjoyed my stay everyone was friendly . I strongly recommend this hotel to people who wants to stay close to Oxford Street and Marble Arch, and Oxford Circus",5,2015,10,26
123,Overnight in London,This hotel is in an excellent position just behind Oxford Street and within easy walking distance of the theatre for our show and the restaurant we had booked. The reception staff were very helpful and our room was very comfortable if not a little compact. But taking into account London prices it was very reasonable and suited us perfectly.,4,2015,10,25
123,Brilliant hotel - Brillian Location,"The hotel is in a brilliant location for shopping/sightseeing. All the staff were friendly and very helpful, Catherine on reception greeted us with a warm & friendly smile and was also very helpful. The concierge staff were brilliant!  All staff were warm & friendly.  The room was big enough for the two of us, warm & clean.  No dislikes at all.
      ",5,2015,10,25
123,A Very Pleasant Stay,"We stayed at the Marylebone for the second time and will definitely come again. At check-in, Gunther found us a room very convenient to the gym and dining room.  Staff was consistently helpful and pleasant. Breakfast was relaxed and enjoyable.",5,2015,10,25
123,Great hotel and staff some quirky rooms,"This is a great location for a London visit with many good restaurants pubs and shops nearby  
The hotel public rooms are spacious and light with some interesting artwork...very cheeky in places
The rooms are as you would expect quite small and not all exactly as described. For example studio suites can have a walk in shower and a sofa or they can have neither. Best to see the room before accepting it is my guidance. We didn't and it took us 24 hrs to get it put right   Some rooms are by the service elevators then up stairs for example 766 and 763 and should be avoided. 
The more expensive rooms have views over Marylebone lane and are very comfortable. Thank you Brendan for sorting out our room for us 
The restaurant 108 is good for lunch and dinner but especially for breakfast. We were welcomed everyday by Villo who seems to be everywhere at once serving with a great big smile. 
The bar is one of the best in the area lovely big room with a great buzz about it - the small plate offer of three dishes for £14 is a steal (for London) again the staff help make the experience and Joanne ruled the roost in the bar. Thank you 
Overall we would certainly return but we would make sure we viewed the room before accepting - the front desk staff are very pleasant but seemed unable to make things happen without intervention so perhaps that is something to work on. 
Thank you to all the staff who made our stay quite special. 
",4,2015,10,24
123,"Great location, Terrible Service","I stayed at The Marylebone for two night on a business trip. The hotel is centrally located, just two blocks away from Oxford Street. The corridors are very narrow and the rooms small but well appointed and with good amenities. Service however was terrible. The free wifi in my room, which was located on the first floor, was intermittent and I could not use it 99% of the time. On the first night I came back to the hotel hungry, tried to call room service but no one answered the phone. Tried to find something in the mini-bar but it was locked despite the fact that upon check in they took my credit card details for incidentals such as using the mini-bar. I called reception to ask them to do something but after 5 minutes of ringing and no answer I gave up. The exhaust fan in the room was very noisy and I could not sleep at night. I was so tired, hungry and frustrated in the morning I called the reception and talked to the manager. They changed my room and the new room (on the 6th floor) was quiet and the Internet worked fine. I had a coffee in my room and left for my meeting. In the evening when I returned to the room, although the maid had been in the room the coffee cup had not been cleaned, the coffee capsules had not been replenished and the mini-bar was still locked!!!! Total lack of attention to detail! On the last morning, because i had an early departure (before their breakfast lounge was open) I requested a light continental breakfast in my room instead of the full on breakfast, they said that would be no trouble but at the check out they charged me extra for it!!! At 230 pound per night I would have expected a much better service than what I got.",2,2015,10,24
123,Business meeting,"My favourite hotel in London.   I have organised 2 business meetings here this year, the service and friendliness of the staff is fantastic.   They go above and beyond to make sure their guests are looked after, nothing is too much trouble.   I would highly recommend this hotel for business or pleasure.",5,2015,10,23
123,Home from home,Recently spent a super weekend at the Marylebone..staff were fantastic as usual..immediately recognised us and exuded warmth..room was great and breakfast fab...Marylebone has become such an exciting area to socialise and shop there is no reason to go elsewhere...a real destination within the city...just love it...can't wait to go back..,5,2015,10,23
123,Mayfair,"For me Mayfair is the best location to stay in London. The staff are extremely pleasant and the hotel is in easy walking distance to shops, restaurants and local pubs. For business or pleasure I will be using this hotel again.",5,2015,10,22
123,My new home from home,"I spent three years as a regular guest in The Marleybone's sister hotel The Kensington.
Earlier in the year our new office opened in Fitzrovia and it meant a change to that side of town. 
As sad as I was to leave the Kensington the fact that I was moving back to an old favourite made it more palatable.

I used to frequent the Marleybone when it was the Clifton Ford Hotel.
Since then it has gone through a transformation to a much more more luxurious property while still maintaining the same level of personal attention and service.

The lobby is very large but it's layout means it remains intimate and provides great places to have a meeting or a quiet conversation. Like all hotels in the chain free wifi throughout. 

Rooms are tastefully decorated with a range of sizes from the expected big city box rooms to expansive suites. Great to have a Nespresso machine in each room instead of the dreaded powdered coffee sachets!
Bathrooms are for the most part spacious and well appointed with some exceptions where it's a manoeuvre to get in and out. 

Food and beverage can be ordered in the lobby area or the calm and serene room off it that used to house the bar in the hotel's previous life.
Or slip down to the main bar that can also be accessed from the street giving it a livelier buzz than most hotel establishments.
The bar menu is nice and has a range of small bites as well as dinner sized dishes.
If you're into cocktails look no further than Ruben who mixes up great concoctions to order.

The gym is an added bonus in this hotel and houses a pool. It seems to be run by a third party and while usually busy has a fine array of equipment and free weights etc.

Front of house staff are very attentive, without being intrusive, and always on hand to help. It's great to see some people still here from when I was a guest many years ago - Antje in particular. And also new faces with familiar accents such as Brendan who was recently a great help with a Rugby World Cup related query. 
I stayed for leisure recently with my wife who was particularly grateful to a chap called Gunther for going the extra yard to make her stay special. it was my wife's first stay and firmly got the seal of approval for a family visit.

Everyone's opinion differs on what is quality and value so reviews are by nature personal opinions. And sometimes properties do have off days which can be reflected in guest experiences. 
However across the board with the three London Doyle Hotels my experiences over the years have consistently been excellent which makes the chore of being away from home much easier to bear.",5,2015,10,21
123,Fantastic service and committed staff,"I have stayed in the Marylebone well over a dozen times. On not every occasion is every little thing perfect, but the staff makes up for those hiccups. In particular, the latest rules indicate that even if you have the highest level of status, there is no guarantee you will get an upgrade. In fact, you are most likely not to get one. It is often necessary as the rooms are not cheap and the lower level rooms are small. Nonetheless, Gunther, one of the front desk staff, has checked me in on numerous occasions and, recognising the value of my business, he has gone out of his way to make my stay comfortable and top notch, even amidst policy changes that, in truth, become annoying for frequent guests. He cannot create capacity for upgrades when there isn't one, but he can smooth out the rough spots related to any elements of one's stay and I appreciate that even more than the upgrades.",5,2015,10,21
123,Great Location,"A five night stay in a great location.  The rooms are smaller than the standard for most american hotels but very comfortable. The staff is attentive, especially Kashif who gave us wonderful suggestions of places to eat. The gym is a great amenity to keep from gaining with all the great food. 108 Brasserie  is a little pricey however the meal was wonderful.  Overall a great hotel and I would definitely rebook if I plan another trip to London.",4,2015,10,20
123,Weekend Break,"Nine of us (eight and a little one) stayed at the Marylebone Hotel for a weekend stay Friday-Monday. It's in a nice area, close to plenty of shops and restaurants. 

As soon as you walk into the hotel it is clear you're in a high-class place. The layout is modern and the porters are quick to assist. The first porter we saw took our bags then brought a teddy bear out for the little one.  It's touches like these that make the difference. 

The wait for our room to be available was short, we were taken there by the porter who informed us of features and facilities in the rooms. 

The rooms are, as you'd expect for a London hotel, quite small. The bathrooms are tiny too. This wasn't a big issue though. The quality of the bathroom was great, all marbled out, with a multifunction shower head with settings for massage/jet/rain etc. 

The bed was comfortable enough, mattress was good and the pillows were soft.  Housekeeping was attentive and precise. 

We had a very small issue when my wife went to have our cards reset for the third night as we couldn't get in our room. She waited in the queue as the receptionist was talking to someone. He sorted our room cards out but when asked if everything was sorted with the rooms he snapped at her saying he was dealing with another customer. A bit strange really.. 

The only other problem was bills coming through the door for newspapers that we hadn't ordered and breakfast that was included in the stay. 

The breakfast was nice, but the poached eggs were a bit undercooked so the egg whites were a bit on the ""snotty"" side. 

In conclusion we had a nice stay, which you would expect for the price. It is in a very convenient location and we don't regret visiting the Marylebone Hotel. ",4,2015,10,20
123,"Lovely hotel with comfortable rooms, great location","Had a three night stay and was very pleased with this little gem of a hotel. The room was spacious, bright and spotless. Free internet, free Nespresso, a small fridge and lots of big fluffy towels.  In the evening cookies and chocolates and fresh bottles of water were delivered when the maid turned down the bed. The bed was a little too soft for my liking, but the linens were crisp and cool. Bathroom was very tiny, but it's London, so I could deal with it, (especially being from New York). At night the lobby was lit with candles and had a cool zen vibe.  The area surrounding the hotel had many restaurants, bars and services to choose from.  It felt like I was in a wonderful neighborhood at home instead of in the middle of a busy city. For extra convenience it was a nice 10 min walk to the tube and Oxford St. The staff were all very pleasant and accommodating. I will definitely return to this hotel again.",4,2015,10,19
123,Stressless,"Greeted by the fabulous Gunther on the front desk who took care of all restaurant arrangements.
Delightful boutique hotel. Displaying work from local artists.
Rooms modern, beds comfortable.
Hotel Is stylish, modern and funky.
Little hidden gem!",5,2015,10,19
123,stayed two nights as part of business cum leisure visit to London,"Overall very satisfactory. Excellent location. Service exceptional.
We used hotel provided taxi service from Heathrow which was very helpful.
Advice re local shops and restaurants was of great assistance.",5,2015,10,19
123,Marylebone Hotel,"Lovely Hotel near Oxford Street , Marylebone High St. has nice few places to eat as well. the hotel is very good, staff helpful but Be-ware the rooms are small, the bathroom is extremely small even in the so called superior room has about a 3 inch clearance between the toilet and the door !!! 
   ",4,2015,10,19
123,"A very relaxing 5 star service near great shopping areas, and good value","Our visit to the Marylebone hotel in W1 was a relaxing weekend stay at a very reasonable price, a good size delux room, excellent service, the 108 restaurant serves good food with a pleasant smile! A short taxi ride into the west end, or a short walk takes you into great shopping areas with lovely quaint restaurants. Try a visit!",5,2015,10,18
123,Charming Common Areas,"The Marylebone is not super small, but has a boutique feeling.   The hotels rooms are small with purple velvet chairs and bed covers.  Not my personal taste in decor.  The rooms are comfortable with all the features to be expected in this hotel category. 

The hotel special feature is the common areas.  For me they are the main reason to book the property again.  They are charming and full of character.  There are several seating areas with free coffee and tea, perfect for a conversation with a friend or for a break during a busy day. The hotel restaurants are excellent.  I would want to go back just for lunch or dinner.  The breakfast was also delicious and served in a very warm and colorful room. 

The service is very friendly and helpful.  

The exercise facilities are connected to a real gym and are wonderful. 

Location is lovely, near Regents Park, walking distance to Oxford Street shopping area and a 30 minute walk to the theatre area, Convent Garden. 

",4,2015,10,18
123,A comfortable one night stay,"I stayed in this very welcoming hotel for one night only last Saturday as I was in London to go to a Golden Wedding party.  I chose the hotel because it was near to the party venue and also, for old times sake, as I worked in Welbeck Street quite a few years ago.  I really liked the atmosphere in the hotel, the staff were lovely and welcoming and I had a quiet room as requested.  My room was very comfortable and fine for one person.  It might have been a little on the cosy side for two.  There was most things you might need, a very comfortable bed and good blackout curtains.  My only problem was with the duvet which was very heavy and the safe which would not lock.  The latter did not bother me but I did tell the front desk about it when I checked out.  I forgot to mention the duvet!   The breakfast menu was almost limitless and I wished I was staying longer in order to sample more.  One thing I particularly liked was the layout of the downstairs area which is a series of comfortable areas where you can meet friends and talk, or sit and read the paper in peace

I do not stay in London all that often but I would certainly stay here again",5,2015,10,17
123,Fabulous Marylebone Hotel,"This is a wonderful luxurious hotel, everything to the highest standard. This was our second visit.
Rooms very clean and very quiet, excellent staff in all departments- reception staff, concierges, restaurant and housekeeping. Thanks specially to Michal in the concierge dept, and Gunther on the front deskGreat breakfasts. Right by trendy Marylebone High St. Five minute walk to Oxford St and Bond St tube, or about 8 minutes to Baker St tube. They serve divine afternoon teas. Also has a great swimming pool which I used every day.",5,2015,10,17
123,The best hotel to stay in every way,"My sister and I have just spent a week here and it was amazing one of the best hotels I have stayed in throughout the world. The staff are  exceptional nothing is a problem and always done with a smile . Location perfect, very quiet rooms even with the window open, didn't use the air con. The beds were like sleeping on clouds, the food fantastic I only have the highest praise for this hotel and if ever I am back in London I will definitely be staying here. Thankyou everyone. Loved it.

123,Weekend break,"Amazing, Amazing, we had the pleasure of staying at this fantastic Hotel for a birthday treat. On arrival we were treated by doorman Jack like royalty, he was incredible, nothing was to much trouble. The Hotel is total luxury throughout. The quality of service in all aspects of the hotel were brilliant. We can't wait to return.  Fantastic many thanks",5,2015,10,14
123,Perfection!,"I recently visited London for the weekend and it was my 3rd time staying in the Marylebone hotel. Fantastic location, brilliant staff, excellent food and great facilities. Also used the gym for the first time and it was exceptional. Already looking forward to my next visit!",5,2015,10,14
123,A great Hotel in central London,The service here was excellent. The rooms were well appointed and the bed was super comfy. The rooms were quiet. The bathroom facilities were also very good and I would definitely choose to stay here again,4,2015,10,14
123,"great hotel, great service","We recently stayed twice within a 2 week period (once for 3 days, the second for 9 days) and cannot speak highly enough about the hotel.  The rooms are comfortable and the hotel is well located (it's close to the Bond St. tube with 2 subway lines).  The staff was very helpful, particularly Gunther and Antje at the front desk.  They worked hard to accommodate our special needs and made our stay there a pleasant one. We will definitely stay there again.",5,2015,10,12
123,Superb Location Fantastic Hotel,"I have stayed at this hotel on several occasions and it never fails to impress.  The location is superb and the customer service is second to none.  Brendan Madden has always been extremely helpful in securing our rooms and ensuring check in/check out is swift and hassle free.  

The rooms are modern, clean and very comfortable.  The hotel serves delicious food and I look forward to my next trip back to London to stay here again.",5,2015,10,12
123,A piece of heaven in a heaving city!,"I recently stayed in the Marylebone hotel with my sister for a weekend. I've stayed there a couple of times before & can confidently say that as long as there's availability- it'll always be my first choice. It's within minutes from bustling Bond Street, but you could be anywhere in the world once you're inside its beautiful, peaceful lobby. The staff are exceptional (A special shout out to Ann Marie, the lovely Irish lady who's always smiling!). The food (we had breakfast twice and one lunch) is very good- you feel like you're eating in a restaurant as opposed to a hotel. We also used the gym and pool while we were there which came free with the room- always a great addition! We stayed on the weekend of the Ireland V Italy rugby match so the hotel was at capacity- although it never felt it. There were families, couples & like myself and my sister, young(ish) sisters on a weekend city break- it caters to everyone. This hotel seems to get better and better every time I return to it- I couldn't recommend it any higher!",5,2015,10,12
123,Weekend break,"A single Saturday night stay in London as a break from a hectic few months at work.  Great standard of accommodation, lovely decor throughout the hotel and perfect customer service from extremely friendly staff.

Great massage in the spa; did not try the gym but it looked very well equipped.  Excellent location in the center of London with easy access to the tube.

We did not eat in the hotel as we had arranged to meet friends elsewhere, but the bar was very comfortable with a broad range of expertly prepared drinks on offer.

As this hotel is very conveniently placed I will likely make use of it again in the future for business trips, and would be more than happy to stay here again for leisure too.

My new favourite hotel in London.",5,2015,10,12
123,10 stars if I could-epitomy of customer service,"The customer service at this hotel is simply amazing. I arrived at 9 pm Monday and I check out tomorrow. This service is the same as the Four Seasons.  First, the rooms are nice.  Great size by London standards. Extremely clean with turn down service and great daily maintenance.  Everyone I met from the front desk, restaurant staff (breakfast), restaurant (evening bar), corporate event space, and even managers.  I had a small concern that was addressed immediately and I was more than satisfied with the response. This evening I returned to my room and was greeted by a manager from corporate.  We chatted about their property in Washington DC and he gave me a complimentary glass of red wine.  (not the cheap stuff either).  I came up to my room to find a note and a voicemail from the manager Brendan stating that they were sorry that they broke a bottle of my perfume and they wanted to replace it. Let me be clear. This was a very small (less than 1 oz) bottle of Aveda purefume (air freshner) that I got for free for my birthday. I don't know if I would have missed it. It was less than a quarter full. Full value is $20.  I called and told him, please don't worry about this.  It is not a big deal and I surely don't want anyone to get in trouble for this. I got a free glass of wine that was $15, so let's call it even. He thanked me and hung up. Ten minutes later he came to my door with a bottle of their air freshener from........geth this, White Company. If you don't know this brand, it is posh and their signature scents at the hotel.  AND it was 20 times bigger than mine! Integrity and great customer service. This means a lot.  Humility, customer service, and integrity. You can't beat this. Don't hesitate and book your stay. Great area. You won't be disappointed.  P.S.  four nights and I have never heard my neighbors, no noise in the hallway, and no noise from the outside. Extremely quiet.  I'm sensitive to noise and like my quiet and night. I think the hotel is fully booked.",5,2015,10,08
123,Ireland v Italy weekend ,"Another excellent weekend sojourn in our favourite London hotel, with a wonderful location right in the super cool urban village that is Marylebone. Really cosy and comfortable upgraded corner room. Room fully and comprehensively equipped. Service great all round ( especially Gunther in Reception). Breakfast very tasty - lovely omelettes and porridge! And bar food also spot on.  Game ( just 8 stops along the Central Line from Bond St - 5 mins from hotel- to Olympic Stadium) was not a classic but a win is a win.  We will be back. 

",5,2015,10,07
123,"Lovely Relaxed Hotel, great location ","The Marylebone is a lovely modern hotel. It is really comfortable and has lots of relaxing areas all over the ground floor. Our room wasn't huge but was ideal for an overnight stay. It was clean and comfortable, great shower but the air con was hard to control. We didn't have a breakfast rate but did eat in the '108 Pantry' and had the continental option which was ideal to stock up before heading out around London. The hotel location was in a nice quiet street but a 5 minute walk to Oxford Street, Regents Park, Baker Street and ideal for our visit to Madame Tussaud's. Highly recommend to anyone ",4,2015,10,07
123,Excellent location and the best gym,"A very good location close to Selfridges and Oxford Sterre but still a quiet street. The gym facilities are better than any in-hotel facility I have ever tried. Highly recommended.
Nice pubs and specialist shops in the proximity
 ",5,2015,10,07
123,family break,"Fantastic hotel, friendly,staff excellent food very clean and a free teddie bear for my grandson, location is good for all sight seeing.rooms are quite small but everything you need is provided....and you are only sleeping in it 
thank you for a lovely weekend and looking after us.",5,2015,10,05
123,High degree of comfort,Excellent location and high degree of comfort.  All staff very helpful and willing.  Amenities and facilities all very well looked after.  Everything possible that you could want from an Hotel is available.,5,2015,10,05
123,Lovely hotel in superbe location,"Had a great long-weekend at the Marylebone Hotel with my 7year old son. Location couldn't be better. Short walking distance to Bond Street tube station, all kinds of restaurants in the area. Nice and quiet, yet so central. Service was good, very nice and welcoming staff. We had warm towels on arrival, and my son was thrilled to receive a Marylebone Hotel teddybear. Our room-requests were met, i.e. we got twin beds in a room on a high floor. 

As mentioned in other reviews the air conditioning is rather noisy. However, we turned it of at night and opened the window, and the room stayed nice and cool. The shower-floor flooded easily, and we had to turn of the water several times whilst showering in order to avoid the water running onto the bathroom floor. We were not able to open the mini-bar door. We did not report these issues (in other words they were not to a great inconvenience to us), thus I'm unable to say how such reports would have been handeled.

I will definitively consider staying again when visiting with my other son in May 2016, and also if visiting London with my husband.",4,2015,10,05
123,Great location and service,"After 25 years of visiting the hotel the front staff are always extremely helpful especially Gunther and Anjie, they always seem to bend over backwards to help us. The room was extremely comfortable and we always ask for the new wing looking over Marylebone Lane. We also recommend the bar/bistro 28/50 in Marylebone Lane to grab a bite to eat or just to people watch whilst having a nice glass of wine.  The location is fantastic especially when shopping as you can drop your bags off every couple of hours!",5,2015,10,04
123,Five star plus at the Marylebone,"Staying at the Marylebone hotel for our son's 21st has been a total joy - from Gunther's warm welcome to a wonderful pair of rooms, fab breakfast and exceptional service. We've stayed here on many occasions and its consistent 5* quality has never let us down. It's always sad to leave and we immediately look forward to returning.  This is a calm, cool and chic oasis in the West End. ",5,2015,10,03
123,Must try,"Great friendly staff, very well located property with great restaurants around it. Facilities are great but take care the pool is not for young children. Gym is good and a Shisha place is just around the corner for all old school smokers here!",5,2015,10,02
123,Location and service,"
My family and I stayed at the Marylebone in September for a week. I have stayed at the hotel before and chose it again because of the location, close to shops and 
restaurants. Rooms are small but are spotless  and well decorated. The health club was a pleasant surprise, with very good area and equipments (besides the pool). The staff  was friendly, polite and really made an effort to make our stay perfect. Gunther (front desk) was particularly helpful, accommodating our requests and anticipating our needs, always with a smile. Rahim (concierge) also helped us with dinner reservations. We will certainly return.",4,2015,10,02
123,Impeccable service and staff,"My husband and I stayed for two nights after being in Amsterdam for work for a week, the hotel immediately lets you feel as you are on vacation. The staff do their upmost to ensure your stay is comfortable and up to standards. Was a little bummed that we could not see the spa or pool, as it closes early 7 pm on Saturdays.

123,Great Hotel in a Great Location ,"This was my 2nd stay at The Marylebone Hotel...with Marylebone high street just 2 mins walk...st.cristophers a 7 min walk and Selfridges another couple of mins from there...the hotel couldn't have been better located...the rooms are spacious and very comfortable..

A stay at the hotel gives you access to a proper fitness centre with an indoor swimming pool..spa..weights..cardio etc...

What makes the stay special and worth 5 stars is the extra courteous and super helpful staff...they really go the extra step and tend to your needs during the stay...A special mention for Gunther and Andreas who accomodated to our requests and made our stay a memorable one...",5,2015,09,30
123,Fantastic Hotel great location excellent food!,"Fantastic Hotel great location excellent food! Helpful and polite staff, especially the Guest Relations Officer Mr Gunther who will go out of his way to be at your disposal and service! We always ask for him when we book at Marylebone. He is our guy. We recommend him and the Hotel in general unconditionally                     Theodorides",5,2015,09,30
123,Great retreat in the heart of London,"I stayed for one night last weekend at The Marylebone Hotel for a last-minute solo getaway and highly recommend it - it's my new go-to hotel in a unique and beautiful part of London.  The location is superb - close to Oxford street if you can stand the crowds, and a stone's throw from the lovely independent shops on Marylebone High Street.  The front desk staff were excellent and check-in/out very easy.  The room was spacious and clean and the bed comfortable. The 108 bar has a fantastic atmosphere and was a nice place to wind down after a long day.",5,2015,09,30
123,Home from home in Marylebone,"We stayed at the Marylebone Hotel during a conference held nearby. The hotel is very well located for access to a range of attractions, including the breathtaking Wallace Collection just around the corner. The staff are quite exceptional - welcoming, friendly and nothing is too much trouble. The rooms are small (nothing unusual for a London hotel) but quiet and comfortable. Highly recommended.",5,2015,09,30
123,Fabulous with strong attention to detail,"I choose this hotel because I really like to swim and the pool here is just fine but I later realized that it has much more to offer. First impressions count and mine was that from the moment you entered the building the staff were there to help and pamper you- the reception desk even has a cylinder of fresh fruit flavored water - what a nice touch. 
I stayed in a standard room so I assume that others were even better but even at this level there was a decent amount of space, very comfortable bed and other carefully chosen amenities. The wifi is also first class and accessed without fuss.
The hotel offers a very good breakfast - for my purposes the buffet continental breakfast was more than enough and did not require ordering an additional cooked breakfast.
My only small criticism is that the room had noisy air conditioning -
Other than that the hotel has a great location and I am most certainly will be back",5,2015,09,29
123,Good Location & Excellent Staff,"Friendly, efficient staff is their best asset. Hotel, as well as our room, was very clean. Not one speck of dirt. Beds very comfortable. A full breakfast was included. Some of the items on the breakfast buffet were juices, meats, cheeses, cereals, pastries, and if that isn't enough, you could order items to be freshly prepared. Dinner at their restaurant is very good but pricey. Restaurants and mass transit are in easy walking distance.  

I would have rated this hotel a 5 except for the noise while trying to sleep. About 10:00 P.M. or later I could hear people talking and it sounded like furniture was being pushed along a hardwood floor. The noise never continued past 12:30 A.M. Sometimes it started as early as 6:00 A.M. The noise did not occur every night. We were on the first floor above the restaurant/bar area. Didn't ask for another room because when we checked in, we were told this was the only room they had available -- even though we booked more than 8 months in advance.",4,2015,09,28
123,Compact but SO comfortable and friendly,"Very, very pleasant stay. Small, compact room but absolutely everything I needed to make life easy and the friendliest of staff. I felt very safe and secure and I wasn't disturbed at all. The lounge and bar areas are really attractive and nothing is too much trouble for the staff.
As I was on crutches, the extra assistance I received was very much appreciated. 
Quiet location despite being just off Oxford street. 
Excellent stay - thank you.",5,2015,09,28
123,Location,"The hotel is in a good location to get to several underground stations and there are some nice shops and restaurants nearby.The rooms have been refurbished and are comfortable, although a bit warm at night.",4,2015,09,28
123,Spacious rooms,Attention to detail and personal attention was excellent.  Great dining experience and room service was always on time. Perfect location for shopping and just strolling. Rooms was spacious and bathroom was inviting after long days of sightseeing.  And a special thank you goes to Kashif who seemed like our personal concierge.  He  met us at 6:30 am on the day of our departure just to make sure we had proper transportation to the airport.,5,2015,09,27
123,Excellent Business Hotel,"I recently stayed here on business. First impressions are a little interesting but once inside the decor is sleek and minimalistic. The room as one would expect is a shade too dark and lots of mirrors. The bed was extremely comfortable. 

The restaurant and bar offered sumptuous food and drink. The dinner and lunch provided were tasty and with great attention to detail. 

The location of course is 5 mins walk from Bond street and Oxford Street. All in all a gem of a hotel!",4,2015,09,25
123,"Business stay, exceptional!","I booked The Marylebone for a very important customer training programme for device implanting physicians.  We had bedrooms, dinner and a meeting room the following day.  Everything about the visit was fantastic.
The bedrooms are cosy, stylish, warm, modern, comfy pillows and bed, heated floor in the bathroom, nice toiletries, it was wonderful.
We had cocktails and dinner at the hotel in 108 bar, and we were given the Pantry - which is a little snug room separate from the restaurant for our dinner.  Cocktails delicious (sampled the virgin cocktails - amazing!) and the dinner was beautiful.  The food is well presented, and the portions are not shy!  Delicious!
Our meeting room was set up the evening before which enabled us to be able to set up our equipment before dinner. The room was clean, had natural daylight, and was well stocked with stationary, and tea/coffee/snacks.
Lunch, like dinner, was lovely.  A selection of cold and hot foods, again we were given the little snug room.
The hotel is in a great location, 5 minutes walk from Bond Street tube station.
I would not hesitate to book this venue again for a meeting, or a personal stay.",5,2015,09,25
123,Stylish and convenient ,"Great little hotel in a super convenient location.  The hotel is on a very quiet street making it easy to get peaceful rest, yet only a short walk to Oxford St, Regent st, and the Bond st. Tube stop.  Rooms are small, but stylish, modern and very clean.  Staff is very helpful and friendly.",4,2015,09,24
123,Another fab stay! ,"Another great stay at this hotel in November for my partners 40th birthday, the staff are always friendly but professional, and always helpful, they upgraded us and brought cake and champagne. ..lovely! The suite was excellent, clean and comfy, we will always stay here when visiting London from now on: ) and hoping for a stay in October for my Birthday 😀",5,2015,09,24
123,Great Location - Exceptional Service,"If you want a great combination of hospitality and location, this is a smart choice. Our room was very clean, and nicely tidied each day for us. The services there are marvelous. We were given access to the spa and health club facility which included a full length indoor pool and sauna. This is a professional operation with trainers and equipment because they sell memberships to the public. Everyone was friendly, and eager to give help and ideas about our stay. Be aware that our low price room was small, though comfortable. We knew we'd be away sightseeing so didn't mind.
The location is a 15 minute walk from the Tube Station, and was integral to us getting everywhere we needed. We used the Oyster card and found ourselves only twice needing alternate transportation over our eight days of sightseeing.
I highly recommend a stay here.",5,2015,09,23
123,Next time I visit London I'll stay here,I am actually staying at the hotel and the service is amazing. My room absolutely nice and clean ( compare to london standarts). I was staying in another Hotel and I absolutely disliked it..... It was hard to find this one ( thank you tripadvisor). Bit we did it.  The price is super good for London! I am a happy camper! ,5,2015,09,22
123,A Smooth Event and Good Hospitality / Location,I have hosted a whole day meeting in this hotel yesterday and everything was going smoothly. The meeting rooms are next to each other which fit our requirement perfectly. Rohini and Esther took an extra miles to accommodate last minute requests and I really appreciate it as I know it's not easy when there were many events happening. The overall experience was great and I definitely recommend this to other company who are looking to host a meeting.,4,2015,09,22
123,First Time in London,"We stayed at the Marylebone on our first stay in London and it could not have been better
We were greeted warmly and shown to a lovely room.
When we wished to leave the hotel to see the sights of London the staff were very helpful with directions and maps and at the end of the day it was lovely to come back to for a drink in the bar
Pip Australia",5,2015,09,22
123,Amazing hotel,"Just the most incredible experience that I have ever received in a London hotel.  Firstly, the hotel was so welcoming, professional staff, very warm welcome, staff could not do enough for us.  We had complimentary gifts, upgrade and front end staff could not have been nicer.  The hotel was simply excellent for multiple reasons.  You must try the Marylebone Hotel, truly wonderful and made a special weekend even more special because of the staff and the qualities of the hotel.",5,2015,09,21
123,Excellent service and gym/pool,"1) Service:   I stay at this hotel regularly on business, and get excellent service from the front desk, particularly Gunther.  He is extremely professional, succinct and yet polite.  Whenever I have had any issue, he has been able to get it addressed ((either while I'm at the hotel or in advance of my stay).  I travel a lot for business, and I would say he is one of the top front desk workers I can recall dealing with on a regular basis at any hotel.

2)  The gym and pool in the basement of the hotel are fantastic.  100x better than a typical hotel fitness center.",5,2015,09,21
123,What a delight...........,"Brilliant! That is all I can really say.  I stayed at this hotel for 1 night and I would have moved in if they had let me.  The hotel is perfectly situated in a quaint quiet street but a stones throw from Selfridges and Bond street which is a winner for the shopaholic.  The staff are so delightful and cannot do enough for you and this includes the doormen, the reception staff, the wait staff and everyone in between.  I was celebrating my 30th birthday and they made me feel so special.  You walk in and you are amazed by the ultra-chic décor that is still warm and welcoming.  The bar is fantastic (108) albeit a little pricey (my husband ordered Monkey Shoulder whisky and was shocked to find that is was £16 for a single shot - but that is his fault he should have looked at the menu :) - my cocktails were reasonable and fantastic).  The breakfast in bed was amazing! So delicious and generous with its portion sizes.  We stayed in a superior queen room and it was gorgeous, so big and comfortable with lots of amenities.
I am a London girl and stayed in many hotels and drank and ate at many bars and I am not sure I would now stay anywhere else.....",5,2015,09,21
123,great personal care,"The more I stay here, the more impressed I am with the personal care and interest of staff. Gunther and his colleagues are going out of their way to make sure I am comfortable and feel welcome. I will be returning and look forward to enjoying the facilities and great location, as well as the friendly and helpful staff.",5,2015,09,21
123,Fantastic week end in London,"We have been in the Marylebone Hotel for 3 nights at the end of August. We have appreciated very much the kindness and the professionalism of all the staff but, in particular, of Gunter at the front desk.
If we will come back to visit the Marylebone Hotel it is also for his presence.
Thanks a lot again.",5,2015,09,20
123,Lovely hotel,"It's a shame we only chose this hotel because of it's location. (Walking distance of Westmoreland Street Hospital) So we didn't get chance to sample the hotels restaurants and facilities. Our room however was fantastic, lovely comfy bed, room controls for heat/ac, bathrobes/slippers just what we needed for an early night in.",5,2015,09,20
123,Incredible experience,"Had an amazing time at this hotel. The facilities are top notch for such a central hotel. We went to a really enjoyable yoga class and the gym had all the equipment we need. The hotel service was impecable, especially at the front desk where Gunther (working at reception) attended to all our needs. Would highly recommend this hotel.",5,2015,09,20
123,Wonderful High Tea Birthday Celebration,"Roberta at The Marylebone Hotel in London went out of her way to make our experience wonderful. We were celebrating my mother's 70th birthday and without being prompted she brought out a wonder dessert at the end with a birthday candle. The tea, food, value, atmosphere and location were perfect. I can't wait to return! Thanks Roberta and staff!",5,2015,09,18
123,"Fantastic as usual, magnificent suite!","Wonderful Central London hotel with exceptional staff, particularly Roddy, Gunther, Sinead and Antjie. This hotel is not so busy for no good reason! Great rooms, unusually good hotel food and lively bar. Whether business or pleasure you won't beat it!",5,2015,09,17
123,Still an outstanding hotel,"This is the second time we have stayed at the Marylebone. The hotel is very conveniently located about 5 mins walk from Bond St Underground.  This is a 4-star hotel but the quality of the service and the attitude of all the staff is easily 5-star.  Helpful, friendlly and always someone around to help or inform.  The rooms are clean, quiet  and comfortable but it is the staff that make it exceptional. 

Given the quality of the rooms and service, prices (which in our case included a great breakfast) are extremely reasonable!",5,2015,09,17
123,Amazing hotel. Can't say enough to praise it... ,"Fantastic hotel and location. Attention to details, amazing staff. Haven't encountered such good service before and I have seen a couple of hotels in my life... Special thanks to Long from the reception who replaced our room to another one when a problem with the A.C was discovered. He even gave us two vouchers for cocktails on the house in the hotel restaurant, that was on it's own amazing (service and food wise).
The hotels decor is so inviting, warm but at the same time modern. 5 stars in my eyes!
Loved it and would definitely come back. 
Thanks for a wonderful stay,

123,"Loved the Hotel, Location, not so much...","...but its location kept it from 5 stars.  Too far to walk to a tube station (and its uphill on the way home), and very few surrounding restaurants, and no pubs nearby that we ever found.  If you don't mind cabbing after touring all day though, this is a really nice hotel and its own restaurant is top notch.",4,2015,09,15

Thanks!",4,2015,09,15
123,Good value,"The rooms were lovely, except there was very limited storage space for clothing. The only other problem is that although within walking distance to the tubes, it is a reasonable walk. As to the restaurant, we were only there for breakfast and they weren't able to make plain pancakes, which our grandson wanted.  Oh well. He got them in Holland",4,2015,09,14
123,Stylish but.....,"I recently stayed 4 nights is this stylish, well located hotel, not far from Bond St Station, fab Oxford Street, Marble Arch, and the vibrant Marylebone High Street. Lovely...so far so good. Checked in and up to my room overlooking the rooftops of London. Room clean, bed comfy, heated floor in bathroom. There was a problem with the safe in my room which was sorted. The mini bar on my room was locked and I was kindly told this would be unlocked immediately.....it never was....
I ventured to breakfast which was included in my room rate....how disappointing.....food tasteless...coffee weak....and the majority of staff (except for Roberta and her senior male boss who were both helpful) were rude. The buffet breakfast is poor, the a la carte is tasteless.....avocado on sourdough for example...bread soggy and soft, poached eggs watery...really disappointing. This hotel is frequented by many...business people, tourists etc. Staff should learn to treat all customers the same regardless of the focus of their visit. This was a lovely looking stylish clean well located place with no heart.....dissappointing +++",3,2015,09,14
123,Amazing!,"The Marylebone Hotel is a definite recommendation for the future. It is in such a cute and quaint area of the city- walking distance to Christopher's Place Square. The staff was absolutely amazing, so welcoming and helpful with navigating the city for the short amount of time we were going to be there. The room itself was perfectly sized, spotless, and very aesthetically pleasing. All in all.. I would definitely suggest this hotel and stay here in the future!",5,2015,09,14
123,"Good hotel & service, great gym facilities!","I stayed in this hotel for ~3-4 months for a business trip. Overall great service and very accommodating staff. (Gunther, Roderick, and [xx] have been very helpful in particular!)
The food is good (especially the juice/smoothy bar) and most of the rooms are always quiet.
However, one of the best features of this hotel is the great gym. Very good facilities for a hotel, including many different weights/machines (just like a 'normal' gym), a large swimming pool, personal trainers, and even classes for you to follow. 
Overall, I would definitely stay again!",5,2015,09,14
123,Excellent location,"Have stayed here whilst on business a few times and always been impressed by the level of service and comfort of the rooms. The location is excellent, close to Oxford Circus, but ""miles away"" from the hustle and bustle of the West End.",4,2015,09,14
123,Perfect London,"Great short stay in London in late August. Hotel is comfortable, stylish and service was excellent. Lovely atmosphere - great location. Lovely run on Hyde Park too. Everyone so helpful. Must single out Abbey and colleagues who helped my wife with some important lost property. Highly recommended hotel.",5,2015,09,13
123,Fantastic Stay!,"Took my wife for 1 night to the Marylebone Hotel and had a fantastic experience!  The hotel is centrally located and within walking distance of the nice restaurants in the West end.  By far one of the better hotels in the Marylebone/Mayfair area.

We visited the SPA (at the Third Space) and thought it was spectacular.  

The rooms are modern looking and overall, very comfortable.

All the staff we met were very nice, particularly Gunther Schildwachter.  He looked after a few requests we had and made our stay even better.

We’ll definitely be returning sometime in the future.",5,2015,09,13
123,Wonderful Service,"I have just returned home having spent the last two nights at the Marylebone Hotel. From the moment my husband and I stepped into the reception we were made to feel welcome and absolutely nothing was too much trouble. The staff were helpful, friendly, polite and informative, it was an extremely pleasurable stay. The room was clean and comfortable, perhaps my only criticism was that the bathroom was a bit cramped with not much space. The turn down service was an extra treat. Special mention must go to Oglala who made the best champagne cocktails and was a delight to converse with, her knowledge of the ingredients was very impressive and my husband enjoyed her signature Cocktail ""Sweet 736"" . Breakfast too was excellent and all the staff went out of their way to be as helpful as possible. Coupled with the close proximity of the shops and attractions this was without doubt one of my best stays in the city. Would I return to the Marylebone .......... Definitely! ",5,2015,09,11
123,Excellent,The rooms and amenities provided are excellent. Cleanliness is up to the mark. Nice ambience and all staff greet you well and make you feel comfortable. The Concierge staff has been of great help. Gunther has been very attentive to ensure all questions/concerns are promptly attended to and resolved.,5,2015,09,11
123,"Amazing location, tiny rooms","I know that most of the hotel rooms in London run small, but rooms at Marylebone are not only small but also ceiling height gives you a bit of claustrophobic feeling. I have change my rooms twice during the stay, in hope that ceiling would be higher but no luck. 

Other than rooms, breakfast bar and in-room dining is great. Location - does not really get better than that, close to bars/restaurants and Bond street.",3,2015,09,11
123,Great Hotel Outstanding Service.,"I stayed just 1 Night,great location,quiet but very close to Oxford Street.Room was small but very comfortable.Great service from the Hotel team.Good Breakfast Choice.Will definitely stay again when I am in London.

123,Excellent hotel,"I chose this hotel as the property I normally stay at was sold out and I must say that the hotel far exceeded my expectations. I chose a base category room and by London standards it was great. Very comfortable bed, work space, great amenities and a very well designed bathroom. The wifi came free as standard and bottled water was replenished. The housekeeping staff were excellent. For e.g.. they noticed the type of nespresso pod i used on the first day and left extras of the same type when they replenished the stock the next day. As a frequent business traveller and having stayed at many types of hotel chains, this is amazing customer service. Check in and check out was smooth and i loved that the staff at the door are empowered enough to walk up to the reception and help with check-ins during busy times. Definitely coming back again.
      ",5,2015,09,10
123,Great hotel in Marylebone,"My husband, 5 yr old and I just returned recently from a 6 night stay at the Marylebone Hotel in London and really enjoyed our overall stay.  The hotel is in a great location.  Very close to Bond St tube station and great shopping like Selfridges & Liberty (off Regent St) and excellent restaurants as well.  Traveling with a young child comes with its own challenges, but our stay at the hotel was seamless & stress free.  We had originally booked a deluxe king, but having arrived from the States on a very early flight we were given a deluxe queen on the top floor (7th).  The front desk person said it was in a great location and had views to look out onto.  She was right and we stuck with the room, although she told us we could change and wait for another room later on....We were already tired so we stuck with the room and was glad we did!  They even had an extra roll-away bed if we wanted, but the two beds that made up the queen was perfectly fine for all 3 of us so we were glad to have an extra bed to put our belongings on.
Marylebone is such a great area!  We visited the Paddington St Gardens playground with our son, walked to Waitrose & Tesco for all necessary items such as water, fruit, etc....and tons of restaurants right in the vicinity of the hotel. 
There is a workout facility w/ pool, but we didn't take advantage of it. The option is great though!  The actual hotel itself is very nice as well.  Two elevators that work fine and quickly take you to your rooms.  There's a computer station on the first floor, if you need to print your airline tix for return.  
The overall room appearance was very clean and modern.  I'm very particular when it comes to cleanliness in hotel rooms, but this hotel did a great job.  There is a great turn down service each night where they provide two bottles of water and small chocolates.  The shampoo/body lotion amenities are awesome too!  The bathroom is a good enough size.  It is London so you can't expect huge bathrooms but this one functions well enough. The bathroom was clean as well and the tub was really useful with a young child.  
The staff who cleans the rooms really do a great job and very nice too!  
Overall I would highly recommend this hotel, especially if you have younger children and I would definitely stay here again.  We were already familiar with the area, having stayed at another boutique hotel on another occasion, but the Marylebone is far superior.
Also there's free wifi, which was great and never had any issues with connectivity.

If you ever need a taxi there are plenty of them throughout the day----We needed one very early one morning to take the Eurostar and it was readily available.   
All in all, a great hotel with great service and cleanliness!  Highly recommend!",4,2015,09,09
123,Very nice place,"Perfect location, very nice hotel with all amenities (swimming pool and fitness). Nicely decorated restaurant, good breakfast. Tiny rooms and a bit dark but Service extremely nice and attentive. Love it and would definitely come back! Thank you!",4,2015,09,09
123,Excellent service - Gunther (reception) was heaven sent ,"This hotel is beautiful and in the heart of London so getting around was a snap with über. Gunther, a guest relations agent was so fantastic. He went above and beyond to make sure my best friend and I stay was perfect. Make sure to tip him big. He's the real MVP! Lol",5,2015,09,09
123,Worth it,"The hotel is a bit far from a train station but it is a really charming hotel.

Sure it is a big hotel with small corridors in the floors and small rooms.

But the lobby looks really attractive. The restaurant for the breakfast is really good.
The hotel smells good.
Heard the swimming pool is one of the largest of the area.
And all the staff is friendly and helpful. One of the only who offer you bottles of water on departure ! 

And I did really appreciate to get my room at 10 am !!!",4,2015,09,09
123,"Great Hotel, great stay","Great cost benefit hotel, great location, and silent. A very good breakfast, and the hotel experience as a hole is very satisfactory. The hotel staff was very nice, in special Mr. Gunther, that made our stay perfect. We´ll be returning soon. Recommended, no question about it.",5,2015,09,08
123,The Best Hotel in London,"I have stayed in many hotels in London but The Marylebone Hotel, together with 108 Brasserie is best for excellent service, dining and accommodation elegance and the atmsophere of comfort and privacy. We stayed at The Marylebone before and after travelling to Paris and it will be our firm favourite.",5,2015,09,07
123,Couldn't have been better...,"My boyfriend and I stayed here during a weekend break in London, and the service could not have been better. In the pre-check in questionairre I mentioned that we were in London for my boyfriends birthday, and we were given a complimentary double upgrade, which was such a nice guesture and made the weekend even more special.

Our room was not ready when we checked in, so we went to the bar to have a few drinks. When they took longer than expected to inform us that our room was ready, we queried this with them, and when they found out that the room was already ready they apologised profusely for this, and signed off the price of our cocktails. 

The room itself was gorgeous. It was one of the Luxury Suites, and that was exactly how it felt. Pure luxury. Everything was spotless, comfortable, and a perfect home away from home for whilst we were away.

Cannot thank them enough for making our weekend away extra special!",5,2015,09,07
123,Very pleasant stay,"A lovely hotel with very pleasant and helpful staff. I was instantly made to feel welcome at the front desk by a member of staff named Gunther, who made sure I was happy with my booking before checking me into my room. My room was modern, clean and spacious. Would definitely stay here again!",5,2015,09,07
123,Luxurious home away from home in Central London,"We arrived from the US to the Marylebone hotel late at night and very tired.  The staff was excellent and got us settled in quickly.  My son was delighted to find a piece of cake, beverages and birthday wishes waiting for him in the room. The room was large by UK standards, the bedding was comfortable and the heated floors were sumptuous! The location was excellent - a few short blocks from a couple of tube stations, which made exploring the city of London quite easy.  The hotel is located in Marylebone village, which has many wonderful little shops and restaurants. It truly has a village feel right outside the hustle and bustle of the city, where you can pick up fresh, delicious locale items at specialty shops which include chocolates, cheeses, fruits, meats, etc. We've been to London before and stayed near the tourist attractions, which is nice, but staying at the Marylebone was better!  I'll be back!",5,2015,09,07
123,2 nights at The Marylebone Hotel.,"During a 4 week trip around Europe, on a tight budget accommodation wise, my partner and I stayed at some pretty average places here and there. 
So we thought we would treat ourselves to some luxury in London, and the Marylebone did not dissapoint. 
Clean modern rooms and up to date facilities can be hard to come by but the Marylebone provided both. Along with friendly helpful staff this made our stay feel a bit fancy. All of the staff were well presented and helpful, we called house keeping to query laundry and spoke to Abbey, which resulted in a lengthy conversation explaining other facilities we didn't know were available to us and even some helpful hints about London, it was well appreicated and very useful.
I would recommend the stay for comfort and location.",5,2015,09,07
123,My favorite hotle in London ,I've been to many hotels in London but the marylebone is like no other and with Gunther on the front desk going out of his way to make your stay as comfortable as possible. It also has one of the best restaurants in town.Definitely this is the only hotel for me.,5,2015,09,06
123,Fabulous Central London Elegance,"I travel to London for work regularly and The Marylebone Hotel has become a firm favourite of mine. Just a stone's throw from Selfridges and Oxford Street at large, the hotel offers convenience and comfort, whilst the staff are very friendly and go out of their way to make my stay as easy and stress-free as possible. Case in point - I casually mentioned to Gunther at check-in (who I have come to know (and look forward to seeing!) due to my regular visits to the hotel) that it had been my birthday the day before my most recent arrival. After dinner that evening I found a slice of birthday cake, a bottle of prosecco, and a signed birthday card waiting in my room. It is these kinds of gestures, along with the location, the understated elegance, and the amenities (pool, gym) of the hotel, which make it a no-brainer when it comes to where to stay in London.",5,2015,09,06
123,Weekend made wonderful....,"We had booked tickets to see ""Sinatra and his music"" at the London Palladium to celebrate our 44th wedding anniversary and decided to stay at the Marylebone Hotel as an extra treat as we had heard it was a nice Hotel. Well what a treat!!!  Beautiful hotel, wonderful attentive staff, comfortable room and delicious breakfast.  We could not have asked or expected anything more!  Must just mention Sujan, Veronika and Minel who are just so lovely. We also received delivered to our room on a tray with a handwritten note a bottle of Prosecco on ice and chocolates compliments of the Management. We were overwhelmed by this gesture.  A huge thank you to you all for a weekend made wonderful.",5,2015,09,06
123,These guys know what they are doing,"when you travel whether for business or with your family , you want people to help and assist and make things easier. The staff at the Marylebone get this and do it with grace every time without fail. All the staff at the front desk are friendly and help in anyway they can. The facilities are superb with one of the best hotel gyms this side of the Atlantic. 

The reason why I return to this hotel time and time again is the staff.  Gunther on reception/front desk is an outstanding representative of the brand . 

I would strongly recommend you stay for the location, facilities, staff and fit out.",5,2015,09,06
123,Great hotel,The location of the Marylebone Hotel is fantastic. Only 5 minutes from Bond street station! The staff was really friendly and the room service was amazing! We had everything we asked for! Highly recommend it.,5,2015,09,05
123,Review of the 108 Bar Restaurant,"Had a lovely meal in the 108 Bar at the Marylebone hotel.
Would highly recommend a visit!
Also we would like to say a big thank you to the staff there for their brilliant service
(Margaret and Shanice) and ( Abel,  Thomas and Matyas) they made us feel very special.",5,2015,09,05
123,Perfect Location in the heart of London!!!,"This hotel is probably the best you can find in London. I have stayed at quite a few properties in and around London, and this hotel by far has been the best. It has amazingly clean and smart rooms, the location of the hotel being one of the best in London right behind Debenhams on Oxford Street, with easy access to the Oxford Street, Bond Street Station and taxis as and when required. The staff is very very friendly, and they will try their best to suit all your needs. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to experience London in the right sense. For me, the holiday begins when i check-in to my hotel, and this hotel really made my holiday a happy one :)",5,2015,09,05
123,Best Hotel in London! ,"We've been there in February for my birthday and it was just simply perfect! 
The hotel is very clean and it has a really nice, comfortable and romantic atmosphere! 
The breakfast was amazing! The food is fresh, delicious and the portions r fine as well! 
The service was awesome. Super friendly, always helpful and if u have special wishes they r always happy to help u out! 
A big big big thank u especially to the food and beverage manager Aladdin M. He made my birthday a lot more special with little attentions. He is super friendly, helpful and did an amazing, fantastic job! Thank u very much!!! 

We can't wait to come back to this fabulous hotel!  ",5,2015,09,04
123,Perfect,"Great location,great service,friendly staff,my favourite hotel in London among which i have stayed. You have early c/in and late c/out,of course it is upon availability but staff will try to their best. You will receive an e-mail from concierge after you will c/in about your satisfaction and enquiries. Free mini fridge service was good,comp. bottle of champagne was cool for my b.day,thanks to FO manager.Wi-fi works without any problem. Strongly recommended, you should try. Thanks to everyone for comfort that which you provide us.",5,2015,09,04
123,Great Eggs Benedict!!!,"Although we were not staying at the hotel, we had a wonderful brunch at the 108 and were looked after by Aladdin who was amazing.  The service was spot on and the eggs benedict even more so.   Aladdin is definitely an asset to the hotel.",5,2015,09,03
123,Terrific Restaurant,We went to the 108 for breakfast.  The food was excellant and we were taken care of by Aladdin who was fantastic. He took care of our every need. Will be definately visiting 108 next time we are in London.,5,2015,09,03
123,Warm and Welcoming!,"The Marylebone Hotel has a warm and intimate ambience. The staff is friendly and welcoming. We enjoyed a lovely brunch which, thanks to Aladdin, was particularly delightful. His warmth and attentive service made our visit very special. Thank you, Aladdin! I would highly recommend the Marylebone as a destination.",5,2015,09,03
123,Mr Aladin,"First of all , it was a great trip in London . The service in The Marylebone Hotel was very good grace to Mr Aladin. I want to think this studious man for his good job. And, I am sure that he gives a great importance to his job and to the customers.",4,2015,09,03
123,Fantastic Hotel!!,"We stayed for a week in August, the hotel is beautiful and airy and very welcoming. Nothing is too much trouble for any staff and they all seem very happy to be there! Our room was very spacious and had everything and more, even a nespresso machine! The bed and pillows were so comfortable! The hotel think of every last detail, I can't wait to stay again, thank you!! ",5,2015,09,03
123,Super service and great rooms,"I have stayed at the Marylebone, for over 2 years nows and the service just keeps getting better and better, great staff and very welcoming. 
The Hotel is great for me as they are right in the heart of town and 2 mins from my office.
The rooms are always clean and very comfortable.
Special thanks to Gunther (front of house) for always looking after me.
Highly recommended.",5,2015,09,03
123,The Best of the Best,"This the second time that we have stayed in the Marylebone and i have to say it gets better every time. It's excellent location being in the heart of of the city , yet in a very calm area,  and in close proximity to the main shopping and restaurants area gives it that special edge . Staff like ALADDIN in the breakfast room who truly made our mornings pleasent with his truly 7 stars service as well as Gunther who made all the room arrangements to our liking and the ever welcoming Mohamed. The staff this time made all the difference . The outlets in the hotel have been really excellent. For a summer family vacation i think its excellent .

123,Wonderful restaurant,We stayed at a hotel just down the road and decided to try 108 for breakfast. Our table was tucked away in a corner perfect for a nice relaxing breakfast. The food was great and we were taken care of by the wonderful Aladdin who made sure we had everything we needed. I had heard that the hotel had recently redone their penthouse so I asked at reception if we could have a look. They were quite busy so we were shown around by Abbey from housekeeping who took us upstairs to the most amazing penthouse! Next time we're in London we will be back!  ,5,2015,09,02
123,"5 star service, again","My young daughter and I stayed at the Marylebone for two nights in late August. It was our second time staying with them and we booked again largely on the fantastic experience we had the first time. What makes this a great property is the stand-out service of everyone we encountered. Smiling, asking how we were enjoying our stay, if there was anything they could do. One employee, Gunther (front desk or concierge desk), really stood out, going above and beyond. One example - making my daughter feel very welcomed by finding her name and age from our past stay profile and bringing her a teddy bear. She felt like a valued guest! The rooms are a typical London size (aka small), but nicely furnished. Our bathroom had heated floors which was a treat - things dried quickly and it felt good our our feet after a long day of walking. The lounge areas are lovely - many places to sit and relax, read a paper or book, have a cup of tea. 

The location is terrific - very central and lots of great eating & transport options all around. Coram Fields (playground) is about a 25 minute walk from the hotel; Bond St tube stop is about a 4 minute walk. Daunt Bookstore (great for kids and adults) is also a 4 min walk. Access to the 3rd Space gym is terrific -- great equipment for a workout and a pool (with special hours for families). 

It's not an over-the-top luxurious hotel, but it's incredibly nice, very comfortable and above all, warm and welcoming. We're already looking forward to our next visit.",5,2015,09,01
123,My visit to London was to participate in the European Congress of Cardiology,"The Hotel has a optimal location.
My room and the other services of the Hotel are 5 stars.
There is a employer, his name is Gunther, very efficient and he is important support for the guest.
The others employers from reception and concierge are very amazing.",5,2015,09,01
123,Excellent Hotel in a lovely neighbourhood.,"I am so glad I booked this as far in advance as I did. We stayed 3 nights just before Wimbledon was starting. The Pride parade was also that same weekend (for which many London streets were closed) along with The Who and Taylor Swift/Ellie Goulding playing outdoor concerts at Hyde Park. So much going on in one place at one time!
The Hotel is a large and very nice property. We spent Christmas in a Marylebone flat 2 years ago, and really loved the area, so I was sure to book us into a hotel there for this visit. The lobby is very nice. We were offered cool towels and refreshment while we checked in. There are doormen outside and plentiful black cab's. 
The room was quite nice. Large cupboard for clothes and closet space. There is coffee and tea service in the room. Turndown each night with complimentary bottles of water and chocolate. Nice touch. The bathroom was pretty tiny, but nicely done. The room was a good size and the bed was comfortable. We recommend it and would stay again for sure!",4,2015,09,01
123,Great hotel (though some mistakes),"When you enter this hotel you can feel that it is going to be a good stay. That you are welcomed by cold citrus water by the front desk is one clue, another is the smiling staff.

We stayed in an executive suite which was nice but had several maintenance issues (such as blinds falling down during use and loose handles). Also there was some construction work going on outside resulting in a loud generator impeding our sleep already at 7 am (also on the weekend), better noise cancellation in the windows would be the way to go.

If these issues were resolved I would love to return since everything else was superb.",4,2015,09,01
123,A wonderful stay as always,"I am a regular guest and the staff make this hotel- the location is second to none and every trip is fabulous.  Special mention to the housekeeping team, Gunther and Roddy who are always extra attentive.  I can highly recommend this hotel and stunning location in the heart of Marylebone Village.",5,2015,09,01
123,Wow Experience!,"I would like to thank Rahim Ismail, the head concierge, for being knowledgeable, friendly and extremely helpful in arranging tickets to the tower of London, advising us in which musical to go to as well as booking tickets to the musical. He is an extremely personable.",5,2015,09,01
123,Brunch in 108,"We popped into London on 30/8/2015 for some last minute holiday shopping and decided brunch in 108 Marylebone was the order of the day...
Lovely to see the restaurant area refurbished in our favourite hotel.
We were served by Nicoletta 9 by our receipt and I'd just like to say what a lovely girl she was,attentive and chatty,interested in our day....
We hope to be down before Christmas for an overnight stay.
The staff very often make someone's experience good or better and this was certainly the case yesterday.",5,2015,08,31
123,Perfect Hotel in the Best Location,"Our family of 5 had a wonderful stay at the Marylebone Hotel. From the moment we entered the front doors until we left, the service was exceptional.
Our rooms were perfect! We had one room that had a small den with a roll away for our youngest daughter and a second room for our older two children. 
The housekeeping staff were fantastic- the rooms were tidy and the bathrooms were well stocked. Thanks to Glyiceria and her wonderful staff.
We had breakfast every morning in the hotel. The staff in the restaurant were attentive and we were served promptly. I wish I knew the name of all who served us- they were terrific.
The Marylebone feels like a small hotel even though there are 260 rooms. You would never know from the amazing personalized service.
We are also greatful to Kashif and Maciej the bellmen  for making sure we knew where we were going and sending us on our way. Finally thanks to Sujan at the front desk who also gave us good info and was very helpful upon checkout. 
We will definitely come back to the Marylebone and recommend it to everyone.",5,2015,08,30
123,10/10,"Good service, good food, very clean , close to wherever you want in central and endless choice of good restaurants nearby. What more do you need more from a hotel.
We have stayed here a few times before and have always had a wonderful time.
The staff always are friendly and always looking to help, especially on this occasion where on our arrival we were checked in by Sinead. She was welcoming and professional and very knowledgable about everything that we needed to know for our stay .
Every hotel needs exceptional staff like Sinead, as they really make the stay comfortable and enjoyable.
I would definitely recommended this hotel to anyone wanting a good nights sleep, perfect location and faultless service! 
Dr D Taheri",5,2015,08,30
123,Amazing breakfast,"We came to Marylebone Hotel for breakfast by a recommendation of a friend. The breakfast restaurant of the hotel is very cosy. The breakfast served included everything from a proper buffet with a various choice of things and numerous hot breakfast-options à la carte. The food and juices offered were amazing and very tasty. We really enjoyed our breakfast at Marylebone, especially thanks to the breakfast manager Aladdin who introduced us well and made everything to let us feel comfortable and miss anything. Thumbs up and high recommendation!",5,2015,08,30
123,All the details were perfect,"We spent four nights here in early August. We had needed to visit a practice on Harley Street, so the location was perfect. All the details were spot-on perfect. The rooms were clean and quiet. The location was ideal -- close to Harley Street and the lovely Marylebone High Street, and an easy enough walk to Oxford Street. Everything worked, which may sound silly but usually in a hotel there is always some small thing wrong -- not here. We arrived very early in the day (around 8:30am, after an overnight flight) but the room was ready for us nonetheless. Room service got the order perfectly right every time and delivered food promptly. The staff was courteous and knowledgeable -- they arranged dinner reservations at a nearby Italian restaurant which turned out to be lovely. Wifi was free, fast and reliable. The only minor glitch is once our key-card accidentally demagnetized and stopped working -- the front desk staff fixed the problem immediately and gave us vouchers for a round of free cocktails as a courtesy! This hotel is absolutely everything you need, and I would not hesitate to stay here again or recomend others to do so.",5,2015,08,29
123,Perfect Trip with Teenage Daughter,"I had the best time with my teenage daughter when we went to London and a large part of that was due to the friendly, helpful, and incredibly competent staff of the Marylebone Hotel. We received excellent advise on which bus tours to take and which show to see. We purchased a ticket for the Hop-On Hop-Off bus and had a wonderful day sightseeing followed by a spectacular evening waiting Les Miserables in premium seats in Queens Theatre. Sandor, in particular, was extremely valuable in that he scheduled reservations, helped us purchase our tickets, and even gave us an email to use when printing our train tickets for the next day. Our room was lovely and, to our delight, turn down service included tasty caramel filled chocolates each night. And my teenage daughter can not stop raving about the complementary breakfast, it was so delicious. We had a wonderful time and we can not thank the staff at the Marylebone enough.",5,2015,08,28
123,Big family with too much luggage,"As part of a 6 month sabbatical through Europe we found ourselves needing to extend in London for two weeks before going to our next city, and then again for a few nights before heading back to Asia.  This hotel is perfectly located and well priced.  We managed to book interconnecting rooms, which happened, not always the case, and many of our kids meals were comped as part of their family offer.  They recovered extremely well after a communication problem meant that our rooms were not ready when we arrived for the second visit, thanks to Duty Manager Long and managed to store some of our 18 pieces of check in luggage for long periods and with a minimum of fuss, thanks to Sandoe and the rest of the Concierge team..  .",4,2015,08,28
123,Great location,"This hotel has an amazing location in central london/Marylbone. The hotel & rooms itself is a bit overrated in my eyes; the room was tini tiny & in the bathroom you could hardly turn around. I have been to several hotels in London and Im aware that rooms are normally small, but this was still on the smaller side. When arrived the room had a terrible smell; the staff was helpful trying to sort it out, but it was still a bit unpleasant. Staff&service was good. Stayed 4nights & i love the location, but the hotel itself for me is no more than average. ",3,2015,08,28
123,Food and service was great,"We dropped in to this hotel during our recent trip to London, just for food.  We had 2 hungry children with us (aged 5 and 7) and ordinarily I would head somewhere ""tried and tested"" which I knew would be child-friendly, but we've found in London that's not that easy unless all you want is a burger.  On this particular day I wanted something a bit more substantial.  I'm so glad we dropped into The Marylebone. We chanced the bar and ordered dinner from the bar menu.  The children were really well catered for, and so were the adults.  It wasn't one of those ""nuggets n chips"" yukky menus for kids.  The food was freshly cooked and was really good quality.
The staff were incredibly friendly (again, our experience in London has been mixed) and patient. 
I'm sure this isn't pitched as a family-friendly hotel, but if you happen to be in the vicinity, with or without kids, and fancy some good quality pub food, I'd definitely recommend.",5,2015,08,27
123,very charmy hotel,"A very good hotel in a very convenient and beautiful location. Beautifully decorated, clean with a very tasty breakfast and many amenities in the center of London.

123,Breakfast,"Very nice place. 
Good localization in a quiet street, close to Hide Park and many interesting places
Delicious breakfast before getting our room after a long flight. This was a good way to start our journey. 

Aladdin, who helped us was really kind!
Thanks a lot!!

123,Best ever stay and service!,"I'm currently staying at the Marylebone Hotel. My favourites bits so far: the 108 Brasserie, the bar area, the excellent service and super kind people working there, including the doormen, people at the gym, reception, but especially Diana from housekeeping office. I warmly recommend this hotel in the heart of London :))",5,2015,08,26
123,Another excellent stay in this welcoming hotel,"Great staff, always ready to help out, they really make you feel at home from the folk behind the desk to the staff in 108 (the restaurant), they deserve recognition for doing a wonderful job. Spacious room, with a very comfortable bed.",5,2015,08,26
123,"Quality hotel, some reservations.","This hotel is a quality hotel with everything you could want, quality linen and efficient staff.
A little expensive, but as its London you would expect it.
Breakfast was available but at as supplement £14 continental and £26 for fully cooked.
Stayed for 2 nights in August 1st night in lower room on side of hotel and was woken by a generator used by builders over the road, after speaking to reception was moved to 7th floor in a room at the back, much better, but wasn't offered any complimenties or compensation, disappointed with this as we only had 1 good nights sleep.
The other thing which I didn't like was when they swiped my card they took an extra £50 as a cover in case we used anything,not used to this practice as its £50 less on your spending money until you check out.",4,2015,08,26
123,Birthday celebration,"I visited the Marylebone hotel and 108 Brasserie for a birthday afternoon tea. Comfy chairs, tasteful decor and a relaxed atmosphere made the experience a really enjoyable and memorable celebration. My partner is coeliac and the 'healthy' afternoon tea catered for her dietary requirements - and she said 'the taste or quality was in no way compromised'. A knowledgeable waitress informed us on the specifics of each tea which was interesting and Aladdin brought over a little birthday treat which made the afternoon. 5*",5,2015,08,26
123,First Class Staff & Services,"I visit this hotel very regularly and I never cease to be amazed at what this hotel has to offer. the location is superb (at the bottom of Marylebone High Street), the gym facilities are magnificent, the restaurant is ideal for the business traveller because you can eat alone at the bar, the rooms are well appointed and always immaculate and if there  is always a warm welcome from the well informed, helpful and above all friendly staff at reception - Gunther in particular always goes the extra mile to make sure each stay is enjoyable.",5,2015,08,25
123,The hotel experience ,"I've been to many hotels but this one was the best. The decoration, the professionally of the staff, the great great food. Every thing was excellent. Or as the British says it: absolutely fabulous! We were so happy to mistakenly ran into this hotel! Hope you will make the same great mistake ",5,2015,08,24
123,Just super,"Location wise this super ( and lux ) hotel couldn't really be beaten in my opinion. 15min taxi in traffic to Paddington for the heathrow express is excellent. Marylebone itself is everything you'd expect it to be and more - its plush, timeless and classic. Loads of restaurants - Le Autre Pied is worth a look.  Also have a walk down to charlotte street which is 15 min walk and try Roka. just wow. 

The hotel is owned by an irish family and is the sister of the Bloomsbury hotel where I have stayed on occasion too. ( which btw is also great & a little cheaper than here ). 

Front of house staff are polished and nothing was a problem - i had a couple of meetings in the hotel and the various spaces and nooks throughout are perfect. We had super snack food from the brasserie on each occasion. Slightly pricey but its Marylebone…..Our evening G&Ts / bubbles were again a little pricey but they were delicious. 

Our room was opulent. Really nicely finished - mix of modern tech and old world class. Bathroom and products were again perfect. 

We didn't eat in the hotel apart from Breakfast in bed which was excellent - i have the staples of coffee and poached eggs where I can…..and these were spot on. Eggs still warm and runny by the time they hit the room is not that easy! ( I hate tray charges btw! - build in the cost in the food price? ) 

We got a late check at no extra cost and without quibble. 

Thanks - will be back and will recommend it to anyone seeking a treat at a cost that is a fair bit less than say claridges etc.",5,2015,08,24
123,Stay at the hotel for 4 nights,"Excellent service from Gunther , always very pleasant and helpful.
I have been staying at the Marylebone hotel for the last 10 years and will highly recommend this hotel. Excellent bar at the back of the hotel.",5,2015,08,24
123,A wonderful hotel with amazing staff,"My husband and I visited this weekend for our first year anniversary treat. We were met at reception by Gunther, who set the tone for our wonderful stay. Gunther recommended a local Italian restaurant for our special anniversary dinner and made the booking for us for the following night. We had an amazing dinner in the hotel restaurant on our first night - the steak was outstanding, the cocktails delicious and the staff and ambience superb. When we returned to our suite (a very reasonable and good value upgrade) there was a bottle of bubbly and a hand written anniversary card waiting for us! A visit to the spa on Saturday was equally wonderful, with friendly staff and lovely treatment facilities. The local Italian was excellent, and Gunther had tipped them off that it was our anniversary, so we had an extra special dessert laid on for us! This hotel is brilliant all round, but one of the best of many things it's got going for it is the staff. Gunther in particular couldn't have done enough for us and helped make our stay so special. Thank you Marylebone Hotel for an amazing weekend. ",5,2015,08,23
123,"Staff exceptionally helpful,excellent value","Excellent value and staff; particularly Gunther at the front desk who quickly understood our needs and modified our original room allocation to meet our expectations. As well, the bellman, Kashif, was not only permanently smiling but also of excellent advice of all sorts. As we also conduct business in London we will assuredly return to this excellent property.",4,2015,08,23
123,Great smart child friendly hotel in central London,The hotel looks great and has a good restaurant and bar. The staff are also very friendly and professional (especially with children) and the location is excellent (5 mins walk from Oxford st). Look forward to our next visit!,5,2015,08,23
123,Pay the extra - it's worth it.,"If you're looking at this hotel trying to justify the price - yes it is worth it. 

Very nice and friendly staff, good rooms and a comfy bed. 

You may notice some reviews complain about the restaurant noise downstairs. We had a room above the restaurant, and while we did hear a bit of noise on a Friday night, it wasn't late and we were so tired from exploring London, we barely noticed the noise. It's not that bad. But if you are a light sleeper, ask for a room at the front of the hotel. 

Breakfast at the hotel is very good and the service is classy, the restaurant and cafe downstairs is very nice and I found myself having a coffee there every afternoon.

The gym is excellent and there is a pool too. If you like to exercise when you travel, this is a good hotel to book as it is a proper gym with proper facilities - not just a treadmill and a few weights thrown in an empty room. 

The local is very nice. Quiet streets but a short walk to Regent st, Oxford Street and Bond St Station. 

The wifi was very good. Free and reasonably fast.",5,2015,08,23
123,Business house,"Excellent stop as always in this hotel which is now my second home. Service is very good at all stages. Nice interior
Easy to check in and out.
Quiet surrounding
Fitness center in the basement with swimimng pool (free) and in the direct vicinity of Hyde Park for outside run",5,2015,08,21
123,Another lovely stay,"Staying at The Marylebone is one of the best things about a trip to London. After the busy hustle bustle the high streets and several hours of shopping or just a day out at the nearby Regents park, its a real treat to be able to come back to the calmness and luxury of my favourite suite. What makes it stand apart from most other hotels is that I can call in advance and everything is arranged for me just as per my preferences specially when travelling with the little one, and that in itself is part of the relaxation or getting into holiday mode when you know that things are being taken care of for you. A special thanks to Mr. Gunther in Guest Relations for that !",5,2015,08,20
123,My usual business stopover,"The Hotel is ideally located for both business and Leisure.
It really is in the heart of it all.
It has become home from home.
The staff are excellent in every way.
A special thanks to Gunther who goes above and beyond to ensure the 
hotel lives up to its reputation. He is an asset!",5,2015,08,20
123,Wonderful service and location,The service was very welcoming and efficient. Would most definitely recommend this hotel to anybody thinking of staying in London. The gym is fantastic and well equipped also. Thank-you Marylebone Hotel for a pleasant stay.,5,2015,08,20
123,Great Stay,"My husband and I have stayed at this hotel two years in a row. Lovely hotel and fabulous location.  The rooms are very nice and the bar/restaurant is great. Everyone is very helpful and we would certainly return.. Marylebone High Street is a plus.

A special mention to Gunther, who always ensures a smooth check in and will always help with any request!",5,2015,08,19
123,"Style, Comfort and great service.  Wonderful location.  Feels like a boutique hotel but has world class amenities.","Great vibe, great use of space.  Restaurant and bar are excellent.  Service is exceptional, especially Aurora at reception and Long, one of the managers.  No request is too difficult and they are immediately responsive and persistent in solving a problem or helping create a great experience.",5,2015,08,18
123,Home from Home,"I always stay in The Marylebone Hotel when I am in London (which is at least two days a week!).  My stay usually starts with a warm welcome from Gunther on the front desk.  He is always so helpful, I am instantly put at ease and nothing is too much bother.  It is  the reason why I keep coming back, the staff are so friendly and attentive, it really is a home from home for me.  The location is ideal, very central, without the noise!  Very comfortable stylish rooms, cannot recommend it highly enough.",5,2015,08,18
123,Breakfast ,"The food and service was great one of the staff members was really helpful to us. I believe his name was Al Addin, him and his team were great, therefore I can say that it was a pleasure to be served by such good people like him and his team. Love it!

",5,2015,08,18
123,reception & concierge,"The staff is great. Gunther, Mohammed and Rahim are great guys. I can't remember everyone's name but shout to the whole staff. I will be back for sure! There are many hotels in London so when you find everything you need...it makes things easier. I've been staying here since they opened. I lady named Gunilla worked there at that time. I'm not sure where she also was excellent.",5,2015,08,17
123,Fantastic ,"A very enjoyable stay...

The room, facilities & location of hotel were fantastic. 

Staff were most helpful and friendly particularly Gunther at reception. 

Great restaurants surrounding hotel with a variety of options of cuisine. 

I will definitely be returning to London and this hotel soon.

",5,2015,08,17
123,Wonderful hotel,"This is a very beautiful hotel set just a short way from Oxford Street. The staff could not have been more helpful and the room was spacious, bigger than a lot of hotel rooms in London. I will definetely stay again!

123,My favorite London hotel,"Wonderfully located and superbly stylish hotel. I have been staying here 5 years every time I've come to London, clocking up some 70 nights. Don't get tired of it, never will! Staff are amazing and today (16/8/15) Gunther was absolutely superb checking me in! ",5,2015,08,16
123,fantastic hotel with superb location and brilliant staff,"Ourselves and four other friends stayed at this hotel for a weekend break and I would just like to say what a fantastic hotel this is, after a small complaint about one of the rooms we were immediately upgraded, The rooms were very clean and offered all you could need , The full English breakfast was superb and the staff were fantastic. Definitely a brilliant location too and we will definitely be returning to this hotel. We often come to London for a little getaway and we have stayed at many hotels , but this hotel is by far the best , five stars and a real winner !!!!!!!",5,2015,08,16
123,Second stay in 2 years,"My wife and I stayed here 2 years ago and our stay was superb then, this time we stayed 2 days longer and we were even happier.  The staff are very good and extremely helpful with good local advice. I would and will recommend this hotel to all of our friends and especially the trave agent who re booked us here.",5,2015,08,16
123,Favorite London Hotel,"I have been staying at the Marylebone consistently for the past five years. While there are definitely larger and more modern hotels in the city, nothing compares to the Marylebone in terms of hospitality and warmth. In addition, it is located in probably the quaintest area of London and it is close to great shipping and dining areas. I have come to appreciate the staff at the hotel, and they always greet me like family. I want to call out Gunther in particular. He is one of the kindest and most professional people I have ever met in my travels and I can always count on him for ideas when I'm in London. He, as well as the rest of the staff, go above and beyond for guests. I strongly recommend the Marylebone Hotel for the consummate British experience. ",5,2015,08,16
123,Perfect location with excellent staff,"I always stay at this Hotel when I am in London. Perfect location for shopping, dining and other big city activities. Top performing staff, always going the extra mile to please their guests. The hotel also comes with a nice gym, restaurant, pool and a bar. ",5,2015,08,16
123,My Best choice in London! ,"I always  stay at the marylebone hotel when I visit London. Love the location, hotel is great and the staff is always so friendly and willing to go the extra mile. I  would particularly like to mention Gunther Schildwachter who makes sure I always feel at home away from home!  ",5,2015,08,16
123,My 60th Birthday,"The service I have received from Gunther and all the staff at the Marylebone Hotel, goes beyond the call of duty. Both on my birthday bash and on all my previous many stays here, they have always gone that extra mile to make me and my family feel welcome.The room this time for my 60th birthday was one of the newly refurbished Terrace suites on the 7th floor.It has a wonderful outdoor entertaining balcony with relaxing seating,heating and spectacular views over London. The location is perfect with colourful local shopping and eating facilities and close to Oxford street.It is handy for the tubes but not noisy.Gunther organised a lovely little birthday cake and some complimentary drink for my husband and four children who also stayed over the weekend.A memory to treasure. Thank you Gunther",5,2015,08,16
123,Marleybone hotel,"We are frequent guests of this hotel and feel like home .the staff member Mr Gunther is very warm wellcoming person he does our bookings in minutes and if any of our guests needs assistance he looks after with big smile 😊

123,Too good,"All I wanna say that it's my future address in London. Central location, great and courteous staff. From the time you step in ie Jack, Mohammad and Kashif at the door to Gunther at the reception. Gunther was too friendly and a real problem solver. He is the man when you are in trouble. 

Best place to stay when you're in London. ",5,2015,08,15
123,Best price/location in London !,"The Marylebone Hotel is absolutely great. I travel to London every 3 months for 1 week and I can assure you that you will not get a better deal for price/location. Just 2 blocks from Oxford Street/Bond St Station. Rooms are neat, clean and the quite. 
The staff is absolutely kind and helpful. 

Hint: Ask for Gunter at the front desk when you check in.... he's been in the hotel for years.. very nice guy and will make sure you get the best experience during your stay at the hotel.",5,2015,08,15
123,Excellent Hotel,"Rooms spacious, light and contemporary.  Staff are truly amazing, nothing is too much trouble.. food delicious and amazing amenities.  Highly recommend staying in such an amazing hotel and superb location.",5,2015,08,14
123,"As they say, ""spot on!""","TA's enthusiastic reviews of the hotel led us here in December 2014, and we were in complete agreement with all the positive reviews.  Everything is very well done in an understated but up-to-date way.  For a London hotel, it feels like a very good value.  Be prepared, the bathrooms are tight, but their swanky decor and fittings make up for it. It was Christmas, and the staff even left teddy bear presents for my sons on their beds at tuck-in.  The neighborhood is central but absolutely charming and small scale; you feel like you're coming home after a busy day sightseeing in London.",5,2015,08,13
123,Weekend in london,"Stayed here for my birthday on the 9th of August. Beautiful hotel, lovely staff, great facilities!!
Lovely spa.  Breakfast was very good, with a good choice of cooked or continental. Room was a nice size, bed was very comfortable.",5,2015,08,12
123,The service and food are outstanding!,"Our family spent several days at this hotel and absolutely loved it! The rooms are lovely and comfortable, the people are friendly and helpful and the food is delicious at any time of the day.  We would definitely make this hotel a destination when we return to London!",5,2015,08,11
123,Great London Hotel,"This hotel is situated in a perfect location which is, Wellbeck Street.It is so near Oxford Street with all the lovely department stores. Also you can walk round the corner to Marylebone High street and then stroll into the lovely tranquil Regents Park , The staff are all amazing very polite and helpful. Special thanks to Otto who works in the lounge. He has amazing knowledge on the computer and Chris who was our breakfast waiter. Two lovely young lads who should both get on to senior positions in hospitality.",5,2015,08,11
123,The coziest and homeliest boutique hotel in central london,"Four minutes walk from Oxford Street! Shopaholics please get ready!
Hotel staff were so warm and helpful even though I had to change my bookings at arrival and required extra explanations at departure.
Room cleaning was twice daily, with utmost professionalism!",5,2015,08,10
123,"Great Hotel, excellent location, friendly staff","First time staying in this hotel, def wont be the last.  Excellent location and friendly staff made our stay pleasant.  Rooms were clean and spacious.  This will probably be my go to london hotel from now on.",5,2015,08,10
123,"Amazing hotel, excellent service","I stayed here in July for 2 nights with friends. Hotel,  room's,  breakfast and bar were all amazing.  Cocktails and food in the bar were excellent.  Service from all the team was second to none.  Breakfast was to very high standard and breakfast room is decorated beautifully.  From the second you walk into reception you are looked after by a really nice friendly team in every part of the hotel.  ",5,2015,08,06
123,Fantastic Stay!,"Stayed here many times over the years and have watched the hotel transform into a fabulous 5 star hotel in a perfect village location, yet walking distance to all of the Central and West End attractions.

The reservation staff were friendly and helpful, the welcome at reception was excellent and included a top parking tip from concierge which saved us a small fortune over the weekend. We received a complimentary upgrade to a beautiful suite, made full use of the bar and restaurant, and thoroughly enjoyed the breakfast.

A special mention to Gunther on reception for his hospitality. All in all, a perfect stay!",5,2015,08,03
123,Great Hotel,Had a lovely stay. Lovely part of London. Hotel is about 10 mins walk from Oxford Street. The lobby/reception area is very well presented with friendly staff. The hotel was nice and clean. Room was a a good size and nicely decorated. Really enjoyed our stay. Would happily stay here again.,5,2015,08,03
123,A real gem!,"This is a super hotel where the rooms, service, food and drinks are excellent. From Minel on the front door to the superb maitre d' in the restaurant we were properly looked after. Thank you! It's location is just right...close enough to shops and restaurants yet situated in a quiet street - perfect!",5,2015,08,02
123,Perfect city hotel for break in London,"Having just returned from a short stay at the Marylebone Hotel, I would be happy to recommend this to anyone looking for a great place to stay in central London, just off Oxford Street. My wife and I enjoyed lunch, cocktails and breakfast at the hotel. The food and drinks were excellent. The crab on Guinness bread is a favourite. The gym and swimming pool are far better than most hotels I have stayed at, with the Bellagio still top of my list! For a city hotel, the pool is large and quiet (early in the morning anyway). The location is stunning, right next to Marylebone High Street and a 10 minute walk from Mayfair. The service throughout was efficient and pleasant. Well worth a visit!",5,2015,08,02
123,Special Hotel,This is where I will always stay in London. On a very quiet street but 100 yards from lots of activity. The room struck me as small but I got used to it and it was actually larger than some. Nicely laid out. Service at every level great. Public areas are billiantly done. Nice restaurant attached. Super place.,5,2015,08,01
123,My go to home from home,"Not the chicest of hotels but nonetheless very comfortable and staff are willing to help with any request. Great location. Some rooms better than others and sometimes a standard is better than the deluxe. Third dimension gym on site is excellent and the hotel bar 108 is also very good. 
Compared to other London hotels in this location and for this price, this is a a good choice.",3,2015,07,29
123,You get what you pay for!,"We were in London to see a matinee (Sinatra) so decided to make a night of it and go for a meal afterwards and stay the night. We live in Greater London so it's not a long distance. We had a fantastic meal in the hotel restaurant and the whole experience was great. The service was excellent from the second we arrived. We did pay a bit more but it was worth it. The room wasn't huge but for a night (or a weekend), it was fine. All staff were polite. Really enjoyed it and would recommend this and that's not something I do often!",5,2015,07,29
123,Perfect hotel in perfect location ,"We were both very happy with our stay in the Marylebone, the hotel is clean and modern, the room was very spacious and was very quiet, but only a 5 minute walk to oxford street, so is the perfect location for a shopping trip! Staff were friendly and very helpful. ",5,2015,07,29
123,"I love this hotel - great combo of sensible boutique, business needs and tourism.","I stayed there for business on a friend's recommendation.  It has always been perfect.  The first time was the best--I had a wonderful room in the front that was just the right size, not too big, not too small, everything perfectly appointed.   It has everything you need: robe, slippers, makeup mirror, coffee machine, kettle on request, TV, wifi, plenty of plugs, plenty of hangers, light, quick room service, hot delicious food, easy access to shops, tubes, cabs, bellboys to help you get them, everything.   The second time I stayed the room was not as nice--the carpet was grubby and I moved the bed to cover a spot on the floor that looked as though an infant had been murdered there.   (Better room cleaning might be a good idea.)    I was also not able to check into my room till way past the cut-off date.   Also, both times I did not end up in my original room.  In the first case I had the lowest-grade room.  The receptionist offered to switch me off the bat, saying it was not suitable for a long stay, and he was right.  When it turned out to be at the end of a long corridor, with barely enough room to put my suitcase in--and then when I discovered someone else's clothes still in it!--I decided to switch and he very kindly gave me an upgrade at no cost, although it took some time to figure this out.  The second time, they gave me a better room, but it too was at the end of one of those long corridors and looked out over a building site, so I asked for another room which took ages to resolve.  As a result, I wasn't able to check in till early evening (how can that be? Okay, so it was just before Christmas and they were completely full, but it WAS long past check-out!) which really threw off my first day.   And then I got the ""baby's-been-murdered-here"" room.   Still, it remains my favorite business hotel.  I always feel mournful leaving.  So they must be doing something right.",5,2015,07,28
123,Warm metropolitan atmosphere,"Great location for this elegantly modern hotel with the a soft warm touch and great facilities.
Very good breakfast, high standard service, gym up to date.
Standard rooms a little tight, choose them for a very short stay or ask for the better size one, it is a good value option.
A lot of different and good options for supper at 5 minutes walk.
Management highly professional and very attentive to the customers' needs, they really care. 
My favorite hotel in London.",5,2015,07,27
123,What a very pleasant surprise!,"I stayed here on a fleeting business trip this week and was very pleasantly surprised by just about everything. The very high level of friendly, helpful professionalism is as good as I have experienced in top boutique hotels in Asia..& that is truly a compliment. From the moment I arrived, through the efficiency of the business centre to final brunch and car booked to the airport, I simply cannot fault the staff. Superb...& they all work really well together which create a great atmosphere. Room service was excellent and my room to a very good standard. Keep up the super attention to detail, the highly impressive staff and overall quality of food, decor & ambience and this is certainly a hotel I would highly recommend for business or pleasure.",5,2015,07,26
123,Great hotel in a great area,"I have been staying at this hotel for a while  (four times this month). Its location is superb - Marylebone High Street is very close and has a real village feel which is unusual in the middle of London - lots of good eating places, supermarkets, book shop, even a laundry that charges by the bag. Oxford Street is also very close if you like shopping with crowds, and the nearest tube is Bond Street (Central and Jubilee lines).
Wifi is free which is a huge plus for me.
Food and beverage is expensive, but the the bar is nice and does a mean cocktail. Rooms are variable in size, generally not too small by London standards but you would not call them spacious. Staff are always helpful. Pricing is variable and if you are paying top dollar it will disappoint - it is it really good but not great.
",5,2015,07,22
123,It's the One,"We spent a week at the Marylebone Hotel.  What a great experience!  We'll definitely come back to this hotel our next trip to London.  

What sets this hotel apart from others is not the physical plant -- like so many hotels abroad, the rooms are small and the hallways are dark -- but the extraordinary staff.  From the concierge to the cleaning crew, everyone was so helpful, polite, and kind.  As soon as we checked in and were waiting for our room to become available, Long Voong, the hotel's guest relations manager, took us in hand, welcoming us to the establishment and serving us snacks and coffee.  He was equally nice throughout our visit.  Can't say good things enough about him.  

The other wonderful feature of this hotel is its location.  If you seek the company of crowds -- and I do mean crowds -- then the madness of Oxford Street is only an eight-minute walk away.  However, far more fun and rewarding is the neighborhood around the hotel itself.  Marylebone High Street is just around the corner, full of interesting shops and elegant-to-casual restaurants.  Just beyond the high street is a lovely little park, Paddington Street Gardens, a jewel of peace and beauty.  Our room looked out on the tiny Golden Eagle pub, another jewel in its own way.

Transportation to and from the hotel is easy.  At least one taxi always seems to be waiting outside the hotel on Welbeck Street.  (Uber we gave up on, as the their drivers seem mystified by the maze of little streets around the hotel.)  Paddington and St Pancras stations are quite accessible for about eight to ten pounds.  More often we used London buses, especialy the number 13, which traverses Oxford Street and the West End, all of which are within easy walking distance of the hotel.

Thumbs up for the Marylebone Hotel!",5,2015,07,22
123,Wonderful hotel and a faultless stay!,"My husband and I stayed at The Marylebone as part of surprise birthday present for him.  We chose the hotel for its location and the fact it has a swimming pool on site, but were impressed by so much more than these two, admittedly great, details!  Firstly the staff do so much to create a memorable stay. They are exceptionally friendly and attentive without ever being intrusive.  Attention to detail is also magnificent - when I checked in, I was asked what plans I had for my husband's birthday and whether I required any help in any way.  When we returned to our room, to our surprise and delight, a card, a bottle of Prosecco and some delicious chocolates were awaiting us.  What a wonderfully personal touch - thank you so much to the Marylebone team!  The bed was supremely comfortable and our room was extremely quiet.  We had a very good night's sleep and could hardly believer we were in London, let alone a stone's throw from the bustle of Oxford Street!  The bathroom is small, as other reviewers have noted, but perfectly laid out and with very nice Aromatherapy Associates toiletries.  Breakfast was delicious with masses of choice, wonderful service and in the very attractive setting of the 108 Pantry.  The Third Space gym in the basement is also a delight - way bigger and more comprehensive than most hotel gyms, and the 18m pool was a wonderful treat.  All in all an exceptional stay in a really delightful hotel.  What a treat to find somewhere that delivers so much more than the bland corporate experience so many other London hotels offer.  We will be back!",5,2015,07,22
123,I just love this hotel.,"I really can't say enough good things about this hotel. My mother and father stayed there every time they went to London and now my mother and I stay there every time we go to London.
I will hit upon the high points: the staff are extremely friendly, polite and helpful. The atmosphere in the hotel just makes you feel comfortable. The location is great, just a few blocks to Oxford Circus or Bond Street for shopping, sightseeing or the Underground.The breakfast bar is extremely well managed, and the regular bar (108) comfortable and friendly. The rooms are nicely laid out, sizing varies depending upon your needs.They were clean, nicely decorated and are very well maintained.
We were there during the first week of Wimbledon when temps were in the 90s. Fortunately, unlike a lot of places in London, the hotel and room were fully air-conditioned.
From the doorman at the front of the hotel to check-in, the process was easy. A hot towel and a bottle of water was provided at the reception desk.And let me not forget, free wifi throughout the hotel, even in the rooms.
All said, we love this hotel and will keep going back again, again and again.",5,2015,07,21
123,Hotel with exceptional service,"The rooms are very comfortable and the service is excellent.  For me the welcome and personable service is what really makes this a fantastic hotel to say in, everyone of the staff seem to go that extra mile to ensure that all your needs are met. Makes any stay even a business trip far more enjoyable.",5,2015,07,20
123,A perfect stay in London,"The Marylebone Hotel is absolutely wonderful, almost beyond words ! Obviously, the location is ideal, but so are the rooms, members of staff and services provided during the stay. You can either relax in the hammam/sauna or go for a swim in the amazing swimming pool (the water leaves your skin smooth as if you just got out of the river - but not the Thames, thank God). Not being the sporty type, we didn't really go to the gym, but it still looked incredible !",5,2015,07,20
123,"Great hotel, great location","On our last visit to London, my wife and I stayed at another Doyle Collection property, The Kensington Hotel. I decided to opt for The Marylebone Hotel on our recent return visit and we weren't disappointed.  

Great, hotel, great service and equally great location with many restaurant, shops and bars within immediate walking distance. 

We'll stay here again.",4,2015,07,19
123,"Healthy mind, body, & hotel","If you take care of your body, you should definitely stay here.

There is a proper gym with state-of-the-art equipent and classes. The pool is big (i think 25 metres) and one can swim laps with or without the boards and fins they provide, in case you'd like to work on your stroke.

The restaurant offers egg-white omelettes and a low-fat selection of smoothies and cereals.

The comfy bed will allow you to re-energize and work-visit London the next day. 

I went back home to Paris in better condition than when I left :-)

123,A charming hotel in Central London,"The Marylebone Hotel delivers a combination of elegance, comfort, and first-class facilities that's hard to find in a busy, hectic city like London. Its interiors are chic and well-appointed, with thoughtful touches like free tea and coffee in the mornings, and ice lemon water on hot days. Staff are friendly and helpful, and that's not just a cliche. 

The biggest drawback is that the rooms are small, but this is to be expected in Central London. You will find the bathrooms difficult to maneuver in as well. But everything is comfortable, extremely clean, and well-maintained. Free coffee and tea in your room, as well as 2 bottles of mineral water every evening, although you have to remind the housekeeping staff to refill the tea and sugar. 

The quality of food both in room service and the pantry and brasserie is wonderful, although the room service menu is limited. Everything is fresh and well-made, and will be done to your liking. (I would have loved some pasta dishes) There is a children's menu and the entire hotel is very child-friendly. The lobby cafe is also really nice, and it's relaxing to have a cup of coffee while sitting on the large, comfy sofas and watching people walk by on the street from the large windows. 

A nice place to stay, in a great neighborhood (Oxford Street literally a five minute walk) and Marylebone High Street is fun to explore. I'd come here again, but I'd try to get a bigger room.",4,2015,07,18
123,Comfortable and central!,The staff at this hotel were amazing! We'd been traveling for some time and they arranged an early check in and pointed us to a wonderful breakfast spot! The hotel is situated just behind Oxford street which is a 5 minute walk from Bond street station-perfect!,5,2015,07,18
123,Fantastic!!!,"Had a 2 night stay at this hotel with a friend to celebrate our birthdays. We had a  great stay! 
Staff are very friendly and went out of their way to help us. Room was spotless, with slippers, robes and plenty of toiletries.  
Great location, close to shops, bars and tube stations. 

Can't wait to return!",5,2015,07,17
123,"Lovely hotel, slightly overpriced","My partner and I stayed here for 1 night. The hotel itself is in a great location, very close to Bond Street and Baker Street tube stations, but tucked away on a much quieter street. The staff were all very friendly and helpful, the room service was great (especially the breakfast - best black pudding I've ever had!) and the romantic turndown was a really nice touch. 

The room was nice, but a little tired and pokey which is the only reason I haven't given 5/5. One of our robes was dirty with makeup and there were some small grubby marks on the walls.  I just felt it wasn't quite worth what I paid. Having said that, the bed was very comfortable and the pillows were a dream. We had a couple of drinks from the mini-bar which were priced as you would expect from a hotel of this standard. 

Upon checking out, there was an extra charge on our bill which I didn't recognise. The staff promptly removed the mystery charge AND our minibar charges for the ""inconvenience"". 

Overall I had a great stay at The Marylebone and would definitely recommend.",4,2015,07,16
123,Amazing experience,"The Marylebone appears to be in a residential area but is actually quite close to central London. It is not inexpensive but reasonable for a nice hotel in London or any other big city, for that matter. We had air conditioning, a nice sized room and comfortable bed. What make the hotel special is the staff. They went out of there way to be helpful and friendly. On our next trip to London we will be staying at The Marylebone Hotel.",5,2015,07,15
123,Nice hotel in the heart of London ,"I stay in this hotel everytime i go to London. The rooms are Nice but If you like Space don t take the first category which is really small and next to the elevators.
Rooms are quiet and the hotel has been renovated in the last years.
Perfectly located If you Want to go to theaters If go shopping ( close from régent street)
The breakfast is really Nice ( what you expect in an inglish hotel)",4,2015,07,13
123,Poor Customer Service and Not kid friendly,"I spent 90 pounds on a dinner for one where I was squeezed between 2 tables.  I asked the hostess are you serious? She nodded and smiled.  When trying to sit down I knocked over the lamp on the table of a person sitting on that table. It was lucky that she had finished her meal. Then when trying to get out I had to put my arms on the seat of the table next to me and get on my hands and knees to get out. Staff looked on. When I asked to complain I was told that they would send the email to my room. Still waiting.

Then I decided well that my kids were staying with me for 1 night so lets forget it and make the best of it. Firstly it was the girls birthday (12) so I thought I would treat them to a mocktail. Entered the bar at 6:50 and was told that there are a no kids rule at 7 and was asked to leave or go to the pantry

Again not to be put off we decided to go swimming (9am) in the morning but was told that there are only 2 slots a day for kids. One straight after breakfast (10:30) which means you are not allowed to swim just after you have eaten so making it impossible. 
At 300 pounds a night I can honestly suggest that you find a much better hotel very near for half the cost and better service. And I am even top of their reward chain and still ignored ! However the guy at the door (concierge) was very good.",1,2015,07,12
123,Good but...,"Rooms were decent but small, staff was generally very good. Unfortunately on our last breakfast we were forced to move due to a horde of children who's parents did not even make an attempt to control them and the staff did not help us move to another table. We are gha black member card holders and were disappointed with this experience considering the rest of the experience was enjoyable",4,2015,07,11
123,there HAVE to be better business hotels in london; pick one of them,"Good things: nice bathroom with heated floors, comfortable bed, strong a/c, walking distance to lots of restaurants and cafes. 

Bad things: 
- So, so, SO noisy -- We face the road. Road construction has been insane during my trip and the sound insulation for the room is just awful. I know the hotel can't help construction, but wow -- I can't have phone calls, it's that bad. 
- Spotty wifi yesterday though it's ok today 
- Windows don't have blackout shades; the cheap mini-blinds let lots of morning light in. I love light-filled rooms, but all hotels of this caliber have blackout shades. 
- Fire alarm went off in the morning (apparently this is a weekly thing) but there was no notification this would happen so it was a surprise. 
- I asked the front desk to move us to a new interior room around noon, and they said they would accommodate us (which was good). However, we've been waiting almost 4 hours for them to notify us the new room is ready and it's not. 

I really wish we had chosen a different hotel. :(",3,2015,07,10
123,Sweet Boutique!,"Found this W1 gem through TripAdvisor. From reception to the cafe (108 Pantry) to the bar (108 Brasserie), the Marylebone's staff are friendly, accommodating and professional.
Our room was well conceived, but in need of an update.
The bathroom shower/tub combo is more tub than shower. It is virtually impossible to shower without creating a diluvial event on the floor of the bathroom.
Room service was prompt, courteous and efficient, but the Brits will never understand how to make a strong cup of coffee.
Traveler Tip: We asked the concierge to book a car to retrieve us at 5 o'clock one afternoon. When the car was a no show, we called only to find out that it had been booked for 5am the next day instead of 5pm that afternoon. When confronted the concierge accepted full responsibility and offered an apology. Although most Brits are simpatico w. Americans when it comes to hours of the day, the EU has resulted in staffing in the UK being very Continentals. Best to use ""military time"" whenever making plans (5pm = 17hours).",4,2015,07,08
123,"Beautiful, central London hotel!","The Marylebone hotel is located in the perfect location for sightseeing, shopping, and just wandering around. The neighborhood is upscale and safe with great restaurants and the main shopping area all within a few minutes walk away. 

Wifi connection was excellent, the staff was accommodating, and the gym at The Third Space was one of the best hotel gyms I've ever been to!

Though the room decor was beautiful, the room itself was much smaller than expected with barely enough room to navigate around the bed. I would only recommend the smallest room choice for solo travelers! It was quite difficult enough trying to squeeze around the room, but even more impossible with 2 suitcases on the floor.",4,2015,07,08
123,Great location!,"In the heart of central London, couldn't get any better if that's where you want to be! A good reception and a welcome pot of tea that is great after a long flight. Rooms are a bit on the smaller side though well appointed. Within walking distance to Oxford Street and restaurants, including an Indian restaurant ""Woodlands"".",4,2015,07,08
123,Great hotel,"We stayed at The Marylebone Hotel for the second time, for 5 nights. We enjoyed our stay extremely and this is mainly due to the outstanding service, care, personal and professional attention from Gunther SChildwachter (guest relations agent). He gave that added value that makes it definite that we will staying with you again during our next visit to London. He deserves the recognition for his amazing work ethics.",4,2015,07,07
123,"Great service, amazing location","Stayed here just two nights on business.

I got in early in the morning on my first day and was given a room right away, which always endears a hotel to me after coming in on a redeye.

Rooms are clean, bed is comfortable, good toiletries, good TV, nice coffee machine.",5,2015,07,06
123,Perfect central London hotel,"My wife and I (belatedly) celebrated her birthday at the hotel this weekend. We stayed one night in a junior suite and we could not have been happier. The suite was modern, clean, spacious and had lovely views of London. The service at all times was exceptional and we even returned from a shopping trip to find a complementary bottle of sparking wine in an ice bucket, with a note wishing my wife a happy birthday.
We made good use of the Gym and Spa facilities and the breakfast was excellent.
The location of the hotel is central but in a quiet street and I felt the hotel provided good value. I would love the opportunity to stay there again.",5,2015,07,06
123,"Very central, small rooms, exceptional gym","The hotel is very conveniently located to Bond street and the centre of London. As most hotels in the centre of London, rooms are relatively small. I stayed at a superior room, which is larger than a regular room, and even then had to navigate in the tight space between the door and the bed.  The bathroom was also very small.

Service was friendly, the bed very comfortable and water pressure ok. 

The gym was exceptionally big compared to other hotels and is also a ""regular gym"" for outside visitors.",4,2015,07,05
123,Great Location,This is my second stay at The Marylebone Hotel - fantastic location however like all London hotel - the room and bathroom are bit small - great if you a solo traveler! The wifi are great most time and i wish they have more channel on tv beside BBC - just for traveler who's jet lag and not able to go to sleep at 2am.,5,2015,07,03
123,Fantastic hotel in central London ,"We had a fantastic time at the Marlybone Hotel. All the staff were helpful and friendly. The room was well laid out and the bed really comfortable. They made us very welcome, even giving me a card, chocolates and prosecco for my birthday. 

The pool was great and they have a proper gym, not just a few rusty weights! 

I can't recommend this place highly enough. We will definitely go back. ",5,2015,07,03
123,Fantastic friendly service ,"The staff at this hotel make it stand out above others in my option. From the doorman to the concierge, they couldn't do enough to help us out on our stay in London. The room was nice too with a great coffee machine! My only disappointment was the lack of hot chocolate in the drinks tray ;) ",4,2015,07,03
123,Exemplary service. Great night's sleep. Free wifi,"Have stayed here a few times on business recently and thought i should write to commend the place. Highly recommended for central London with easy access to Oxford st etc. 
Wonderful comfy beds. Thoughtful little touches in the rooms (although a couple of rooms have been on the small side, every thing has been considered and they are well designed to make best use of limited space).
Most importantly the service is extraordinarily good. Unobtrusive but unfailingly respectful and polite.",5,2015,07,03
123,london hotel,This hotel was in a good central position with nice staff and a very good restaurant. The room was a bit small but very comfortable. Make sure you get the english breakfast as it will set you up for the day,3,2015,07,02
123,Great hospitality,Great stuff great location very nice rooms breakfast is very good. We will come back.4 min walk from Oxford st. 15 min from marbel arch and hyde park. Nice resturants in the area. Very clean and nice neighborhood.,5,2015,06,29
123,Exceeded all expectations!,"My husband and I finished up a 10 day cruise out of Southampton with a 4 night stay in London.  Our travel agent had suggested the Marylebone and we were more than pleased with our stay there.  Everyone from the reception desk staff, the Concierge (Rahim), the Guest Relations Manager (Long), the restaurant staff and housekeeping were friendly, courteous, extremely helpful and always smiling.  We would absolutely stay there again!",5,2015,06,28
123,"Beautiful Hotel, Perfect Neighbourhood","My friend and I stayed one Saturday night and we really enjoyed the hotel! The neighborhood was perfectly located as it is on a quiet street in a beautiful area but just a few short blocks from shopping, restaurants and pubs. Our room was beautifully decorated and the bed and pillows were very comfortable and made for a restful night sleep after a day of walking. We will be back as we forgot our swim suits and didn't get to enjoy the pool!",5,2015,06,28
123,Romantic Retreat,"Husband and I were celebrating his 40th birthday and so we decided to treat ourselves and we were delighted with our choice.

We choice the romantic retreat package and the champagne, breakfast in bed and late check out were very much appreciated.

After going out to dinner, we returned to the hotel and used the bar, which was great.

The service during our stay was amazing. 

So why not an excellent rating? The gym is good with extensive facilities and the pool was great, however the area's look quiet tired and the steam room was not working on the morning we checked out. The fact that the sauna's are small and in the changing rooms meant husband and I had to use them separately.

The room was lovely, but the bathroom was very small. This is just something to remember when booking.

I would highly recommend this hotel. The location is great, service first class and a real treat.",4,2015,06,26
123,The right one for me!,"It was my first time in this hotel, and certainly not the last.
I have looked for a good hotel for this business trip that would not only be well located but also with a swimming pool ;-)
Well this one has it all!
Excellent service and facilities,
Perfect location,
Great room, with a nesspresso machine ,
Very good breakfast and nice bar,
And most important for me...swimming pool. And a great one.

I had a very first time experience in this hotel, i will definitely come back    ",5,2015,06,26
123,"Nicely designed rooms, a good night's sleep, really great staff","I was pleasantly surprised by the hotel in Marlylebone, conveniently located near Oxford Street in a lovely neighbourhood full of cafes, restaurants, pubs, bakeries, and charming-but-not-that- touristy shops.  Rooms are quite small -- normal for London hotels - but newly decorated and very clean and comfortable.  Check out the many public areas - the design is inviting and super cool.  Staff couldnt be more friendly or competent.  A nice change from some of the worn out, tired, dreery and over worked hotels in the city, I'll definitely be back.",4,2015,06,25
123,Another Great Experience,"It's been a while since we stayed at the Marylebone, but much like putting on a favourite sweater, it feels great almost straight away.  This time we stayed in one of the refitted studio suites, which was both roomy, spotlessly clean and to be fair a little larger than we expected.  Another bonus was to find a huge bed, and not like so many hotels nowadays two single beds zipped together.  Although we did not dine that evening, we certainly sat at the cocktail bar, which was bustling, and sampled several cocktails expertly mixed in front of us.

It goes without saying that the breakfast is top notch, again it delivered in spades providing just enough energy to allow me to sleep through the train journey home !

Well done to all the staff, we will return",5,2015,06,24
123,Fantastic hotel in central London,"My boyfriend and I stayed at The Marylebone Hotel for two nights when we visited London and it is by fair the best hotel experience I have ever had in London. Great atmosphere, extremely attentive staff and an overall feeling of luxury. 

The rooms were small but nice. The restaurant and bar was amazing and the breakfast had everything you could wish for. 

I can truly recommend this hotel.",5,2015,06,23
123,Lovely hotel,I've been to this hotel twice now and it really is lovely. Staff are so friendly and concierge are attentive. Reception staff give a bottle of water upon checkout which is a nice gesture. Rooms are modern and clean and beds comfy. If you can afford to stay (as it can be pricey) then I would recommend. Would definitely stay again.,4,2015,06,23
123,Brilliant Staff,"Stayed overnight 19.6.05 whilst my husband had dental treatment, we stayed for the location as it is within walking distance to Harley street
The Staff were very helpful and went out of the way to make my husband comfortable after his surgery by sending us ice up to the room for ice packs. Lovely comfy beds were an added bonus
Will defiantly stay again, thanks guys you were brilliant",5,2015,06,23
123,Wish I'd Stayed Longer!,"London was just my first stop on a whirlwind tour of the UK, but it was a wonderful place to begin! The staff seemed not just pleased but almost excited that I was there! Actually, it was a very remarkable feeling to be so appreciated, but such is the level of customer service that results in the Marylebone's fine reputation. 

The room was comfortable, the service was prompt, and food preparation was outstanding! I had my first sampling of black pudding as part of a traditional English breakfast, and it was heavenly! 

I will return, but for a longer stay next time!",5,2015,06,22
123,Fantastic Experience!,"Enjoyed 8 nights at The Marylebone Hotel.  From the minute I arrived (very early from US red eye flight) until the time of check out, service was impeccable.  I forgot to lock the safe (which had my passport and US cash) when I traveled north one day for meetings and the manager retrieved from the safe for me and put in their safe until I returned.  Very convenient to trains & Tube. All shopping in walking distance.  Room Service - Excellent!!

Definitely will return!",5,2015,06,22
123,Great all around,"Hotel was picked by tour service.  We arrived early in London and we were checked in by 10:00 AM  It had a great staff, Hotel and Dinning room.  Concierge service as very helpful and took care of all of our needs.  Would definitely stay here again.  Close to most London attraction and transportation.",5,2015,06,20
123,A village feel in the centre of London?,"Stayed for 2 nights, had nothing booked, but this was no obstacle to the concierge. A couple of phone calls had us reservations at  Veerswarmy's for dinner, followed by Ronnie Scotts and The Jersey boys for the following night, remarkable.
All the staff were courteous and helpful and one of the most comfortable beds I have slept in zzzzz
The hotel itself is centrally located, but as we liked the village feel of Marylebone, we opted to have breakfast out both mornings.
A little french bakery served the most delicious breakfast as you ate with the locals.
To our surprise, on the Sunday morning, right behind the high street is a farmers market, which completed a perfect weekend.
5 mins to Oxford Street, my wife did indeed like this hotel.",5,2015,06,17
123,London Visit,"We arrived after a 24 hour flight at about 9.15pm without a hitch.  We were checked in at reception by a young lady with black hair into a room.  I pointed out we were staying 10 nights and was it a good room.  Quiet, not near the lift etc.  She assured me it was.  
What we got was underwhelming.  A room with a queen bed (we had booked junior suite with king bed.  Shower over the bath.  And I then discovered NO air conditioning.
When I phoned reception a young lady arrived who had no idea and she said she would contact maintenance tomorrow.  A young man arrived who also had no idea,
By the time we woke up in the morning the temp. in the room was 27c.  When I phoned down finally a young lady told me that in fact the whole wing had no air conditioning.  They were replacing the aircon. At that point I went down to see the manager Brendon.  I told him among other things if he had not fixed my problem in 1 hour I would be leaving the hotel.
Then I got the chief engineer Kevin.  He was a decent fellow and told me it would probably take 3/4 who knows how many days to fix the problem.  I told him I had no interest whatsoever in their maintenance issued.
After further discussion with the whole management Brendon and Long then gave me a new room.
This room had a king bed, was 20 square meters larger, everything worked.
Later Long (customer service manager) informed me that they had included breakfast for us for the duration of our stay.
The rest of our stay, especially the concierge Rahim was very good, and I would stay here again.",4,2015,06,16
123,thank goodness for this hotel,"눇After coming in after a car crash the staff (Sinead and Jack) could not do enough to help me feel at ease. there is not enough space to rave about these members of staff but they turned my awful day into a fantastic stay. I cant thank them enough. the service of staff is impeccable they go out of their way to ensure you are happy and comfortable. the facilities are top notch and the cleanliness of the hotel is immaculate. my room was perfect and Sinead saw to it that I had a quite room after my hectic day. Jack lifted my spirits (with a complimentary glass of wine) and ensured that I felt comfortable enough to go and have a relaxing time at the pool. thank you thank you. I loved everything about this hotel. the 108 brasserie was a relaxing place to be, the rooms were superb, service perfect. thank you for a amazing weekend. I will not be staying anywhere else in London. thank you",5,2015,06,16

Lovely restaurant.Decor delightful inside the hotel.

123,Excellent hotel close to Oxford Street,"Room was clean, room and bathroom were quite small but nevertheless adequate . Hotel was convenient to Oxford street and Marylebone High Street which is a gem with excellent cafes and bars. Very good service. Friendly and attentive staff. Would stay there again.",4,2015,06,16
123,Staff makes a difference,"Just spent three nights at the Marylebone Hotel on a long weekend to see the sights. Our assigned room did not match our pre-paid spec which was for a king (not queen) bed and deluxe (not standard) room. It was the construction right below the window that caused us to seek an immediate room change. The staff took care of the details and we were given the room we requested. What a difference! Cold A/C, great towels, good shower, comfy bed (although was two twins pushed together), free Wi-Fi, nightly water and chocolates all made a difference. We found the doormen particularly helpful. Our A/C did quit working the last night of our stay, but luckily we could open the windows enough to make things bearable. Within a block or two there was a grocery, french bakery (great breakfast), ATM, and several good restaurants. I can't say I saw an underground station nearby, but we found the taxis to be reasonable given the central location of the hotel. The Wallace Collection was an easy walk away.",4,2015,06,15
123,Four Star Hotel with Five Star Service,"Conveniently located about 5 minutes walk from Bond St Underground on Oxford St.  A rather non-descript modern building in a fairly quiet residential street.  

PLUS POINTS: Outstanding staff and service. Friendly, helpful and they seemed to anticipate your needs in a way associated with the very best hotels. Clean modern rooms all in immaculate condition.  Outstanding breakfast with a great choice of cooked and buffet foods. One of the best!

MINUS POINTS: Even our ""superior"" room wasn't the largest. Bathroom was immaculate but very cramped - not possible to open the door whilst someone was standing at the sink.

OVERALL: Despite the room size issues, would still strongly recommend. Overall excellent!",5,2015,06,15
123,Excellent location with very good service and hospitality,"We have been staying here for last three nights. Located 5 minutes walking distance from Oxford St, yet very quiet area. All needs for travellers are available close by. The hospitality and service in the restaurants and room service is one of the best. The staff is very helpful.",5,2015,06,14
123,Great hotel with excellent staff,The quality of the staff (from the booking via email to the departure in a luxury limo) is the main reason I came back to this hotel. In addition it is very comfortable and has an excellent location (2 min walking distance to Oxford Street but not on a busy street),5,2015,06,11
123,Business ,"Great hotel rooms really good ,ideal location for what we wanted  would certainly use this hotel again . Staff were really helpful ,could not do enough for  you .
Good selection of food available and priced accordingly.would of licked to have stopped for a couple of nights, defiantly will next time ",5,2015,06,11
123,"Some nice touches, with a few minor niggles","I stayed here for one night after a work event that also took place at the hotel.

The room we had for the event was a good size for the number of people we had, well laid out and with plenty of water. The staff were on hand to help with any technical problems regarding the presentation screen, tea and coffee was delivered exactly on time and the biscuits were of a high quality.

Following the event I checked in to my room and was pleasantly surprised by the hot refreshing towel offered. Unusual, but a nice touch. My room on the 1st floor was, I believe, a Superior room but was still not very large, although it did have slippers and dressing gowns available. The bathroom was tiny, but had enough space for one.

I was surprised to see that there was no bottled water in the room, but realised on return after the evening out that it was put out as part of the turn down service. Another nice touch.

I had a few minor niggles that would bother some to varying degrees. Although a couple of small groups were still enjoying drinks at the bar, they stopped serving at around 1am. I realise they can, but I can’t remember the last time I was in a hotel bar of this stature when they stopped service whilst hotel residents were still enjoying drinks (and not cheap ones either). The only way around the problem was to order room service that HAD to be served in the room rather than one of the very nice lounging areas available in the hotel.

Early in the morning my sleep was interrupted by a very odd vibrating noise that I couldn’t even begin to understand where it was coming from and there was also a screaming child (not the hotel’s fault, but I could still hear it). The shower could only be operated by standing in it and getting wet (and therefore cold) and the mirror had no de-mister behind it.

Breakfast was a cosy affair and looked well set out, but only continental was included in the price. Cooked breakfast is available at extra cost.

I did not use the gym or swimming pool so cannot comment, although I notice there were clear times that children WERE allowed in the swimming pool and it was quite restrictive. That’s good/bad depending on how you see it.

The hotel is in a good location being only a few minutes walk from Oxford Street, but far enough away to feel exclusive.

This is a good hotel and I would be happy to return. I swayed between three and four stars for this review, but think that on reflection most would consider it at least a four and had I not had my sleep disturbed I’d probably not even considered three at any point. Note that two people trying to use the tiny bathroom might feel very restricted by the space.",4,2015,06,10
123,Amazing Hotel with All what you need,"great location few hundred meters from Oxford street, quiet area as the window was open by coincidence in one night and I didn't know but the good thing that I didn't feel any sort of noise until I woke up next morning and I am a very shallow sleeper. another good practice that I forgot my two mobile in the room when I left in the morning and when I came back at night I found them in the same place and the room was cleaned by the house keeping.
I recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to stay in a quiet place within few steps from all the vibes.",4,2015,06,09
123,Great Hotel in London Center,"I've stayed in The Marylebone Hotel two times already for a weekend trip and will choose this hotel again in the future when I travel to London. It is well located, in a very safe area, close to Oxford Circus. The rooms and the hotel overall are exceptionally clean. The rooms are indeed small, but you don't need more space and all the amenities you could need are provided. The breakfast buffet is varied, and I was pleasantly surprised this last time with the quality of the à La Carte menu. It's no wonder that you see non-guests coming over for meals. The staff is super helpful, anticipating your needs without being imposing. I've given some feedback during my stays which was not only respectfully accepted, it has also been swiftly taken care of. I definitely recommend this hotel, it's very good value for money.",5,2015,06,09
123,It is what you expect ,"It is conveniently located near Oxford street, it,is modern and clean.
The superior room is just ok in size, modern and clean with a nice bathroom/shower that has a rain type shower that is very refreshing although rather small. 
The hotel staff is very kind, including the people serving at the 108 brasserie on the ground floor, really very good service. 
If you are into a quick shopping trip around Oxford street this is a great choice. 
For rose driving in there is a public car park barely 5 minutes away on foot on the same street. ",4,2015,06,08
123,Another Pleasant Stay at the Marylebone,"My wife and I stayed at the Marylebone Hotel for a total of three nights in May (2 nights in the 2nd week and 1 night in the third week) in a Superior Room.  This review pertains to the 2 night stay (the 1 night stay was identical in every way).

  LOCATION:  The hotel is very conveniently located in the Marylebone area of London (W1). It is a very quiet area and seems to be absent of police and ambulance sirens that are often heard at other hotels located in more busy and tourist-intensive areas.  There are numerous small businesses a short walk away for either shopping or food. Further south is James Street where there are a number of cafes and restaurants for indoor or outdoor dining.  Only a 5min walk south is Oxford Street where the more major retail shopping is found in abundance.

Getting to the hotel is easy via the Underground from Heathrow, however if like most people you have several bags of luggage, hauling them through the Underground is somewhat less appealing. The Heathrow Express to Paddington is also an option and then a short taxi to the hotel.  On this occasion we decided to book a private hire car for our airport transfer that was arranged by the hotel (thanks Simon!) and thus began the exceptional service provided by the Marylebone Hotel.

 SERVICE:  The level of service at this hotel is excellent. Upon arrival in mid-afternoon my wife and I wanted to enjoy the good weather and dine at a rooftop restaurant.  I contacted the concierge Riyas who was able to arrange at the last minute an outdoor table at a fine rooftop restaurant.  Riyas answered any questions that we had informatively and enthusiastically.  In Riyas's absence, Rahim stepped in to offer his services.  Reception was well staffed and efficient. This high level of service was extended to all other staff members that we encountered including housekeeping and the breakfast room staff. 

ROOMS:  We had a room on the fifth floor that was clean and well laid out. It was quiet with minimal to no street noise. The bathroom is small but the floor is heated as well as the mirror which is a nice touch.

 DINING:  We had breakfast at the hotel which was nice. We chose the buffet option which provided a small selection of continental choices.  Staff was attentive.

NOTE: For those of you that like to get a bit of exercise while on holiday, the hotel provides guests with free access to the gym on the lower level. This is not a mere room with an exercise bike and treadmill thrown in it like other hotels. This is a fully functioning fitness facility that has practically every piece of equipment to satisfy most needs.

In room wifi was strong and consistent.

 Overall this is a very, very nice hotel that provides a high standard of service and is located in a convenient an pleasant area. We would stay here again (in fact we did) and recommend it to friends and family.",5,2015,06,07
123,Very Nice Stay at The Marylebone,"I spent three nights at The Marylebone Hotel in a Standard Room.  Overall, I had a pleasant stay and would strongly consider a return to this hotel next time I'm in London.

The room (#241) was comfortable and clean, consisting of a double bed, a desk, large closet and flat screen tv.  There was free in-room wifi, lots of tv channels, minibar and safe.  Bathroom was extremely clean and had great water pressure and heat.  Housekeeping and nightly turn down were well executed.  My room rate included free continental breakfast which was very good.  

The room itself was very small, but not unusual for a big city property.  I had no issue with the square footage, but the low ceiling in the hallways and room entrance (I estimate 7"" ceilings) were uncomfortable  for me at 6""4.  It felt claustrophobic, like you're on a cruise ship.  I'm not sure if that was just on 2nd floor or just in Standard Room, but I would check on availability of rooms with higher ceilings in future.  The only other issue I had was with the electrical outlets, half of which didn't work.

All staff I encountered (front desk, valet, restaurant, housekeeping) were exceedingly polite and helpful.  Really made for a nice stay.  The location was ideal.  Lots to see/do in the surrounding area and easy access to the Underground via the nearby Bond Street station.

I enjoyed my stay at The Marylebone Hotel and recommend.",4,2015,06,05
123,Good hotel,"Good hotel, very friendly stuff and a great location. Would recommend this hotel to anyone for business or pleasure. Also there is a great gym which is free to use but it does get very busy in the evening, there is also a spa.",4,2015,06,04
123,London in the Rain,"Good hotel with friendly staff and good service - umbrellas provided! Rooms are clean and comfortable but compact ('superior' room but I suppose it is London after all). Great location close to Oxford Street but with the nearby village ambience of Marylebone. Swimming pool a bonus but also small, especially with a few athletic swimmers trawling up and down. Had breakfast elsewhere but chose to have dinner one night; bustling bar and busy restaurant (brasserie) but again friendly attentive service and good food. Too big to be a boutique hotel but it does have the feel.  We enjoyed our stay and would use this hotel again.",4,2015,06,03
123,Loved this hotel,"From the moment we weregreetedat the reception desk to the moment we checked out we were pleases with the staff and the accommodations.  The staff were helpful and friendly.  The hotel is in a good location, within walking distance of Oxford Strret, Piccadilly Street and Bond Street.  There is a tube stop at Bond Street. The food in the 108 Resturaunt was excellent and the bar was great.",5,2015,06,03
123,Lovely business hotell in the hart of London,"Business or pleasure in London? Stay at The Marylbone Hotel. Greate location, and a lovely beakfast. I'm going back to The Marylbone Hotel!!!! 
Try the afternoon tea - you will not regret <3 Lovely restaurants nearby. 7 minute walk to Oxford street.",5,2015,06,02
123,Great hotel and good value,"When I need to be in London the travel agent of the company I work for has booked me in here. I like it so much that I have also stayed on leisure visits to the city.
The staff are welcoming. The bar and bistro is always busy but still friendly enough for a lone female to feel comfortable. The position is really good, right on Marylebone Lane, although the main doors are on Welbeck Street, with lots of bars, restaurants and shops ranging from designer boutiques, to independents, to the monolith that is Selfridges. 
When they email you a booking confirmation it says ""your home from home"", that doesn't do it justice",5,2015,06,02
123,Highly Recommended,"The hotel has a good location in the center; near Oxford St, 5 minutes walk to the Underground station (Bond St.).
The hotel staff is professional and kind.
 
Very clean and cozy.
And has free Wifi in all areas.",4,2015,06,02
123,Great location,"We enjoyed a two night stay here in May with our friends from the U.S. The location is perfect within walking distance from Oxford Street and Bond Street tube station. Marylebone High Street also just round the corner.
The staff were attentive, particularly the German girl who checked us in who acknowledged my husbands birthday and went out of her way to make it a special occasion. The room was a good size for a London Hotel.
We didn't eat or drink here.",5,2015,06,02
123,Fantastic Hotel in a fantastic location,"My partner and I visited the hotel for a weekend break in Dublin. We are so glad we chose it. From the minute we walked through the door, until the minute we left, we were treated to exceptional service. 

We were met by the General Manager, Roderick, checked in efficiently, with some great tips on what to do in the locality, and arrived in a beautiful and spacious room - by London standards anyway. 

The facilities were first class, every member of staff we encountered couldn't have been nicer, and there was a special ambiance and that unique welcome that comes from the Doyle hotels! 
I have visited London a lot but this was my first time in Marylebone. It's a great place to stay, very convenient to some of the best shopping in the world, many great restaurants and coffee shops, or places to see. And I couldn't recommend the Marylebone Hotel more highly. It's really, really good and if you are looking for a really good hotel in a great location, try this place and you will not be disappointed ! 

",5,2015,05,29
123,Weekend,Quiet but central. No main roads but easy walk to Marlybone High ST or Oxford St. The staff could not have been more helpful. We arrived early but were made comfortable while our room was prepared. Nice pool and well equipped gym. Lots of small areas to sit unlike many London Hotels .,5,2015,05,27
123,Great Hotel,I would recomend this hotel loved everything about it. Great location close to tube station and oxford street. Staff were fantastic. very helpful nothing was to much bother. Have stayed here 3 times now would still come back again. Food was fantastic we were out in time to go and see our evening show,5,2015,05,27
123,Flawless ,"I had the pleasure of staying at the Marylebone this month for a recovery break (close proximity to Harley St) and was utterly delighted by the high level of customer service from the hotel staff. On arrival I was greeted with discretion and understanding from the reception team, shown to my room which was to a luxurious standard you would expect with a central London hotel but for my needs was slightly too small so I upgraded to a suite. It's worth noting I was spending more time in the room than most guests would so I needed something with more room. At every point during my stay, the staff were genuine, considerate and helpful, making sure that my stay was an exceptional experience. Unfortunately on this occasion I wasn't able to make use of the spa, restaurant and bar but will be rebooking in the coming months for what I expect will be an equally flawless stay and will be making use of the hotel amenities. I love this chic hotel, ideal for a weekend city break with access to shops and restaurants literally on the hotel doorstep!",5,2015,05,26
123,Still a really good place to stay,"A repeat visit to the Marylebone on 1st and 2nd May, 2015.  There is something about this hotel which makes staying there relaxing and enjoyable.  The staff are friendly and helpful, without being intrusive and the bigger rooms are particularly comfortable with good views of the lanes of Marylebone.
This time, there had been some redecoration and updating in the public areas and the breakfast was again fresh and delicious, after a slight lapse the last time we were there.  
My husband and I prefer staying at the Marylebone to more expensive options we've tried.  
Prices are high here too, but that's London for you.",4,2015,05,26
123,Great location and great staff,"Recently stayed at this hotel via a recommendation from a friend and it really lived up to our expectations.
All the staff are really friendly and helpful especially Roddy at reception who is a gentleman and Minel the doorman who helped us with directions and any other local information we needed.
Also the location is fantastic and although we were a 15 minute walk to the hustle and bustle of Oxford Street it was like walking back into another world of peace and quiet once back within the borders of Marylebone which is a really nice part of London with tons of restaurants, coffee shops and nice boutiques.
Great memories and a wonderful stay!",5,2015,05,26
123,Great hotel.,"A great location - easy to get

123,Great location,"Friendly staff,  great location , you must check that everything in the room works,  underfloor heating,  windows open,  mattress in good condition.
Gym and pool great facility , but disappointed that my 17 year old was not allowed to use gym or join classes with me. They should implement some kind of indemnity form for parents to take responsibility in case of injury.
Overall good ,  need to keep maintenance up to date.",4,2015,05,23
123,Amazing hotel best location,"The receptionist was nice and friendly
My room was clean , fresh towels clean linens and authentic london street view .

The location is central but in a very quiet small street  , just a step away from Oxford street

I'll highly recommend this hotel for everyone .",5,2015,05,23
123,Nice,"Nice location, staff, hotel. Everything was great. The rooms could be a little bigger but they are fine! 4 blocks away from bond underground in a very nice neighborhood. We walked every night to the soho. I would go back for sure! The breakfast is simple but OK. ",4,2015,05,22
123,Medical visit,"Great staff, very comfortable beds and pillows. We have stopped there twice in 3 months, view not good but food great and very convenient for London  visiting we were there for medical reasons and traveled from the U.S. 
Very quiet. Lots of staff too",5,2015,05,22
123,Nearly perfect but not quite,"You cannot find more friendly staff in the hotel business, they are attentive, polite and friendly but not overpowering. Full marks to the management training scheme.

The breakfast was good and for London not overly expensive. Aladdin our waiter was excellent as were the other members of staff.

However the one letdown was the studio suite we booked at £342 a night. It was just a double with an L shaped corridor with no seating, so we were no better off and worse off because of the extra we had paid. Not sure if all of the studio suites are the same as 652 the number we were in but if they are it is definitely not worth paying extra for. We will use this hotel in the future because of the staff but will only book a double.

123,Long weekend stay,"Nice hotel in Marylebone behind Debenhams on Oxford street. 5-10 min walk from Debenhams. Good location for shopping on Oxford street. Friendly Staff, quick checkin.  pleasant fruit drink on arrival. Hotel always smelled gorgeous with lovely candles. Good decor and nice areas to sit.  Very Clean and modern.  Room Well decorated, compact…i.e. very small, but had enough room for short stay. hanging space, comfy double bed with comfy linen. flat screen wall tv. tea/coffee, packet biscuits, complimentary bottled water every day. iron/board, brolly, hairdryer, mini bar..but no fridge. desk/ 2 chairs table.

Robe and slippers provided.  Comfy pleasant clean well presented room although it was a little too small.  Good location, Supermarket at top of street and around corner. Free use of swimming pool, not very warm water tho, 2 sun loungers, and a sauna.  Gym looked ok although I never used it. 
paid £600 for 3 nights but no breakfast as it was too expensive.. it would have been another £100. Lots of good places nearby for breakfast. Walk to oxford street and get lots of buses or underground on Oxford street all over London. Concierge only offers advice to .. Get a taxi. Lots of shows near covent garden … overall good weekend, spend a fortune. Booked through booking.com, I asked about early checkin got no reply…although room was ready early. I asked about booking afternoon tea..got no reply, so went to Harrods had a good deal on.",4,2015,05,21
123,Lovely hotel in convenient location with friendly service,"Stayed here during my honeymoon and it was absolutely lovely,

The staff are very friendly and accommodating. The room was on the small side but quite luxurious. Also as they knew we were on our honeymoon, they gifted us a lovely bottle of Prosseco and had roses in the room, including rose petals on the bed.

It is just a five-minute walk to Oxford Street. How could you complain about such a great location?

Also guests have access to a gym and swimming pool, which is great if you have the time.",4,2015,05,20
123,Always wonderful to return,"After another wonderful stay, I would like to commend the new general Manager on doing an excellent job, we always love returning to the Marylebone, always to be welcomed by the excellent staff who always remember us, especially Rahim.
Rahim you are a great concierge always arranging everything so efficiently.
Staff in the dining room are always great, remembering your name always and welcoming us back , with warm open arms, namely Christian , such a great waiter, 
I love their spacious suites, which are great on London standards.
the water, chocolates every night are a lovely touch and always great to have free wi fi in the rooms.
Golden Hind over the road for the best fish and chips in London is so convenient, don't miss it.
location is excellent, convenient to Selfridges and the best stores on Oxford Street.",5,2015,05,20
123,good choice,"Great location, very close to many tourist attractions and shopping destinations. The service was ok, nothing particularly impressive. View from my room was to the back of the adjacent properties, so not very attractive. My room was relatively quiet (noises from the hallway were louder than the ones from the street), the bed was comfortable. The linen was clean, but the bathroom not so much. Many elements (e.g. doors, bathroom sink, armchair) were quite shabby. The breakfast was average. 

I tried food at the bar and it was excellent. But, I think the bar should be reviewed separately from the hotel.",4,2015,05,20
123,Carla from Dublin,"Just spent 2 days here with my daughter. Fantastic location, rooms were clean and modern with some nice extras (coffee machine, chocolates, bottled water, robes etc) All the staff were lovely and could not have been anymore helpful.

123,Great time in Marylebone!,"I had a fantastic short break here for 3 really comfortable days in luxury accommodation. The location is super and despite being so central the rooms were very quiet with no traffic noise. The staff were extremely courteous and discreet and breakfast room service was impeccable. I also had a delicious early lunch in 108. Reception staff were more than helpful - thank you Sinead, and thank you Mr McGrath for your warm welcome.",5,2015,05,14
123,Loved it!,"My husband and I had a great visit to the Marleybone Hotel. We stayed for a week to celebrate our anniversary. The location was great - very close to shopping on Bond Street, the tube, within walking distance of Hyde Park. The room was clean, nice and on a very quiet street. The room was a bit small, but we expected that. Full English breakfast was included with our stay and was yummy! We ate a ton to fuel all of the walking we did while sightseeing. The service and staff was very good, professional and responsive. The concierge helped us plan our trip and gave several good suggestions to us, including helping us to secure theatre tickets on our anniversary night.",5,2015,05,14
123,What a wonderful experience!,"I have just returned home after spending 9 nights at the Marylebone Hotel. This was my first visit to London. What a wonderful experience. From the time I arrived to the day I left, the service at this hotel was exceptional. This made my visit to London even more memorable.

I arrived early (08h00) and they made a plan to have my room ready by 10h00 so that I could freshen up after my flight from South Africa before going out to experience London. 

The welcoming manner in which I was received to the friendly, professional and efficient advice offered by the front desk was exceptional. It is said that, it is not what we do, but rather the way we do it, that is important. For me, this is what makes The Marylebone an exceptional hotel - their staff.

I was made to feel like family by the advice I was offered on what to see in London, the easiest way to get to my destinations and general knowledge. Given that I was just one of many guests, I was always warmly greeted by my name when I arrived back at the hotel in the evening. I was always asked about my day and if I needed anything. It almost felt like being at home.

The room I stayed in was very comfortable and well serviced. I never was in need of anything. The facilities are really very good.

A special word of mention must go to Riyaz and Minel at the front desk. Their engaging, professional and friendly nature was so reassuring. They are truly excellent ambassadors not only for the Marylebone Hotel but also for London. Thank you gentlemen for helping in making my visit to London a wonderful and memorable experience.",5,2015,05,13
123,"Excellent service, perfect location","The Marylebone hotel has a very sharp interior, the rooms are clean and comfortable. But where the hotel really shines is it's exceptional staff. Rarely have I seen such on-point and friendly staff, absolute top notch from lobby staff to restaurant service.

The breakfast is great in all ways, and all restaurant facilities are very good.

We stayed here for a London weekend getaway as a couple, and the hotel is perfect for this. The area is great, and very short walking distance to all the hot spots.

We've visited London many times, and have stayed in numerous hotels. The Marylebone Hotel is the new top pick and we will definitely be returning on our next London trip.",5,2015,05,11
123,Fantastic Gem of a hotel!,"I am so pleased that I found The Marylebone on Trip Advisor. I was looking for somewhere special for my daughters 30th birthday trip to London and booked three doubles for the occasion on the strength of the comments..we were not disappointed. From the guy on the door to the maid offering the turn down service, every member of staff at the hotel is a real ambassador for the hotel and the Doyle Collection. The management deserve huge praise for the way in which the staff are recruited, trained and rewarded for delivering the level of service they do. The hotel itself is really well designed; the reception areas are more like the interiors of a private club, with individually designed lounge areas creating secluded meeting or relaxing positions, on different levels throughout the ground floor. The dining rooms follow the same pattern, ensuring that no table is on top of another. The decor is elegant  and the use of different subtle colours in each area is stunning. I believe that you can generally tell what a place is going to be like from the presentation of the toilets; at this hotel they are amazing!
Our bedrooms were only standard and not large, but the use of enormous mirrors in the decor to give the impression of a much larger space.
We would certainly recommend this hotel if you are planning a trip to the city..",5,2015,05,11
123,Nicola and Mandy,"Very nice stay. Front of house staff made the hotel warm and welcoming and clearly enjoy looking after their guests. The room was a bit on the small side but was clean and the facilities were good.

123,Lovely break,"First visit to the Hotel, ticked all the boxes , great location, very nice room. The staff on duty were all excellent , very accommodation, friendly, special mention to Jack, front of house, who was the friendly face of the hotel during my stay. Excellent yoga class on the Sunday morning. Great spa, gym facilities. Breakfast also excellent, lay out, food options and efficient staff. Thank you!",5,2015,05,05

123,EXCELLENT OPTION IN CENTRAL LONDON,"We have been in The Marylebone Hotel for a long week-end. Whilst we have been many times in London and tried many hotels, some of them with more * and more expensive, The Marylebone has become our perfect choice. Very well located, just 5 streets behind Selfridges, in a cosy and calm traditional neighbourhood with nice bars and restaurants more for local than for tourist.., hotel facilities very new, nice and tasty deco, clean and comfortable, staff friendly and professional, excellent gym...we stayed in a Studio Suite and this was a good choice. Highly recommended and willing to repeat. ",5,2015,05,04
123,Lovely Hotel,"Very comfortable hotel with nice looking public areas and a room with an excellent bed and high quality linens etc.  Great central location but in a fairly quiet street.  Service is excellent and the staff cannot do enough for you.  
Free wifi with reasonable speed - we wouldn't stay anywhere that we had to pay for wifi these days. I will pay more for a free wifi hotel just so I don't feel ripped off by being charged separately for it - this doesn't always make sense but paying for wifi is so annoying!
The only fairly trivial reasons for not giving this hotel 5 stars is, firstly, that there is nowhere to keep anything of your own in the minibar (eg real non UHT milk which is a must have for me on a holiday) and it's one of those systems where if you take anything out you will be charged for it.  
The other slight irritation was a scraping/grating noise in the morning which sounded like furniture being moved around and was presumably cleaning of some sort.  This was strange because the rooms are carpeted but it woke us up earlier than we would have liked.
Overall however it was a very good experience and we would return.",4,2015,05,03
123,Surprisingly Enjoyable In Marylebone,"Our family of three has stayed at this small hotel in Marylebone on several occasions as our daughter studies at Royal Academy of Music. My most recent stay was in January 2015.  While the regular rooms are too small, the suites are quite comfortable.  This is not a true luxury hotel - but if you have reason to be in Marylebone, the location is excellent and the hotel does indeed grow on you.  I must  say, on my first visit, I was not convinced I would come back, but on visits # three, four  and five, we were very happy. Upon checkin, the fruit-infused water on arrival is a nice thought after a long flight.   ' 108'  is a good restaurant and meeting place; and the Third Space gym and spa within the building is also very good. We have benefitted from workouts with several of their excellent trainers. Good yoga classes,  spin, swimming pool etc.  Room service was timely and tasty, but there is also a large selection of restaurants in the area.  The concierge offered may recommendations - everything from Michelin stars to casual local fare. The decor of the  hotel hallways tends to be  dark but the main floor public spaces are a welcoming place to meet friends and even clients. We have found that the staff go beyond the call.  Nothing is perfect. WeI had a problem with Tv connection but the problem was address and solved immediately.",4,2015,05,01
123,Holiday in London,"This is my second night at the Marylebone Hotel. I chose this hotel because of the excellent reviews I saw on TripAdvisor.  Well, I can safely say that,  while this is only my second night, this has to be one of the most customer centric hotels I have stayed in. Their focus on customer experience is exceptional. I have travelled many continents, but have to say their services are excellent. ",5,2015,04,30
123,Excellent stay near Oxford Street,"From the moment we arrived, we felt at home.  Warm service was offered by the doorman, the check-in staff and a special thanks to Riyas at the concierge desk.  He helped find stores, landmarks, transportation and restaurants for us and always with a smile.  He definitely went above the call of duty.  
The hotel is in a great location.  It's only a few blocks to Oxford Street with lots of shopping and close to the tube.  
The bed was comfortable and the room was larger than expected after reading some of the other reviews.  Hotel rooms are notoriously small in Europe and our room had plenty of space for 2.  
I would definitely stay here again and hope it's sooner than later.  :)",5,2015,04,29
123,"In the words of Alberto Bertorelli ""What a Mistake-a to make-a!""","We booked for a 1 night stay at The Marylebone Hotel though booking.com.
Upon arrival at the hotel we were greeted by a cheerful and willing porter who directed us though the very attractive foyer to the reception desk, we were quickly checked in and given the key to our room on the 7th floor (we had requested to be on an upper floor).
On entering the room we found it quite warm so first call was to open a window or turn on air conditioning. Upon opening the nets over the windows we were greeted by an exquisite view of one of the neighbouring buildings having roofing works done, so we closed the nets and addressed the A/C, we found the yellowing ‘thermostatic’ controller next to the floor mounted A/C unit, after some careful negotiations (I couldn't find any instructions) with the controller I set the the temperature to a comfortable 23C and the fan speed to ‘auto’, we were greeted by a smell that can only be generated by an A/C unit that has not been serviced properly for some time, the room looked like it had had little use so we put it down to the A/C not seeing use for a period of time.
Next step was a post travel shower, after working out how to access the bathroom without tripping over the badly placed toilet (Villeroy and  Boch unit with an ill-fitting, budget aftermarket seat), the first thing we noticed was the rain-head shower cubicle/wet room, covered with limescale! So as you can’t judge a book by it’s cover on it went, then the water pump started… It was so loud it could be heard outside the room and down the corridor, we found this was also true when just using the sink tap. So a bit of a bad start with the shower, this was then compounded by the shower temperature regulator being so stiff (I later found after knocking some the the limescale off it turned easier) it took 2 hands and a good bit of strength to adjust it a small amount (the wrong way, there was no hot or cold indication) for a quick icy shower, now even considering the low temperature of the shower I was supplied at just how much steam was in the room especially with quite a large extractor in the shower area, as it turned out it didn't work, now this could be down to the bulb in the shower area being blown but either way it didn’t work.
After this we left the room to visit the near by Regents Park, in passing I mentioned the issue with the extractor with a member of staff posted at the reception desk, there was little care given to the fact it didn’t work correctly so we left i",1,2015,04,29
123,SIX Star Hotel,We spent 5 wonderful days in London and at the Marylebone Hotel.  Everything about the hotel exceeded our expectations.  The staff and the service was great.  The breakfast at the hotel was wonderful.  The location was superb and gave us a chance to experience lots of local shops and businesses as well as the proximity to Oxford Street.  BIG thank you to the entire staff for making us feel so welcome and we appreciated all of your efforts and suggestions!,5,2015,04,29
123,Wonderful hotel,"The hotel was perfect for our weekend away. Very central, with easy access to the tube and shopping!.  The staff where very helpful and and their knowledge of the area was excellent.  We are planning to take the children to London for a show and we will be booking again.
              ",5,2015,04,29
123,Great stay great service,"Stayed here for 1 night (wish it had been more). The hotel is ideally located just behind Debenhams on Oxford Street. The hotel was spotless, doors were opened for us as we arrived and we were given a really warm welcome. We arrived just after 10am and one of the two rooms we had booked was ready so we checked in early and left our luggage to go shopping. The rooms were really nice and included tea, coffee etc. Every single member of staff we came across were really helpful and nothing was too much trouble. My daughters boyfriend visited the gym and was impressed and he's a real gym freak so this was good. Had breakfast there full English which was really nice and there was loads of food all of it was delicious. I had emailed the hotel to say we were coming to celebrate my daughters boyfriends birthday and they put champagne and a card in the room this was a really nice touch and a lovely surprise. We visit London a few times a year as my niece lives there, I can't believe we have never found this hotel before, I am so glad we have now and will defo stay there every time.
A massive thank you to everyone",5,2015,04,28
123,A relaxing wonderful oasis of calm in central London,"Staying here in mid April we expected this hotel to be busy but was this was a quiet, relaxed and superior experience. The service from the booking line, the front desk -  Gunther is a star -  and the room we were provided with was very well organised. Clean, efficient and very welcoming. Breakfasts are fast and enjoyable with the restaturant manager and her team in tiptop form. Meals in the restaurant were well priced for the area in Marylebone in an enjoyable ambiance. Access to the third space gym and spa is a great bonus. Housekeeping were very attentive and nothing was too much trouble. A top class experience that will be repeated!   ",5,2015,04,28
123,Birthday week-end,"Reading a couple of recent negative reviews for this hotel has encouraged me to add my own very positive one! From the moment we arrived until our departure- my daughter and I were treated so incredibly well -from the very charming door staff,who always found a minute to ask what we had been up to during our trips out,the delightful receptionist whom i think must have been instrumental to the birthday surprise left in our room and the other hotel staff who were all polite and helpful.
However,being fairly well travelled myself i have to add that the shocking rudeness and lack of respect  from some of the residents to the staff quite took my breath away. Good manners cost nothing and perhaps before writing a negative review it would be more helpful if people examined their own behaviour and attitude 1st.
I will recommend this hotel with no hesitation and i also look forward to returning.",5,2015,04,28
123,Very Bad Experience,"This is not our first time at your hotel and it will probably be our last. For how much you charge we were beyond disappointed with absolutely everything. We left with the clear feeling that you couldn't care less about your guests. I will start from the beginning. As soon as we arrived my daughter has been sick. I had a paper bag that she used to throw up while in the cab. When I asked a lady at reception to help me get rid of it she has this negative attitude. Not feeling very welcomed. I felt like I needed to apologise?!?!? Then we went to our first room of our 2 night stay. Room 188. On top of your restaurant. Loud music noise and chairs and tables being moved around until God knows what time and early in the morning for breakfast. We complained and were moved to room 428 (disadbled room). We took a shower and left. Asked room to be serviced but when we came back at night bathroom has not be cleaned. Room extremely hot. AC not working. Called reception and they told us they knew AC was broken and still offered us the room. But were kind enough to offer a fan and water! (Sarcasm here) Before I forget, previous time at your hotel there were complimentary bottles of water and a teddy bear for my daughter in the room. Not anymore. We could clearly note decline in service. After a lot of discussion with reception we were moved for the night (you wanted us to move at 9pm so we were not occupying 2 rooms....but we refused) to another room (cannot remember numbers anymore) which surprise surprise AC was not working as well..... Finally we end up in our fourth room of our 2 night stay with AC working. Got back in the morning to room 428 and we took showers. Plumbing was not working. Bathroom flooded. Disgusting. Toilet wouldn't flush all paper. Sincerely, I couldn't wait to get out of your hotel this time. Glad to be back home. This experience was such a horrible and expensive one not to be mentioned.",2,2015,04,27
123,"Reasonably Good Stay, But I'll Not Return","Overall, my stay was pleasant.  However, to be honest, I will not return.  Primary reasons -

1.  The bathroom design was bizarre.  The shower has only a half glass partition which serves no apparent purpose; water gets all over the floor as a result.  The shower itself was disappointing in terms of water pressure and flow. 
2.  My room, 149, was directly across from service elevators and some kind of work space for the service personnel.  I heard glasses clanking, staff conversations, etc. at all sorts of hours, including 8pm and 6:30am.  
3.  This one is my fault, but I failed to truly appreciate how small 16 square meters is (standard room size).  There wasn't even a place to open my luggage - I had to balance it on the arms of the loveseat.

That said, the hotel has numerous admirable qualities -

1.  Two bottles of still water bedside each night.
2.  Terrific location on a quiet street very nearby Oxford & Bond Streets.
3.  Polite and helpful staff.
4.  Very comfortable bed and bedding.",4,2015,04,26

Did not got to SPA, Fitness Center or Swimming pool.",5,2015,04,26
123,Location - location - location and good service!,"Super hotel with top service and a splendid location.
The Marylebone Hotel is my preferred hotel in London - just 10 min from Paddington Station by taxi and only few minutes walk from Oxford Street and the Tube. A lot of cafes, restaurents and shops around the hotel. The hotel staff is always very friedly and helpful. Nice and clean rooms and excellent breakfast. I can highly recommend this hotel both for pleasure and business.",5,2015,04,25
123,Another glorious stay,"This hotel is lovely. I stay here on business and leisure and it is lovely returning to me staff like Gunther on reception to greet you and make suggestions to make my stay more enjoyable eg dinner recommendations. Breakfast room staff were very attentive and are so polite when taking your order. Rooms are always comfortable and hotel beautifully decorated - very stylish
Well done Doyle team.",5,2015,04,23
123,Top class hotel with top class service and great location,"Me and my girlfriend went to London to celebrate our birthdays. After looking around we booked The Marylebone Hotel which was better than we ever could have dreamed of. The hotel is very nice with and old fashion touch and the service is top class (I have never been to a hotel with such good service). The location was also excellent. Walking down to Oxford street in just 3 minutes and then a 10 minute walk to Hyde park.

Hotel concierge Riyas was so helpful and helped us with booking of restaurants and much more!

If you stay here, make sure you have breakfast included because it is worth it. The service during breakfast is really good and the food is excellent. Furthermore, you get access to a very nice gym and spa facility located under the hotel. My girlfriend got a treatment from me on the spa which was very good as well.

We will definitely be back to London and I will definitely try to get a room here again!

Many thanks to the hotel and the staff and especially to Riyas :)",5,2015,04,23
123,Very good service!,"Very satisfied with or stay at the Marylebone Hotel! Nice and clean room and facilities and the staff was very friendly and helpfull.

123,Amazing stay .. Faultless,"Me and my husband have just stayed here last weekend and well what can I say , absolutely perfect !
We arrived early and our room was ready and able to check in early , we had booked a package and everything was givern to is on arrival including our vouchers ,  we took the car to car park and checked in . A lovely man in reception told us about the cost voucher off parking and that I can park outside the hotel for free from 6.30 on a Saturday evening which saved us a lot of money ! 
We booked a standard room which we went to view and was lovely but small ( which I expected ) and thought worth asking if any upgrades avalible which was extremely reasonable so we upgraded to a deluxe room and wonderful view ,spacious , and beautifully clean .. Would recommend asking for upgrade if u can afford . 

We was shopping all day , as it backs on to oxford street be rude not to , and came back to a lovely bottle of prosecco to celebrate our anniversary ! We booked dinner in there restaurant which was lovely 

We had a faultless nights sleep , and went for breakfast ( also included in our retail package )cooked English and continental and again faultless all included and a amazing service 

We used the spa facilities and went for a swim lovely and clean fab little basement pool and steam changing rooms has lovely redken products and ghds 

We also had champagne afternoon tea agai a faultless experience our friends met us and was perfect lovely food lovely pink moet 

All in all it was beautifully clean perfect location , never opened a door and met with a happy smile and a true 5 star service thank you we would love to come again !",5,2015,04,18
123,User friendly,"The whole 3 days we spent at the Marylebone were excellent.  From check-in to checkout you felt that you were being given 5 star service.  The staff at breakfast were most attentive, and the system for the supervisor letting the staff know your name made it particularly welcoming. Jack the doorman always made you feel special when you went out or returned again knowing your name and remembering it.  I've stayed in many hotels in London many of them 5* and never received the level of service the Marylebone provided. We will stay there again and recommend it to visitors to London.",5,2015,04,18
123,Fantastic stay,"This is my second visit to the Marylebone Hotel and it was just as good as I remember.  Yet again, the service was exceptional.  The staff here cannot do enough to help you.  Lovely rooms, good selection at breakfast with hot food cooked to order, and a great location  We had time to use the pool this visit - a novelty in sucha  centrally located hotel.  The changing facilites were spotless, and very well equipped with towels, hairdryers, straighteners etc.  Can't wait for our next trip! ",5,2015,04,16
123,"Relaxing, Central, Friendly - Perfect!","I'm late on expressing my enthusiasm for staying at this boutique, modern, and fabulous hotel. As my first time in London, I found this hotel to be central and walking accessible to high end shopping, restaurants, and metro. Aside for my love of the design of the hotel, it was really the staff that personalized my experience and made this hotel a one-of-a-kind experience. They were so personable from the minute at check-in, during my stay, and ensuring we made our flight back home. I loved their soap products so much, the manager kindly offered me more to take back with me! The restaurant was excellent as well. We had a very late night and the restaurant stayed open and was even friendly to see us and made sure we were content. Fabulous hotel, restaurant, and staff. I would highly recommend this hotel when visiting London.",5,2015,04,15
123,Great location and wonderful service,"The hotel is located in a quiet street, 5 min from Oxford street and the bond tube, which makes it a perfect location. Around the hotel there are many cafes and restaurants, everything within a short walking distance. The hotel is beautiful, very clean and tidy. The room is a bit small, but very well equipped and clean and the free WiFi is at a good quality. The hotel staff is very friendly and helpful, and I want to point put especially Gunther which was super helpful and welcoming.
I highly recommend staying in the Marylebone hotel.",5,2015,04,15
123,"Great location, contemporary design and super service","This hotel is located just off Oxford street in a quiet area. Great location if you want to sight see in London or do some shopping.

Only drawbacks are price and noisy construction work taking part in the back ally behind the hotel.",4,2015,04,14

123,"Quiet, luxury hotel in a good location","Stayed at this hotel for the first time over Easter.  When we arrived we were greeted by a very friendly concierge who opened the door for us and proceeded to take our luggage whilst we checked in. Check In was very efficient, effective and fast and to our delight we received an update.  The room was clean and tidy with tea, coffee facilities and a mini bar.  My daughter much to her delight received a teddy bear on her bed and also when returning back from the West End, there was milk and biscuits waiting for us - a lovely surprise.  Breakfast in the 108 Pantry had a good choice of both hot and cold to suit every need from gluten free to healthy to indulgence and a separate menu for juices from The Juicery (at an additional cost).  We also ate in the 108 Brasserie which I would also recommend - the Guinness bread was to die for!!  So impressed we are staying there again in June.",5,2015,04,13
123,Short Trip,"I only stayed here for one night so my review might not really justify what this hotel has to offer. My review is solely based on my experience. 

The best thing I liked about it was the location. It is near Oxford street & Bond Street tube. Staff were great and willing to help. I felt welcomed at the reception. The room was cosy and just nice for me but if I had brought my huge luggage, space is going to be an issue.

The only downside, the room service. I was aware of the extra charges when I made the order because I read the fine-print. I went ahead because it was late at night and was starving while getting some work done. I only ordered side-dish of fries. Add to that, tray & service charges, making a total of 9.06pounds for a small bowl of fries. Lesson learnt. So just to warn people to read the fine-print and get food from elsewhere before retiring into your room. (Unless, of course, you are making a big order, the extra 4-ish pounds is not going to make a difference).",4,2015,04,13
123,Disney cannot be better,"A joy to step out of the lobby in the morning into a quiet street, and after turning two corners to find oneself in a bustling area full of live. A joy to come back in the late afternoon to an exceptionally clean and quiet room, taking a rest before going for dinner. It is better than Disney, it is fun, entertaining and relaxing. What you do not seek in the hotel is a mere walk away.",5,2015,04,10
123,A Nice Place to Stay in London,"We stayed at the Marylebone for a few nights during a recent visit to London.

The hotel is very conveniently located about a 10 minute walk from the Bond Street Underground Station, providing easy access to the city and tourist attractions.  It is also a few minutes from Oxford Street, a nice shopping area.

The hotel is nicely decorated and clean.  Our room was spacious for London standards with plenty of room for an extra bed for our daughter. The beds were comfortable and we slept well.

The bathroom was small but clean and met all of our needs.

The hotel staff was exceptionally helpful and friendly.

Our rate included breakfast daily, which was outstanding. In addition to a buffet with breads, meats, cheeses, fresh fruit and juice, they made hot foods fresh - nothing is sitting in a warming dish or under a heat lamp. The coffees were wonderful and may daughter recommends the hot chocolate.

I recommend booking your stay via The Doyle Collection website, where we received an excellent rate for London that included breakfast and free wifi, which are often additional costs at other hotels.

A couple of items to note - the plumbing was loud, in that you could hear the water running through the pipes in our room whenever you turned on the faucet.  I also felt the lighting in the room was a bit dim.

I would recommend the Marylebone Hotel and we would certainly return during our next visit to London.",4,2015,04,09
123,not 4 star rated,"hotel clean friendly staff but not up to standard  on food,swimming pool.went to this hotel because of pool when booking told we had granddaughter with us aged 12yrs also what time we would arrive.on arrival granddaughter got in swim suit straight away only to be told not for her age to swim after certain time.food in hotel does not come with any veg order chicken you just get chicken you won't veg add £4/50 for small size veg each.",2,2015,04,08

123,Well situated in a quiet yet accessible street,"The hotel is very well located in a quiet but easily accessible street and has a well-equipped fitness centre as well as swimming pool. The rooms are very small for the price paid, unfortunately errors in the bill left a sour impression upon departure.",3,2015,04,07
123,"Good Location, great service","A great location and only a few minutes walk from Oxford Street. 
The hotel is very nice and quiet and has a good bar for cocktails. There are lots of other shops and eating places in the area as well. 
The room was nicely furnished although quite small (can be normal for London) so if you need space, then book the biggest room your budget will allow. The bathroom was really small, for example, you could not move the shower screen from the bath it the toilet lid was raised. Very tiny space. 
We did not have a breakfast rate but did choose to eat in the hotel each day as you can order many separate dishes instead of taking the buffet. We preferred this and the price was ok. We did look at the breakfast buffet and the choice did seem very good. 
We enjoyed our stay here and found the location to be great, especially if you have come with shopping in mind. We did not worry about the small room so much as you don't really go to central London to stay in your room. 
Overall a very nice hotel in a good location. We will consider staying here in the future.",4,2015,04,06
123,Business and pleasure combined,"I recently stayed 4 nights in this hotel and was very impressed with overall value: location, comfort and very high standards of accommodation were a pleasant surprise!

123,Good esperience in London.,"I think this hotel used to be The Marylbone Hotel. I will submit review for that Hotel.
Good location.
Good room and facility.
Good staff.
There probably should be better hotels to stay in London. However, it will be a rather hard work to find one like that. So I will think abour staying this hotel if I ever have chance to stay in London again",5,2015,04,05
123,Excellent stay at Marlybone Hotel,"Stayed recently with grandchildren and their family.  Hotel, room, and breakfast were all fine but the hotel was made especially memorable by the hotel staff who were invariably friendly and helpful.  Especially the concierge Riyas(?).",5,2015,04,05
123,Fantastic Staff,"We have just finished a two month sojourn to South Africa and stopped for 4 nights at the Marylebone before heading home to NY. I can say without any qualifying remarks that the staff at this hotel were some of the best in the world. Everyone greeted us and went out of their way to help. Especially helpful was the Concierge Riyas who took care of us like visiting royalty. We have traveled all over the world and stayed in Mandarin Oriental Properties and 5 star hotels, but have never felt as welcomed as the Marylebone. 
I cannot say the same for the dinning room. The breakfast was wonderful, but our one dinner there was very mediocre and pricey.",5,2015,04,03
123,Nice location.,"Stayed here while on a midweek night out. Room was small but comfortable, it's a 10-15 minute walk from Oxford Circus, easy access to the West end. Staff were all helpful, very well stocked continental breakfast, overall very good, however, for not far away from £300 for 1 night, we really expected nothing less!",4,2015,04,02
123,"Well Positioned, Good Location","This is a nice property although maybe not quite top class for a Central London five star hotel (although this is reflected in the price). It's in a good location, roughly half way between Hyde and Regents Parks, ten minutes walk from the British Museum, Bloomsbury, Oxford St etc - so well situated if you only have a few days and want to explore London. 

As is usual these days, if you're in Central London, there are a plethora of good restaurants within walking distance, so don't feel restricted to the hotel facilities. Ask the very helpful concierge for suggestions but probably best to have a rough idea of what you're looking for as there are so many options. The hotel restaurant does a good but not especially memorable breakfast - be warned, it does get crowded between 8:00 - 9:00. 

The surrounding area is quiet (unlike say Manhattan, which is constantly punctuated by fire and ambulance alarms) but if you're looking for a place with great views, this isn't it. 

The rooms are on the small side but not unusually so for Central London and well set up; my only caution would be that the bathroom was distinctly cramped, even for the UK, which was fine for me as a solo traveller but might require an element of planning for couples.",4,2015,04,01
123,Birthday celebration/weekend break.,This hotel is ideally located;7 minute walk to Bond Street. Breakfast was excellent and staff were extremely friendly. Our most impressive experience was with the Concierge; we planned our days in conjunction with him getting the best advice and the best from our trip.,5,2015,03,31
123,Setting the benchmark in London,"Excellent hotel, my new reference point in London. In quiet neighbourhood but still in the heart of the city. Professional yet friendly and genuine staff. All of them encountered, make you feel welcome. Rooms are not very big (closet is on the small side), this hotel is more for the 1-3 day business stay. Comfortable bet, bright bathrooms, everything top quality in functionality and it has its own style. Breakfast and lobby area are nice, allowing for small group discussions and even small meetings. Quality of food is top. Very important for me: WiFi: PERFECT. One log in at the beginning with no password and I am automatically connected for my my whole stay everywhere very fast, unlimited devices and for free. This proves again it can be done and it should be done. Well done! Nice touch, three different power plugs just over the desk so don't need adapter, connector, or look for plugs. This hotel makes business travel a breeze!",5,2015,03,31
123,Loosing it's touch,"If you have read my previous reviews you will see i absolutely loved this place. Been staying here for many years now and the hotel has been beyond exceptional.....

My most recent stay was in December for 4 nights just before Christmas. The room in it self was outstanding. We were in the luxury suite. 

The chap who brought our breakfast every morning was fantastic. The 3 of the 4 mornings i was there i had tomatoe juice. The final morning I forgot to order it. When i woke to the knock on the door i had fresh tomatoe juice waiting for me on the trolley. The chap who has been bringing my breakfast up to me remembered I previously ordered the juice and brought it up anyway. Now that is the attention to detail you expect from this type of hotel. 

Where it's loosing it's touch is the front desk. I will not go into naming any names but there were a couple of very poorly trained staff who I feel should not be on the front desk. They really let the side down this time. I have never seen them before so maybe they were new recruits? Still no excuse. They were very unhelpful, rude with a sense of arrogance. All I did was ask for my complimentary water and bowl of fruit that we always have waiting for us in the room to be sent up. I was abruptly told you must wait until turn down service. cut a long story short instead of saying I wil get some sent to your straight away I was told I must wait. Anyway, I never saw my bowl of fruit. 

I don't want to go into to much detail with other issues I had with the front desk but I must suggest a round of refresher training in customer service is required. 

Minel from concierage was as always excellent. Always goes out of his way to please. He's a top bloke and i hope the hotel looks after him. It's a shame Gunther from front desk wasn't there during my stay. Hope he hasn't moved on. 

I will be visiting again for my annual trip to London on s bank holiday weekend soon. Let's see if there is an inprovement on the service from the front desk. It would be a real shame to this hotel if it continues.",4,2015,03,30
123,most relaxing place I have ever stayed,"We stayed from Friday until Sunday.  Usually pick budget hotels but as it was my daughter's 16th decided to upgrade a little.   The hotel is decorated beautifully, every nook and cranny is a visual feast!.  Amazing aromatherapy smeills waft through the hotel  making you feel as though you are being pampered on  arrival.   We tried the afternoon tea but didn't have time to sample all the hotel had to offer.   The tea and cakes could rival any I have tried previously and are served in the most authentic setting.  Our waiter was pointing out new decor and it just struck me that every member of staff we encountered seemed proud and enthusiastic about the place and how this is so rare to encounter the majority of the time. All the staff go out of their way to be very professional but warm and friendly too.  They all appear to genuinely enjoy working there and are truly a credit to the place.    The room we stayed in was on the small side but we were offered an upgrade on arrival for a small supplement which we declined as our trip was mainly sightseeing and shopping.  Had we had a few more days I would have definitely opted for the larger room and used the hotels facilities.    I couldn't have asked for more From this truly amazing  and surprisingly affordable hotel!",5,2015,03,30

123,Perfect hotel for family and/or SPA,"Very good location, friendly, smiling and helpful staff. Nice decorated and spacious rooms. Great pool, also for kids to use 2 times a day on set time. Very good food and service at the restaurant. Delicate relaxing sofas in the reception area.",5,2015,03,25
123,Wow!!!!!! ..... Love this place! ..... Unassuming .... Fantastic .... Friendly,"Just arrived back from a fabulous stay at the Marylebone Hotel.
I have been fortunate enough to have stayed in many amazing hotels all over the world.
The Marylebone exceeded all my expectations ... 
Family trip with my teenage children.
All the staff here are so friendly and approachable,to name a couple 
Rahim - Head Conceirge- such a genuine guy and so chilled! 
Very helpful in letting the kids know about the sightseeing etc 
Roddy Mcgrath - what a pleasure to meet him!
The girls who work in the 108 Bar ....all so lovely .
I visit London lots and don't want to go anywhere else now .
Cant wait to go back!",5,2015,03,24
123,Possibly the best private terrace in London,"I took the children for a city break treat and we stayed in the newly renovated Marylebone suite. It has a connecting terrace with great views over the West End.  A retractable roof opens the whole area up to sunshine or night skies where you can watch a great movie or sip wine by the cool fire pace.  It really does have the ""Wow"" factor. The new 108 Brasserie has a menu which kept us all happy and the friendly and informal vibe was perfect.",5,2015,03,23
123,Luxurious and personal,"Fantastic hotel with well-appointed and comfortable rooms.  Many little luxuries, including a ""fog-free"" spot on the bathroom mirror and heated bathroom floors.  The bed was very comfortable.  This is London, though, so the rooms are quite small.

Staff are outstanding.  Very friendly and helpful.  Truly seem to enjoy their jobs and work hard to make your stay pleasant.

Breakfast is adequate but expense.  Serving staff are excellent.

The location is excellent.  Marylebone is a beautiful neighbourhood.  There are many excellent restaurants nearby, including lots of options for a quick (and less expensive) breakfast.  It's also walking distance to Hyde Park (maybe 20 minutes' walk.)

We would happily return!!",5,2015,03,20
123,Overpriced and tiny,If you want to experience tiny house living at a premium - this is the hotel for you! The rooms are clean but tiny and closet space very limited. The lobby was small and areas to sit limited and gloomy. The front desk staff seem to be encouraged to 'up sell' your room type and do seem to make judgements on what type of guest you are when you arrive. ,2,2015,03,20
123,Great neighborhood/ Modern Hotel,"The hotel is nicely situated in a charming neighborood with both local and gourmet restaurants.  The neghbhood is within easy reach of several shopping districts including Oxford and Bond Streets.  The hotel is walkable to the Ritz and Buckingham Palace.  The hotel is nicely modern, which we like these days, especialy in this old city.  Staff is very attentive.",5,2015,03,19
123,Amazing stay!!! The staff surpass expectations,"A beautiful hotel with friendly staff.  I didn't even feel as though I was in Central London, furnishings bedroom restaurants were all in immaculate condition.  We quite pleasantly rcvd a complimentary room upgrade, we mentioned that we had a preference to eat at a nearby restaurant and within minutes we had been checked in and a reservation made for our restaurant. Our extremely charismatic and suave concierge, otherwise known as Rahim then provided us with complimentary drinks at the hotel bar, the extremely elegant 108 rooms.  Beds were exemplary room amenities were lovely and even featured a top notch esprsso/coffee machine.  Spa was clean steam room amazing came out feeling refreshed and ready to take on the world.  Breakfast was fresh tasting and delicious with a good choice on the menu.  Would definitely stay again& will be recommending to anyone that will listen!",5,2015,03,18
123,Beyond Expectations,"Truly...our experience at the hotel was beyond expectations. The food, the service, hospitality, cleanliness...everything was impressive. The food at their restaurants is delicious. Being new it saved us the hassle of looking for a good place to eat. The servers were very courteous and knowledgeable about the dishes. The front desk and other staff at the hotel made us feel at home and gave us pocket friendly advise. I will definitely come back here considering its location.",5,2015,03,17
123,5 stars,"Staff is absolutely friendly, professional and always there to help.
Definitely the best service I've ever had when staying in a hotel.
Food was great and the hotel pretty clean and cool.
The best choice to stay in London.",5,2015,03,17
123,The friendliest hotel I have ever stayed in,"Stayed for 3 nights with friends and had a wonderful experience. The hotel staff were attentive, friendly and helpful and made our stay a unique experience from the moment we entered the building. Thank you Roddy and team for your professionalism and warm welcome. I would strongly recommend the Marlebone hotel to anyone who wants a great location and  great service.",5,2015,03,16
123,Superb,"I booked in after leaving another hotel which I found unacceptable.  The cost at this hotel was almost the same but th standard was as different as night and day.  Wonderful helpful staff.  I had a lovely room, comfortable bed, great shower and a nice view on to the Main Street.  The fresh smoothies available in the morning are wonderful. Great for those who don't want a full breakfast. I will make this my hotel of choice in London.",5,2015,03,15
123,Outstanding staff,"Spent a week in Marylebone for business.  Staff went out of their way to provide excellent service.  Restaurants for breakfast dinner and drinks were lively, good food and atmosphere.

Riyas provided recommendations to other restaurants and local attractions.  Hotel is well located walking to shops, park.

Hotel rooms are small, yet clean, quiet and very comfortable.  I highly recommend and plan to return next time I am in town.",5,2015,03,13
123,A medical trip for surgery,"A pleasure to stay at this most comfortable hotel,I highly recommend it. Great food, great staff, incredibly clean. I wouldn't go anywhere else .w were visiting London for eye surgery so needed space and comfort,we got that at this hotel and more.we spent 7 days there. We are returning on the 18 th for more surgery and look forward to the peace and quiet that we experienced last time.
Dyllis and Bill Wells,
Florida",5,2015,03,13
123,Lovely stay!,"Stayed here for business. Simply lovely hotel. Very quiet, they must have great insonorisation, as I had the impression I was alone in the hotel. The gym is exceptionnal for a downtown hotel. Has all the latest equipment, great classes also. Ideally situated and still in a quite neighborhood. The service was very attentive. And the main point: the bed was very confortable.",5,2015,03,13
123,"Amazing stay, amazing staff, amazing location, top!","Stayed her for a weekend in February, I know the area very well and I loved everything of this hotel, the staff were amazing, the rooms very clean and the location unbeatable, ratio quality/price excellent, I will soon be back!",5,2015,03,13
123,Still on top :),"I have now stayed at this a couple of times when in London. It's a very central hotel situated on a calm street with boutique style. Rooms are maybe a bit small but practical. Excellent beds. Staff remembers your name at breakfast (!) and has excellent smoothies (not included in breakfast price)
Access to gym which is called 3rd space, lots of equipment and classes. In summary: the Staff makes the difference as in all top hotels !",5,2015,03,12
123,Super stay!,"Stayed here with friends on a two night visit to London. Excellent location for shopping or sight seeing. Staff were friendly and polite and the food in the restaurant was of a good standard. Alcoholic drinks were expensive from the bar. Standard rooms were exceptionally clean and well presented but on the small side for a couple, particularly someone tall. Would recommend.",4,2015,03,10
123,Must visit! The Marylebone hotel London! ,"We were staying at the Marylebone hotel, March 2015 for 4 nights.

The hotel is located only a few minutes walk from Oxford street, actually see the backside of Debenhams from the steps outside, There is nothing more needed to say about the location, its perfect for shopping and exploring London

** Very good location**

The service was great, friendly and polite staff that meets your every expectations and beyond. 

**Great service**

Room we had was clean and spacious. The bathroom was nice and clean.

**Very nice room**

The hotel restaurant – 108 Marylebone Lane Bar & Restaurant – served good and tasty food.

** amazing continental breakfast **

To summarize all above shortly:

The Marylebone hotel is highly recommended! !!!

Enjoy😊
",5,2015,03,07
123,Stunning,"We stayed here when we were in London for Christmas shopping.
Very nice hotel, great breakfast and on walking distance from Oxford Street.

For us a s a couple it was perfect. Don't think it is a good place to stay with a family.",5,2015,03,06
123,"Perfect service, small rooms","Definitelly high-standard hotel with perfect service, however the rooms are incredibly small. I know this is quite common in central London, but if you choose expensive hotel you expect you have better comfort. Everything else is suberb - location, service, breakfast...",3,2015,03,03
123,Only dined here - excellent all round,"Great service, food although you pay for it, but this is central London and very close indeed to Oxford Street. 

Well recommended in an area where hotels and restaurants abound.

Menu and wine list very tempting - pigs cheeks, oysters, king prawns all delicious.",5,2015,02,28
123,A great stay,"The Marylebone hotel is located only a few minutes walk away from Oxford Street; you actually see the backside of Debenhams from the steps outside. There is nothing more needed to say about the location, its perfect for shopping and exploring London.

The service is very good, friendly and polite staff that meets your every expectations and beyond. Room we had was clean and spacious. The bathroom was nice and clean.

The hotel restaurant – 108 Marylebone Lane Bar & Restaurant – served good and tasty food, but I lacked menu options for kids.",5,2015,02,26
123,Definitely stay again,"Really enjoyed our stay. Great facilities! 
We found all the staff really helpful and accommodating for example Ana on reception had a complimentary bottle of the special water from the lobby made up and sent up to our Room as I mentioned that I liked it. Minel on the Door was really welcoming and helpful, happy to park the car and couldn't do enough to help us settle in. 
The decor and general ambience of the hotel is really tastefully done. Even though the room and bathroom was compact it felt luxurious. Awesome location close to the hub but on a quite street. Would definitely stay again. ",5,2015,02,24
123,Serence and comfortable in bustling London,"A repeat stay at Marylebone reasserted my previous perception of a high service level (friendly, forward thinking, unobtrusive) with a comfortable and quiet room.  A 10 minute walk away from Oxford Street, Regent Street shopping - or public transportation.  Couldn't be easier to get around!  Though their room service and restaurants are great, Marylebone High Street and direct surroundings offer great breakfast or lunch alternatives:  Paul, Pattisserie Valerie, Pret a Manger, Natural Food or for that matter - Waitrose!  Shopping around the corner offers you many of the same retail fashion stores that Oxford/Regent street does, but with less of a hassle.  New Cavendish Street on the corner with great unique service boutiques, and on Moxon Street - the renowned delis/butchers La Fromagerie and The Ginger Pig.",4,2015,02,24
123,"Hotel and staff better than the ""bones"" but nice property","Passing through London recently, and wanted to try a new neighborhood.  The hotel experience here was great, from check in through check out.  I wasn't as keen on the (physical) property itself which feels so mid-20th century, neither classic nor modern - though the pseudo hip decor leans it toward modern style in an appropriate way.  Rooms were on the small side. Great in room coffee service (Nespresso). Attached restaurant and bar are lively and crowded. Overall the pluses far outweigh the minuses (which in my case are subjective).",4,2015,02,23
123,This hotel is lovely ...and so are the wonderful people who are who here,"We had HIGH customer service from concierge Riyas ...as well as other front desk people who helped us with our business travel needs.    Riyas quickly and efficiently handled our business shipping needs back to the US.  The hotel is lovely; the restaurant ambiance, people in restaurant as well as food is delightful.  Thank you for a terrific stay.  We will return.",5,2015,02,23
123,Compact but good,"This is a great hotel just tucked away from the hustle and bustle.  Not the first time I have stayed here, the reason I returned is for the following:
Clean
Great location for restaurants and shopping
Breakfast is normally good, one of the best eggs benedict - although on this occassion the service was terrible and my breakfast was tepid at best
Great gym
Good atmosphere

I would recommend it for sure, but hope they have got the breakfast situation sorted out, it was chaos this time.",4,2015,02,23
123,Excellent afternoon tea!,"We came here for afternoon tea for part of my sisters hen weekend. There were 14 of us altogether and despite the large number the service was fantastic. The girl who served us was very friendly and helpful. I had the classic afternoon tea which consisted of finger sandwiches, homemade scones clotted cream, strawberry preserve, and a selection of scrumptious cakes.....the lemon curd tarts were amazing!! I had lemon and verbena tea which was delicious and refreshing and went very well with the food. A few of the group paid extra to have a glass of pink champagne and strawberries too. At £31.50 (this includes service charge) the classic afternoon tea is superb value for money and the hotel itself is of a very high quality. I would definitely go back again. ",5,2015,02,23
123,excellent hospitality,"i cant speak highly enough of the staff at this hotel. Mr Long the customer service manager went out of his way on several occassions to help my kids. Gunter on front desk makes you feel welcome very time you visit.As a family of five, arriving at breakfast can be tricky but the girls in the breakfast area did everything they could to accomodate us all. I genuinely couldnt recommend this hotel highly enough, the staff are excellent and the location of the hotel blends Marylebone village charm on the doorstep of out great capital.",5,2015,02,23
123,Brilliant,"Hi
I would just like to thank you for a great weekend I visited for a birthday weekend the bar and food was excellent would also like to thank one of your door staff Kashif for being very helpful nothing was too much for him
Thanks again see you soon
Ms Devine ",5,2015,02,22
123,Great location,Really enjoyed our stay at the Marylebone Hotel. The staff were very welcoming and attentive. The room is not very large but very well equipped and perfect for a weekend break. The location is fab with lots of restaurants close by. The bar is a great place for late night drinks with a lovely atmosphere. Breakfast was lovely with particularly good service. We shall certainly return for another weekend treat.,5,2015,02,22
123,"A Wonderful, pleasant, Central hotel with excellent staff.","An excellent hotel with fantastic staff, nothing is too much for them. From the moment I walked in the staff were so helpful. Kashif and Minel were amazing, helped take bags to room, explained were everything was, give directions, organised taxis, give me great information on shopping streets and helped me 2 organise a trip 2 the theatre. They also give me great advice on local walks and attractions in London which I found most helpful. They were both very welcoming and it was lovely to be met with a warm smile each day. A very pleasant stay and I would definitely return.",5,2015,02,22
123,Fantastic,"I stay here quiet often for the reason of its location and the staff the guys on the door are so nice and experienced (Minel) very nice person , All the staff make you feel warm and happy , The rooms are clean and cosy only let down is they are a bit on the small side but beds are very comfortable , the food in breakfast and restuarant are up to scratch , kind regards Brian ",5,2015,02,22
123,Great Staff,"Me and my wife stayed at the hotel for 3nights once you arrive the staff from start to finish make you feel at home .The food is fantastic and the rooms are so cosy , The Gym and pool is also very good ,I would highly recommend a stay ",5,2015,02,21
123,Perfect,"Great place , staff are very nice especially the porter Kashif very nice and most helpful with directions and resturants in the area , The breakfast is very nice large selection and the service is second to none , We stayed in a suite very spacious and warm nice bed and chocolates at turn down , would 100% recommend the hotel to my friends ",5,2015,02,21
123,Best Hotel In Central Location,"This is my second visit to the Marylebone hotel and it truly is a luxurious home away from home. The friendliness and superior service experienced is unparalleled. The highlight must be the exceptional breakfast and The Juicery, what a treat and an excellent way to start your day.

My only concern during my trip is that I found the hotel beds too soft to my liking but this is personal preference, to those who prefer a soft night sleep I imagine the bed to be heavenly.

Thanks so much to all the staff at the Marylebone for ensuring our 3 night stay was phenomenal and trust that we will be back again soon.
",5,2015,02,21
123,Wonderful stay,"Had 2 nights staying here with another couple , my husband emailed ahead to let them know it was my birthday and we were left cake and a bottle of prosecco , unfortunately it was left in the wrong room!! Our friends thought it was there's as they were celebrating there wedding anniversary and it was only later when they saw the card that they realised it was for me !!  Never the less it was a nice thought but unfortunately I didn't get it !! 
Definitely stay again though food and drink were great and hotel was spotlessly clean.",5,2015,02,19
123,Super hotel in a great location,"A brilliant stay last September. Not the most beautiful looking building from the outside around the older architecture of Marylebone but don't let that deter. once inside it has well above average levels of luxury and features one would expect from a 4 star hotel. I would describe the feeling as warm and indulgent.
We'd booked a standard room and while quite small managed to efficiently fit all the elements one would expect into the room.
I flagged on my booking that it was my wife's birthday (in the hope of a room upgrade!) Alas not, but they did arrive with a bottle of prosecco and a cake which was a really nice touch. Overall service was excellent and professional  at all touch points. The location is brilliant , we had to spend some time in the BBC and it was only 5 mins walk away / similar stroll to Oxford St and Marylebone high street and its surroundings had plenty of excellent and bars. Super hotel in a great location , shall definitely return!",4,2015,02,19
123,Great Place in brilliant location,"Very warm welcome, staff were great and the room was in lovely condition. The location is so close to central London which makes it accessible to walk pretty much everywhere. Only slight disappointment was the lift to the pool was broke so you had to go outside to get to the pool but this is only a very minor issue on what was a great stay",5,2015,02,19
123,Haven of peace,"We were happy to return to the hotel after a long day hopping in London.
Decent modern hotel with all amenities. Very clean and very near to main artery in London. 
Professional staff. 
I highly recommend.",4,2015,02,18
123,A fabulous Valentines day!,"Myself and my other half stayed here for one night for Valentines day and it was exceptional in every way!!
We arrived late as we were travelling up from the south coast and we were greeted with such a warm and friendly atmosphere, which was lovely after being stuck on the train for over two hours!
Unfortunately for us, our booking had managed to percure itself on the wrong date, that being the 15th and not the 14th! Completely our fault, not the hotels, however, our receptionist, Gunther, went beyond measures to help us cancel it and to rearrange a new booking for that evening - which we were able to do!! Not only did we then get our room, but an upgrade as well, and if that still wasnt enough, we then received a complimentary bottle of prosecco.
The effort that was made by Gunther and the rest of the staff was a pure example of hospitality at its best! We were made to feel that nothing was too much trouble and it honestly made a fantastic start to a fantastic stay!!
The hotel itself is absolutely lovely inside, not only are the rooms and bathrooms of a lovely decor, but exceptionally clean with all the amenities you need! But at the end of the day, the staff definitely make this hotel above the regular standard!
We will definitely be visiting this hotel again!!!",4,2015,02,17
123,"""Lovely stay""","Very pleasant stay in a quiet location just perfect & tucked away enough to be away from the Hustle and Bustle! The staff and service and food I cannot fault .
The decor of The Marylebone is tastefully done & I would definitely return in the future. Also would like to recommend the Afternoon Tea at 108 Pantry attached to the Hotel - very nice!  ",5,2015,02,16
123,No better location,"Easy walking distance to all of the west end. Can always find a taxi outside. Room well appointed with bathrobes etc. The 108 restaurant and bar very popular with a young crowd. A very acceptable select and not crowded menu. Staff very helpful and smiling which is difficult to find these days. Express check out with a form delivered to your room on your last night excellent idea. Excellent restaurants, pubs and shopping within 5 minutes just off Marylebone High Street.",5,2015,02,16
123,Great hotel in a great location,"My go to adress in London. Love the location, the room, the service, the restaurant food and the gym is amazing! My only disappointment was the shower which is starting to look a bit run down and the door kept on opening while I showered. But it won't stop me from staying there again.",4,2015,02,15
123,"Fantastic location, smashing room (but where was chess board in the photo?)","The hotel is in a great location- restaurants, pubs, shopping and the tube all walkable.  I think we were upgraded to a larger room, but I won't complain- it had sun streaming in, the decor was soothing,and the bed heavenly.  I would definitely stay here again.  

The only things that were disappointing: 
--the gym (including steam room) wasn't open longer on weekend evenings.  We came back at around 8 PM on a Saturday on a cold day and had hoped to warm up in the sauna!  Perhaps they can extend the hours in the winter....

--Also: the hotel website has a couple playing chess in the lobby- one reason we picked the hotel (we love chess).  We asked the reception, and bar area, and no one knew of any chess board.  This won't knock it down a star, but beware if that's what drew you to the Marylebonne.",5,2015,02,14
123,Great choice in London,"The Marylebone is perfectly situated on Welbeck Street, just a few minutes from Oxford Street. From the outside, the hotel looks like any other anonymous 70s building, but someone has worked wonders on the interior. Décor is beautiful, and the many lounge areas on the ground floor are all inviting and comfortable. Our studio suite on the 7th floor was massive, well-insulated from noise, and perfectly maintained, with a superb bathroom. Housekeeping at this hotel is a standout feature - with a welcome turn-down service in the evening. 

Staff are unfailingly polite, and service in all areas is to a very high standard; someone is drilling staff to perfection. 

Breakfast is taken in 108 Brasserie, which can also be accessed off Marylebone Lane. Yet again, service is top notch, with an excellent a la carte choice as well as the customary continental/full English options. 108 also serves a classic brasserie-style menu throughout the day and a decent afternoon tea, and there is a nice cocktail bar too. 

Many London hotels disappoint, and they often represent poor value; the Marylebone deserves its high rating. It's not the cheapest in town, but quality always costs a little bit more. 

This is our new top choice when staying in London.",5,2015,02,11
123,Birthday celebration wknd,"Excellent location, excellent service, totally recommend, the staff helped in the wknd celebrations by providing a surprise bottle in our room upon return, together with a delicious piece of Choc cake fabulous wknd fabulous stay",5,2015,02,08
123,Lovely hotel! ,"This is a lovely hotel just off the main road and a few minutes walking distance from Oxford street. The hotel was clean, modern and quiet! The service here was great and so was there breakfast! Great evening meal. Great location to go off and do a bit off shopping and come back. ",5,2015,02,05
123,This is the life!!,"The Marylebone Hotel is unfailingly warm and welcoming, while at the same time modern and stylish.  I stayed here for a luxurious three weeks, and loved each day of it - I made the most of the superb gym, pool, sauna & steam room, making these a part of my daily routine; I easily ventured out in London during the day via the nearby undergrounds & buses; I became a local at the quaint Marylebone cafes, bars and Saturday morning farmers' market; and finally I loved coming ""home"" in the evenings to sit by the cosy fire in the lobby with a Prosecco, or heading down to enjoy the vibe at the 108 bar/restaurant - somewhere I still love to go to catch up with a girlfriend now that I live permanently in London.  I can't wait for a reason to return to Hotel Life at it's best!
P.S. special mention to Karen & Miguel at the front desk - thank you for your warmth each day",5,2015,02,05
123,Excelent hotel! Will visit again soon!,"Lovely hotel, with very friendly staff! Excellent service, very nice rooms, and a very, very comfy bed. The bathroom was a bit small, but it was so nice and clean that it really did not matter! I will definitely stay there again when I'm next in London! :-)",5,2015,02,05
123,Fantastic ,"We visit London regularly on business and have stayed in most of the top hotels.  This hotel is by far the best value for money.   We will definitely stay again! A special thank you to Rachel Murphy in reservations who was professional, friendly and personally met us at our check in just to say hi.   Exceptional!   😊",5,2015,02,04
123,Nice Hotel,"I chose this hotel due to its location as well as a recommendation from someone I know.

The hotel is located just minutes walk from Oxford Street and Baker Street.  I read some reviews that said rooms were not available upon check-ing in so I was concerned at first but this did not happen to me.

I stayed in a Deluxe room, which is of decent size for London standards.  Bathrooms have very nice marble finishing, with Grohe equipment and the porcelain stuff was Villeroy & Boch.

My biggest complaint was the NOISE!!!  They put me on the 1st floor of the hotel, right on top of a restaurant so you can hear and almost feel each chair as it is moved in the morning.

Another issue is the hotel seems understaffed during nights.  Room service during late hours took so long I cancelled the order.

Will I stay there in the future?  Yes, but only if they give me a higher floor room...",4,2015,02,04
123,London's best,"I am just about to rebook this marvelous Hotel and the memories off my last stay are all positive. I had a truly wonderful October 2014 traveling and staying for some two weeks off and on at the Marylebone Hotel with my daughter.  Each time I returned to the hotel it felt like home.  The staff are all exceptional from the front porters, the reception staff, the management, the cleaning staff and restaurant/bar staff.  I am looking forward to visiting the new refurbished 108 bistro.  Great location with The Wallace Collection a short 5 minute walk away, Oxford Street and the wonderful Marylebone village.  The gym has great equipment and the pool with superb facilities is a perfect way to start the day.   I can not think of a better place to stay in London.",5,2015,02,04
123,Marvellous!,"I have stayed here several times and can’t fault the location and general ambience of this hotel. The staff are great, particularly the team on at breakfast time in the 108 Pantry – really friendly and very personable. There’s free Wi-Fi  throughout and access to a well-equipped gym, the rooms are very comfortable too. Location-wise it is hard to beat. Close to all the shopping without being in the middle of it all and transport links that mean you can be in Canary Wharf in less than 20 minutes. It is well worth joining the loyalty programme for the bonuses if you are a regular traveller to London.",4,2015,02,03
123,Understated Gem,"This was our second visit and it still impressed us.
The staff stand out head and shoulders over some of the very top London hotels.
They just can't do enough for you in every area from reception right through to the cleaning staff.
Always there when you need them and really make you feel welcome.
It has a great ambiance and feels really homely the way the public areas are designed and divided into smaller areas it just makes you feel so comfortable.
The standard rooms are a tad on the small side but quite adequate and very well appointed.
Breakfast is an absolute delight everything on offer, superb service and without fault. Just some of the tables for two are a little cramped but otherwise everything is perfect.The Staff are totally tuned in so compliments to an extremely well run operation all round.
Pool and gym looked fab, just needed longer stay to take advantage.
Cant comment on the restaurant for an evening meal but with more time will certainly try it another time. Management have got this place so right.
 Looking forward to going again.",5,2015,02,02
123,Best place to stay in London,"I have visited this hotel 3 times over the past 7 years and every time I return it seems to have improved. The location could not be more convenient in my opinion, as it is extremely central yet very quiet;  eliminating the need to attempt to work out London's daunting transport system! The rooms are beautifully decorated but retain an element of simplicity. The staff are extremely polite and attentive and the breakfast is just extraordinary! I've stayed in both the standard and superior rooms and both really exceeded my expectations. Love this place and I hope I never have to stay anywhere else if I'm in London!",5,2015,02,02
123,Great service and location let down by poor room maintenance,"My wife and I stayed in a junior suite last Saturday. 

While the staff and service where generally good there where several issues with the room that let the experience down. Half the light fittings in the bathroom didn't work meaning it was very dark and my wife found it difficult to put on her makeup, one fitting was very badly corroded and looked a little dangerous. The bedside alarm clock was not working which gave us a fright when we woke in the morning, as we thought we'd overslept. Finally the string for one of the Venetian blinds had broken off, meaning we couldn't open it to let light into the room. 

The hotel is well appointed and in an excellent location but, sadly, let down by poor room maintenance.",3,2015,02,02
123,Lovely hotel in a great neighborhood.,"I've long loved visiting my friends in Marylebone and staying at their houses.  This time I stayed in a hotel - the Marylebone Hotel - and loved it.  Simply great location near all that I love in Marylebone.  Near the High street, near great restaurants, and near great shopping on Oxford Street not far away.  I arrived early - at 9:30AM.  After a few minutes and a complimentary coffee in the lounge I was in my room by 10AM.  Very nice.  Room was small as expected but comfortable.  Nice bathroom, great plush towels and a marble shower, and a very comfortable bed.  Loved the decor.  understated and elegant.  Friends of mine and I had drinks all afternoon in the downstairs lounge.  Very very comfortable, great service, and I liked the snacks they provided with the cocktails.  This was a great hideaway and I loved staying here.  I love the neighborhood and would certainly recommend it for anybody looking for a great central London hotel.",4,2015,01,31
123,the best hotel,"We have spent 6 nights in the hotel and wanted to thank the stuff for giving us the most wonderful  treatment.The nice people in the reception and especially Sujan and the most helpful concierge Rahim and the very nice guy who helped us with weighing our suitcases before leaving and the unbelievable service in the dining room.Breakfast is rich with a big variety of choises
The room itself was so very clean and the bed was fantastic The bathroom spic and span.
The overall public area are so nice and causy.
It is situated so close to Bond street underground station on a quite street.
I have been in many other hotels as I like travelling and I must say that This hotel was the best I stayed in for a very long time. Thank you again for letting us have the most wonderful holiday and keep up the good work",5,2015,01,30
123,Location + Hospitality = The Marylebone Hotel,"My husband had business in London so I actually didn't book this hotel, his company did as it was close to the office.  He had stayed here a few weeks before and thought I would like it.... He was right.  He was busy so I was on my own so a good concierge was important.  They have a great one.  They helped me with a hair salon, restaurants recommendations, directions, discount theater tickets.... Everything I need for a week on my own.  And remembered my name each and every time.  The spa experience was great.  The attached restaurant was very good as well.  The included breakfast was good but we did have the omelet as well one day to mix it up.  The server that waited on us at breakfast each morning not only remembered our names but remembered that we wanted a small pot of coffee left at the table and we didn't even ask for it after the first day.  We had drinks and snacks at the bar one night before going out for dinner and once again were not disappointed.  As the location is wonderful I walked everywhere except for the evening it rained as I was getting out of the theater (rain one day.  I was lucky) but as the location is great, expect the room to be small which it is and the bathroom as well.  I would stay here again anytime.",4,2015,01,29
123,The reviews don't lie,"Stayed this week for 2 nights with my wife as a treat to ourselves, I'm a regular traveller so lots of hotel experiences. We both liked the Marylebone as it has a good atmosphere with very professional staff who are friendly, polite, courteous and go that extra mile. Decor is high quality, very good state of repair, bustling gym with a pool. Breakfast excellent, bar relaxed, didn't eat dinner in though as we had commitments. Would definitely stay again, it's a million miles away from a chain hotel including the premium brands.",5,2015,01,28
123,"Great hospitality, value for money","This is the second time we stayed in the hotel and the experience is just great. The hotel is located in a quiet avenue but only a few blocks from the famous shopping area around Oxford street. It's in a walking distance to Hyde Park, too. A perfect hotel for tourists in London. 

The breakfast is one of the best I've ever had with great selections to choose for the main course. 

The duty manager, Long, is really a great guy. He helped us to plan the tour to Lake District with all detailed itineraries. Long also helped us to book theater ticket and manage to get us a refund and rebook the ticket when we messed up the date. 

It's a great pleasure to stay in this hotel. ",5,2015,01,27
123,Family Visit to London,"For Friendliness and Cleanliness this hotel is very hard to beat. My wife and two daughters stayed here recently and we were all very happy with our experience. Starting with the great  service from Rachael in reservations and from the moment we arrived outside the hotel, we were greeted by a very friendly Porter who brought us in to the reception where the receptionist was equally friendly. We were made to feel very welcome. The location of this hotel is excellent near Oxford street and center of London. It is only 5 minutes walk from Bond Street underground station. While the room was slightly small and the bath room was very small they were both spotlessly clean and comfortable. I am probably not surprised considering a One Bedroom Apartment in this area costs approximately £900 per week!!! The bed was very comfortable. The English breakfast both mornings was excellent and there was a good selection of morning papers available to the guests. The bar was very nice, comfortable and relaxing for our nightcap on both evenings, after shopping and the theater. The staff here were also very friendly and efficient. There are also lovely peaceful seating areas on the ground floor, where one can enjoy afternoon tea.  Overall an excellent hotel. We will certainly stay at The Marleybone Hotel when in London again.",5,2015,01,27
123,Highly recommended!!,"I stayed here last weekend for my partners birthday after reading good reviews. I have to say I was not disappointed from the moment we arrived at the hotel staff were very friendly and happy to help in fact we had our room ready from 11am and bags took up for us while we had a short walk. The rooms are very well presented a little small but then again you can't complain as it is a central location and reasonably priced for this standard of hotel. The hotel was beautiful inside and I particularly liked all the little alcoves and nooks that you could take yourself off for a quiet and relaxed chat. Breakfast in the hotel was the best I have had and the staff were more than happy to provide anything you needed., nothing was too much bother. The hotel pool was a bonus and I enjoyed a quick dip whilst I was there. Also we were given on the Friday night a complimentary bottle of champagne and little try's bakes with happy birthday decorated on the plate for my partner which was absolutely lovely and a nice touch. Further to this we were able to check out later at no extra cost. My stay at the Marylebone has been fantastic and I will defiantly be staying here when I next visit London.  I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone. First class service from start to finish.",5,2015,01,26
123,Good all rounder,"Good hotel in Great location. Nice room, comfy bed, quiet location at night, helpful staff, good gym and pool, bathroom a little small but had everything I needed.  108 Restaurant very good: great cocktails and delicious fillet steak! 

Will be back.",5,2015,01,24
123,Super marylebone,Stayed here again for business as bond St tube now open again. Place is lovely and spotless and never have an issue here. Reception staff very kind and will help with luggage no matter how tiny the luggage is and at dinner the menu always inviting. Rooms so comfortable,5,2015,01,22
123,Great location,"This hotel is in one of the best locations for shopping, walking distance to oxford and bond street. The reception area has lovely decor and well presented with helpful concierge staff.
I always stay in a superior double and while small does have everything you could possibly want, even a decent hair dryer which you don't have to keep pressing a button to keep it on! 
The only issue is checking in and out always seems to take longer than neccesaary but in fairness if that's the only area for improvement I'd be a happier hotelier reading this review!",5,2015,01,21
123,No complaints,"Stayed here for a weekend trip, where we wanted to stay more central and at a better quality hotel than we usually do in London. The little extra £ added compared to other London hotels are most definitely worth it. 
Very central (walking distance to Oxford Street's shopping, Regent Street, two tube stations, etc), excellent English breakfast, very helpful and polite staff. It felt like a low-key luxury hotel, where you're free to wear denim and a hooded sweater without being looked down on.",5,2015,01,21
123,A great experience!,"I stayed in Marylebone hotel for three days during a conference. I had booked a single room with my colleague. At first were given a room with single king sized bed. We had not requested separate beds in advance so it was our mistake. We brought this issue up when we arrived and we were give a new room for the second night which had separate beds. That was excellent service.

Location of the hotel was superb. Just a 5min walk from the Oxford Street. 

Breakfast was excellent. The were a lot of different options and the food was great and fresh. The hotel was very clean and the overall look as a hole was elegant. Rooms were very tidy and beds were great offering a good sleep.

My stay was excellent and trouble free. I would definitely stay here again if would be able to spent 350 euros a night.",5,2015,01,20
123,"Hip business hotel, but great with families too!",I typically stay at The Marylebone when I am over for business from Canada and always get great service.  What surprised me was when I brought my family over they were fantastic!  They helped us get a wonderful room that suited our needs and were absolutely wonderful with the kids.  The concierge helped us find some kid-friendly activities in the area and made a potentially stressful situation fun.,5,2015,01,19
123,Good quality central London hotel at reasonable rates ,"Not cheap but good value. Good location for London shopping. Quite rooms,very good quality, great, friendly bar with good atmosphere . Breakfast area and bit chaotic and busy. In side road but on taxi route. 3 minutes walk to Selfridge's and Oxford Street. 
",5,2015,01,18
123,Fantastic hotel,"The Marylebone benefits from a great location, but further enhanced by the quality of its staff who are exceptionally professional, warm and caring. Rooms are compact but very clean and comfortable. By far the best place to stay in the West End.",5,2015,01,15
123,I was expecting more,"I stayed with my girlfriend in Marylebone last December for 4 night . The location is relatively good near to oxford street . The hotel quite contemporary does not support its high price. I have visited at least 30 hotels in london and this was not my best choice. The room was ok , the decoration was ok and breakfast was very good. In general terms nothing really special. Moreover the concierge service was on and off . one day we asked for a help and the reaction is that we have to book our tickets by our own and the guy in the concierge didn’t know for which station the train was ( i think everybody knows that it is Paddington ) . The other day though there was another guy who was really hepful. When we arrived back home i realized that i had forget a perfume in my room . I sent an email asking to send me my perfume in my home with my expenses and simply they never reply.",3,2015,01,15
123,"Fabulous hotel, top class service.","This was my first visit to this hotel with a friend who had stayed there previously.
The guest relations manager, Long Voong, looked after us wonderfully for our entire stay, despite it brief. The hotel is very well appointed, beautiful rooms and very sumptuous communal areas.
It was very relaxing to sit and have cocktails in the red room before popping out to the theatre and breakfast in the morning was simply delicious, all freshly cooked to order.
I had a problem on our second day with a very bad migraine and the staff could not have been more sympathetic or helpful, offering to call a doctor and allowing us to extend our stay until I was well enough to travel, nothing was too much trouble.
The location is ideal for shopping, dining and theatres and I will definitely be returning to this hotel on my next visit to London.",5,2015,01,15
123,Gorgeous! ,Absolutely loved our stay and hope to return soon. Sadly we were there only for a night didn't really get a chance to explore the hotel. But hopefully soon we shall be returning and for longer then we will be able to explore the hotel properly!!,5,2015,01,13
123,Great hotel in a great location,"The hotel has everything one needs for a stay inLondon.

Very clean, modern, wonderful showers and very friendly staff.

I have eaten better breakfasts in cheaper hotels but in general it was ok.

Will ceratinly return.",5,2015,01,13
123,Great experience,"We stayed here for four nights in early January, selecting the hotel on the basis of the location and the review comments.
The location of the hotel was ideal for us, we had a short walk to Marylebone high street shops and restaurants, Oxford st was minutes away and tube stations were very close too. 
The room was very comfortable, the marble bathroom had underfloor heating, amenities were good. All the staff we dealt with were friendly and professional. We would definitely choose to stay here again.
",5,2015,01,13
123,Happy to visit The Marylebone Hotel again,"My third visit to this hotel. It's elegant and convenient. It has a good fitness center and a terrific pool--I like to swim to relax after a hard day at the museums and theatres. Marble bathrooms, but they should come with instructions about the silvery fixtures because foreigners may have trouble figuring out  how to turn things off and on. Likewise the sophisticated coffee maker. I never did make it work. Among the many blessings is the heated marble floors in the bathrooms. A really nice touch in winter..",5,2015,01,12
123,Weekend break,"This will be my 3rd stay at this fantastic hotel. The staff are so polite and friendly, it's location is about 5 mins walk from Oxford St, and the rooms are tastefully decorated and comfortable. This stay however exceeded our expectations. On our 2nd and final day my friend developed a migraine in the early hours of the morning and was not well enough to vacate the room by 12 noon. The manager on duty Mr Long Voong could not have been more helpful, saying we were able to keep the room until she felt well enough and even offering to call a doctor but she just needed to sleep it off. Fortunately being able to rest she was well enough to make the 2 hour train journey home thanks to the caring and certious nature of the staff. A big thank you to all the staff that helped us and we will definitely be returning. Customer service at its best. ",5,2015,01,11
123,Romantic stay,"My husband and I paid a bit extra for the deal where you receive a bottle of champagne and a late check out. It's well worth doing. The hotel is beautiful, and is on a quiet street. The only reason I haven't given 5/5 is because we had to pester the reception to give us our champagne, and when they did, it was a cheaper bottle of Prosecco. Our friends staying here had exactly the same issue (except they rang to complain, and received Moët instead.) Our breakfast card was left in our room late, so we'll probably have to call up to order it too. It's just those little things that irritate me! But on the whole, I would definitely return.
",4,2015,01,11
123,Excellent location,"I love this area in London, close to Marylborne Highstreet, St. Christoper's place etc. 
Close to nice restaurants and shops. 
The staff is very friendly, the hotel is stylish and comfortable and very clean. 
The room was not big, but the bed was excellent!",5,2015,01,10
123,Great family hotel with excellent location,"Travelled to London with my wife and 6 year old daughter. The location is great a 5 minute walk to Selfridges, and Debenhams. Christopher's place eating joints are very close by. The gym is amazing and my 6 year old loved the indoor pool, a luxury in London. We got a junior suite with access to the deck, it was a great room, the only inconveneience was that the porter had to take the bags up a flight of stairs as the access to the rooms is from a staircase. It was a small inconvenience for a rgeat room. The best part is the snacks they have at reception, my daughter and I loved the carrot cake they had on one of the days during our stay.",5,2015,01,10
123,Birthday treat,"My husband booked this hotel as a surprise treat for my birthday for 4 nights. It was the  first holiday he has ever booked, as I am a bit of a control freak where hols and hotels are concerned. Overall I felt he chose well, especially for location, but I do think he paid a lot more than I would have for it. The rooms were on the small side but spotlessly clean. The bathroom was tiny with very little room for our own toiletries, but the bath was a bonus after a day sightseeing. They were mean enough replacing bath gels etc and I had to ask for some when I ran out of it. My husband had booked a delux afternoon at the hotel spa for me but it turned out to be a big disappointment. It was just a treatment room really, no relaxation area etc. we took this up with management and they more than made this up to me. A big thanks to the manager Claire O'Reilly, who went to the trouble to ring me when I got home to Ireland to follow up my complaint. We dined in the restaurant and the service was excellent the food was nice and it had a lovely atmosphere. Overall we had a good stay, we found the staff professional and attentive. (We have found the service consistant with our local Doyle group hotel, The River Lee Hotel in Cork, which is also a very good hotel) We would stay here again if visiting London. 

",4,2015,01,08
123,A very pleasant stay !,"Marylebone hotel  has a fantastic location very close to Oxford street and Bond tube station. The superior room I stayed is medium in size but the furnishings and the style are modern and pleasant.
The service during my stay was very friendly and hospitable making me feel at home, while the room service was of high standard. 
Highlight is the breakfast with its high quality of food and beverages , the polite service and the warm surroundings.
Also the  onsite bistro- restaurant has a very pleasant  atmosphere and overall good food quality.",4,2015,01,07
123,Elegant and cozy Hotel,"The hotel is well located in Marylebone area, with a 5 minutes walk to Oxford, Regent's and Bond streets, where several bus and underground stations.
The lobby includes many sitting areas, fairly separated yet preserving the coziness of the place, with a nice fireplace. The afternoon tea is presented in this area and is delicious.
The staff are so welcoming and helpful; in fact, they helped us several times to arrange our visits and our NYE (I would rate 5 stars for the staff).
The room is elegant and offers enough space for all needs, with a heavinly bed (though we weren't lucky to have a view but didnt need it since we spent most times outside).
The bathroom is lovely and convenient with luxury accessories (villeroy and bosh, toileteries, many towels of all sizes).
One down point is that I suspected that the towels weren't always changed (thus I used to put them on the ground), where I saw that one towel had the makeup marks from previous day (this is the reason I gave the hotel a 4 grade instead of 5).
The breakfast is delicious and presents a good variety of cheese, meat, fruits, cereals... and not to forget the ""a la carte"" omelette, eggs (benedict, royale, salmon...) which are all delicioussss... as for the wonderful croissants and viennoiseries, they were just right of the oven... yummiiii.
The waiters are equally 5 stars staff, always friendly, smiling and professional. In fact, they ended up memorizing our tastes.
Taxis are always lined up in front of yhe hotel.
This hotel might be the right place for any traveller to London searching for relax, good taste and good location.",4,2015,01,06
123,New yrs eve stay,Lovely evening  spent at the hotel. Staff were fantastic from the front door staff to the cleaners and my room was beautifully clean not a thing out of place bed  was extremely  comfortable. Very happy  will be back again  soon.,5,2015,01,05
123,December at the Marylebone,"Excellent service, Great location.  The staff do everything that they can to ensure a great stay.  Highly recommended.  The Marylebone is ideally located for the West End shopping and shows.  It's a short ride to Paddington for the connection to Heathrow.  A great choice.",5,2015,01,04
123,Excellent,"Stayed at The Marylebone for New Year 2015 having also stayed for NY 2014. Standards as high as ever, great staff, comfortable modern rooms and very relaxing. Location is superb being right on the edge of everything but the ambience, peace and quiet of the hotel are such that you could be miles from the centre. 
In our view, great for leisure or business and we will for sure be back again.",5,2015,01,03
123,Small Boutique Hotel in great location,"We stayed at this hotel in June 2014 on a family vacation through England. I thought the folks at the reception were a bit confused. I think there were a couple new people who had not been properly trained. Although I had exchanged several emails confirming that we had connecting rooms, when I got there the rooms were not connecting. It took several tries (side-by-side rooms that did not open)  before we got the rooms we were promised - thanks to Gunther, who was really efficient and professional. Ultimately, things worked fine and our rooms were really nice and of a good size. The location is excellent, really close to Oxford Street, shops, the tube and restaurants. I think I would stay there again just for the location, although I tend to prefer bigger hotels (Park Plaza Westminster, for example).",4,2015,01,02
123,Fabulous....,"Booked an overnight treat to take our Daughter's to a show over the Christmas holidays, with Simon's extra touches from the hotel this was made into an amazing stay for our daughter's,  the rooms on the 7th floor were spacious, fabulous views, large comfy beds with extra little treats - thank you. Edwina looked after our breakfast service, relaxing and everything you need for a great start to the day, nothing was too much trouble. Looking foward to a return visit, Happy New Year to all the staff at the Marylebone who strive to ensure everybody has a memorable stay",5,2015,01,02
123,My Favourite London Hotel,"Brilliant, excellent service friendly staff, nothing is too much trouble. Stayed here over New Years came back to see the new year in at the bar, a complimentary drink from the staff and even a dj.brilliant. Staff had a drink to see the new year in which was so nice to see as they had clearly worked their socks off. Thanks for a great start to the year.",5,2015,01,02
123,Wonderful hotel in the perfect location!,"Stayed for a week in early December 2014 and was very pleased with this little gem.  The king room was quite large and comfortable.  The bathroom was extremely large, with a wonderful towel warmer, robes, and plenty of shelf space.  The hotel lobby is very expansive, with an inviting fireplace just right for afternoon tea.  The staff was pleasant and accommodating.  The best part of the stay was the FANTASTIC breakfast included in the price each morning.  If you don't see anything from the expansive cereal, fresh breads, fruit/juice selection, you can order something from the extensive hot menu.  The location is perfect - shopping on Oxford Street is just a few blocks away, and bus tours at the Marble Arch is a short walk from there.  All in all, it was the perfect place to stay for my first trip to London!  I will definitely stay at the Marylebone again!",5,2014,12,31
123,What a value for money!,"Excellent location, nice but small rooms, decent bathroom, excellent service during breakfast. Pstg 16 for breakfast is ok, but excludes scramble eggs etc. Staff at the bar was pleasant and assisting us in ordering some late food.",4,2014,12,29
123,Great hotel in great location,"Just a short walk from Oxford Street and the west end, tucked in a back street, but worth seeking out. Decent value for what it is - it feels like a 5 star hotel, the lobby, the decor, the rooms, also there is a sports club at at the back / in the building which has a swimming pool in the basement. You can get there directly from hotel lift at the back. Very good - have used this hotel twice and will try and stay there when in town again.",5,2014,12,29
123,Perfect stay,"This hotel was recommended to me by the London Vision Clinic, for an overnight stay the day I had laser eye surgery. The hotel staff were very accommodating of my request to check in slightly early as I need to lie down straight after my surgery; we arrived to drop off our bags at 10am and our room was all ready for us then. As you can appreciate from a central London hotel, the rooms are quite small but perfect for a stay of a few nights. The bed was so comfortable, never experienced such a good night's sleep before, which was just what I needed with aches, sore eyes. The rainfall shower was brilliant; I couldn't get any of my face wet or let water near my eyes, so I was pleased to find that the shower is wide enough to turn it on but not having to stand directly under the water. The whole hotel has a cosy, plush feel about it and I loved the lamps in the room, they gave it a nice atmosphere.The hotel is a few minutes walk from Harley Street and Oxford Street - an ideal location. Couldn't hear any traffic noise in our room either. On the day we checked out, the hotel staff securely stored our bags away whilst we spent the day in London,and when we returned to get a taxi to St Pancras, the porter offered us a drink while we waited. We were more than happy to take this offer up, and within a few minutes he appeared with 2 travel cups of tea for us to take for the journey. Overall, this is an amazing hotel, perfect if you are having an appointment at Harley St or spending a few days in Central London! ",5,2014,12,26
123,"Dark dark rooms, friendly but useless staff","We stayed in one of the suites with a balcony, as this was a special trip and wanted to splurge. The location of the hotel was great and the staff were friendly. However, we will never stay here again, due to the dangerously dark rooms and inexperienced, ineffective staff: 
-Our room was so dark it was impossible to even walk safely let alone try to read. We immediately requested more lamps. Eventually we received one (very dim) lamp  Then one of the few remaining lamps stopped working. The bathroom lights worked at random intervals. 
-When we first came into the room we heard a loud screeching sound. The staff member appeared puzzled, telling us it was construction outside,  until I located the air conditioner switch and turned it off. So, we had a choice of air conditioning with a harsh piercing sound or no air. 
-When we used the sink, brown water erupted in the bath tub.
-Neither sink's stopper worked so putting in contacts was a challenge.
-We asked for help with these issues and an overworked, harried ""engineer"" had to be called each time. None of the problems was resolved. Clearly these are longstanding concerns with this room but staff acted surprised each time we asked for help.
-The layout of the room and bathroom were bizarre. Though there were two sinks in the bathroom, only a very skinny model could use one of them because the wall jutted out where one is supposed to stand in front of the sink.
-We are frequent visitors to London, and decided to ask the concierge about good neighborhoods for buying a certain kind of art. The very enthusiastic fellow urged us to take one of the bus tours of the city. Repeatedly explaining that we were very  familiar with London, and did not want the tours, did not stop him. He kept insisting that we needed to take the bus tours so we could go to Madame Tussaud's, etc.  and he could get us a good deal. We finally took the brochures so we could get away from his desk.
-The ""business center' is a joke. I tried logging onto email and the software was so out-of-date that the computer couldn't be used. When I brought this to the attention of the staff, they appeared puzzled and said a computer consultant needed to be called.
-Breakfast was especially odd. There were lots of waiters and waitresses but somehow they all seemed overwhelmed and confused. Each morning they managed to get our orders wrong or forget our table or have problems with the bill. 
Maybe staff that week were all trainees??",2,2014,12,24
123,Great hotel in perfect location,"Marylebone is my first choice in central London, location is unbeatable and quality of service is what you expect looking at the rest (that means, very nice). Price is definitely not on the cheap side, but i think it is in line with the neighbor and with the category of this hote.",5,2014,12,19
123,This is a great Hotel,"Very effective, welcoming reception staff. The room was well appointed, although a little on the small side, but I was travelling alone. The location is as good as it gets, a hop and a skip from Oxford Circus.",5,2014,12,19
123,Simply Perfect,"I think its my 4th stay here at the Marylebone Hotel. Last stay was November 2014 for 5 nights.
The check in/out procedure was slick and the staff show you to your room which is a nice touch.
The hotel is bright, fresh and all you would want from a hotel in London. Very central only 5 minutes walk from the nearest tube station and the shops of Oxford street. Very attentive staff, always with a smile ( I think Simon is the best). Wifi wery fast, free, with no problems.
Every day I had complimentary sweets, 2 bottles of water one still and one sparkling. Room service very good with very tasty food and very fast service. In bedroom and bathroom they provide you all kind of amenities you need. I dont think I have to say anything more about this hotel. 
Yes, yes I will come back!!!",5,2014,12,19
123,Great choice for business travel,"This was recommended by a colleague and is now my ""go to"" hotel when traveling to London for business. It's located a short distance from Paddington station and the Marylebone area has a lot of great restaurants and pubs. The hotel room was spacious, desk had a US power outlet, wifi is fast and complimentary. The hotel has a partnership with a gym called Third Space which is a great facility that includes an 18m lap pool. Staff were all very helpful. I've stayed at one other of the Doyle Collection hotels in Kensington and it was also very good but didn't have a fitness facility.",5,2014,12,19
123,Wouldn't stay anywhere else,"Stayed in this hotel a number of times and it's the only place I will stay at in London from now on. There is no good reason not to return here. The rooms are clean and well appointed, if a little on the small side. The public areas are attractive and welcoming, the bar wasn't too expensive by London standards. Close to the tube and within walking distance to most places of interest, but quiet enough to get a good sleep. Great place to stay.",5,2014,12,17
123,What a gem!,"What a gem! Stayed at The Marylebone during 4 weeks and would stay again. Few hotels have such an attentive staff (specially Gunther) and personalized service. Breakfast, fitness club and location are excellent. Will certainly pay attention to other GHA properties.",5,2014,12,16
123,wonderful Location,"This is certainly a hotel that has thought of everything to make the guest comfortable.
I love their suites as they are generous in size, with Robes, hair dryers, that are strong, bottled water at your bedside each night together with chocolates.
the breakfast room is cosy, with excellent staff and serves a wonderful buffet and al la carte menu.
I would like to mention Merel the front desk manager who is exceptional, and how fortunate they are to have such an effecient lady at the desk, who strives for perfection in making guests happy.
I did have a problem on check in with a room, different to what I thought I was getting, and she so efficiently took care of this and made sure we were happy, thank you wonderful Merel, Doyle Collection and Marylebone Hotel are fortunate to have you as their team leader.
I love the great location, convenient to tube and Selfridges, a five minute walk.
Christopher Square and Marrylebone High Street close by have wonderful bakeries, and restaurants and directly opposite the hotel is the Golden Hinde , voted best fish and chips in London.
Vinnel at the front desk you are so helpful, only want to see a happy guest and Elizabeth  in the fabulous 108 restaurant you are the perfect host, always effecient and with a smile.",5,2014,12,16
123,Another great stay,"Our fifth stay at this hotel was to be completely honest what we've come to expect as regards quality, efficiency & the friendliness of staff and management.
Our room was spotlessly clean, the public rooms well appointed and the bar chic and inviting.
The area around the hotel has something of a village fell in the busy heart of the city.
Thanks to all involved.
We will definitely be returning.",5,2014,12,15
123,"Despite minor problems on 3rd visit, I would gladly return","This is probably one of London’s best first class (as opposed to “luxury”) hotels, with excellent service, friendly staff, and especially spacious, warm, and inviting public areas (I really like the public areas!).  The rooms are very comfortable and well equipped, although my sisters’ room did not have a vanity mirror; the free wireless internet is excellent. (Also, the hotel should try to relocate the closet’s room safe from floor level to a higher one that is more convenient for older guests.) The bar and restaurant are very good, and the breakfast is quite ample, with excellent waiter staff. Minor concerns: flowers I had requested to be delivered to my sisters’ room were sent to mine instead; and more worrisome, there no longer appears to be a doorman manning the front entrance—when we arrived early evening, no one was available to help us with our luggage (in fairness, during the day there was a bellman to assist guests, but over our 5 night stay, there was never a doorman on duty in the evening, unlike the situation on my prior 2 visits). Nonetheless, we enjoyed our stay at this very friendly and comfortable hotel. I can recommend it highly, and I hope to return.",4,2014,12,15
123,Christmas trip,"The Marylebone Hotel was just perfect, excellent friendly staff, great restaurant and fantastic facilities. We booked a superior double room which had the tiniest bath I have ever seem and the room was not that big, however it was adequate for us.

Not quit a central location. The hotel is within walking distance from Euston station which is why we had booked. ",4,2014,12,14
123,Best hotel in the Marylebone area,"I stayed at the Marylebone hotel for 5 nights in early December and this has been by far my best experience in a London hotel.  The rooms were spacious, the linen perfect, the lobby, bar and lounge area inviting.  It was hassle free: free internet, free usage of the business lounge, free coffee in the morning, fruits on the reception.  It was as if someone was predicting what I would need next and made sure I had it.  I felt welcome, appreciated and respected :)))",5,2014,12,13
123,The best part of my travels,"I'm a frequent guest at the Marylebone and I'm always welcomed back warmly. The staff is exceptional, especially Gunther.  I feel as though I have a friend when I return to the hotel. I generally am able to check in early when possible, and I've been saved from wandering the streets when I've had evening fights. The location is absolutely perfect and the neighborhood ideal.  The only downside is that a few of the rooms can be rather small, but that's to be expected in a European hotel.  While many of my colleagues tend to stay in more modern places, I wouldn't trade the Marylebone for any other hotel. I look forward to my next trip in January.",5,2014,12,12
123,Comfortable hotel just off Marylebone High street,"I stayed in this hotel for 4 nights. Check-in was smooth, and the room we were given was bright and very comfortable. In addition to the comfy room, the hearty Irish breakfasts in the dining room - whilst reading the imported Irish newspapers was a joy. The waiters made a point of looking upa and using your name during service once they have your room number - which is a nice personal touch.

Also the bar at the back of the hotel is large and stylish. 

The location is 1 minute from Marylebone High Street (via the back bar entrance), a few minutes to Marble Arch and only 10 minutes to Oxford circus. So the position of this hotel is wonderful for exploring the West end.",5,2014,12,10
123,First Class Staff,"A delightful modern hotel with charm only ten minutes walk to Oxford Street and Regent Street. Brilliantly located for a shopping trip or a night in Town. The staff bend over backwards to he helpful, and this was something we felt when we called the concierge before arriving, to the reception staff on arrival. One warning which may be useful when booking. Ask for a room away from the staff service lifts and  cupboards. These rooms  have 38 at the end of the room number. We didn't  know and ended up in 438. It was very noisy, but once requested, our room was immediately moved, and done in an extremely polite way.  Generally a lovely hotel offering good food, a pleasant buzzy bar, and excellent breakfasts! We will go again.",4,2014,12,09
123,Wonderful staff,"Excellant hotel, fantastic service from all staff, I have visited this hotel several times and the service is always consistent and the food great. Great location ideal for business or for a shopping trip. Well done to all.",5,2014,12,08
123,Excellent Boutique Hotel,"This is a swanky boutique hotel in the center of london and near everything; great location and walkable to Oxford street and Hyde Park.  The hotel has beatiful touches throughout and is nicely appointed and yet very comfortable.  At every turn there are sofa/chair groupings for intimate gatherings, be it  high tea, breakfast, late afternoon cocktails or simply reading in front of the fireplace.  A suspended christmas tree made out of decorative balls greets you as you enter the lobby.  

The rooms are small (this is London and that extends to all of Europe) and for the most part, unless you are staying in an american chain hotel, all of the rooms will be small with low ceilings.  I had a superior room and even that was incredible small.  And yet the standard room was even smaller!  While the room is small it is well appointed.  The tea and coffee maker along with daily varieties of twinings tea and scottish shortbread biscuits were a treat, as was daily bottles of sparkling and still water on the night stand along with chocolate truffles.

The bed was soft and very comfortable and the linens were very nice.  Thick towels and a nice down duvet with a beautiful velvet bed blanket.

The breakfast was fresh, plentiful and hearty; it was nicely displayed and refreshed frequently.  The croissants were the best that I've had outside of Paris!  Fresh squeezed juice was also on hand

The staff was very professional and attentive.  Even before arriving I had a positive interaction with the staff.  I needed advice on how to best get to the hotel from the airport.  A representative responded to the email immediately with various options and details for my inquiry.  The front desk staff, bell staff and restaurant staff all work diligently and very hard!  They are attentive and attend to every need.  Upon arrival, Enrique greated my taxi, took my bags, ushered me in, asked my name, and then announced me to the concierge .  The concierge called me by name and proceeded to check me.  Thoroughout my stay, I was greeted by name, be it in the restaurant or the front desk.  

Note to hotel mgmt. - a few staff members that were personable, professional and just GREAT!  Andrea checked me in and was my ""go to man!""  Be it recommendations or directions, he was just wonderful! Falguni is a rock star!  she got me reservations to a hard  to get in restaurant and then was able to get them to slip me in early!  Mohammad and Kashif always had a welcoming smile and was simply a joy.  Brendan, ahhhh Brendan!  he is an amazing utilitity player! From changing a light bulb because maintenance had left for the evening, or surprising me with a sweet treat (I had already gone through my shortbread biscuits and truffles!) he was an all around GREAT employee with a great disposition!  Villo!  What a breath of fresh air! determined, focused, aimes to please, and excited about working for the Marylebone Hotel.  She attended to every need with a smile, took initiative and had great follow-up duing a very busy time during sunday brunch.  She was composed and never got rattled!  Lastly Roderick (Roddy) the project manager hustled!   He rolled up his sleeves, and pitched in along side of the staff to keep things moving.  Now that is good leadership!  Speaking by action and not by words.  He came over and apologized for the busyness and the apparance of everyone running around.  Again, an example of great customer service. (by the way, the university student from Ireland that is doing an internship shows great promise!  Definately put him on a ""one to watch"" list.)

Trip Advisor readers, stay at this hotel!  You will enjoy the personalized service, and the beauty and comfort of the property.

Mgmt: please pass along the accolades to the staff.  They should know that thier work and efforts do not go unnoticed by the guests.",5,2014,12,07
123,A gem in a great location,"A lovely 4 star boutique hotel. Fabulous location, friendly and helpful staff. The rooms are comfortable, clean and modern. Worth having a deluxe room or a suite. The bathroom in the deluxe room had everything but was small. We had one night in a luxury suite and it was worth the upgrade. Breakfast was good, The attached spa and gym are excellent. All in all a great 4 star hotel with facilities of a 5 star hotel.",4,2014,12,07
123,"Nice Hotel, Excellent Location, a Few Glitches","Our room was comfortable but on the small side, on the first (European) floor looking into an office building across a narrow street.  Comfortable bed, two hassocks that served to hold suitcases, a desk with free wired and wifi internet, and plenty of UK and international electric outlets.  Street noise wasn't a problem until the construction site started up well after breakfast.

Breakfast, included with our agency booking, was good, with fresh dishes off the menu supplementing a small but good continental buffet.  Service was uneven and we had too small a table for two people.

The front desk gave the feel of a high service hotel with well-trained staff.  But our slow-draining shower wasn't attended to, resulting that evening in half an inch of water on the bathroom floor and a sodden carpet.",4,2014,12,06
123,"Super hotel, good location, excellent service!","We have now stayed at the Marylebone Hotel a few times, and on each occasion have been very impressed with the service from the staff, their friendliness, and the quality of the rooms and restaurant.  We now opt for this hotel every time if we need one.  It is also in a very good location, not far at all from Oxford Street for shoppers, but in a quiet location, couldn't be better.",5,2014,12,03
123,Location superb and quiet,"I only had the opportunity to stay one night but judging from that, I will be back.  Location is great and is on a quiet street yet close to Oxford Street and Marylebone High street which is one of my favourite shopping streets.",4,2014,12,03
123,Lovely Hotel in a Great Location,"This hotel is nice, modern and clean.  The restaurant is very good.  The service from the staff is courteous, professional and very friendly.  

The hotel is in a great location near to Paddington for Heathrow airport, a short stroll from Oxford St. and within easy reach of the major sights.

Definitely recommended",5,2014,12,02
123,"Excellent service, great location, beautifully refurbished","But the lighting in the room is a bit dim - the ambience of low lighting is delightful except when you are shaving, applying make up or trying to read. A rather soft bed was immediately remedied - with a smile, a hard board and without delay. The restaurant - The Pantry - is so good that we actually ate there on three separate occasions. The common areas are elegant without being fussy or sterile and the lobby is small enough to be welcoming even without any soft furnishings. There are numerous comfortable sitting areas, some with fireplaces, scattered throughout the ground floor - great for meeting people or just sitting quietly and reading a book/ IPad. Good speedy free Internet connection throughout the hotel. The hotel has an unexciting facade but once you are inside it really is lovely. And the location in the Howard de Walden Estate (  much of Marylebone ) with its wonderful High Street makes this Hotel a true gem. And the service throughout the hotel was truly impeccable.",5,2014,12,01
123,Loved everything about this hotel,"Wonderful hotel in great area.  Staff was very friendly and helpful. Rooms very clean. The concierge was very helful, pleasant and accommodating. Front desk staff friendly,polite and responsive.  Will definitely stay again.",5,2014,11,30
123,Great stay,"We chose this hotel after a recommendation from a friend. The stay where great, the location was 5minutes walk from Oxford Street. The staff where great, the restaurant where great and the rest of the hotel was great. 

We will stay here again! ",5,2014,11,30
123,Wonderful,"The hotel was an oasis in London, providing some sense of calm in what is a very busy city.  The hotel is located a short walk from Marylebone Village which has resturants and shops a plenty.  A longer walk will get you (and your credit cards) to Oxford Street and the myriad of shops that make it one of the best known shopping streets in the world.  

The staff at the Marylebone were wonderful and nothing was too much trouble for them.  Room service is available but beware it comes at a price, but it is London and nothing is cheap here.  The room was spacious and well outfitted and the bed very comfortable.  would I stay there again, most definately!",4,2014,11,28
123,"Smart, very well located","We stayed in this hotel as a couple, staff is friendly, it was a quite room, location is great near to tube stations and yet away from the wee streets, couple of things had to communicated again and again to the staff, If I ignore that it was a peaceful stay. Room was spacious enough. Staff at the Reception needs to be more proactive in informing things.  I would recommend and visit again",4,2014,11,26
123,A wonderful visit,"We were there for five days; my husband for business and me for pleasure. What a great experience! The rooms are comfortable, the service is excellent and Afternoon Tea is an experience you will not forget! Pantry 108 serves wonderful food. ",5,2014,11,25
123,"Smart, modern and nothing too much trouble.","If you want to visit London, try this hotel. It comprises of a modern design, with comfortable relaxing lounge areas and a trendy cocktail bar. The hotel is situated in the middle of Marylebone village which is friendly and safe. The hotel staff couldn't have been more helpful. They had restaurant  recommendations for all cuisines, hailed a taxi when needed and were polite at all times. The room we had was on the 7th floor and faced a building site, but as it was pouring all weekend, we didn't want to look outside anyway!! The rooms are clean, comfortable and well equipped with tea and coffee making facilities. Sky Sports available as well!! 
Explore Marylebone village. It has great restaurants, bars and cafes and is only a few minutes walk from Oxford Street and Bond Street for the shopaholics.",5,2014,11,25
123,Recommended,"This was my second stay at the Marylebone Hotel over 6 months and  my first impression was confirmed: very comfortable  hotel  in top location, on a quite street just a stone throw from the Marylebone area (which I love ).Very near to the hustle and bustle of Oxford street  and Bond street tube station  as well. It's well kept, modern and clean and I have to say:  the staff is excellent , truly friendly and polite without being too much "" in your face"" .
The room on the first floor was reasonably sized - although a bit noisy-and the bathroom really tiny but clean  so ,to me it's totally ok . I appreciated the good quality toiletries , the fluffly towels and slippers.. it was definetly a nice touch
Would I recommend this hotel  to others or consider staying again? Most likely !",4,2014,11,25
123,Cannot say thankyou enough,"Was our 2nd Wedding Anniversary , so thought we would try this place. Now I'm fussy but when I get great service I tell ya about it. This hotel was brilliant, the facilities , the food and the magnificent staff. If your looking for a great hotel in a fantastic location then please head here. the staff were so friendly and could not do enough for us.

The food granted only had breakfast but was lovely. The bar service was absolutely first rate. And the complementary wine from guest relations was lovely. Two minute walk from Oxford Street , area packed with little boutiques and bars. Whilst around the hotel the staff were so friendly made it an absolute pleasure and will definitely be back. A massive thank you from us",5,2014,11,24
123,What an amazing hotel with the kindest staff!,"While visiting London for both business and pleasure in November 2014 we stayed at The Marylebone Hotel in the Marylebone area of London. The hotel are situated in a very central spot of London - close to the heart of the city, Oxford Street, Regent Street, Bond Street etc. Perfect location for a shopping visit. Only 5 minutes walk from the hotel we found St. Christophers Place - a cosy and small street filled with wonderful shops and cafees. The area showed us the London we love. So whether you prefer the large shoppingstreets or the small exclusive shops with an intimate atmosphere, The Marylebone Hotel is close to all of that. The rooms were as expected, a little worndown furniture but linings/pillows were very nice. And the bathrooms had all amenities. The staff were truly excellent - always helpful, smiling and very professional. This goes for both the reception staff, the waiters in 108 bar / pantry - but especially the concierges were outstanding and helpful in their service. The food and beverage were very good also - both the breakfast, afternoon tea and selection of cakes and the a la carte menu also. For sure we would like to return to this hotel again.",4,2014,11,24
123,Great location and hotel,"Spent 6 nights with my husband and very much enjoyed this hotel. Great service, lovely room, quiet and a beautiful bar!  I also loved that there was a nice gym connected free of charge. We walked most places but the tube was close by for our further jaunts. Loved the neighborhood. I'd definitely stay here again. ",5,2014,11,23
123,This is possibly my best hotel experience,"I have stayed here on three occasions, for me this offers all I ever want in a hotel. The Area Marylebone is a fantastic area, within walking distance you can get to Oxford Street, Bond Street and Piccadilly. You can walk to theatre land quicker than getting a taxi, at peak times. Marylebone is like a small village, plenty of shops and restaurants. The room we had was on the 5th floor, very quiet , not the largest room, but if you are here for a weekend or sightseeing in London, how big do you want a room? It was clean, modern and everything had been thought of. I didn't manage to get in the room mini bar, there must be a secret we weren't let in on. The 108 Bar & restaurant is terrific, music on most weekday nights and very lively. The restaurant didn't disappoint I had Tuna to start with a soy sauce, it was perfect. The rib steak on their new, special, grill (can't remember it's name) was great it offered a great flavour. Finally the staff, from arrival to departure we were made to feel as welcome as old friends. As a result of this I know at least 4 of our friends have stayed here and they all agree. I can't see me going anywhere else. Well done and keep up the good work",5,2014,11,23
123,Fabulous,"Very comfortable well designed rooms, clean and classy. Food delicious, service brilliant with hot flannels given at check in and a free bottle of water on departure.
Lovely bar and beautiful restaurant with attentive service
 I shall definitely stay here again.",5,2014,11,23
123,Very pleasant stay,"We've just returned from a lovely overnight stay in room 738.  Welcomed on arrival and no problem checking in early around 1:30, we had called ahead. Room was great, huge comfy bed and seating area, big TV, Sky sports, mini bar etc.  we ate in the 108 Brasserie attached to the Hotel, the staff were great, cooking our 4 year old boy his favourite sausage and fries, even though it wasn't listed on the menu.  Our meal was wonderful.  Room service later was swift and friendly, they even brought Young Harry a birthday card and cake later in the evening (birthday the week before), nice touch.  Good breakfast next morning and leisurely check out around 1ish. Will definitely be back for a longer stay. Thank you.",5,2014,11,23
123,Return visit after an absence,"I have been using this hotel for a long time but have not stayed here for nearly two years. The main attractions for me are the location (Marylebone is a great area to be in), the size (big enough to have an array of facilities but not too big to be impersonal), and having a well equipped gym. The hotel has been renovated substantially so the common areas and rooms are all in very good condition. The rooms are of the expected UK size (smallish) but are comfortable and well equipped. The front desk staff have always been efficient and helpful and remain so. Breakfast was included in my rate, the food quality was good but the service was slow as the place was full and the staff appeared to be stretched somewhat. The new (to me) gym operator is a big improvement over the previous operator, ""Virgin"". I had a very pleasant and comfortable fleeting one night visit and will continue to stay here - as long as I can continue to access competitive rates.",4,2014,11,21
123,Fab full four days,The Marleybone Hotel was an excellent hotel in mnay ways & also for location - very near to Oxford Street. Staff were very welcoming on arrival - only problem was our room wasn't ready - but tea was offered while we waited. Small room but very clean and adequate for our stay.,5,2014,11,20
123,Review for the bar,"I was today in the bar and had first a big bottle of sparkiling water without lemon and an espresso. When the water arrived it was small, with lemon and without gaz, so I returned it. 

When I went to the toilet I asked the waiter to watch my luggage. When I came back, the luggage was still there but the big bottle of water - almost full - had gone.

As my laptop was almost empty I wanted to change seats where I could plug in my laptop. I can't believe that there was no seat available where I could plug in my laptop. The waiter was completely helpless and also couldn't believe that there are no plugs. Finally I found a place in front of the kitchen exit where I could plug in my laptop but the staff had to watch out that they didn't fall over my power cord. So I ordered again a big bottle of sparkling water, San Pellegrino. The waitress told me that they don't carry that, so I told her that the water is on the menue. She didn't believe me, had a look and then said, ok she will look and brought the bottle. 
When I asked for the menue to eat something they brought me the bar menue with mostly drinks on it and just some bites to eat. So I asked if that would be all and the waitress said, no they would have more but it's not on the card.
This is again an overrated place where architecture is more important than real service for heavy travellers who have some basic demands to do their work and unfortunatelly the staff doesn't seem to be very well trained. Disappointing.",3,2014,11,20
123,Nice and cental hotel,"Stayed here for a weekend trip. 

Room: Booked a superior room. Nice and tasteful decor. The rooms was quite small for two people, especially the bathroom. 
Location: Good location for a shopping trip, 5 min walk from Oxford street.
Service: We got help when we asked, staff very polite.

What I did not like was that they always burnt scented candles in the lobby, with a quite strong smell. I am allergic to perfumes, so could only stand there a few minutes before I had to get some fresh air. 

All in all, it was a nice stay.",4,2014,11,19
123,Great stay,"I spent 3 days last weeks at this hotel.
Location is spot on , in the heart of Mayfair. The service was great, checking was easy .
Room service was quite quick and the menu was diverse.
Breakfast tend to be busy in the breakfast room but the service was not compromise and there is a large selection of hot food.
Hope to stay again soon",5,2014,11,18
123,Perfectly welcoming,"I have reviewed this hotel a couple of years back but having stayed there the weekend gone I feel it merits another review.  Where to start but the location which is convenient to Oxford Street but best of all a mere stones throw from the lovely Marylebone High Street which offers an eclectic mix of high street boutique brands,  small adorable  boutiques to unusual book shops, galleries and fine eateries.  Staff at the hotel are smart and welcoming, the atmosphere is calm and almost spa like and while the rooms are small they are comfortable and the decor intimate.  Breakfast is outstanding and food in both the bar and restaurant is excellent.  Can't wait to return really.",5,2014,11,18
123,"Riyas, was brilliant. He was the unflappable concergie who couldn't do enough.",He helped me get my shirt ironed and together with the lady in the WC they both gave outstanding service.in my hour of need they were both outstanding. Saving my life on my big day. Nothing was to much trouble for this dynamic pair. ,5,2014,11,18
123,Lovely trip to Mayfair,"Courtesy of a raffle prize we found ourselves guests at the fabulous Marylebone Hotel; a luxury haven of calm and welcome in the frenetic west end. A great weekend break location. From the welcome at reception to the work of the concierge to get us a table at a nearby restaurant we had a great time; so much within walking distance. Great afternoon tea and a gluten free option for my wife which is exceptional! 5 Stars all round.
      ",5,2014,11,17
123,Daughters birthday perfect!,"Great hotel, like everyone has said, the standard is awesome. Could not fault the hotel facilities, room, lobby, breakfast all fantastic. What really set it apart was the service. It was our daughters 5th birthday and we emailed before we went just in case they might do something. They gave her a teddy on arrival and when we got back from dinner Saturday night there was cake and chocs waiting for her, her name on a plate in chocolate writing, a wrapped present and a card. It's the 'little things' that set one place apart from another!",5,2014,11,16
123,"Excellent, confortable and friendly","We are currently staying at the Marylebone Hotel. We have stayed in many London hotels and it is as good as any we have ever tried. It is in a wonderful location, close to many fine shops and restaurants. A large and comfortable room and bed, good food in the Pantry and Bistro 108 and really friendly helpful staff. Highly recommended.",4,2014,11,14
123,Fabulous staff,"This was a 24 hour stay as a birthday treat for my partner. we were greeted very friendly by reception.  Our room was upgraded, very nice to make higher-level rooms available if they are free, the cost for the hotel is the same and the clients are happier.  The room was not ready - no problem have a complimentary tea in the reception area. A birthday treat appeared in our room for my partner.  I have rarely been treated so well by hotel staff, ever. They seemed to be there only for the purpose of providing happiness. Recommended.",5,2014,11,13
123,A Box Room for £318 a Night,"I have been staying at the Marylebone on and off for years (even before it was called the Marylebone when it used to be called the Clifton Ford). The reason I kept on going back there was because it was so well located and for the price, it was pretty good. However, the days of The Marylebone competing on a ‘Value for Money’ basis have clearly gone. The room rate, without breakfast, was £318 a night, which is starting to nudge the ‘very pricey’ range. Fair enough, prices have generally gone up everywhere, however, when I got to my room, I realised just how far down the ‘lets take advantage of the customer’ route this place has gone. I was put in room 251 which was just about big enough to get a 4’6’’ bed into. It was tiny. Fortunately, I just had an overnight bag, but if I’d had a suitcase, I am not exaggerating when I say that there would have been no place to put it. The average ‘Travelodge’ room is probably twice the size. At £318 it was a true ‘rip off’ and after 30 years of staying there, I wouldn’t stay there again on principle if this is the type of thing that they think they can now get away with.",2,2014,11,13
123,I must say...,"A very good hotel. best location, nice & good size rooms. front desk reception quick with a fantastic service & a very good breakfast to open the day. a nice Spa with a gym and a good size pool.

I like to say Minel was the best. very helpful feller always their for you from the moment we have arrived to check out!
Very Good hotel. I will definitely come again!",4,2014,11,12
123,"Great Hotel, great staff and great location","I have stayed in the Marylebone hotel around 15 times in the last 4 years and it never fails to deliver. On this occasion I was on business yet again and when checking in I informed the staff member that my wife would be joining me the following night, and that that day - Thursday 6th Nov - was actually my wedding anniversary. He remarked that he would ensure we had a pleasant stay and I thought no more of it. On Friday after my course, I went to Selfridges to buy my wife a half bottle of champagne and some chocolates for her arrival. I returned to the Marylebone with my chocolate-dipped strawberries and bottle of fizz only to find that the assistant manager Declan had already left a bottle of Prosecco in an ice bucket plus salted caramels for us along with a card wishing us a Happy Anniversary. It really made our stay that bit more special.
It's attention to detail like this, along with the overall first class feel to the place that makes me return again and again. The location, the gym, the bar, the food, and the rooms are all top notch. I have already booked my next stay at the end on November this year for a further course and am looking forward to another enjoyable stay. It's not cheap, but it's not excessive either. I know I will be back in the new year purely for a relaxing few days. A fab hotel!",5,2014,11,12
123,Nice hotel in fabulous location,"We chose this hotel for the fabulous location.  
The hotel lobby is lovely, very upmarket and welcoming.  Our check in was smooth and quick.  Our room was good, a weird shape because the elevators were in the middle and the room wrapped around it... the room was clean, modern, spacious and the bed linen and the pillows were out of this world!  In saying that, I wasn't very impressed to find we were in this room... by the elevators, but we never heard any noise from it, so it wasn't an issue.  We ate in Pantry 108 for breakfast once - the service was very efficient and we were greeted by our names by each server person as they served us.  The buffet looked lovely, great selection - however we only ate from the al a carte and it was good.  We definitely couldn't have gotten a better location with the same price tag.  It really is a few minutes walk to Oxford st, but don't miss the area of Marylebone, it has some fabulous eateries! Special mention to the housekeeping staff - coming from high end hospitality background - I found the consistent standard of the room each day was excellent.",4,2014,11,12
123,"Well located, Comfortable and with Good service","The Marylebone Hotel is a top level hotel in a huge city as London. First of all it is well located, with easy access to the whole city. If the weather allows, it is possible to reach some of the most important places and monuments by walking. The room we stayed was new and really comfortable (#293), with all the facilities, a great bathroom and a nespresso machine. The breakfast is good, with some varieties of fruits, breads, cheese, toasts and jams. However the highlight of this property is their staff, specially Gunther, at the reception, who gives his warm welcome and kindness to the guests. He made the difference to our stay, suggesting places to visit and restaurants to eat, for what we are really thankful. Going back to London for sure we will stay here again.",5,2014,11,11
123,Small but perfectly formed and located...,"Fantastic hotel, reception is stunning and staff are really friendly. Jo Malone candles and wash clothes at check in, smells amazing. On site gym and spa with pool. Rooms are luxury with velvet walls and the most amazing beds, stylish décor and clean bathrooms with complimentary slippers and robes. Though I was there on business would be great for romantic getaway. Iron and board in room, plenty of sockets including European and blackout curtains (tick in mjy box). Great hotel, would thoroughly recommend and will definitely be back., already emailed our travel people to put this on our rotation on a regular basis.",5,2014,11,11
123,Top Choice!,"When we were sent the booking for this hotel it looked like our hotel booker has hit jackpot and it lived up to expectation big time!  i'd been before when it was a Jury's Hotel and thought it had been restyled very well and made real good use of the room size. was very well laid out and beds were really comfortable - only downside was I didn't spend long enough in it!

The pool was really good and well appointed - quite cool so woke me up a bit. Gym looked well stocked and will take gear next time.

The reception area sofas were really comfortable and was good area to chill out in.  We also tried the bar at the back which was also very spacious.

Really would recommend this hotel. Very friendly staff and helpful",5,2014,11,11
123,Great Hotel - worth every penny,Great design / boutique style hotel. Once we arrived we were handed hot towels and a drink. The room was great. Bathroom was a little small. Gym is top of the line. Spa is average. Overall a great hotel in a fabulous part of town.,5,2014,11,11
123,"Great Location, Stylish Room","We just really enjoyed out stay at The Marylebone Hotel.  The service was good, efficient and friendly, the hotel was stylish and comfortable and the room was lovely.  I especially liked the bed linens and pillows. Also the price for the neighborhood was significantly lower than other similar options, which is always appreciated in Central London.

One of the great things about this hotel is the access to the Third Space gym that is in their basement.  I was able to take a yoga and spin class at no additional expense.  I'd been on the road for 4 weeks at this point so this was particularly appreciated.

Great location, lovely space and friendly staff who know their stuff.  I would recommend this hotel to anyone.",5,2014,11,10
123,Perfect service,A small and smart home from home. Bravo - what a team. I love the Doyle Collection Hotels - an Irish group! The restaurant is modern and has a great vegetarian menu and the classic dishes. The waiters are attentive and warm. I love the bar staff- they always remember my favorite wine.,5,2014,11,08
123,...by far exceeded any of our expectations',"we have been staying in plenty of high end/luxury hotels around the globe, yet 'The Marylebone Hotel' has made it among the top of our list.
the hotel staff from the entrance staff, reception, concierge, restaurant staff, cleaners, etc have been about the most forward coming and kind people we ever stayed with. thanks to all and every single one who helped us and congrats to the HR department.
the hotel offers ample smaller sitting areas which allow for some pleasant time relaxing, chatting or enjoying a perfect cup of tea.
the gym including pool is outstandingly equipped with good teachers and well worth a visit.
108 brasserie, in the back of the hotel is an excellent bar/place to wind down the day over desert or a good cocktail. again the staff has been more then outstanding.
we very much are (still) enjoying our weeklong stay and will definitely come again. thanks!!!",4,2014,11,07
123,Could afford in real life.,"Welcoming staff, clean and tidy reception,  large well presented and equipped room, friendly and helpful bar staff, a good selection of quality food at breakfast.
Getting a little dated in places.
Good location for an Oxford Street shopping spree.",4,2014,11,07
123,Excellent,"As a business traveler it is so important to feel at home , to have basic facilities
healthy breakfast , late check out and coffee in the room ...
always nice to be back and be welcome by one of the top hotels and team
when i am in London THIS IS MY ONLY CHOICE!
  ",5,2014,11,05
123,Ladies luxury holiday,"This hotel was a perfect place to spend a little ladies luxury holiday in London! Shopping, Mamma Mia musical, fabulous hotel breakfasts, great dinners and first-class company made this trip! The personnel of this hotel was also very, very kind :)",5,2014,11,05
123,They have a genuine passion for taking care of guests,"I took my wife as a surprise for her 40 birthday. The team helped me with the surprise and it felt as if they were as excited about it as we are.
Perfect location, reasonable price and above all service service service.
It is hard to explain in words but there is something unique about the staff's organizational culture. they make you feel both happy and wanted in an authentic way.",5,2014,11,04
123,"Very nice, good location","We were very lucky and got our room upgraded to a suite.  It was a nice room on the 4th Floor.

It was clean and everything you needed was there apart from a teaspoon to stir the coffee.  
Checking in was easy and we were soon in our room.  The only thing  I didn't like was being asked if we wanted to join the Doyle hotel club - the incentive was a free newspaper and a bottle of water in the room, and money off/upgrade after x no. of visits.  I would have thought a bottle of water in the room would have been nice anyway.  
Not sure I like the wall covering in the hallways, I wonder how long it will stay looking nice and the stripy carpet in the hallways was hard on the eyes.  
We didn't stay there long as we had a table booked for dinner at a small restaurant in St Christophers Place - Olivellis, see seperate review.
When we got back from the theatre there was a half bottle of Moet and a dessert with Happy Birthday written in chocolate on the plate.  Turn down service was nice and the usual chocolate on the pillow along with two small bottles of water, one still, one sparkling. Slept well (apart from the alarm from another building at 5.30 am).  Bed was comfortable. There was a constant noise from the aircon even though we didn't have it on.
Husband had breakfast at the hotel he said it was very nice.  Didn't have time to try the pool or the gym as had another place to be.  
Checkout was easy, the credit card was charged for his breakfast, still waiting for the extra which was held on the card to be returned.
It's a nice hotel, quite expensive but then I believe all London hotels are.  Would stay there again as only a short walk to Bond Street underground and away from the hustle and bustle.",4,2014,11,04
123,Perfect hotel and location,"The Marylebone was the perfect hotel for our stay in London. Our room was spacious, the restaurant served great food and the staff was warm, friendly and helpful. The real winner was the location. It was minutes from the underground, Oxford St, Selfridge's and fabulous restaurants and bars. I would stay here again in a heart beat as I was really impressed with the service and facilities. In a word: fabulous.",5,2014,11,03
123,Boutique Hotel with Five Star Service,"What an amazing stay we had at Marylebone hotel!!! My husband and I were blown away by the outstanding and first class service.  

We stayed in the recently refurbished and spacious Penthouse Suite which has an outdoor terrace, lots of light and all the amenities and service provided was first class. From the moment we checked in till we checked out, all the staff at Marylebone hotel went above and beyond their duty to cater to our needs, and ensured we had a wonderful stay. We used the drawing room for a Chinese tea ceremony for one of the days, and Marylebone hotel provided tea and teapots for us to use, rearranged the room for our purposes, had multiple staff on standby for anything our families needed, and it was the perfect space to host the tea ceremony before we headed to our reception venue. We also had afternoon tea in the Pantry, and not only were the cakes and scones delicious, but again, the staff was there to attend to our every need that day. 

The hotel is located in beautiful Marylebone, right near the high street, so it is extremely convenient yet hidden from the main street so it is peaceful and quiet. We already miss staying at the Marylebone hotel and can't wait to stay there the next time we're in London.",5,2014,11,02
123,Great Hotel in Lovely Location,"We spent 4 days here and had a wonderful time. The hotel is superbly located in an area with a village feel with lots of nice bars and restaurants close at hand. The hotel itself is very pleasant and has a contemporary and yet elegant feel to it. The bedroom we had was very comfortable and had a lovely view on to the street below. Breakfast was served in a very nice room and the buffet was extensive. What was most impressive sbout The Marylebone, however, was the attentiveness and friendliness of all who worked there. They are what really makes this hotel special. If ever we return to London we most definitely will stay there again.",5,2014,11,02
123,Nice and convenient ,"Nice hotel ideally located in the heart of Mayfair.
Rooms are clean, people are nice and polite. 
Rooms prices are more than reasonnable for this category of hotel and location.

Improvement could be focused on being more efficient at the checkin-checkout. It takes too much time!",4,2014,10,31
123,The best hotel in London,"My flight had just been cancelled , it was late and a bad day was getting worse, so i phone the Marylebone they had a spare room , the check in advisor was happy and professional and turned my very bad day into a much better day.
This hotel always delivers everything you want, spotlessly clean managed and run by real professionals,comfy beds and a great location.

",5,2014,10,31
123,Long week-end stay at the Marylebone Hotel,"Myself and my wife have thoroughly enjoyed our stay in the Marylebone Hotel  last week-end , the 26th October 2014.     The staff are all very friendly, and the accommodation and food were all first class.     We were both made feel very welcome at all times and it was like home away from home but with plenty of benefits.    I would have no hesitation in recommending the Marylebone Hotel and it's location is second to none, as it is within walking distance of Oxford St, and all the key sights etc etc

                                We look forward to our next stay in the Marylebone and hope it will not be  too  long before we experience again this first class hotel with it's wonderful hospitality.",5,2014,10,30
123,Excellent location and staff,"I have never bothered to write a review before but I feel the urge to do so for this hotel.we stayed from october 24-29th (2 adults and a child) Excellent location, impeccable service, very polite and helpfull staff. Kids friendly. Really close by a super market, a Paul bakery and close to Debenhams, Selfridges etc. we arrived earlier than 2 pm and was given a complementary beverage as we waited for our room. Which was ready at least half an hour earlier than 2 pm. On our last day, we requested a late check out and a complimentary wine and apples were delivered to our room. I have stayed to much more expensive and well known hotels in london, but, honestly, i will return to this hotel when I come back for all the above mentioned reasons. Definitely recommend it to friends. Congratulations to the staff and manager. ",5,2014,10,29
123,Breakfast chaos,"This was our second visit as we loved it so much the first time we stayed. The staff are helpful and attentive, the ambiance is stylish, calm and comfortable and overall it is really good value for money given the location. We stayed again last weekend and were disappointed by the totally chaotic experience of breakfast that was so awful that we began to feel embarrassed as clearly the staff were stressed. Our impression was that the hotel is trying to cater for too many guests whilst undertaking a refurbishment and they are at risk of losing return business.  We will try again however and fingers crossed this issue will be resolved by the next time we visit.",4,2014,10,28
123,Great hotel in super location,"I can't think of the 'one best thing' about this hotel but I have to start with the staff, who manage to combine a friendly welcome with efficient and extremely professional service.  Their 'can do' attitude and attention to detail is second to none.
The location of the hotel is perfect for shopping or general sight seeing.  It's tucked away from the maddening crowds, but just minutes from Oxford street and walking distance to some of the best bits of London.  The area feels quite safe.
In terms of the rooms,I wasn't expecting a large room in a central London hotel but my room was a perfect size.
The bed was exceptionally comfortable.
Bathroom was all white marble and spotless.
There was an iron and Ironing board and a proper hairdryer.
WiFi worked well in the room.
Best of all, the window in my room opened, which is always a plus for me.
One minor disappointment was room service, the food I ordered wasn't great.
Breakfast was delicious with a large selection of dishes available.
I didn't eat in the restaurant but it looked busy for lunch and dinner.
I will definitely be back to the Marylebone.",5,2014,10,28
123,Excellently located hotel.,"Stayed here last night courtesy of Gaggenau. Comfortable hotel, lovely continental breakfast and friendly staff. All in all a very decent hotel in a great location if you intend to go shopping! Highly recommended. And there is a lovely Italian restaurant around the back too...",4,2014,10,28
123,Good for the price.,"I found this hotel to be a good value.  My room on the 5th floor was quiet.  We asked for two twin beds and were surprised to find that they were completely pushed together.  It was like sleeping in one bed.  The bed was comfortable.  The room had a nice espresso machine.  The window opened a few inches for fresh air (after I had someone come up and unlock it). The doormen were very polite and helpful getting a taxi. We enjoyed the complimentary water bottles at night.

 On the downside, I asked for a bathtub but received a shower only. The carpet throughout the hotel was dirty. Our television had a bad picture.l Very bad lighting for doing your make-up. The bathroom sink drained slowly. They said that they would send an engineer to fix it.  I think they did send someone, but they did not fix the sink.",3,2014,10,27
123,A one night stay at the w/e.,This was part of an anniversary celebration for my wife and I. We needed a comfy hotel handy for The Royal Opera House Covent Garden and the West End. We used Booking.com and Tripadvisor which we have come to rely on. We have stayed in many first class hotels internationally but rarely in our home country or capital city. We were not disappointed and have promised ourselves that we will stay at this hotel again. It is well run and all that a good hotel should be. It is worthy of an extra star - but then would this hike the price excessively? Better to be at the top of your own chosen class than bottom of another! Well done Doyle Group.,5,2014,10,27
123,Very pleasant stay with one exception,"I spent an awful lot of time choosing a hotel for our 4 nights' stay in London. Finally, I decided to reserve at this hotel, partly because it is British, and not a hotel from an international chain. It had good reviews with Tripadvisor, which helped me decide. We reserved a studio suite, which was a lovely large room with a nice view, and breakfast and wifi were included. Breakfast was great. The first three nights were as expected. The only thing I could have complained about was the occasional noise over our heads, as some work was obviously going on on the roof. But it wasn't unbearable. However, on the 4th day, it poured rain, and when we returned to the room, we discovered that it was also raining in our room. It took a couple of hours until we moved to a new room, too long in my humble opinion. The new room was nowhere as romantic as the first, but it was fine. If we hadn't had this incident with the rain, I would have considered this hotel perfect for a stay in London. The neighborhood is quiet, and the location is excellent.",5,2014,10,27
123,"Friendly hotel, good location","Stayed at The Marylebone Hotel in October '14 for 8 nights on business. I found the rooms to be clean and well serviced but a touch on the small side. The shower could have had a bit more oooomph, but I guess they are limited with water pressures throughout the hotel. Bathroom is definitely on the small side of compact! Aircon in room was VERY noisy, luckily it wasn't the height of summer so I switched it off, had it been hot this may have been a very different review!
Complimentary bottled water and chocolates at night were a nice touch.
It was room only so I can't comment on the restaurant & food.
Location is great, ideal for shopping, the theatres of West End are easily walkable. Regents Park & Hyde Park are walkable too. Nice, safe, quite location for central London.
Would I stay again, yes.
The room rate worked out at an average of £192/night. Which for a hotel of this standard was great.",4,2014,10,27
123,"great hotel , great location","we came for 3 nights, a group of 14 on a commercial shoot in london, all where very happy with the hotel. the location was perfect, the Marylebone area and street are a very nice area to be in
goud resturants as well.",5,2014,10,27
123,disappointment,"The hotel is well located, the staff is very friendly. Rooms are relatively small but clean, well equiped and nicely decorated. However, I was highly disappointed because people under 18 cannot have acces to the swimming pool (permitted hours as so limited that it is a clear indication that teenagers or children are not welcome). I travelled with teenagers who are 17, and we were not allowed to go to the swimming pool. This should be mentioned on the hotel web site to avoid customers like myself being highly frustrated. I will not come back to this hotel because I consider this policy as not family friendly..",2,2014,10,24
123,Afternoon Tea,"On 11th October 2014, I took my wife and 2 Children to the Marylebone Hotel for afternoon Tea. We were overwhelmed by the service we received from the welcoming staff. The children were given colouring books and pencils to keep them occupied. The various teas were carefully explained to us by the waiter and the hot chocolate was the best I have ever tasted. The  sandwiches and spread of cakes were amazing. We had a great afternoon. Thank you to all the staff who were on duty",5,2014,10,24
123,Another solid stay,"I often stay at the Marylebone Hotel when in London on business.  In fact, it's always my first choice.  I like the fact it's small, the staff is friendly, the restaurants are excellent, and the location works well for my work purposes.  It's also close to shopping, restaurants and pubs.

The fitness center and pool are also excellent and the fact that hotel guests can use it free of charge is an added bonus.  It's also easily accessible by lift from within the hotel.

Overall, I strongly recommend this hotel to any London visitor who needs a quiet place with excellent amenities and customer service in the Marylebone/Oxford Street area.",5,2014,10,24
123,Great London Stay,The Marylebone offers a perfect location. Marylebone Highstreet is seconds away and you are within a few minutes walk to the west end. The Third Space Gym is free for guests so you can build an appetite for the superb breakfast at the Pantry. The room was a good size and the service was very good. ,4,2014,10,24
123,London October 2014,"A great location in a very nice neighborhood, the streets around are quiet and safe, the staff is welcoming and the room was very comfortable. We enjoyed our stay very much. Maybe a little expensive, but this is London!
      ",5,2014,10,23
123,Hotel did not help me with request for walk in shower,"On making my reservation 6 months in advance and paying for the night before arriving at 5.30am
also confirming the need for walk in shower both in writing and 2 phone calls to the hotel, I was not given a room with walk in shower, spoke to 3 very unhelpful reception staff, who said they would get back to me, no person did. Very disapointing as I stayed for a week with no help.Have stayed in other Doyle Group hotels so I am a regular.Margaret",3,2014,10,22
123,"Fantastic location, beautiful afternoon tea, but a little disappointed with bedroom","I stayed here in October 2014 with my husband for 2 nights. We treated ourselves and. booked a deluxe room for what I  consider to be a lot of money, and were looking  forward to a touch of luxury. The hotel is in a fab position right beside Oxford Street and Bond Street, and although disappointing from the exterior, the reception accommodation is stunning. The lobby is lovely and we had a fabulous afternoon tea there. Everything was perfect, service, the teas, sandwiches etc. we both enjoyed it a great deal. Our  room was on the second floor and consisted of a very small bedroom, in an alcove, and a larger dressing area with a setee, wardrobes etc. The amenities were excellent, coffee machine, IPhone charger, plasma TVs, slippers, robes etc. what I was disappointed with was the slightly tired appearance of the room, stains on the carpet, worn and dirty patches on the leather settee, and the wet room/ bathroom with was separated from the bedroom by a sliding door. This didn't close properly and there was a gap into which you could see the bathroom. I did not like this. The wet room had  little in the way of storage for toiletries etc, and the complementary toiletries,  that were supplied, were only sufficient for  one person, although the room was for two. All of the snags are small things, and if I had been staying at a moderate hotel, I would have been happy, but this is a 4/5 star hotel and ,to me, the facilities and accommodation should be 4/5 star quality. Staff were fine at the hotel, not exceptional, but fine. We didn't eat in the hotel (with the exception of afternoon tea) as the rate we had did not include breakfast. We couldn't find the bar, although we tried twice to locate it by following the signs, which then disappeared outside a lift. We then gave up and chose to go out of the hotel for a drink. All in all, great location and fab afternoon tea, but slightly shabby, moderate quality, bedroom accommodation left me a little underwhelmed with this hotel.",3,2014,10,22
123,Another great stay,"Stayed at The Marylebone Hotel again last weekend, great location when in town and staying over. We had a gorgeous room ... the best one yet. From the moment we arrived, we were welcomed back by the friendly and very polite team. From check in to check out it was just perfect, we look forward to our next stay.",5,2014,10,21
123,Best Location Ever,"The hotel is very cute and trendy. I loved the style and location. It is close to Oxford Street and Bond street, so it is perfect for Shopping. The Guest Services Manager, Long, told me all the amazing places to go. I loved SoHo and East London the best. It was an amazing trip and would stay here every time.",5,2014,10,20
123,Nice hotel in great location,"Friendly, efficient staff. Good facilities in room except very small bathroom.
Good location for Marylebone, Oxford Street, Tube stations. Pleasant general areas. Small swimming pool but spa treatment rooms make up for that!
      ",5,2014,10,20
123,Great service ,"The hotel is in a great location and the hotel itself is lovely! The staff were polite and very helpful. We stayed in a superior room (237) which was a good size, only downside was some damp came through from the bathroom causing the wallpaper to peel and a lick of paint is needed. The mini bar wasn't refilled after using it either. We didn't use the spa or gym, the breakfast was great at the 108 pantry. Very happy that it was part of the deal, but it felt like we were given a lesser quality of room as part of the deal as well! Overall, our stay was very enjoyable and we would return again. ",4,2014,10,19
123,wow............nice one !,"just back from a few days in London, visiting our son and found a fantastic hotel in the centre of London , next to all the sights, shopping and great restaurants. The staff were so friendly it just made our time their special. As I will be popping over every few weeks to keep an eye on our son its nice to know I have found such a special place.cant wait to go back",5,2014,10,19
123,"Nice hotel, but...","The Marylebone is a beautiful, quirky hotel with a TERRIFIC location.  It is definitely a four-star hotel. Generally, we were very pleased with the quality of service and our accommodations.  As expected in an uber-urban hotel, our room was very small, but the appointments were very nice.  The front desk staff was responsive, accommodating and professional.
However:

1. We had a couple of problems with the room:  the light in the coffee service ""counter"" was supposed to go off via a small switch - which didn't work.  We ended up opening the closet door so that it would block the light.  Secondly, the ""stop"" for the shower door to close was absent.  The shower door swung open freely.

2. We paid for the full English breakfast with our room.  While restaurant staff greeted us and showed us the buffet, they never prompted us to order off of the hot menu.  How many people have restricted themselves to the buffet, not realizing they can also order off of the menu?

Those two items aside, this was a good choice for us to be centrally located in London.",4,2014,10,19
123,Excellent,"A special anniversary trip to London was enhanced by this excellent hotel.

The staff were very helpful and friendly. And from the minute we arrived knew it was a top notch hotel. 

The quality was evident throughout.  Little touches of care and service matched the top decor and excellent food.  

Located easily in reach of theatres and the sites of London. ",5,2014,10,18
123,Great hotel in a great location,"My wife and I came here for our anniversary and just loved this hotel, its location and in particular the staff. The hotel is very clean and comfortable, the rooms are a bit small but this is typical for London, but the staff are exceptional. While we were there they were extremely helpful and friendly, in particular Ash who served us at breakfast each morning, couldn't do enough to ensure we had all we needed. The location is great as its only 5 minutes walk from Oxford Street, Bond Street Tube station and Selfridges. We'll definitely be back.",5,2014,10,17
123,A Lovely Space but Tiny Rooms,"Great hotel that was nice and central to Oxford street shopping  which was only a 5 min walk. Taxis to the theatres were approx 8 pound. We found this the way to go as the subway was more expensive and a hassel on trying to figure out where to go,wasn't worth it.  The hotel had some lovely spaces through out, like nice couches in lobby's etc. Great saunas and pool, wonderful door staff, who even came out to greet us with an umbrella when we got out of the taxi. The rooms were very nice but sadly very very small, we had the supreme queen room. We had travelled through out Europe for 7 weeks and this room was the smallest we encountered. The bathroom was so small you could hardly swing a cat in it. definitely only room for 1 person at a time. The room itself was very comfortable as was the bed and linens etc. The limited space in the room meant there was only room for 1 large suitcase in the wardrobe and the other had to go on the floor. Not ideal when space is so limited. The room service was great along with the meal. We would go back but would get a suite next time as they are larger. ",4,2014,10,16
123,Good location for Oxford Street/Shopping,"I typically stay over at The Bloomsbury Hotel but they were booked so I decided to give this sister hotel a try. I booked a superior room on-line and was pleased - the room was lovely and had everything I needed. The only thing I didn't care for was the shower ... I know that rain showerheads are very modern these days, but I don't like them ... especially if you aren't trying to wash your hair. :o)

The location was very central for shopping - Oxford Street and Mayfair. Otherwise I find Bloomsbury to be more central for exploring and combining business and pleasure.

I would stay again if the price is right - the Doyle Collection hotels are really lovely.",4,2014,10,15
123,A delightful stay,"I had a grand visit to London, living at The Marylebone. Oxford Street almost just outside the front door, and if feeling lazy, food and drink was very tasty at the hotel. I will recomend to try The Juicery too, very good freshly pressed juice. 
      ",5,2014,10,15
123,"Very good, almost excellent ...","Very good location for shopping (Oxford and Regent street nearby).
Very good bed and bathroom even if the room was not brand new.
Very good and helpfull service.
We had breakfast included, very good buffet but you need to order your hot drinks and food (takes some time ...).
Top gym access + pool included if you have time ...
Next time we'll try an afternoon tea !",4,2014,10,14
123,"Chic, well-located London spot","Just returned from a week's stay at the Marylebone. From the initial booking - which was made direct with the hotel - right up to check out, they were fantastic and very accommodating. The location of the hotel is excellent - only 5 mins walk to Oxford Street and Central Line tube stations. The leisure centre was fantastic and lobby area had several really comfortable, visually appealing seating areas. My only complaint would be check in - we came in on an overnight flight (7:00 am arrival) but despite the hotel's assurances were only able to check into our room 7.5 hrs later (at 2:30pm). As a family, we were also disappointed that the pool does not allow access to children under 5.",4,2014,10,14
123,"Excellent Hotel, location & service","My husband and I stayed at the Marylebone Hotel recently. The hotel room was clean and comfortable. The location was great and easily accessible.  
The staff downstairs were very friendly and provided us with the relevant information needed to make our trip very pleasant.
The concierge Riyas has given us exceptional service.  As this was our first time in London, he went the extra mile to make our holiday easier than we imagined giving us advice about the underground, sightseeing, shopping, soccer matches etc.
We would definitely choose this hotel the next time we stay in London, thank you Riyas!

123,A GREAT STAY,"Just back form a wonderful say in the Marylebone. Stayed here for 2 nights to celebrate a significant birthday. Right from the get go, I couldnt say enough about this hotel. From the initial booking - which was made direct with the hotel - right up to check out, they were fantastic.
Firstly check in was seemless and prompt. We were shown to our room which was really nice - upgraded to a queen suite - highly recommend.
The location of the hotel is excellent - only 5 mins walk to Oxford Street.
Breakfast was excellent on both mornings - food very well prepared and plenty of it.
Visited the bar on both nights - good selection and nice atmosphere.
The leisure centre was fantastic - spotless clean - one of the best I've been to.
The general cleanliness of the hotel was excellent with a number of lovely seating areas on the ground floor around the lobby.
Overall 10 out of 10
If returning to London in the near future will certainly revisit",5,2014,10,13
123,We loved every moment,"We just checked out from 5 great days in the hotel. Service and attitude of staff is superb, location is perfect and the smile on face of all the workers is forthcoming. We have been here 2 years ago and we will come again no question. The attitude of Long, the service manager was unbelievable. Only advise take the deluxe room as smaller rooms may be too small",5,2014,10,12
123,"Incredibly efficient and friendly staff, restaurant service and food is beautiful. Rooms are comfortable and clean.","Great hotel, I would certainly reccomend it and stay again, value for money. This hotel offers a great central location, within easy distance of all stations. Staff are attentive and efficient as well as friendly, nothing is too much trouble for them.

123,What a gem!,"I'll be sad to leave this gem of a hotel when I depart later today. When I travel for business I usually end up spending minimal time at my hotel, but this hotel has so many great features the opposite was true. Here are some of what's in store for you: 1) a terrific restaurant with absolutely scrumptious good & delightful service, 2) a large and delicious complimentary continental breakfast buffet, 3) a fabulous multi-level gym with tons of equipment & various fitness classes throughout the day, 4) modern room with comfy beds, and 5) an amazing array of 'living rooms' just off the lobby to have a meeting, conversation or just hang out. I absolutely love this hotel and am already plotting a trip to bring my kids next spring. Can't wait!",5,2014,10,11
123,Repeat visit and even more excellent,"I stay at The Marylebone at least once per year. However, I continue to be impressed by the ever increasing standard of service. I believe the management of this hotel to be exceptional, because everyone in the building is on the same page, and that's customer satisfaction!

I worked in the hotel industry for years, so I am probably a very picky traveler - especially when it comes to the attitude of staff.

I have rarely seen such an efficient, ""can do"" attitude from an entire hotel staff, from the housekeepers to the engineers to the front desk to the concierge desk to the bellman. There is nothing they do without adding a smile and a lovely attitude.

The rooms are small but immaculate, the restaurants- both in the lobby and the attached 108 Bar and Grill- are excellent, the room service is fast, hot and reliable... the laundry service fast and impeccable.

I especially note one employee who provides consistently excellent service - the Concierge, Long. I arrived from a trip to Malta with all sorts of things going wrong at the same moment, one of which was my laptop. He dropped what he was doing and came to my room to attempt to ascertain the problem and did everything humanly possible to solve it. He ultimately set me up in the business center and helped out with several other tasks while I got settled in.

I review the hotel for the second time, because I feel they deserve another mention for outstanding staff, location and service.",5,2014,10,09
123,Great location,"I've stayed here a few times recently on business and am always impressed with the overall presentation of the whole hotel. After a speedy check I went to the room which was a superior double, it had everything you could possibly want. Not sure about room orientation service from the valet though, I think I can find an iron and use a phone. The gym was great, good size for a city center location, definitely a perk when staying. 
The only negative was checking out. I got a quick check out bill under the door which I took to reception, I had no extras but after waiting my turn I then had to go through printing of receipts and bills again. Just not neccessary! Hotels should just email the bill to you these days, paper is just too old school. So a as this was such a small delay the hotel gets a great review from me.",5,2014,10,09
123,Worst Expensive Hotel.,"When I first saw this hotel in the top hotels in London, I was thrilled. We booked it and flew to London. When we arrived our rooms hadn't even been confirmed yet and we had to wait in the reception for 45 minutes. Finally we got our room, and we were not impressed. It was tiny and when we tried to rent a movie (which they said they had many) they had none. When we went down for breakfast they served me off milk and the breakfast was plain and way too over-priced. DO NOT stay here.",1,2014,10,08
123,Amazing hotel and restaurant!,"My mom and I stayed at this fabulous hotel in mid September and could not be happier with the staff and every detail of our stay.  My mom declared that this was the best hotel she had every stayed in. We felt very pampered and taken care of.  We requested a quiet room and neither of us heard a sound from our neighbors or the hotel staff the entire stay of 4 days.  The breakfast which was included in our package was simply awesome.  We had a full, satisfying meal from the breakfast buffet.  The wait staff was simply outstanding. One day, I ordered a latte and the next morning, our waiter came to our table and after a lovely greeting, asked if I would like another latte.  I love that! ;) 
I HIGHLY recommend this hotel and hope everyone has as nice of a stay as we did.  I will definitely stay here again! ",5,2014,10,05
123,Second Time isn't the Charm,"We were very excited to revisit this hotel since our last year visit with 3 families. This time it was only with my wife and my 1 year old son for 7 nights. Last visit was memorable but this one wasn't.

The welcoming of the hotel haven't change, they are still very welcoming and professional with their jobs.

The hotel price have gone up a lot since last year even though last year we stayed at the hotel during the peak season of summer!

The positives:

1-Prime location, only 5 mins walk to Oxford street and 2 mins walk to two Halal restaurants, one Lebanese and the other is Iranian.

2-Very welcoming staff

3-Descent size rooms for London, we stayed in Studio Suite with a queen bed

The Negatives:

1-We have agreed on taking the breakfast price as we were promised Halal food, but when we ordered chicken hot dog for breakfast we were told that its not halal and non of the chicken or meat is halal, while the rest of the food is! Well rest of the food is only egg and bread! To us that was unacceptable and we ended up eating eggs for 7 days. 

2-It was shocking to see that the tea cups and other dirty glasses were not replaced after the room services, we had to complain twice regarding the issue.

3-Shower gels and shampoos were not replaced every time and only one of each was provided. even though there 2 adults sleeping in that room and there is a bath tub!

4-We did mention about the lack of efficiency in the room service last year in our review but nothing changed and the water pressure in the shower is still very weak, so give your self a good time if your thinking to wash your hair.

5-At night don't expect someone to open the hotel main doors for you to help you with your shopping bags or baby stroller as they are all busy chatting.

Most of the staff look new not the same as last year, we did miss the tall black guy from last year who used to always welcome us on  the door day and night and offer his help and fruits when we come in after long day in London.

Considering to come back to this hotel might be difficult, however to location is great, hence you might consider the Holiday inn Hotel which is just next to it.",3,2014,10,05
123,"5-star Service and a decadent breakfast, plus complimentary treats in our room!","OUTSTANDING! Warm memories of the 5-star service we received at this 4-star hotel prompt me to post this review, belatedly. We stayed at The Marylebone Hotel in London for 3 nights in  2013, enroute from San Diego to Cape Town. Room are on the small side, but our King Studio Suite was big enough for us, and we were pampered from the moment I contacted the hotel, until the end of our stay! I had requested a quiet room, and were delighted with our tasteful room with 3 chairs, a desk, and a small table. Complimentary fruits, wine, and chocolates were waiting for us when we check into the room! The front desk staff and the restaurant staff remembered our name and greeted us when they saw us. Complimentary herbal tea was sent up to our room before bedtime. We felt like royalty!

The Marylebone enjoys a delightful location on a quiet road in the charming heart of Mayfair, and it's a short walk to Regents Park. 

I had written to the hotel manager, Frits Potgieter, via Tripadvisor, and asked him to try to secure for me the most quiet and spacious room that was possible, within the category of rooms that I had booked. We were immensely pleased with our room on the 6th floor. I don't even know if Frits is still the hotel manager currently, but I owe him a huge thank you, wherever he is! I had booked a Deluxe Queen room, so it seems that the King studio suite may have been an upgrade. Our room was very quiet, and I couldn't hear any noise from the hallway at night, nor any traffic noise either.

I panicked the day before our flight when I realized I hadn't booked our transportation from the London Heathrow airport to the hotel. So I wrote to Frits, since I had his contact info already.  He promptly had the concierge arrange a ride for us from the airport, and the concierge contacted me! 

My only criticism is that, at first I thought the mattress was going to be a little soft for me...but we woke up refreshed every morning, and I never got any backache. So it seems the mattress was comfortable after all.

Breakfast at the Marylebone's restaurant was utterly spectacular! If you can get breakfast included with your room, it is definitely worth it. We ordered a hot breakfast each morning at the hotel's restaurant, and this also allowed us to enjoy the breakfast buffet as well. The breads, local meats, cheeses, and smoked fish at the buffet were fabulous, and the full English breakfast was one of the best that I've had anywhere. The hotel's excellent restaurant is called 108 Bar & Grill, and that's where breakfast is served. We especially enjoyed the table by the window, as there's a view out to the quaint little street. I also enjoyed the Porridge on the hot breakfast menu, but don't miss out on trying the Full English! 

I'm sorry that I didn't post this review sooner, but I've saved all of my notes and some photos. When we return to London, I'm 100% sure we'll stay at The Marylebone again! I enjoyed this much more than our stay at the London Marriott County Hall hotel. Just keep in mind that if having a huge room is the most important factor for you, then The Marylebone may not be the best fit for you. For us, it was an amazing stay.",5,2014,10,04
123,Lucky competition win!,An impulse entry in the Marylebone Journal resulted in a fabulous overnight stay at The Marylebone Hotel with a sumptuous dinner at 108 Pantry.  My husband and I had a really luxurious stay with really friendly staff in a very convenient location.  Hope to come again for Christmas!,4,2014,10,04
123,A very comfortable London base,"I have stayed at the Marylebone Hotel several times.  Their service has always been impeccable, the rooms clean and the beds comfortable.  Breakfasts used to be outstanding, both in range of choice and quality, but they've just changed the layout and system, so it's too early to say whether standards have been maintained.

The position is excellent, close to the super shopping of Marylebone and many good eating places.",4,2014,10,03
123,Worst service ever!,"Good location about 10 minute walk from Bond Street tube station. However very overpriced and a huge disappointment. 
Staff esp front desk was cold, condescending and unhelpful. Absolutely the worse service I have ever experienced in the more than hundred hotels I've stayed in. 
Breakfast was included in the exorbitant price but restaurant staff did not volunteer or offer the hot breakfast even though it was included. It almost seemed like they were hoping we'd not ask and just take the continental buffet. 
Amenities in the bathroom looked like they had been used and half full. 
Will definitely never stay at this hotel and the Doyle chain again and I strongly recommend you give this hotel a miss. 
There is a Holiday Inn down the street and closer to Bond Street which I'm sure will be a more value for money and give a more pleasant experience. 
Actually any of the many London hotels I've stayed in would give a much better experience.

123,The Marylebone Hotel London,"The Hotel is located at the heart of London West End, close to the shopping areas of Oxford St and Reget Street. I was attracted to this hotel upon a recommendation from a friend, and I am Swimming addict, the hotel pool was just what I wanted next to accomodation. Thevroom was very clean and bright, somewhat small, with a Queen bed. The Restaurant served an excellent menue 
",4,2014,10,02
123,"staff, service, location, that breakfast....","I am only ever impelled to write about a hotel when I leave and want to go back. And when I do go back the service, smiles and kindness of the staff is the same. I’ve lived in London for 20 years so having to book a hotel for my recent stays felt weird. I love the area - The Marylebone typifies the charm and ease of the local community. From early morning cuppas in the lounge with newspapers to the excellent breakfast service, access to gym, pool and park (Regent’s Park), and finally, a lovely evening bar for drinks, just off Marylebone High Street. For those who love shopping it’s perfect for Bond Street and Oxford Street. I hope The Marylebone doesn’t change too much before I return.",5,2014,09,30
123,Central London location with hidden benefits,"Good value, great location hotel with surprisingly good restaurant and attentive staff. Great for business and leisure trips. In the heart of Marylebone village, a stone's throw from shopping oasis, Selfridges, the hotel is relaxed but professional, with surprising charm for a hotel of this size.
      ",4,2014,09,30
123,An Absolute Gem of a Hotel,"I stayed here to celebrate my birthday in London and I love this hotel so much I can't envision staying anywhere else when I next visit London. 
The location is perfect, just behind Oxford Street. Facilities are first class, rooms are lovely, clean and well furnished. Breakfast was lovely too with polite and attentive staff. 
The main thing for me though was the ambiance which is hard to describe really. But it was peaceful, relaxed, safe and friendly. I just love it. ",5,2014,09,30
123,"5-star service, great location","The service of this hotel was excellent. Literally every employee was super professional, friendly and helpful. The interior of rooms and public areas is stylish! Breakfast was excellent. The only small issue we faced were the beds which were very very soft.",4,2014,09,29
123,"Very expensive, not respect of platinum members","I have been living in this hotel for 9 months (very good location, 200 meters from my office). No respect for long stays guests. I never get upgrades of the room as I should because of my Platinum status. In any other hotel after nine months I would be a guest star.
For one night is fine, but if you choose it for long time staying, evaluate other alternatives ",2,2014,09,29
123,Honeymoon!,"What a fantastic hotel.  This was our 3rd stay and we were on honeymoon.  On check in the receptionist organised a free cocktail and a surprise to our room! Our room was spotless and well equipped with tea/expresso coffee machine which my husband loved, plenty of towels, slippers, bathrobes.  The mini bar is well stocked too.  The staff then left a bottle of champagne with chocolates to our room with a lovely card to wish us good luck!  The staff at this hotel are brilliant and want to look after you.  The location is so convenient and offers a nice quiet area with lovely shops nearby.  Every night we slept well with no noise.  We wouldn't want to stay anywhere else in London.  Staff then placed rose petals on our bed when we returned to our room on our first night with green tea, strawberries in chocolate, cake... a very memorable stay, thank you again Marylebone Hotel.",5,2014,09,29
123,"Brilliant Hotel: Stylish Interiors, Helpful Staff, Great Location","For me, this Hotel ticks all the boxes. I like the decor, especially the spacious ground floor public spaces(with its artworks) and the 2 restaurants. Restaurant 108 is a great place to have coffee, and read papers.The location is minutes away from fashionable Marylebone High st. I will definitely return

Some of the rooms may be small, so if you can, go for a pricier deluxe room. Try to get also a room closer to the lifts, as the corridors may feel dim and claustrophobic",5,2014,09,28
123,A very nice place to stay in London,"Pros: The staff highlights Gunter, Miguel, Mohamed and Ismail. A Tea service at night, the room cleanness, the breakfast with gouda cheese, brie, provolone, mackerel, smoked salmon, fruits, sourdough bread. The
bathroom underfloor heating. Daily bonbons in the bed room. Electric water heater for tea/coffe and varied dishes and cups. An ironing table w/ iron.
Located in a quiet street at almost the same distance from Oxford Circus, Bond Street, Baker Street, Regent Street and Great Portaland Street Underground Stations. Near to Oxford Street, Regent Street, Regent Park. 
Lobby with flavored water and fruits.Trustable Transfer services. Taxis at the door
The cons: Bathroom: missing an hygienic shower and slippery bathtub. Safe is too low.The air conditioning switches off during the night",5,2014,09,28
123,What more do you want?,"Stayed here for business however would definitely come back with the family for a short break. Location is king with the Marylebone, firstly it sits in the middle of Marylebone village so plenty of shops, restaurants and pubs right on the doorstep .... And no shortage of local history. 5 min walk and you are on Oxford Street, so if shopping is the order of the day you have it adequately covered. The rooms are a reasonable size, very clean and quiet despite being so close to the heart of London. Restaurant at the back of the hotel surprised me at how good the food was and how reasonably priced it is however I suspect this is due to lots of local competition, this is on the edge of the Lebanese section of town so the choice there is amazing. Last point - if you are there on a Tue or Sat nip out the back to the pub on the corner (painted red) as they have a pianist who comes in for a sing a long - beats Karaoke hands down!",5,2014,09,26
123,Best hotel in London !!!!,"Have stayed in this hotel for 6 nights in September.From the min we booked the room until  the moment we left the hotel- it was wonderful.This hotel 
The stuff at the reciption was professional,efficient,kind and you can see that they are putting the client on top.We wanted to visit he buckingham palace and they help us in arranging tickects very quicly.
The room was great,  very clean and at good size ,very warm and welcoming.WIFI connection was very good -somthing which all hotels declare but some how does not work.
Location of the hotel is very good,5 mins walk from Oxford street.A very nice surprize was to see that evryday after we came back to the room at evning , there was always 2 bottles of water with chocolate.These gestures makes one hotel different from the other. Also the doorman who always had some advised on good resurants,places with music etc.
This hotel have also gym and swimming pool, which looked very tempting -unfortunely we did not use it,maybe next time. In any case the gym stuff as well was very nice and gave us all information we asked for in case we want to use it.

In overall,we enjoyed this hotel so much we decided to come back soon.I would like to thank the stuff of this hotel especially Mr Long Voong,and also the person who booked for us the tickets.
It was great and very good value for money !!!!",5,2014,09,25
123,We loved it!,"We were there from September 13th to 18th. We originally chose this hotel for its location and reviews and we were not disappointed! We arrived at 7:30AM exhausted from our travels and the hotel accommodated us very well and had our room ready for us by 8:30AM. They did not even act like it was an inconvenience. I had emailed ahead to let them know it was our Honeymoon (mainly to surprise my partner) and they did just as they said and made it an unforgettable stay. As a result, we got a room at the back of the hotel with a nice view, champagne, chocolates, rose petals EVERYWHERE, and a congratulations card (although it had Mr. and Mrs. on it when both names on the reservation are obviously boy names). This hotel also has free turndown service at night with chocolates and water (still and sparkling).

By the way, let me just say that heated bathroom floors are heaven! Bath products smelled amazing! The spa was okay I wasn't too thrilled with my 175# treatment, but that was fine. Breakfast was included in our stay and it was always just amazing! The eggs were done perfectly and the tea was nice! I was really sad when we had to leave!

To sum it all up: I am big on customer service. This hotel did it perfectly! The rooms were clean and decent size (we're from Texas and I'm still saying the rooms were decent size wise). Breakfast was good. It was a 7 minute walk to the tube station. Nice charming neighborhood.",5,2014,09,24
123,Excellence All Round,"Having arrived at the hotel we were a little flat with the first impression of the exterior, however if ever there was a wrong first impression then this was it.  From the moment we arrived nothing was too much trouble, from the doorman - who remembered our name on the way out (shopping) as well as the following morning on our way to breakfast very impressive.

Check in was flawless, any polite and engaging without being over bearing, on a hot sticky day it was the perfect greeting.

On to the suite, roof top terrace, which was significantly better than either we expected or was indeed portrayed in the brochure.  The room was immaculate with the very highest standard of cleanliness throughout, the terrace offered a spectacular roof top view of London.

After a hard days shopping we retired to the bar where we found the Rumanian barman to be a whizz with cocktails, after sampling several we headed off to Soho for the evening.  On return the night service had turned down the bed and left a refreshing flask of herbal tea and a slice of home made cake - nice touch.  Breakfast again found us surrounded by remarkable efficient, polite and engaging staff.

Breakfast itself was a treat, with a very Celtic feel to it, but clearly all on the plate had been individually prepared and not just slapped on the plate.  The only downside to the whole experience was having to check-out our time was done.

Overall a truly fantastic hotel, where nothing appears to be too much trouble, a must stay venue for all visiting London",5,2014,09,24
123,Location excellent,"This hotel is in the heart of Marylebone which s a brilliant part of London feeling like a little village with its numerous specialist shops, cafés , restaurants, English pubs etc. 
The lobby itself is small but check in and out was very quick. The staff throughout the hotel were extremely friendly and helpful. There are many different and beautiful relaxing areas throughout the hotel for some quiet time. We stayed in a standard queen room which was not big but had everything you could possibly need for your stay. We did find the bathroom a little on the small side though. Others in our party had bigger rooms so maybe you could ask for a change of room if not satisfied at first. Breakfast was included in our package and was scrumptious. I must give special mention to our dining room attendant Alladin who was a delight. The Marylebone is only a short stroll to Oxford St, Madame Tassauds, St Christopher's place with its lmany eateries, and many more attractions. I would definitely stay at this lovely hotel again.",5,2014,09,23
123,Attention to detail,"We had a very good experience at this hotel.  We found it very convenient for Theatre Land, shops, and walking to many places.  Marylebone is a very nice area with lots of restaurants nearby and Oxford Street a couple of blocks away.

All the staff were very friendly, all taking time to pass the time of day.  Little touches like complementary bottled water and chocolates in your room & when you go out for the day.  Complimentary robes & slippers.  Breakfast was one of the best we've ever had, such a wide range of everything.  Even if you only opt for the continental breakfast you will have a huge choice.

We had a deluxe room on the 4th (top) floor.  It was very spacious, the shower was very good.  TV reception, excellent, free WIFI very good.

It was my birthday and complimentary prosecco & chocolate Brownie was in our room when we returned.

We managed to get a very good deal on our room through an external agent including full english breakfast as we booked last minute.  

The only reason I can't give it an excellent rating is that at 11.30pm the boiler was being mended on the roof above us.  Very noisy and went on for over an hour.  It only stopped when we complained & were offered complimentary drinks.  I believe if we had been warned of the noise before and drinks brought up then it would have been better.  At one point I thought someone was going to fall through the ceiling!",4,2014,09,22
123,Excellent location and service,"This hotel has recently had a make over, large bedrooms with all the extra you need right down to providing an umbrella. The staff were all a pleasure to deal with and went out there way to help. The hotel practically gleamed, and was so welcoming it will certainly be my first choice when visiting London again",5,2014,09,22
123,Nice hotel in good location,"Overall  a very good hotel, deserving its ratings. The outside looks a bit dull but once inside you're welcomed and taken care of by very nice staff (as in many placed reception can at some times be crowded). The common areas are very nice with a lounge feeling. My room was a deluxe and it was well equipped though not large. Don't expect a nice view, many rooms look out onto a boring court yard. The room itself is nicely furnished but a little bit worn in places. The bed was comfy with good bed linen- The bathroom nice and big enough (2 sinks) but the shower solutions means you will wet half the floor. The gym is good (externally provided with lot's of equipment and nice changing rooms. The swimming pool is not so deep and more for doing laps than relaxing. Breakfast was ok but a bit expensive. A lot of restaurants in the Marylebone Village area and close by to the main shopping on Oxford street.  ",4,2014,09,22
123,my home away from home in London,"Excellent location - the hotel is located just behind Marylebone High-street which is my favourite street in London. it is also very close to Oxford street. lots of nice shops, great coffee places and restaurants. the hotel is lovely. I stayed in a great comfortable room. staff is very friendly and helpful. great lobby with places to have a chat and a coffee. good facilities. nice breakfast. I come to London very often and I usually stay at this hotel.",5,2014,09,19
123,Great location but very small rooms,"The hotel has many admirable qualities.  The rooms are clean, the decor is modern without being cold and the location is great.  The hotel is near the High Street with lots of interesting restaurants and shops.  The breakfast was just OK - very small selection on the buffet and very poor selection of fresh fruit.  Service in restaurant was outstanding.  Unfortunately the coffee was bitter

The double superior rooms are tiny.  If two people share this room, there is not enough space to get to the side of the bed near the window.   I noticed that there was an extra chair near the elevator on my floor  - probably put there by guests who needed more room.  Also the bathroom in one of the rooms I had was very very tiny.  The door to the bathroom barely grazed the toilet.  Towels and toiletries were excellent.   I noticed that the description of rooms mentioned heated bathroom floors - not in my room.   The second room I had was facing the courtyard with a shower rather than a tub.  The bathroom was slightly larger.   The rooms are extremely quiet - absolutely no noise from adjoining rooms.

The hotel is replacing its mattresses so be sure to check that your room has a new mattress.

I would probably stay at the hotel if I wanted to stay in this part of London.",4,2014,09,18
123,Excellent Accommodations and Service,"Just spent 4 days at this property.  Our stay was wonderful. the hotel and rooms were spacious and very clean.  The Service was exceptional.  The Concierge Riyas was always cheerful and helpful as were all of the staff. I would highly recommend this hotel.  Location is perfect just off of the main street. Room good sized with wonderful city view and full of light.  Only minor complaint was that the bed was a bit soft for my liking and there was an odd smell in the hall way to the breakfast area.

Would happily return and stay if my travels bring me back.",5,2014,09,18
123,Never Again!,"I have read the recent reviews and after our experience I am left wondering at the veracity of the reviews. It appears to me that any review which may have said something was wrong at the Hotel has been removed.

We booked along with another couple rooms 180 and 383 for five days. The couple in 180 was denied access to their room on arrival for quite some time and when they complained they were given another room. The mini bar was empty and not filled until four days later. Their toilet blocked twice and could not be used.  Their shower was also almost ineffectual and used ours on a number of occasions. They had to use the toilets in reception.

We were in room 383. A room with a brick wall for a view but it was very quiet. The room was very small and the bathroom even smaller like something from Lilliput! Nor was it clean with numerous stains on the tiles which were like bodily fluids had dried on the floor. The Guest Relations Manager was shown the bathroom and his comment was it needed refurbishing. 

All this culminated in being present when housekeeping serviced the room changed the bed and to my horror when a pillow case was removed there was ""blood"" on the case. I am assuming ""human blood"" as it is a Hotel for humans.(I have photos).

This was the end and a meeting was requested with the General Manager. We got to discuss with Guest Relations Manager and were not graced with the General Managers appearance at all. The GRM was very apologetic and thanked us for our complaints as they where helpful in fixing things that were wrong in the Hotel. I would not have thought they needed help.

From the door, reception and other staff there was a sullen attitude and a remarkable number of staff whose first language was not English. In fact it appeared many were short term employees on holiday and working from other part of the Union. The housekeeping staff were generally friendly.

The in room amenities for tea coffee making for a ""four star"" hotel were pathetic. Two teabags two coffee sticks, two sugar and three little pottles of milk. Not at all what you would expect for a $278 pound a night Hotel. A request for more was finally actioned on the last night when a large amount where placed in the room like it was some sort of joke.

As it was impractical to leave the Hotel, we did try but accommodation in London at short notice for two couples was difficult, so we negotiated with the Hotel. They agreed in the end to credit both couples two nights accommodation and by way of apology gave us a free meal at the Hotel. That was appreciated and I think probably that is how the Hotel solves all its issues.

I have travelled the world and have never encountered such a Hotel. Even with the credit of two nights per room for both couples we still spent $1492.00 pound. An awful lot of money for a ""Fawlty Towers"" experience.

I have used our room numbers as I am quite happy to discuss with Management and provide them with photographic evidence if required. I am not in the habit of writing vindictive reviews and have in fact waited some three days prior to reviewing so I could be objective.",1,2014,09,17
123,"Classy, convenient and cool","This little gem is tucked away on a quiet side street just a hop, skip and a jump away from Oxford Street shopping district and is within easy walking distance to 2 tube stations.  The decor is visually stunning, with unique and comfortable lobby furniture.  The bar is formal yet very comfortable, with excellent service.  Rooms were designed with efficiency in mind, and while definitely small, did not feel cramped at all.  Comfortable beds and pillows; robes and slippers were an extravagant bonus!  Bathroom is gorgeous, and again, the design must be mentioned.  I was truly impressed with the layout, and the shower was a real treat.  Service overall was wonderful.  When we checked in, we were asked what brought us to London.  We mentioned that we we were there to celebrate our 1-year wedding anniversary (and see Kate Bush!), and upon returning to our room after dinner, found a nice bottle of prosecco and the most delicious chocolates at our bedside!  This was completely unexpected and made our visit even more amazing.  It's personal touches like this that make a hotel go from memorable to completely unforgettable.  Well done, Marylebone Hotel!!",5,2014,09,17
123,Four star plus,"My wife and I stayed at the marylebone  on a weekend away,what a find .first class all round,staff ,rooms facilities,could not fault a thing.breakfast cooked to order was superb.great for oxford st. Shops and a short cab.to Coventry garden and other areas.we loved it ",5,2014,09,15
123,Can't fault the service or location! Fantastic!,"I am not generally someone who 'gushes' about where I stay but I had to write a review because Usually I can always find something to complain about! However, This time, I can't!!! This really is a fantastic hotel.  The location is superb.  You can easily walk to oxford street and from there to the surrounding areas. However, what I was particularly impressed with, was the service.  It was impeccable. I can not thank all the staff enough for making our stay extra special.  My husband booked this hotel as it was a special birthday celebration.  On arrival we asked if it was possible to be upgraded because of my birthday and we were given a spectacular room at no extra charge.  They also surprised us with a bottle to celebrate with in the room too! The breakfast was amazing.  So much food and again a fantastic service.  We rarely find a place that we would return to but i can honestly say that we will be returning the next time we can get another break away! Thank you so much to the staff who made this experience one of the best I think a hotel has ever given us!",5,2014,09,15
123,"Perfect location, great experience","We were given the name of the Marylebone Hotel by a friend from Los Angeles who has stayed here several times. We've thoroughly enjoyed our time here, especially aided by Gunther and Riyas, who have been extremely helpful and courteous. The rooms are lovely and modern, the staff is pleasant and helpful, and the location can't be beat. We will definitely return again, and are anxious to try other hotels in the Doyle Collection.",5,2014,09,15
123,London,"Excellent hotel and excellent location.  Have been visiting London for many years.  I find The Marylebone friendly, courteous and always ready to go that little bit further to make your stay enjoyable. You are within walking distance of the West End theatres, restaurants, Mayfair, the leading stores and Hyde Park - if you need that extra space to walk about, away from the shops.",4,2014,09,14
123,"Good Hotel, Great Breakfast","This hotel has a boutique feel.  The accommodations were nice.  The best thing about the hotel was the breakfast.  We filled up for the day and usually skipped lunch for a light snack.  The hotel is in a quiet residential neighborhood, which is nice.  It is quite a few blocks from the tube stations, though.  The Bond Street station being closed for renovations causes more train transfers.  My wife was able to get a juice at the bar.  There are many rooms on the main floor to relax.  The concierge was not very helpful for restaurants in the area.",4,2014,09,13
123,Went the extra mile!,Great hotel. Me and wife recently stayed for a short weekend break. I had a few special requests for my wife's birthday. Gunther in reception was fantastic and went above and beyond to make our stay exceptional. Would definitely visit again. ,5,2014,09,09
123,Perfect stay!!!,"We stayed here 3 nights and it was the most perfect stay ever!! Never going to choose any other hotel when we're coming to London! The room was lovely, the food excellent and the staff very friendly!!
      ",5,2014,09,09
123,Wonderful Stay,"We had only 2 nights at the hotel but wished we could have stayed longer. From the excellent location, centrally located to shops (Oxford St), restaurants and Victoria station, there was so much to do at this beautiful hotel and not enough time to experience it all. The Staff were all very helpful, attentive and thoughtful- from the check in/check out process and ensuring that our needs were met. We stayed on the 5th floor, while there was construction next door, it didn't bother us as we were up and planning our day already. The room (superior standard room), decor and the bed were all very comfy, we especially appreciated the little touches-bathrobes, slippers, complimentary soft drinks to greet us and chocolates in the evening. Rooms are smaller by North American standards but still enough room to store suitcases and move around comfortably.
While we didn't get the chance to enjoy all the amenities, we had a quick stroll around the hotel. The pool and the exercise facilities were state of the art and the photos don't really do it justice. We would definitely stay here again, and this time longer! Our stay was very comfortable, within walking distances of everything and safe neighborhoods.",4,2014,09,09
123,Mixed review,"Great location, only 2 minutes walk to cafes, shops etc. 
Reception and public areas are modern, clean and well appointed. Breakfast and dining area also superb. 
Guest rooms are ok, let down by size and a little shabby, could definitely do with an upgrade to match the public areas. 
What makes this hotel, is the friendly and welcoming staff and the little extras, such as complimentary water, chocolates turn down service etc..",3,2014,09,06
123,OUTSTANDING!!,"This is a great hotel which is difficult to find fault with. From check-in to check-out the service was excellent, especially in the restaurant at breakfast.

Check in was efficient, rooms were great. We had a Studio suite which was spacious, very light and everything was provided. Everything was very clean including the bathroom which also had everything we needed. Our room was on the 6th floor and very quiet.

Breakfast was fantastic. Choose from the buffet and also have a full English. Service was excellent especially our waiter (unfortunately I did not get his name). Was always on the ball ensuring we had everything we needed. Plenty of choice for breakfast.

Location is also good. 5 minutes from Oxford Street and 5 minutes from Regent's Park. The closest tube station is only a five minute walk away.

This is a great hotel which I would happily stay at again. You will not be disappointed.",5,2014,09,06
123,Superb ,"Weekend stay.

Wonderful location in Marylebone with all the 'village' attributes you may dream of. So close to Mayfair, Oxford Street etc.. And yet so refreshingly quiet.

Room very comfortable.

Breakfast very good. Civilised.

Staff very helpful and attentive.

",5,2014,09,06
123,Would recommend,"I live in London so rarely stay in hotels here, but with children at home, can be fun to have a night away. Very pleasant hotel. Would definitely recommend to friends from out of town. If breakfast is included in your room rate you are in for a treat - scrumptious.",4,2014,09,05
123,The Marylebone Hotel,"The Marylebone Hotel was exceptional in all areas. The staff were friendly helpful and knowledgeable, nothing was too much trouble and you were always felt you had their full attention. The hotel itself was very clean and welcoming. I would certainly recommend the hotel to friends and family, would not hesitate in making future bookings.",5,2014,09,04
123,Trip to London,"Excellent location and neighborhood.
Good room.Fantastic attention at front desk - if you are a Brazilian ask for Gunther.
Easy to access from Underground.Walking distance to Bond Street and other fine shopping areas.
A choice to be made.",4,2014,09,03
123,Great location,"Comfortable rooms and lovely public areas. Quiet setting and great neighbourhood to explore.   A small elevator at the back provides convenient access to rooms at that end of the hotel.
Hearty breakfasts in pleasant ambiance made a great start to the day.
      
      ",5,2014,09,01
123,Top Location with comfortable rooms,We booked this hotel less than 12 hours before staying & got a great deal for 2 nights over the weekend.  Brilliant location (situated on a quiet street meant we got a good night's sleep on one of the most comfortable beds I have ever slept in!) within walking distance of Regent/Oxford Street & Soho.  Our room was straight in front of the main lift so we were a little worried it was going to be noisy but it wasn't.  The room is compact but tastefully furnished & decorated and very comfortable (the Nespresso coffee machine was a nice extra touch).  The bathroom was teeny tiny but the shower was brilliant.  Staff very courteous and helpful. I would definitely stay here again.,4,2014,09,01
123,Great location and service,"Husband and I stayed here for 4 nights in July and had a great experience.

Check-in was quick and easy, and everyone was very friendly and welcoming.

We had a Deluxe Room, which was nicely furnished, with a fantastic bed.
The room was on the small side, but enough to fit 2 suitcases so it was fine.
(I assume the Standard and Superior rooms are smaller again, so 2 suitcases may have been an issue there)

Downside of the room - and the only downside for us - it smelled like cigarettes when we walked in, even though I requested a non-smoking room and the hotel is sold as a non-smoking hotel.
It didn't bother us too much as we didn't spend much time in the room, but it wasn't a great first impression.

The breakfast was fantastic, with great selection, buffet AND A La Carte, as well as attentive service with a smile.

The best thing about the Marylebone is it's location.
If you are looking for a hotel walking distance to Oxford street (2 min), Regent Street (10 min) and Leicester Square (20 min) - this is it.
The immediate area the hotel is in is lovely, very quiet and with a few nice bars and cafes closeby.

As a travel agent I would definitely recommend this hotel to my clients.",4,2014,08,30
123,Short stay post hospital,"Arrival and check in we're fast and efficient, the staff very friendly. We were quickly in our room and were confronted with the smell of stale smoke. The room , despite being a junior suite, was extremely small with a bed shoe horned into an position off the main sitting area.  In the sitting area there was just one small round table around 18 inches in diameter and the most uncomfortable chairs. The furniture made it impossible to have dinner with my wife in comfort.
The bathroom, although of decent size had a bath that was impossible to use due to its size. On enquiry we were told all rooms have this type of bath fitted.
The general decor was tired and badly needs renovation and the mattress on the bed was well over due a change as it sagged badly in the middle.
The hotel is convenient to the medical facilities in the area and also Oxford Street. There are a number of excellent restaurants in the area.
room service was a challenge making us on a number of occasions request fresh produces and accurate orders.  This really lets down the hotel.

I would stay for a short period again due to its location, but would certainly not recommend. ",3,2014,08,29
123,Real Treat,"This is my 3rd stay at The Marylebone and once again everything was perfect..
The staff are all so friendly and helpful and the rooms have the most comfortable beds I have ever slept in. The overall ambience makes you feel like a welcome house guest and I look forward to my next visit.",5,2014,08,29
123,TAJ MPLS,This hotel is excellent.  We have stayed at many hotels around the world but none offer the level of service The Marleybone.  It is a real hotel with a heart.  It is in an excellent location with great access to the city.  Would definitely stay there again.,5,2014,08,29
123,TeaTime,"I didn't stay at this hotel this time (my third trip),  but my sister and I had tea at the Pantry at 108 here.  We were both impressed with the looks of the hotel and I think in the future either of us would consider staying here.  It's in a central location to reach the places I haven't visited in London yet.",4,2014,08,27
123,A lovely treat for a special wedding anniversary,"A superbly located hotel in a quiet oasis really close to Oxford Street and environs.  We mentioned it was our anniversary and we were delighted to find a bottle of prosecco, chocolates and a card from the staff in our room.  We stayed in a deluxe room which had dual aspect and was well decorated and appointed.  Breakfast was included in our room rate and was very comprehensive.  The waiting staff were attentive, polite and a nice touch was they found out your surname and addressed you directly to make sure you had all you needed.",5,2014,08,27
123,This is not a non-smoking hotel.,"Lovely lobby.  Stinky rooms.  If you stay here, be sure to specify you want a non smoking room.  You may or may not get one, but if you enquire if smoking is permitted, the front desk will say no, the maids will say yes, or no depending on whom you ask.  My daughters room stank of cigarettes and ours smelled of old cigars.  Our room had locked windows and no fresh air available.  Cigarette butts littered the window ledge, and our room's carpet was dirty and stained.
Elegant pretense at its best.",3,2014,08,26
123,Fantastic experience,The hotel and its staff are simply top class.  From the moment of arrival to check out the staff were professional and friendly. All of the facilities are fantastic. Definitely a place we will revisit!,5,2014,08,26
123,"Style, service and great location for central London","My wife and I just stayed at the hotel for our wedding anniversary. The staff did everything to make our stay very special; their friendliness and level of service was superb! The hotel's contemporary style is warm and welcoming. The rooms are very comfortable and the Grill is superb, both from a culinary and ambiance perspective. Being so close to Oxford st. and a pleasant walk to Piccadilly and beyond, the location was ideal for us. Bravo to the hotel team - a memorable stay!",5,2014,08,26
123,Nice stay in The Marylebone Hotel,"We had a very good stay in the Marylebone Hotel. Very good location near Bond Street and others. Nice rooms, only the breakfast could be better.
Definitely a recommendation for a short stay in the City of London.",5,2014,08,26
123,Didn't start well but improved,"Stayed here for long weekend in London.  When we arrived we checked in and where allocated a room and as soon as we opened the door it was obvious it was not the superior room that  we had booked and had a huge cot in the room when we don't have a baby!! We went back down to reception and after a rather long wait were reallocated another room,  which was much better even though it smelt slightly of tabacco. The rooms and the public areas of the hotel are tastefully decorated and extremely clean.  Overall a good place to stay and very conveniently located just a 5 min walk to Oxford Street and also close to the bars and restaurants of Marylebone. One thing to note is that breakfast is ridiculously expensive and a much better option is Patisserie Valerie which is just a short walk in Marylebone High Street and very good quality and value.",4,2014,08,24
123,overpriced,stayed in for six days but still the mini bar was empty!! very small shower and room!! overpriced for a room like this! there was no hairdryer in the room. we aloso could hear every little noise from the next room,3,2014,08,24
123,"Ideal location, with great rooms and a very caring staff.","My wife and I came to London from the US to celebrate a milestone wedding anniversary, so the accommodations were very important to us.  We were delighted with the service and with our room.  The management and staff were top-notch and went out of their way to assist us in any way they could.  We will recommend This Maryelbone Hotel to our friends.",5,2014,08,23
123,"Great place , very convenient","Right in the heart of the city , close to all the main shops and many areas of interest, parks etc.
Handy for tube and 5 minutes taxi from all the main railway stations.
Lots of lounges for casual business meetings.
Standard rooms not large but nicely furnished and well decorated. 
Good coffee shop and restaurants. 

Lots of traditional pubs and good eating places in the area if you want some fresh air.
 
Staff great.",5,2014,08,22
123,Nice location,We stayed for four nights with my kids. We stayed on the first floor and didn't like the view. The room was a bit tired but clean. The staff is great and the location is just amazing. The only thing is that you could feel that the building is old and needs some renovation  ,4,2014,08,21
123,"Perfect location, average value for money.","I spent three nights at the Marylebone Hotel and the most striking feature is actually its location, which is conveniently close to Oxford Street for connecting to all other London zones via public transport, but also, and most importantly, is right in the middle of the Marylebone district, with its shops, bars and restaurants.

Upon arrival, we couldn't check in due to a problem with the IT system. 
The staff was understandably frustrated with the nuisances this was causing to all arriving guests and did make some efforts to compensate, specifically by providing vouchers for free drinks at the very nice bar within the hotel (six in total, equivalent to almost 100 GBP).
The overall attitude of the staff was positive and sincerely apologetic (shout out to Zohora for being so kind with us!).

When we finally made it through check in, we were welcomed in a nice room. Contemporary furniture, adequately spacious (considering London standards), nice bathroom.
Housekeeping service has proved to be top notch for the entire duration of our stay.

The main issue, and the only one to be honest, was the bed size: a queen bed in what was called a doublebed room for two adults. While this may be practice for some hotels, it came as an awful surprise, given the standards this hotel apparently aims to set. 
The bed was simply too small to comfortably accommodate two adults and three sleepless nights subsequently ensued. 

Given the rates at this hotel and that sleeping well is the primary need that a room must satisfy, while objectively beautiful, I can't really support the Marylebone Hotel as much as I'd like to.
I would suggest evaluating other options unless you're booking business/suite rooms.",3,2014,08,21
123,Lovely hotel,"We stayed here for our wedding anniversary by way of a change we decided to stay here the staff were so friendly and nothing was too  much trouble we booked a superior room which was very nice modern and clean with a comfy double bed. The bathroom however was very small so I would look at booking a different room when we go back, yes we would return here without a doubt we were presented with a bottle of Prosecco and chocolates on our wedding anniversary which was a lovely gesture.",4,2014,08,19
123,Great location,"Stayed 2 nights here and the hotel has it all nice rooms good restaurants and bars
Friendly staff and great fitness/spa section with a big pool a plus is the free wifi in the rooms this is not written on their site just common areas. ",4,2014,08,19
123,weekend break,"very good theatre break in london ,ideal location for our visit to buckingham palace and hyde park.selfridges just 10 min walk from hotel.very good mix of bars and eateries on doorstep.nearest tube station bond street[on central line] so straightforward access to covent garden/leicester square.
      ",5,2014,08,18
123,Wished we didn't have to leave,"Was able to spend four relaxing days at the Marylebone property.  The stay was wonderful - the staff was very attentive and was checking to see if there was anything they could do to help us.  We had breakfast included in our stay which was a wonderful way to start each day.  Beds were extremely comfortable - we had been traveling prior to this and when we got to the Marylebone, these were our best nights of sleep.  The Hotel is conveniently located to Bond station (be aware Jubilee line does not currently stop at Bond due to work) and Baker Station.  Great restaurants in the neighborhood so you don't have to go far.  ",5,2014,08,18
123,Just great. ,"Just back from The Marylebone having been to watch Les Miserables. The hotel had Friendly staff, the room was great (we got an upgrade without even asking!) the bar is cool though drinks were very pricey. The cooked breakfast was perfect too. 

Perfect stay, would certainly use again. ",5,2014,08,18
123,A lovely place to stay in a very nice part of London,There is a very good welcome at this lovely hotel in a very pleasant quite central part of London. - The hotel exterior does not reflect the stylish-modern hotel within. Although quite big it feels very personal and friendly. We stay often and have already booked our next trip!!,5,2014,08,17
123,Very convenient. Little expensive if you are not on a business trip,"Very convenient. Little expensive if you are not on a business trip.
You are 500mt away from Oxford street but still sufficient far not to be disturbed by any noise.

123,"Fabulous hotel, with great facilities and brilliant customer service","We stayed in this hotel for my husbands 40th birthday recently,  as we were going to the Pizza Express Jazz Club for the evening. It is a fabulous hotel, in a great location, but with lovely quiet, clean rooms, and with brilliant facilities. The staff were great, and the customer service was second to none. I would highly recommend this hotel and would definetly go back there. My only tiny complaint is that breakfast was not inlcuded in the room rate, which I feel for a hotel of this standard, beakfast should be part of the package.",5,2014,08,14
123,Beware of the building site next to the hotel!,This is normally a good hotel but there is a building site near by so you WILL be woken up early if your room faces the construction site. Its a real shame they dont tell you before you make your reservation or when you check in!!,2,2014,08,14
123,Excellent hotel - Great value and location at a good price,"One of the best business hotels i have stayed in when in London! .... and i am quite fussy!
Excellent location - I was able to walk to most of my client appointments.
Yes the facade is very 70's , but the hotel has been beautifully refurbished to a very high standard.
Breakfast was one of the best i have had in London... and a fairly civilised affair even with lots of tourists and families staying at the moment in their busiest time
The rooms are small but well fitted out ... modern and clean.  
Staff were really helpful professional and polite
The gym and indoor swimming pool were a fabulous added bonus ... a proper lap swimming pool too! 
Dinner in the bistro style restaurant was excellent too
I will definitely stay here again when in london with work",5,2014,08,13

123,Great Hotel - Ideal Location,"The Marylebone Hotel is my hotel of choice in London and I've stayed there a number of times.  The hotel staff is exceptional, the rooms are reasonably sized and have always been very clean and quiet. The location of the hotel is ideal, with many amenities in the immediate vicinity, centrally located but away from the bustle of Oxford Street. I would highly recommend the hotel.",5,2014,08,11
123,Thank you Frits!,"Stayed here last night. Very nice area, quiet location despite being just around the corner from Oxford Street. Easy to get to from Bond Street Station. 
Arrived to find we had been upgraded to a suite due to the kindness of Frits the Manager trying to help me make it more special for my wedding anniversary. On our return that evening we found that we had a complimentary bottle of bubbly in the room, some chocolates and a card. Thank you Frits!
The room was lovely, we enjoyed all the nice touches including rose petals in a love heart shape on the bed and sprinkled all over the floor! Thank you!
Breakfast was great, I had a full english and also had some of the huge selection of cold buffet items. Also had a look at the pool and gym, just didn't have time sadly.
We will return to this hotel!",5,2014,08,10
123,"Nice hotel, friendly customer service, good central location","Recently stayed over on business, the stay was very comfortable, room was well equipped, if on the small size. Reception staff was very welcoming and friendly.
I would stay here again.... Only downside was the lack of nearby car parking",4,2014,08,10

123,luxury value in good location,"Good location in the West End. Hotel has been recently updated to a high standard. Staff are especially helpful and welcoming. Rooms not large, but well outfitted. Good value and recommended. Best deal was booking direct through the hotel web site.
      ",5,2014,08,10
123,"Nice, but not great","Good location for our particular stay which was required to be in walking distance of Harley St. and US Embassy. Very close to Oxford St is also a plus. 
Looks a bit dated, with a '70's' facade, but nice, well lit rooms, and good A/C. Nice lounge furniture in lobby and plenty of areas to sit in, A lot of staff around to help you, although not all were knowledgeable about how to check you in ! Key card system was playing up, which is always a little annoying when you have to go back to reception to fix it. 
Overall, nice hotel, but nothing special. I would like to say that I did not come across a single member of staff, and there were many, that was from London, or even the UK. A mixture of French, Spanish, Arabic and Eastern European might seem to be very cosmopolitan enough these days, but I can't help feeling sorry for overseas visitors who want to experience a little bit of English culture and ambience when coming to London, and sadly it just isn't there in this hotel. ",3,2014,08,10
123,"Excellent hotel, Fantastic service","Have just returned from a four night family holiday in London and would strongly recommend this hotel. From check-in to check-out the friendliness, excellent customer service and professionalism of all the staff was evident, but particularly Fanguli at reception, Concierge Riyas and Roddy McGrath, Manager. The rooms were a good size, nicely decorated and spotlessly clean. Lovely extra touches were chilled water infused with lime or lemon and a fruit bowl at reception.
The hotel is closely located to Oxford street but is in a quiet area close to restaurants and nice bars. We will definitely be returning to this hotel, hopefully next spring.

123,Great hotel at great location,"This hotel is really very ideal. The hotel is great with great rooms and service, located near oxford street which means shopping, to the main stores of all the major brands, selfridge, debenhams, marks and Spencer's, river island, etc...and you can easily take your train, taxi, tube rides to go to places, hop on hop off.... To banks . Nearby are cafés, from Italian, English, Chinese, etc, near Roman Catholic Church, a tesco express. And yet you still get to end your day in a quiet place and very comfortable place. The staff at the bar and restaurant are genuinely really nice- kudos to them, food is good. Price is reasonable compared to nearby hotels, but still on the high end side.
I highly recommend this hotel, and will definitely go back and use this hotel when in London. My sister stayed and recommended this hotel, my husband and I say she was right in recommending this hotel to us! Made our stay in London just  perfect!",4,2014,08,09
123,Fantastci stay,"I've just returned home from a 2 night stay at the Marylebone Hotel with my 10 year old daughter.  I stay in London regularly on business and this is the best hotel I have stayed in by far.  From the moment we arrived the staff were welcoming, friendly and helpful.  My daughter loved the iced water in reception, infused with a different fruit each day as well as the lovely and relaxing lounge areas. She spotted a jar of macaroons in reception just before we left the hotel yesterday.  When I asked a member of staff if we could order some, I was told they were just for display, but he would go to the kitchen to see what he could do.  Within minutes this lovely waiter returned with a small plate of macaroons for her - in my daughter's words ""This is the best hotel ever.  We need to come back next year."".  
We stayed in a superior queen room - quite spacious by London standards - with a  good sized desk and chair plus separate armchair, there was plenty of space for our bags, with room to spare.  The bathroom was a little snug, but exceptionally clean and plenty of hot water.  There is a good choice of food for breakfast which is served in The Pantry - it has a pleasant feel; not corporate at all.  The hotel, or at least our room, was exceptionally quiet, and yet we were only a 5 minute walk to Oxford Street and Bond Street tube station.  This is an excellent base for shopping and sightseeing.  I can't recommend it enough.  We got a great rate through Amoma.com including breakfast, which is why for me, value for money was 5*.  Maybe if we had booked at the rate on the hotel website (which was £80 per night more excluding breakfast)  I would have marked 4*.  Even so, this is a great place to stay.  We'll be back!

123,Charming and cozy,"I have stayed at the Marylebone several times and each stay has been wonderful.  The hotel itself is tucked away in Marylebone and the exterior is somewhat unassuming however it is located perfectly in the West End of London and places you within minutes of key locations.

The rooms are very nice and cozy and while the hotel is small the amenities are great (wifi, spa, room service) and the hotel staff are extremely supportive and friendly and will do what it takes to make sure you have a comfortable stay.  Every once in a while there are small glitches (i.e. A/C not working well) however the hotel immediately switched my room.  I have always felt comfortable and well-catered to while staying at the Marylebone and found it to be great value for money.",5,2014,08,07
123,Nice and Clean Hotel,"We stayed at this hotel for three nights in August and were very happy.  The hotel is extremely clean, the furniture is new and updated, the staff leaves chocolates and two choices of glass water bottles each day. The front desk is also very helpful; both before and during our stay they were easy to contact, and they were always eager to accommodate us. The rooms are a bit small, but the cleanliness and thoughtfulness in making it neat and clean is well worth the lack in space. All in all this was a great hotel and I would definitely recommend it.",5,2014,08,07
123,Best choice in Marylebone,"This was our second stay at this hotel.  Our experience was just as exceptional as last year.  All the nice touches of a Doyle hotel were much appreciated, including the Nespresso machine in the room, a nice bottle of both sparkling and still water left in our room each day, and wonderful beds, bed linens and pillows.  The location is perfect with short walk access to Bonne Belle and Paul's bakeries, Tesco and Waitrose for snacks, plus dozens of great restaurants and shops within a few blocks.  We love this hotel.  Great value and great service.  We can't wait to come back!

123,Very happy the marylebone hotel,Stayed four nights. Nice hotel in great location. Very clean and tidy. Hi light was the great staff. Very obliging!! Enrico the concierge was a gentleman. Staff at breakfast were very professional. The breakfast is fantastic!! Highly recommend this hotel..,5,2014,08,06
123,First Class,"This was my first time to stay at the Marylebone hotel. The overall experience was first class. We were greeted by the concierge who provded water and hot towels while we waited to check in (a welcome intervention after a day through airports). The room was superb, spacious and comfortable. The breakfast was great. I only needed something light and quick - the serving staff were alert and on the ball which was a really pleasent change with tea, toast etc served without a fuss . I cant say enough about my stay. Genuinely ""wowed"" and was not expecting it - was on a flying visit to london so it was a really welcome  break. I have already told my PA to use the Marylebone for future trips. ",5,2014,08,06
123,Excellent.,"Great hotel, very clean and the staff are friendly and helpful. Breakfast was very nice and there was something for everyone. Drinks in the bar were also very good.

This hotel is in a great position for shops and restaurants, and only a few minutes from Oxford road. £8 in a taxi from Euston station, and only a short walk from Selfridges in one direction and Regents park in the other.",5,2014,08,05
123,Great service and location,This hotel was a really convenient stop over for a 1 night stay. It's close to Bond Street tube and round the corner from the nice restaurants in Marylebone. No street noise at all. Our room was very small but well designed. I liked having a nespresso machine. Service was very friendly and efficient. If I was staying more than a night or 2 I'd need a larger room!  Everything immaculately clean so thank you to the staff.,5,2014,08,04
123,The Marylebone,"Very warm welcome but unfortunately our room wasn't ready which wasn't too much of a problem for us.
Our room was extremely comfortable but the bathroom was small and getting in and out of the bath for a shower was a little tricky!
Overall though, a great hotel in a great location and would definitely stay again!",5,2014,08,04
123,Highly recommend,"Always enjoy staying here. Service is great and very friendly staff
 The postion of the hotel isperfect as its in the centre of Marylebone which is like a small village in London  Its only a few minutes walk to the high street where a good range of shops,restaurants and services are available
Only a ten    minute walk to Oxford Street and Bond street tube  ",5,2014,08,03
123,Lovely hotel in great location,We booked 2 superior doubles here as a treat for our nephew's 18th birthday and my only regret is we didn't have longer to appreciate the beautiful interiors and all of the facilities. Service warm and friendly (not always the case in London compared with Scotland ;)) Rooms compact but classy with the most comfy beds and pillows. Nice added touch with sweets and fizz in room for birthday when we got back from shopping. Location perfect for west end shops and nightlife. Will definitely stay here again and check out spa and restaurant in future.,5,2014,08,03
123,Concierge extraordinaire,"My entire experience at the Marylebone Hotel was very good, but the concierge service was exceptional. Riyas Kallan went above and beyond to assist me with a difficult task and really came through -- making my trip to London one of the most memorable trips ever. Thank you.",5,2014,08,03
123,Birthday treat,"Stayed for one night and have a wonderful time. We had a superior room which was well  with a variety of teas and coffees and the bathroom had Aroma Therapy toiletries. The staff were attentive and nothing seemed too much trouble. The evening meal was gorgeous and the breakfast was delicious with so much choice. The pool although a little chilly was very nice for a swim with first rate changing rooms. Marylebone Village itself is vibrant with a selection of cafés, bars and restaurants. There are some lovely individual boutiques. It's about a 15 minute walk from Baker Street if you feel like a visit to Madame Tussads and a further 5 minutes to Regents Park. We will definitely return for a second visit.",4,2014,08,03
123,Exceptional,"Exceptional hotel, do you start with the excellent staff, location or quality of the breakfast, the pool, the gym. Really top class hotel , close to all the action. Could not recommend this any higher for business or pleasure. 
      ",5,2014,08,03
123,Perfect!,"My husband and I just returned from two separate stays at the Marylebone and each was sensational.  I had mixed up our first reservation and reserved a smallish standard room instead of a suite, which we preferred.  Although a crowded weekend the staff arranged for us to move into a bigger room the next morning.  When we returned back to the hotel after several days of hiking in the Cotswold’s, they upgraded us into a beautiful private suite on the 7th floor.  The staff could not have been more accommodating on all fronts, from bellboys to front desk.  The concierge made two restaurant recommendations (and reservations) that were fantastic.  Marylebone is a wonderful quiet neighborhood that is just lovely for strolling, taking meals and window browsing. Marylebone Hotel is our new go-to place to stay in London.",5,2014,08,03
123,Another fantastic stay at The Marylebone Hotel!,"We stayed at  The Marylebone Hotel when we visited London last year and did not consider any other hotel this time and were glad we did not ! We had another wonderful stay. Our Junior Suite was spacious and bright and very well furnished.  Very comfortable mattress and bed lines. The oversized desk was a big plus. WiFi was the best we experienced on our trip. The marble bathroom was gorgeous and very well equipped. The Nespresso machine in the room was great. Service was outstanding, from a very warm welcome to the outstanding and friendly staff throughout.  Mr. Frits Potgieter was very helpful with our reservation.  On the day we arrived, a bottle of wine was delivered to our room and every afternoon cake or pastry was delivered together with a flask of tea.  In the evening, the staff checked the room and left chocolates and bottled water.  The hotel also has access to a fantastic gym. 

Location is superb. It is in a quite neighborhood but only a couple minutes walk to the bustle of Oxford Street and the Bond Street Station.  Neighborhood dining is great with lots of cafes and restaurants nearby, including St Christopher's Place.  We cannot wait to return!",5,2014,08,02
123,Our home away from home in London,"I live in Stratford on Avon but commute to London each day. Until recently my office was directly opposite the Marylebone Hotel which is how the hotel first became known to me. And even now it is quite close to my present office location in Wigmore Street. 

As regular ""repeating"" guests, my wife and I are always assured of a warm welcome from management and front desk staff at this excellent West End property.

It is perhaps a sign of how good this property is that there is little staff ""churn"" and many of the front desk staff have accordingly been known to us for years.

The public rooms are tasteful and exude a very cosy atmosphere - a genuine home away from home for us.

There appear to be many different room types even within the same category but we have rarely been disappointed by the actual room selected for us.

As to F&B this is grossly overpriced - a standard breakfast for example costs an arm and a leg 

As we treat the hotel as somewhere to sleep rather than to wine and dine this is not an issue - there are numerous cafes and chain outlets within walking distance in and around Marylebone High Street which offer good value for money.

We would not stay anywhere else in London - I hope this is a sufficient endorsement!",5,2014,08,02
123,"Lovely experience, pricey extras","My girlfriend and I stayed here in July to attend the Book of Mormon at the Price of Wales theatre.

This is an ideal location for visiting the West End. It's a short walk from Bond St station and found it ideal for sauntering along Oxford St, and we were in amongst the theatres within half an hour.

The hotel isn't much to look at from the outside, but the inside is extremely plush, and the staff were courteous, friendly and helpful.

I can't comment about the facilities because we didn't spend a lot of time at the hotel, only being there for one night. The hotel bar is swanky and the bar staff are clearly adept at whipping up fancy cocktails.

My only criticisms would be that everything is fairly overpriced, and our Superior room was quite ""compact"". I managed to get a good deal through Secret Escapes that included a complimentary drink and cooked breakfast, but I think it would otherwise have cost us a fair few quid. I'd be hard pushed to pay £13 for a cocktail or £14 for a fry up if I wasn't feeling totally self-indulgent.

Would love stay here again (for the right deal, or on business expenses anyway!).",4,2014,08,01
123,Fabulous afternoon tea,"Booked an afternoon tea 2 for 1 deal through afternoontea.co.uk for £29 for an anniversary treat for my partner. After a little fun finding the place (my fault) we were shown into a wonderful oasis of cool and quiet. We arrived at a quiet moment and had the pick of the room just about. We chose a quiet interior corner allowing us to see out across the room. Our waiter Modesto was quiet, polite and very helpful. Explaining all the tea options available (6) not the most extensive range maybe but adequate for us. We chose Assam to begin with. The tea was fresh nicely brewed and delivered with quiet skill. The 'tea' consisted of four sandwiches which were fresh and flavoursome. Two
Scones which were quite small when looked at individually but overall in the tea were about right jam preserve and cream sufficient without waste. A small carrot cake, Victoria sponge cake and a Pims jelly cocktail. The same for each of us. The carrot cake was nicely moist as was the Victoria sponge. The jelly was also very tasty. 

The pots hold two cups of tea. Without needing to be asked we were offered another pot each. I chose Darjeeling this time. Also very nice. More customers were coming on but it didn't get you crowded. Finished our second pot and ordered a third. A nice touch I felt was when I changed teas I was brought a clean cup with the tea. 

In all we had a very relaxed and enjoyable 90 mins afternoon tea. I expect we could have stayed longer but we wanted to do some sightseeing. This was our first formal afternoon tea and I could not rate this any higher for quality and service.",5,2014,07,31
123,Lovely Hotel,"This hotel was just fantastic. The WiFi was amazing.The neighborhood is amazing, you can walk to everything and anything you could desire. They came into my room and emptied the minifridge out so I could fill it with food I bought. I was staying here for a week. The bed was moderately comfortable. The rooms were super quiet and the nespresso machine that came in the room was SUPER utilized. I asked for no room service, however, they did not listen for some reason. The first day I put out my Do Not Disturb sign it disappeared. I went to the front desk and had them put in a note that I did not want room service and that I would ask when I needed it. After 4 days I needed my trash out, and coffee refilled. I asked for that only. I went out for a couple hours, and came back to a made bed, and new towels. Ugh. Fine whatever I let it go. Next day, they came back into my room again and made my bed. I called the front desk and told them I did not want people in my room. Next day-they came in AGAIN!! While I was out. At this point I taped a big piece of paper on my door that said DO NOT DISTURB. That afternoon I found two hotel door hangers on my door. Sheesh. That was ridiculous. Other that THAT-this place was great. The breakfast was awesome in the morning, and all of the hotel staff was super friendly and accommodating.",5,2014,07,31
123,"Very modern hotel, very central and yet very quiet.","Rooms are quite small but have all that you need.
We had a room towards the back so it was very quiet.
Service is very efficient.  The air conditioning is a little bit to high in the breakfast room, otherwise the hotel was perfect. ",4,2014,07,31
123,Service is second to none,"Spent two nights here in July and found the hotel to be a wonderful place to stay to relax and explore London. The hotel staff were friendly and went above and beyond to ensure my stay was comfortable and enjoyable. The hotel is in a good location and not far from sops and an underground station. Room service was amazing and well priced and rooms were very comfortable, quiet and clean.

Checkout was fast and efficient.

Would easily stay here again.",5,2014,07,30
123,my best hotel experience...ever,"I stayed at the Marylebone with my mother this summer and highly recommend this hotel to anyone who is looking for a beautiful stay in a virtuoso hotel in a prime location. I am 23 and my mom is 56 and we both had a very memorable stay. It was our first time in London and Rahim, the concierge, made this trip very special. He procured us the best seats at the theatre and recommended fabulous, Michelin Star restaurants. 

The hotel smells like flowers and there is always delicious infused water on tap. There is a restaurant/bar in the back of the hotel that is open late. Our room was large, with a king size bed and a sitting/tv area. Every night we came home to hot tea and some sort of sweet :) The closet has mirror doors and there is plenty of space to fold and hang your clothes. From the doormen to the bar tenders and concierge, the service was superb. I will definitely be back.

Also, the Marylebone is nestled in a very charming neighborhood with delicious restaurants and great shopping. However, it is very close to the hustle and bustle of London so you can easily enjoy the big city vibes by walking two blocks to the main streets or you can casually stroll the beautiful nearby park -- Regents Park. It was perfect for us -- I wanted party and she wanted serenity. 

Highly recommend. Thank you Rahim and the rest of the wonderful staff!",5,2014,07,29
123,Perfection!,"A wonderful place to relax and be pampered, with friendly, attentive staff, beautiful surroundings, spotless rooms, wonderful food and assistance for disabled visitors.  Perfect for a second honeymoon!

123,GREAT LOCATATION,"This is our second stay this year.  Stayed over the Easter Weekend, so when we knew we were spending another weekend in London this was our first choice.  It was perfectly situated for everything we planned to do.  I would recommend this hotel.  We had tickets to tour Lords cricket ground and it was perfectly situated.  It was just right  for everything.  The staff couldn't have been more friendly or helpful.  I am sure this won't be our final visit here. I forgot to mention the lovely swimming pool.",5,2014,07,29
123,Impeccable Service,"I stayed here with my wife for her birthday weekend and the impeccable service and attention to detail made my wife's birthday weekend a very memorable one. 

From the moment we arrived we were greeted by a friendly doorman and the level or service never let up. We were checked in by a very kind receptionist who couldn't do more to help. She even provided us with 2 complimentary cocktail tokens as a birthday gift for my wife (The Singapore Sling was welcomed with glee). This was on top of a few treats in the room as a special suprise.

The room was a modest size but had everything needed and was quiet (which is good coming from me being such a light sleeper).

Breakfast was amazing with so much choice to be had from the self-service counters as well as waiter service for hot food options. Again the service levels were high, greeting us by name was such a nice touch and made us feel very welcome. When we asked if we could take our coffee outside to sit in the early morning sunshine there were no qualms.

We finished our 1 night stay with a dip in the swimming pool which was deserted! Felt like we had to place to ourselves.

Overall I could not recommend this hotel highly enough. Great location, good food and superb service. Thank you for making a special weekend so memorable.",5,2014,07,28

123,An Excellent place to sleep eat and relax,"It is very difficult to fault this hotel. The rooms are smallish but sufficient for ones needs. They are loverly and clean, and I especially congratulate them on the cleaning of the basin plug holes  every day. Towels, face clothes, and all the accessories were excellent, and at times unnecessarily replaced every day. The chocolates at night were a nice touch. Though an accident is awaiting to happen in the bathroom with the placing of the tissue box on the top glass shelf unfixed. An unsteady hand could cause problems. All the staff were most pleasant, polite,and helpful. Nothing was too much trouble.     
The restaurant was excellent, and the food and service was what one would expect at this class of hotel. Excellent, I will return, all being well.  Gerald P",5,2014,07,23

123,Perfect Hotel!,"The Marylebone Hotel was the perfect spot for our recent visit to London (July 12-15). The rooms are small, yet adorable and contain every comfort we could have asked for, including heated floors in the bathroom! The room was plenty cool, the beds were incredibly comfortable and the walls were even equipped with jacks for plugs from any country (USA or Europe). It was quite impressive. The breakfast was spectacular with an amazing buffet full of cheese, meat, cereal, muffins, fruit; you name it (plus all kinds of items to order). They also have a great bar and dinner/lunch restaurant. We ate dinner there and thoroughly enjoyed. The hotel lobby has one cozzy sitting room after anotther; complete with comfy sofas and fireplaces. And the staff was ridiculously accommodating.

123,Love this London hotel!,"We had a brilliant 6 night stay at the Marylebone hotel. It is a very well run hotel with excellent staff and efficient service. We loved the location and the ""village"" type atmosphere of Marylebone High street. The breakfast is excellent and we so appreciated the kids prices for both 108 bar and breakfast. London is an expensive destination but I think Marylebone offers good value for money. I highly recommend this hotel.",5,2014,07,21

We had a suite but it was more like a room,  it was spotlessly clean and very comfortable but there was not separate seating area.  I have noticed that people have mentioned chocolates and water? But we received neither and the mini bar was locked so maybe they were in there.  Not the best hotel i have ever stayed in but we were only there overnight and we stayed up nearly all night at the wedding reception and stayed in bed in the morning so didn't have breakfast so can't comment on that.",4,2014,07,19
123,Such a lovely hotel,"I have stayed in my fair share of hotels in my time, but I can really say that the Marylebone Hotel has got customer care spot on. The concierge team were really warm and welcoming, very helpful. It felt like they all genuinely loved to make people's days. We stayed there on our wedding night in one of the suites. It was clean, spotless and comfortable. The bed was soooo nice, we didn't want to get up from it. It's also wonderfully located. There really are quiet spots just off busy Oxford Street. Lovely. Highly recommended.",5,2014,07,18
123,Great place to stay.,"The Marylebone Hotel is well situated near the busy hub of Oxford Street but in the quieter Welbeck Street.  The staff at the hotel are friendly and helpful.

I may have found it with this hotel. The personal attention and friendly way to be spoken to makes a difference to me. Every single staff member we encountered did his upmost best to do so. This in combination with a good location, an excellent breakfast and a decent decorated, equipped and decorated room with free Wi-Fi makes it all. Only downsize to me was the size of the room, specially the bathroom, but in the end the other things are more important. Will try it again next time and hope they keep up this level of quality !",5,2014,07,15

123,Afternoon tea in the Pantry (Marylebone Hotel),"I visited the Pantry with my two sisters for afternoon tea. I had booked online and had mentioned that it was my sister’s birthday. We arrived early and were greeted by a very friendly staff member called Aladdin who was our waitor during the visit and made our visit really enjoyable. He patiently explained the choice of teas (he did this twice for me as I had forgotten by the time he had got through it).

I have been for afternoon tea before at a number of places but what made this one special was both the décor (very relaxing but elegant) and Aladdin’s service. Even though the Pantry filled up with other people he had to wait on we never felt that the quality of service was affected. He was very attentive, professional and just pleasant. 

Aladdin (and all the staff in the Pantry ) made my sister’s birthday special, they brought out an extra piece of cake which was beautifully presented with a personal happy birthday message.
Also to top it all off they offer a healthy gluten free option which is still a little naughty without the guilt or as much guilt. I think I will definitely be returning for another afternoon tea there.",4,2014,07,14

123,Great hotel. Great service.,"My husband and I stayed at the Marlebone Hotel last week. I was so pleased with the hotel amenities and staff that I am writing a review on Tripadvisor for the first time. The hotel has a great location. It is on a relatively quiet street, but only a few blocks from restaurants and shopping. The staff members working the front desk were very helpful and very kind. Breakfast was included in our stay. They had the typical (but very good) cold buffet, but also offered hot options from a menu which were also included. The number of staff working breakfast was amazing. Our tea was refilled before we had a chance to ask. The fitness center was a terrific surprise. It is a full service gym that is accessible by the hotel elevator and free to hotel guests",5,2014,07,13
123,Could do better,"Stayed here for 2 nights at the end of a trip to UK. Excellent location and staff very attentive. Good pool and gym. I really prefer a proper gym rather than a few machines in a spare room so the attached gym/health club is a real bonus. Food/drinks way overpriced particularly considering the cafe/restaurant opens onto the street and is therefore open to the public. It simply does not compare to the many surrounding excellent restaurants/cafes/pubs.
Room was clean and well furnished, but despite emailing a request for a quiet room with a king bed on a high floor, I was really disappointed to be allocated a room on the first floor literally wrapped around the lift shaft. Doors opening and closing and clattering food trays do not make for a restful night. At this price point there are many options in London and you simply cannot get away with this sort of lack of attention to detail. Won't be back.",3,2014,07,13

Gunther at the front dest stood out not just because he was so nice and helpful to me but he seem to be able to accommodate everyone's needs at the time of check in and check out as I witnessed a few unpleasant guests.  I was upgraded to a fantastic room which made my stay even more unforgettable. This hotel is a gem in a Great location with some of the best service I've had! Danielle",5,2014,07,10
123,Great hotel in a great location!,"This hotel is very well managed and in a great location-close to tube stations, restaurants and shopping. My suite was large with a lovely balcony. There was a bit of an issue with the shower but Gunther at the front desk managed to correct the situation. My son had one of the queen rooms which looked to be recently renovated. The staff were wonderful. I would certainly recommend this hotel.",5,2014,07,09
123,Trendy and Chic with Excellent Service,"No doubt this place is under-rated, it's located in a quiet and chic enclave of Marylebone Village. Fancy bars, restaurants (think Chiltern Firehouse) cafes (think Monocle cafe), trendy shops are just within 5 mins walk away. Bond street station is just 8mins walk away. The hotel lobby and restaurants are superb. After a 14-hour red-eye flight, I needed to check in and rush for a business meeting, the hotel helpfully let me check in early and even got me a cup of latte on the house while they sort of my room. It's this little gesture that really counts. 

The room although is a tad small (hey, this is London), it's clean and compact. WIFI is free and reliable. The bathroom and accessories are all luxurious. For a relatively small room, there is a decent queen size bed, a writing desk etc all nicely fitted. It's nice a quiet and with the multiple lifts within the hotel, Marylebone high street and oxford street are just easily accessible. Cabs are available at all times and the doormen are all extremely helpful. 

All in all, superb. Keep up the good work guys!",5,2014,07,09

123,Good hotel in a great location,"Third time we have stayed here and it is always consistent. Very friendly and helpful staff. The location of this hotel is excellent, near to Oxford street, Regents park and smack bang in the middle of Matylebone. Would recommend.",4,2014,07,07
123,Home from Home,"My wife stayed at this hotel for various periods/weekends over 5 weeks, whilst I was undergoing heart surgery at the UCLH Heart Hospital, some 2 minutes away. For various reasons we couldn't always be precise on the dates because of post-operation complications. 
The Reception Desk staff were brilliant. They were very caring and compassionate with my wife and always ensured she got a reasonably priced room when she needed it even at very busy times. The room quality and breakfasts were outstanding. The hotel staff made sure she was comfortable and gave her positive support over this worrying time for her. Most of the entrance staff spoke to her and welcomed her every evening enquiring after my progress and making her feel she was among caring friends. 
There is no doubt that the hotel staff considerably eased this difficult time.
This is a first class London hotel, staffed by people who care. Try them!",5,2014,07,07
123,Perfect in every way,"I'd like to thank (Initials of person: LV) for getting me an amazing room at the very last minute. In the past I dealt with Mark directly however, Mark left for new pastures a few months ago. 

LV was very professional and dealt with my booking swiftly. The room and service was as always outstanding. 

If I recall we had a slight issue with room service last time unfortunately we had a small issue this time as well, nothing worth going into detail about however main thing is that it was put right straight away. 

The hotel is in a fantastic location if you want to shop on oxford street. Its about a 5 min stroll. The Marylebone village has lots of little shops and places to eat if you don't fancy the food at the hotel. 
 
I'd like to thank all of the staff for making our stay comfortable and enjoyable and we look forward to returning to our favourite London hotel before the end of summer.",5,2014,07,07
123,Couldn't be better!,"We stayed at this hotel on the recommendation of a good friend and we were not disappointed! The welcome was excellent, the bed exceptionally comfortable and the breakfast, outstanding. We'll be back!",5,2014,07,07
123,Birthday Weekend ,"This was my second time staying in this hotel. My husband booked a 3 night trip as a surprise for my 30th Birthday. Like the first trip the hotel did not disappoint. Staff are absolutely too class. Room wasn't ready on check in so we strolled around the many shops and sights that are literally on your doorstep. 

Location is very central ideal for theatre and shopping. Yet on a very quiet side street so you are Guaranteed a good night sleep. 

Room was very small but what else do you expect in London. It was very adequate for a couple who were staying for 3 nights. Turndown service every night with bottles of water and chocolates left on the bed. Nice touch also with the Nespresso machines. 

Breakfast was amazing. We had full breakfast every morning and it was cooked to perfection. If you are a fan of poached eggs you just get them here. 

Every night we finished off with a few cocktails in the bar. While expensive they are very delicious and if you are like me and like a champagne cocktail you must try the Marilyn Monroe. Fab. We were there during the group stages of the World Cup and it was nice to see there was a big TV to facilitate watching the matches in the bar. 

I would recommend this hotel to anyone and we will certainly be back again  ",5,2014,07,06
123,Wonderful stay!,"We chose the Marylebone for a birthday treat having read other very positiveTrip Advisor reviews  We were not disappointed! Great hotel in a quiet London Street - very well located for Theatreland, Regents Park, plus shopping! ALL staff very friendly and helpful. We had a studio suite on 4th floor - spacious, light and airy. Breakfast was superb! Swimming pool was a lovely bonus :) 
Thanks to all staff for making us feel so welcome. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay.",5,2014,07,04
123,Cosy business hotel with atmosphere,"My favorite hotel in London for business trips. Even if it is a quite large hotel, it feels like coming to a small cosy hotel - very friendly staff and the interior is inviting. Great to have a free bathrobe in the room, for the evening. Breakfast is VERY good.",5,2014,07,04
123,"Nice hotel, terrific neighborhood!","This was our second stay at the Marylebone.  This hotel is ideally situated in a terrific neighborhood.  Marylebone High Street is a wonderful shopping/dining area.  The hotel was very comfortable,  with very good service.",5,2014,07,03
123,Amazing birthday stay :),"I stayed at the hotel with my girlfriend for my birthday. A lovely hotel, comfy beds and lovely bathroom. The hotel staff were lovely and even wished me happy birthday.

After a long day in London, we came back to find a bottle of prosecco and also a happy birthday cake dessert thing. Lovely touch and nice to see a hotel being so personal.

I would stay here again, delightful stay really.",5,2014,07,03
123,Great Hotel For Reasonable Price,"Room size is very OK for London and this price range and the quality of service was awesome as well. Gym, SPA and access to swimming pool is a nice extra as well. WiFi wasn't too horrible either - not brilliant, but above average if compared to other hotels ( I could actually watch YouTube videos!!! ).

Nice access to all your main London attractions you might want and has some great places to eat around the area as well ( if you don't mind walking 5-15 minutes ).
      
      ",5,2014,07,02
123,Four stars?,"The hotel's location is great. Staff were friendly. The standard room, although clean looked tired and wasn't as attractive as advertised on-line. The room was small. The bed was very small and slumping in the middle.It is difficult to believe this hotel is advertising a four-star rating. It's not good value for money as far as I'm concerned.",3,2014,07,02
123,"Great location, nice front desk service, slow housekeeping","We reserved two rooms for our family of 4 and our request for adjoining rooms was honored, but the rooms were not ready when we checked in at 16:15.  Front desk was very kind and offered us complementary drinks while we waited for our rooms to be ready and personally came by to give us our card keys and to let us know our luggage was already up in our rooms.  One of the rooms was a junior suite and had better amenities (fruits, sparkling water, heated towel rack) than the other.  One thing hotel could consider for improvement is to replace the blinds with black-out drapes.  Sunrise was very early (5 a.m.) when we were there and daylight was coming in through the blind slats and we couldn't quite fall back asleep which could be why we all felt so tired by mid-afternoon and needed to nap which was interrupted by housekeeping.  My disappointment was that our room (the suite) was not made up when we came back to rest at 3:15 p.m.  My son in particular was not feeling well so he was already asleep when housekeeping knocked on our door at 3:50 p.m.  I asked if it was possible for her to come back an hour later and she said no because she is off at 4 p.m. so I just ended up asking for a change of towels.  For the room price, I would have expected either more speedy housekeeping (before 3) or more flexibility than just a 10-minute window to take it or leave it.

To end on a positive note, location was excellent and it was close to the Tube (Bond Street) and to Oxford Street shopping. Primark was a hit with my teenager daughter and wish we had more luggage space to buy more stuff there.  Hotel is close to bakery (Boulanger Paul which we saw a ton in Paris) and convenience store (Tesco) in a quiet, residential neighborhood, (except when a car alarm went off before 6 a.m. and woke us up but not the hotel's fault).  Overall our experience was mixed but the location can't be beat.",3,2014,06,30
123,Pleasant and Comfortable,"A pleasant and comfortable stay in the heart of London. Staff exceptional with great facilities for dining and exercising. Reasonably sized rooms, quiet and excellent value for money. Would stay again.",5,2014,06,30
123,Excellent service,"This hotel is amazing the staff particularly Gunter have been friendly and welcoming. My Dad has been in hospital in London and my Mum has been staying at the hotel ...everyone has been really supportive to my mum and have gone the extra mile to make her stay as best they can under the circumstances. I would totally recommend this hotel for anyone wanting a personal, friendly service.",5,2014,06,27
123,"Great location, good rooms, nice staff","We had a great time at this Hotel. The staff is attentive and nothing is too much trouble. They booked us theatre tickets, organized shopping to be delivered, got us an extra bed side table when we asked. All wit a smile. The breakfast room is friendly and the staff is good. You ALS get a decent coffee here which is not the case in most Hotels in London. Having a Nesspreso machine in the room is fantastic. Why don't all hotels have this facility. It costs so little, yet makes life away from home so pleasant. The location is very good, close to everything. We will be. Back. ",5,2014,06,26
123,Afternoon tea-Superb!!,We had afternoon tea here and stayed the night. The cakes were delicious and the room was pure luxury! Definitely worth every penny. The service was immaculate and superb and the staff could not enough for you. The restaurant area is very classy and elegant and immensely enjoyed our time there. Thank you!,5,2014,06,25
123,Conference rooms,I have used the conference facilities at the Marylebone Hotel for a number of years to run professional training courses. The staff have always been super-helpful to give our training programmes a very suitable environment.,5,2014,06,23
123,Great location,"Great location, Marylebone village wonderful and easy walk to theatres
Great gym
Tiny room and miniature shower room, bed such a small double that my husbands broad shoulders almost filled it!
Average food
Avoid juice bar, really poor quality

      
      ",3,2014,06,23
123,Very Nice!,"My wife and I really enjoyed our stay at the Marylebone Hotel.  The staff was friendly and professional.  The room was very clean and the decor is appealing.  This is the only hotel in Europe that I have stayed at that has all of the electric plug types in the room.  You can plug at least one US style device into the wall without an adapter! 

The food in the restaurants is as good as anything in the area.  There are a lot of very good choices in the area and that says a lot about the hotel restaurant.

The bathroom was very roomy and well appointed.

This is now my favorite hotel in Europe.

",5,2014,06,22
123,Great stay,"We stayed for one night for my daughter's birthday and could not have received better service. Don't be deceived by the exterior of this hotel. The interior is great. The staff went out of their way to be friendly and helpful at all times. The icing on the cake was arriving back late after a show to be greeted by cake for my daughter. Also was sent off next day with a bottle of water.
Little touches that make a stay special.

Thank you Long and your team.

We will definitely be back!",5,2014,06,20
123,The Marylebone Hotel,"The hotel met and exceeded all expectations.  It was very comfortable, the room service food was excellent and the staff were all very helpful.  I would have no hesitation in recommending anyone to stay there.
      ",5,2014,06,20
123,Great way to end long trip,"After spending 10 days on the road in Great Britain we spent our last 3 days in London at the Marylebeon. 

From the moment we walked in to the moment we left we were treated like royalty. The front desk, the breakfast team, the concierge and Enrico at the front door made it their mission to make sure our every need was exceeded. 

Centrally located and within walking distance of great shopping, tube stations and the West End, everything was perfect!

If in London you must stay here! Bravo! Bravo!",5,2014,06,19
123,"Ok, maybe average is unfair?","I've given this 3 stars not because I didn't like it, but as it was our honeymoon over 4 days we didn't really experience it much...not due to knookie, just never in the hotel! 

What we did see was a convenient hotel, obliging staff, decent room, and a kind gift of wine and flowers in the room.

Absolutely no complaints, just not in great position to comment.  ",3,2014,06,19
123,Long weekend in London,"We were extremely happy with our stay at the Marylebone Hotel. The staff were incredibly friendly and helpful. The hotel was stylish, clean and very comfortable. The location is excellent. It is a hotel where you definitely feel that you have spent your money well. We stayed in the hotel for a long weekend and being so close to the shops made it incredibly handy to pop our purchases back at the hotel and instead of having to drag them around all day. For such a centric location it wasn't at all noisy. We're generally very contented with our stay.",5,2014,06,18
123,Fantastic !!!!!,"My wife and I were in the city at the weekend to combine my birthday and Father's Day celebrations. From start to finish we were looked after in every way.  Special credit must go to Simon at the front desk... Whilst chatting during check-in I told him it was my birthday weekend... 5 minutes after settling into our room there was a knock at the door.  A waiter announced ""happy birthday"" and in he walked with a half bottle of Moët and a slice of cake!  My wife and I were absolutely thrilled, it really was a lovely gesture, when we're next in London we wouldn't consider staying anywhere else.  Fantastic. Thanks to you all!",5,2014,06,18
123,Luxury Lodging in London,"My youngest daughter and I recently spent three nights at the Marylebone Hotel in London during a vacation. The staff was wonderful, treated us like royalty and recommended a nearby fish and chips shop to satisfy my daughter's craving. The assistant GM personally greeted us and the hostess at the desk was wonderful. We arrived before our room was ready, but were ushered to an empty room so that we could freshen up after our travels. Our room was clean, modern, stylish and quiet. Our travels didn't allow time for us to use the pool, spa, or exercise facilities, but we did enjoy wonderful dinner at the 108 restaurant one night (as well as our breakfasts and an afternoon tea). The location was great--only a short walk to the Oxford Circus Underground Station, shopping and Soho. We were lucky enough to have a nice suite, but the single room where we freshened up was extremely nice, too. I'd certainly go back!",5,2014,06,17
123,good location,"The location is great, close to important streets as Oxford st and marylebone high way and at the same time very quiet, the staff are very friendly. The lobby lounge is very comfortable , Roos are fair
      ",4,2014,06,16
123,Superb location,"Stayed in this centrally located hotel (yet quiet and away from the hustle & bustle of London). Received a superb, genuine welcome and the attention to detail throughout was excellent. Will be back for sure
      ",4,2014,06,16
123,Great location and excellent service,"My husband and I visit London regularly and have stayed in many hotels.  The Marylebone Hotel was excellent.  On arrival we were warmly and professionally greeted by Mr Voong.  He ensured our check in was dealt with efficiently.  We arrived early and so did not necessarily expect our room to be available, however, he went out of his way to sort our room and while we waited offered us complimentary drinks in the lounge area.  The hotel is in a perfect location in a quiet area but only a 2 min stroll from Marylebone High Street and it's many bars and restaurants or a 5-10 min stroll to Oxford Street. The room was modern, stylish and bright.  The hotel has a nice restaurant and bar and the gym and spa are well equipped.  We would definitely stay here again and welcomed the friendly and efficient customer service.  This hotel trumps many of the 5 star London",5,2014,06,15
123,Excellent hotel in quiet central location.,"Perfectly located in a relatively quiet street just of Oxford Street, you could not wish for a better medium-sized hotel in a central London location.
The staff are amongst the best I have ever met. Polite and efficient without being aloof or faux-friendly, the balance is just right. 
Nice bar / lounge area, superb breakfast, I just wish I had been able to try the restaurant for dinner.
Room was small, but this is central London! Bathroom was clean and well lit, with a powerful shower.
Perfectly located for all the shopping areas of Oxford Street, Bond Street and Regent Street, 30 minutes walk from Hyde Park or Regent's Park.

This was a business trip, but I will use this hotel for leisure weekends in London without hesitation.",4,2014,06,15
123,Very nice hotel in wonderful neighborhood,"Stayed with my husband in a ""superior junior suite,"" I believe. The room and bathroom were reasonably sized (for London) and very pleasant and well-maintained. Air conditioning did not work well, so the room felt a bit stuffy with the windows closed (with windows open, things were much better). I loved staying in this neighborhood -- so quiet, yet with plenty of restaurants and shops nearby, and a quick walk to the Bond Street station. Hotel staff were extremely nice and helpful, without exception. I felt very welcome. Coffee in the lobby starting early in the morning was much appreciated. Gym downstairs looked really nice (I didn't actually use it, just looked at it).

One small issue with check-in as we arrived early in the morning from an overnight flight and had reserved the room starting the night before -- travel agent had specifically noted this in the reservation but they didn't see this and marked us as ""no show"" and canceled the reservation (even though the reservation was for several nights!) -- luckily the room was still available so it didn't really matter beyond the initial confusion. Next time I would make a phone call in advance to make sure this doesn't happen again.",4,2014,06,14
123,Great Stay!!!,"Pros:  Friendly and helpful staff. Central location, yet quiet area. Room was great and clean.  Nice luxurious bathroom for Europe. Good internet signal. Newspaper at your door every morning.  Amazing stay!

Cons:  Could you use more lifts. Had to wait morning and at dinner time for a lift with space in it. ",5,2014,06,12
123,Excellent hotel and facilities,"I only have good things to say about this hotel; friendly, helpful, genuine staff, clean spaceous and comfortable rooms with excellent gym, pool and spa. There is nothing more you could want for a business trip or holiday.
      ",5,2014,06,12
123,Good Choice in London City,"Nearby oxford road and Bond Street this is a Great Choice to stay. We stayed in a suite in the 7 th floor very quiet and spacious. The breakfast and the Dinner at the inhouse Restaurants were excellent, staff very friendly and helpful. Even when we came with 8 persons they arranged a table for us. If you have enough Energy After a Long Day of Shopping and Sightseeing a well equipped gym is waiting for you. I can recommend the Hotel very much.o",5,2014,06,12
123,Great service,"Unusually attentive service (especially from Gunther) makes the difference every time.  Staff were eager to help and paid attention to details.  Everything from booking a cab, ordering room service or navigating the minibar bill was made easier and more pleasant.  Location is also a plus, as Marylebone is a more manageable, less crowded, more sophisticated shopping and browsing neighborhood than Oxford Street and Regent Street.  Overall, I would definitely return.",5,2014,06,10
123,London Location,"Fantastic for people wanting to walk everywhere like us. Easy to get to hop on hop off buses, local corner pubs, shopping, shows and of course sightseeing.
Staff were immaculately attired and groomed and showed us how to get places and willing to book anything for us. Loved the place for it's excellent location.",5,2014,06,07
123,"Great location, but...","Previously my visits to London have included staying at the Mandeville Hotel but due to a huge increase in rates, I chose the Marylebone hotel, primarily due to location (just around corner from Mandeville) I love this area! The Marylebone was offering quite competitive rates compared to everyone else so I bit the bullet and booked. I've given this hotel 4 stars to be fair; positives include great staff, lovely bathrooms, room size is quite large, and location as I've mentioned. But I don't know that I'd rebook here. My main hesitation relates to the room itself which is dull and doesn't give off even a hint of luxury that a 5* should have, and a bed and pillows which had dirty linen. But I'm sure this is probably a one off. Overall if you're looking for a reasonably priced hotel in a great loco, then check this one out. ",4,2014,06,06
123,Great location and experience,"Booked a one night mid-week stay here as we were having dinner in Mayfair and the location was within walking distance. Located only a short walk from Oxford Circus or Bond Street tube so convenient for shopping! As we approached the hotel on foot, which is situated in a nice street, from the outside the hotel looked like a very ugly 1970's building. Once inside we were pleasantly surprised how excellent the decor and furnishings were. They offered us hot towels on checkin and water on check out which was a nice touch. We stayed on 6th floor. The corridors looked like they had recently been refurbished and everything very smart. In our superior room it was also good standard and the bed was comfy had all the facilities you required including a nespresso machine, complimentary water, slippers and robes. Breakfast was not included in our rate but we didn't have time to experience breakfast or see the pool/ spa facilities. Maybe next time!",5,2014,06,05
123,Well located and comfortable,"This hotel is well lacated in mostly residential neighborhood with easy walking access to central london shopping, dining and site seeing. The staff is friendly and helpful. Our room was on the smaller side, but very adequately appointed.",4,2014,06,05
123,Amazing stay!,"My sister and I travel to London for the first time. We stayed in the Marylebone. Great location, great service. Staff were friendly and helpful. The location is great, it is close to Oxford Street, Regent Street and tube stations - Bond St and Marble Arc tube station. The hotel itself was of a high standard, we enjoyed our stay. Would highly recommend",5,2014,06,03
123,Fantastic Afternoon Tea,"We booked via a website that entailed us to afternoon tea for 2 for £38.

The decor was so charming and colourful and the staff are very friendly and helpful.

The tea was lovely; the lemon verbena tea is excellent. The sandwiches were very fresh; the cakes were interesting, especially the champagne jelly. The tea is unlimited - this is a nice feature as sometimes you have to pay extra for this option..

I would re visit this hotel for afternoon tea, it is one of the best i have come across",4,2014,06,02
123,"Great location, great service","Spent a week in London in the Marylebone and felt moved to post my first ever review. 
Great location, great service. Staff were friendly and helpful. The concierge, Riyas Kallan, went out of his way to make my life easier. The restaurant staff even kept my breakfast warm while I was called away to conduct some business mid-meal. The hotel is convenient for Tube and greater London, the rooms are comfortable and the facilities excellent.
Highly recommended.",5,2014,06,01
123,Great central hotel,"The Marylebone Hotel is perfectly located for a trip to London, just a 5-10 minute walk down to Oxford street, regent street and tube stations. The hotel itself was of a high standard and the staff were super helpful and welcoming. Would highly recommend.",5,2014,06,01
123,Gotta be Kidding Me!,"This hotel is just ok, nothing at all special.  My room was a joke  It was small and narrow.  From the foot of my bed to the wall was about two feet at most and they hung a flat screen TV on that wall.  I had to walk around the bed to get to the desk.  I must have banged my shoulder on that TV at least six times.  There is no chest of drawers in the room, just a closet.   The tub did not have a shower door, but only a swinging piece of glass that was about 1/3 the way down, How is that supposed to block water from going outside the tub?  It doesn't.  The breakfast buffet was also joke. Some pieces of ham, cereal, bread, yogurt and some hard boiled eggs.  The staff are ok, nothing special.  Friendly enough.  But the half the time the doorman is not found and you need to find your own cab (which are parked out front so not too bad).  The fitness center is good.  it is actually a separate center but included for hotel members.  Much better than your average hotel fitness center.  There are much better places to stay in London for the cost.",2,2014,05,30
123,Modern London,"A modern, small hotel. Relatively close to a few tube stops. Friendly staff. Access to great health club and pool. Asked for wake-up calls each day, but they only got them right about 2/3 of the time (and you have to arrange by calling the front desk, not by pressing the wake up call option on the phone, which rings and rings...).  Nice touch having complementary coffee, tea, and croissants on the lobby each day, as well as paper delivery to the rooms. Rooms were very small and somewhat dark. air conditioning worked very well. I don't know if it is intentional, but the ventilation system was always on providing white noise to cancel out external sounds.  Nice smelling candle always burned in lobby.",4,2014,05,30
123,Small but perfectly formed!,"Yes, fellow travellers I know it's a cliché, but it really does sum this hotel up. From the outside it looks a bit grim, but once inside you are transferred into another world. The service puts many other hotels to shame, the rooms are clean, tastefully decorated - my only moan would be the standard rooms are a tad small - that'll teach me not to be so tight next time. The common places are plentiful and restful, which is useful if you are planning to stay here before or after an op; the hotel is well versed in looking after people visiting the surrounding medical establishments. In addition, don't forget where this is, right in the heart of one of the most up and coming areas of London - even the local fire-station is a restaurant - good luck trying to get a table though!",5,2014,05,30
123,Great location. Great service.,"The hotel's location is great, it is close to Soho and Oxford Circus. I was given excellent service. My room was comfortable and clean, but rather small. The restaurant is good, but breakfast is just ok. ",5,2014,05,28
123,"Beautiful, if small, spaces","When I'm in London, I normally stay closer to the office, but since this was a one-night, in-transit kind of stay, I chose the Marylebone hotel for its location - close to shopping and good restaurants, and not too far from Paddington station.  Plus, the reviews were so good that I couldn't resist!

The staff was really wonderful.  I found everyone to be helpful, polite, accommodating, and chatty (but not overly so).  The location really is a dream - just a few minutes walk to Oxford Street and to the convenient Tube and bus stops.  Plus, there are dozens of great little cafes and restaurants - you can hardly stumble a few feet before finding another neighborhood gem.

The rooms, if you aren't used to city hotels, are quite small.  Even as a frequent traveler to NYC, the size of these rooms surprised me.  I did find myself maneuvering carefully around pieces of furniture (and yes, the bathroom door), and if I were staying for longer than one night, I might perhaps reconsider.  That being said, the rooms are quite comfortable, the amenities are lovely, and I didn't really have any complaints during my stay.

Breakfast was delicious too - the staff really knows their stuff, and we had a nice selection to choose from.  Overall, I definitely recommend this place!",4,2014,05,28
123,Great stay and very convenient to shops,I stay at this hotel on most of my business travels. I find the rooms really neat and well kept. I even got upgraded to the business suite the past stay. The location is really central and staff are very helpful. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who is willing to fork out a little more for a comfortable stay in central London.,5,2014,05,28
123,A confusing experience,"I will start with the bottom line, the The Marylebone Hotel is a very good hotel, well located and comfortable, good breakfast and lovely gym. But, unfortunately we did encounter some foults. It started with the fact that upon arriving at the hotel at midnight we were informed that we will have to be downgraded due to a error, Only after a unpleasant argument we were talled that the day after we will be upgraded and we'll not be charged for breakfast (we were charged but they fixed it..).in both rooms the air condition did not work and was fixed only after many nagging…. Other than that,I must say that the room was comfortable, clean and the service was very good. So, presuming my experience was irregular (as I think it was), and considering the other qualities, I will probably try the hotel again and hope for a better experience",4,2014,05,28
123,Great hotel in an excellent location,"I chose the Marylebone hotel primarily based on location - not too far from Paddington, very close to shopping and restaurants - but the reviews on TA really tipped it for me.  And all of the reviews were right on!

The rooms are pretty small, even for a city hotel.  If you're familiar with NYC hotels, then this room won't be much of a surprise - but even for an ex-NYer, these rooms really require some maneuvering around furniture.  Fortunately, I was in the hotel for only one night, but if I had been there for longer, then perhaps it would have been less comfortable.

The rooms are comfortable, the bathroom amenities are luxurious, and I had all of the accoutrements that I needed.  The staff is incredibly friendly and helpful, and I found them to be pleasant to talk to.  The staff in the restaurant for breakfast was just as great - accommodating, informative, and polite.  Overall, I absolutely would recommend this hotel!",4,2014,05,26
123,"Nice Hotel, but know what you are getting","I just completed a stay here. I love this area of London and find this hotel very close to all the important areas either by walking, short tube or short taxi. 

This hotel is not a 5 star but a solid 4 star in my opinion. I made sure to read many of the reviews before booking and found a lot of the information helpful. Know what type of room you are getting. It is worth the extra to spend to get a suite. Please re-read the previous line - it's important. Important for us Americans to understand: the king beds are 2 twins pushed together and not at all acceptable. My king had 2 completely different (lumpy) type of mattresses pushed together and it was horrible. The hotel was very accommodating to find me another a suite with a ""normal"" and much better quality Queen size mattress. The AC is wonderful and no American will be disappointed. The Health club is first rate as well, but has later hours on the weekends which was not super. Everything is very clean. Nice free coffee bar in the lobby. Very quiet, no issues with noise at all.

It is not a 5 star hotel for these reasons: I did not have turn down service 2 nights of the 6, I have no idea why. I tend to count on it if I know I have it for new towels, water, min bar resupply etc. I had room service one night ant 9pm and was asleep in bed and got a call at 11pm from room service wanting to know if they could have my tray? That was so odd and disturbing, I did not understand that at all. If they want or need a tray back - they should be the standard note board on the delivered tray explaining what the expectations are after the meal is finished - no such information was provided. The meal was great btw.  I think there could be better satellite TV service and/or at least a better listing of channels available. The list I had in my room was about 12 channels but there were more then that available but I had no idea what they were or where to find what. My coffee station in my room (which is wonderful and free) was restocked sporadically  - again, if I depend on it, then it is not to have things there that should be. I had to call for a few things a couple of times. Towels vary a lot, some thin and tread bare,  others fluffily. My robe had a belt that was in sheds. These are things you do not find at a 5 star, but things you tolerate at a 4 star.

I would stay here again. The things I value are all there, but know what you are getting when booking.",4,2014,05,26
123,Expensive small room,"Just back from weekend stay here. The main feeling I have is I paid a large amount of money for an average hotel. 
Pros: Just off Oxford street & near Bond Street & Oxford Circus tube stations so convenient for this part of London & shopping areas nearby. Staff are courteous. Hotel is clean.

Cons: Tiny room. I booked a deluxe double but the bathroom is the smallest I have seen & that includes Paris & New York hotels. The bathroom door will hit the shower door if you open it fully & vice versa. 2 people cannot fit in the bathroom at the same time. Shower only, no bath( That doesn't bother me, may be an issue for others). I paid over 200 euro a night to stay in an upholstered box really. If it was an amazingly luxurious or opulent hotel, I might have felt less aggrieved at the price but it is a small hotel with a few small darkened areas to sit near reception so I didn't feel I could even relax in the lobby to read a paper as I was asked to move at 11:30am so they could set the area for afternoon tea.

Breakfast for 2 was a whopping 50 euro& not included in the price. This is CRAZY. This is not a 5 star hotel, we had cereal, a small amount of fruit & a substandard cooked breakfast on a tiny table. I was really taken aback when the bill arrived. Did not eat there the 2nd morning.

To put this hotel in context. I stayed in London 2 months ago in the Park Plaza Westminster bridge in a deluxe double. The room was literally twice the size of the one I had here for significantly less money. It was a bigger, sleeker hotel that was central to tube links & tourist attractions.

 I feel like I got a very poor deal here, I wont stay again, there is better value elsewhere.",3,2014,05,25
123,Nice hotel close to Mayfair,"This is a (by U.S. standards) solid 3 star hotel with clean rooms, good amenities and modern bathrooms.  This is London, however, and you should expect rooms to be small, so this hotel doesn't disappoint.  If you plan to walk to Mayfair, Soho, etc., this is an excellent location to launch from.  The hotel is in a quiet neighborhood so no party bars close by - you'll have to walk a short distance if you want that.  Very enjoyable stay. Pleasant staff",4,2014,05,24
123,Odd start but great afternoon,"My friend booked our afternoon tea for 3 a few weeks ago, then amended the booking for 4, and later amended the booking to note that we had a vegetarian in the group.  The hotel was very helpful with all these changes!

We arrived right at 3pm and were seated in an alcove section away from the main seating area, which was lovely.  Because we had booked through afternoontea.co.uk, we had booked the 2 for £28 deal.  When I asked to make sure we were having the 2 for £28, our waiter said yes.  We then asked for champagne to be added.  After our tea and champagne arrived, one tea stand and two plates of sandwiches (4 per plate) were brought to the table and nothing more.  It took a little while for us to figure out that our waiter thought we wanted 2 teas between the 4 of us.  A bit of confusion followed, on everyones part, and we were brought the second cake stand and two more plates of sandwiches.  The only downside to our tea from this point onward was not being sure what would appear on our bill.

The sandwiches were pretty good.  Nothing too special.  A little something extra (spice, flavour, etc) would really go a long way.  The scones were the perfect size - not too big or small.  The cakes were fantastic.  The tart, despite looking heavy, was actually quite light and fruity.  The two cakes were the perfect size and tasted great.  The jelly/pudding/fruit pot was amazing.  So much so that when one of our party was too full to finish, another was happy to eat her pot as well!  Truly the highlight of the afternoon tea.  We even asked our waiter which liqueur the jelly was infused with.

The teas were good, and we appreciated the information given about each tea, but we felt it was a limited selection.  Between the four of us we had 3 different teas and all liked our choices.  Our bill did show the two for one deal, plus the extra for champagne.

The service was the attentive and responsive to our questions and concerns, yet not at all overbearing.  The toilets were clean.  The doormen were lovely, one even helping my friends mother out of our taxi.  

This was my mother's and my friend's mother's first afternoon tea so we had great hopes that it would be a great experience for them and we're happy that is was!",4,2014,05,24
123,Fantastic hotel,"Stayed here for 7 nights. The hotel is contemporary, clean, and well-finished. Extremely convenient location, close to shops, supermarket & transport, yet still on a quiet street. Staff are extremely polite and helpful. Pricing was also good, relative to the rest of London. Room size was similar to another 5-star London hotel I've stayed at, but small compared to rest of Europe. Will definitely look to stay here on my next trip to London.",5,2014,05,23
123,"Very organized , brilliant meeting facilities","I really just could not hold this hotel in more higher regard , I visited for the week as part of a conference. From start to finish I was impressed  the meeting room team were organized by Deepak and the room was always clean and fresh , 
We had breakfast which was tasty modestos , Tamara were lovely early in the week and today we had an Irish man Neill who was sublime he made me laugh and really got my day off on a good note and his accent is just a pleasure to listen too . 
I applaud you on your team and Can't help but thank you for making the week fly with no issues 
Regards a delighted YPO member

123,Exceptional value and modernity,"Arrived for a three day stay with my daughter, she was excited by the contemporary design, close to shopping and the lovely welcome we immediately received from the door man and reception. Could not have asked for better quality for value/location.",5,2014,05,22
123,Perfect!,"My partner and I recently stayed here for three nights for his 31st birthday. I upgraded to a studio suite with a special that the Doyle collection was offering for the the weekend. 

Our entire stay was amazing from the moment the door man opened up the taxi door for me and welcomed me to the Marylebone hotel. 

The service was among the best I have received. As it was my partners birthday the hotel had champagne, a card and beautiful cakes on arrival to our room. 

The suite was beautifully designed with everything one could need, and anything out of the ordinary available upon request. Cleanliness is always at the top of my list when staying in a hotel, and at the Marylebone it was second to none. Each evening we received water and chocolates by our bed, and each morning our rooms were thoroughly cleaned and refreshed as new. The beds are so comfortable and rooms quiet for such a central location in London. We did have breakfast in bed, and it was the best breakfast I have had in a very long time, but quite pricey I must admit, albeit enjoyable. 

We enjoyed the location, many shops and great restaurants in the immediate area, including oxford street. The closest underground is bond or oxford, not Marylebone. 

We did have one slight issue, the hotel wrongly charged my credit card a few times in excess of what they were supposed to, which meant I couldn't access quite a lot of funds for a few days until the error was amended. However, they were truly apologetic and offered a few things for us, in order to compensate the inconvenience. Mistakes happen, and this certainly didn't ruin our time here.

I would strongly recommend this hotel to everyone!!! I am very fussy, and this was perfect in every way! 

Thank you to the staff at the Marylebone for providing such impeccable and attentive service, I look forward to a future stay! 
",5,2014,05,22
123,Amazing Hotel!,The hotel interior is very beautiful. Breakfast was actually the best. Rooms are spacious and comfortable and the hotel is located in the best neighborhood in London. Very central yet in a calm and cozy neighborhood.,5,2014,05,20
123,brilliant birthday stay,"My boyfriend & I stayed here last weekend to celebrate his birthday. Everyone at the Marylebone Hotel made our stay very enjoyable from check in to check out. The location is great & in a lovely neighbourhood. The room was lovely, very quiet & the duck down pillows & duvet made for a very comfortable stay. We returned to our room on Saturday night to a chilled bottle of prosecco & a chocolate written 'happy birthday' with mini cakes which made our stay even more special. Thank you. 
I will defiantly be recommending the Marylebone Hotel & looking to stay here again on our next visit to the city. ",5,2014,05,19
123,"Shaky start, excellent stay","I had arranged an early check in due to the FA Cup Final, when I arrived I was given keys to a room but when I went up they didn't work.  I went back to reception and the leys were replaced, I went up to the room, opened the door and found that someone was already staying in that room (which was a bit of a surprise!).  I went back to reception and they were extremely apologetic, and said that they would include breakfast free of charge for the inconvenience.  The receptionist then started looking for a room to put us in, and came across a suite that was available on Saturday night and upgraded us to that room.

The staff were extremely helpful at all times, and but for the mix up with the room, it was a highly enjoyable stay and I can't recommend the hotel enough.

The breakfast was excellent, with top quality ingredients and more than enough food to go some way to curing the hangover from the celebrations the night before!!",5,2014,05,19
123,Amazing experience!,"When we first arrived, we were greeted in a very polite yet friendly way! It instantly gave me the feeling of ""home"" I later checked-in and the check-in went SMOOTH! Actually, what surprised me the most is the housekeeping, no words could ever describe how they cleaned the room. Even the shoes were kept all in one place! I literally wanted to kidnap the housekeeping lol! This is how perfect they were. The concierge desk were extremely helpful as well (gave very specific directions to anywhere we chose) I'm definitely going back again! Perfect location to Oxford street, Selfridges is 15 minutes away and James st. is 5 minutes away! We also ran into Meat Liquor burger house and did not realize it's that close! (literally 3 minutes walking) HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! GOTTA LOVE THE MARYLEBONE HOTEL!",5,2014,05,19
123,A quintessentially british high tea with a gluten free option.,I was invited by a friend to high tea at 108 Marylebone as she knew they served a gluten free option and we were curious. Not many places in London know how to cater well for those with gluten intolerance so I was a little nervous. I needn't have worried though - it was lovely! The gluten free menu was served with exactly the same presentation as the normal tea (not normally the case in other establishments) and I couldn't even tell the difference between the two in terms of looks. Everything was delicious!! It definitely set the bar for me in terms of a real british high tea. Highly recommend - and will definitely return. I actually did a full review of this high tea with numerous photos of the venue and food over on my blog 'Quintessentially Me' if you would like more detail....,4,2014,05,18
123,Excellant Boutique Hotel,"I would highly recommend this hotel for business or leisure.  Staff extremely friendly and efficient.  Bedrooms very modern and very comfortable.  The gym is probably the best I have ever seen or experienced in any hotel. Breakfast very good and food in restaurant and bar was excellent. Hotel is also located in central london close to an array of shops, restaurants & bars.  Overall, a very nice stay and would highly recommend.",5,2014,05,16
123,Style and service,"We stayed a week at the Hotel Marylebone over Easter.   The location in Marylebone is central to the very close to Oxford Street and the West End.  Despite being so central the area in which the hotel is located is residential and quiet so it feels like an oasis.  Our was a good size for London.  The bathroom was not large but really well set out.  We had a room at the back with a view of roofs and air conditioning vents but it was quiet.  The public areas of the hotel were compact but stylish and inviting.  The restaurant and breakfast were good.   My husband used the gym which he said was spectacular.  The service was uniformly excellent - attentive but not intrusive.  My husband was sick one day and after arranging for a doctor the staff were practical and thoughtful, bringing extra water and calling to see if we needed anything.",4,2014,05,15
123,108 restaurant,"I go to 108 regularly for dinner as the food is delicious, staff are very welcoming (refreshing for nice London restaurants) and atmosphere is great! We hear the pantry food is great and it certainly is refurbished to a great standard. Love this place!",4,2014,05,13
123,"Great value, wonderful staff, and right in the heart of London","My partner and I stayed at the Marylebone Hotel over the Easter Weekend.  On arrival we received the warmest of welcomes at reception with a refreshing hot towel to revive travel weary spirits. We had booked a standard room, but found it too small. We asked to move to a larger room, a request that was immediately dealt with. We were later upgraded to a deluxe room due to a minor problem with our new room. All this was done seamlessly and with the greatest of courtesy. There was also a complimentary newspaper at our door each morning.

Throughout our stay every member of staff we met appeared greatly interested that we were enjoying our stay in London, which we did. This was in no small part due to the location of the hotel, five minutes from Oxford Street, close to Regents Park, and set in a beautiful neighbourhood with great shops, bars and restaurants. There was even a Farmers’ Market in a nearby car park on Sunday morning.

We highly recommend this hotel. The location is excellent. The room rates are very good, but the staff made us feel extra special during our stay. We look forward to returning.",5,2014,05,12
123,Amazing stay !,"We were offered the stay for my 30th bday. The stay was just amazing !!! Staff is smily and nice, always trying to help andbe sure you feel comfortable and satisfied. The room was very large and luxuous (only be careful with the electronic mini bar). Breakfast very complete, restaurant really nice. The location is ideal, between regent park and hyde park, 10 minutes away from Oxford Circus, with Bond St station in the area, as well as many buses going to all the major places. Swimming pool is just perfect to relax after a day walking around London. We loved our stay and we highly recommend it for the perfect global experience it offers. ",5,2014,05,12
123,Lovely Marylebone hotel,"My husband and I stayed here for the second time at the end of April. The hotel is excellent in every respect and the only reason why we do not stay here every time we come to London is because the room rate is sometimes out of our price range. We use Superbreak and we have  several 4* hotels which we use, so we look for the best deal. The rooms are small, but we have found that the ones with smaller beds have bigger bathrooms which we prefer. The breakfast is  great because you now have 3 options with the choice of just coffee and toast if you are going out for brunch as we were one day. I am sorry we will not be staying here at the end of May, but we hope to come back later in the year if the prices are a bit lower.",5,2014,05,12
123,"Spectacular, Brilliant, A little Jewel","I would like to firstly congratulate Frits Potgieter the General Manager on leading his team to become the wonderful and superb hotel that this Marylebone Hotel is.
Each and every staff member really cares about their guests, from Eduardo in the Lobby who hated to see me carry my heavy parcels and only wanted to be of help,  Amram, forgive me if I am spelling his name wrong, he is a superb porter who helps out as concierge at night and really does an excellent job both at the front desk and at the concierge desk.
This hotel is wonderfully situated close to the tube, St Christopher Square which has great restaurants, especially a Middle Eastern restaurant called Sofra. It is in close walking distance to Selfridges.
The gym is great and well equipped, complimentary to guests, also a great indoor swimming pool.
The breakfasts are delicious, hot and cold foods, a superb buffet and great attentive staff in the dining room. They also serve the most delicious fresh squeezed juices.
We enjoyed a delicious meal in the hotel restaurant, I do not usually eat in the hotel when traveling, but the food was excellent as was the maitre' d ,by the name of  Sonny
There are many sitting areas in the hotel, always a spot to sit and comfortably enjoy a cup of tea.
Acomodations are great, with lovely white linens, something very important to me personally. Housekeeping does a really good job and are there early if you are not in the room. The rooms are lovely and quiet with no outside noise.
There is turn down service every night with bottles of water left complimentary and chocolates, what a lovely touch.
A hair dryer in the room is supplied and it is a nice powerful dryer.A kettle, tea bags and sugar are also an added nice touch to the room.
I would consider myself a discerning traveller, and would highly recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to London.
I cannot wait to return and to the wonderful hands on General Manager I would like to say Baie Dankie.
An incredible hotel, with amazing staff.",5,2014,05,10
123,Afternoon tea that's gluten free!,"A friend and I thoroughly enjoyed the Afternoon Tea at the hotel's Pantry at 108. I had the Indulgent Tea, and my friend had the Gluten Free Tea. The portion sizes were perfect. The hotel and tea room are simply gorgeous. Our sandwiches, scones and pastries were excellent. The service was impeccable. I have a full review with numerous pictures of everything on my Sunny in London blog.",5,2014,05,10
123,Our new London destination,"We Visite London twice a year, predominantly for leasure purposes but also sometimes for business reasonsThe location is excellent and the friendliness of the staff was extraordinary during our entire stay (5 nights). Great breakfast. Fully recommended ! This was our first stay and we are definitely new regulars. 
      ",5,2014,05,10
123,6 nights stay,"This is the fifth time I am staying in this hotel, all previous times were really. Unfortunately, during my last stay my room was changed after 24 hours. While I was sitting at the restaurant my coat was stolen, despite the fact it was near on the sofa. As I figured out after, the hotel has no security at all and most of its cameras do not work at all. All this was really disappointing.",3,2014,05,09
123,Fabulous,"Absolutely first rate. Had a wedding close by so booked rooms for ourselves and a couple. Very smart, tidy and clean. Super coffee machine and staff who couldn't help you more. Will definitely   recommend and return. Good value.",5,2014,05,07
123,Very comfortable bed,"My husband and I enjoyed our two night stay here last weekend.  Everything about the hotel was great, but the bed was the highlight.  The bed was very soft and comfortable and made for the perfect resting place after a long day of walking around.  The rest of the room was great as well, and clean which is what matters the most to me.  The staff were also very nice.  We arrived at the hotel around 11am and they were nice enough to give us a room early.  We walked to all the major sights in Westminster from the hotel, which was about 1.5-2 miles.  The area just west of the hotel is also very nice with lots of shops and restaurants.  I would definitely stay here again.",5,2014,05,07
123,"An excellent weekend, again!","We have stayed at this hotel and unlike hotels or restaurants, which can pall, become tired etc, this one always pleases. We stopped staying in another top London hotel as the lounge facilities were sparse and the staff seemed not to care if we were there or not.
The reception staff are polite and helpful, nothing is too much trouble. The good manners and style do not stop there, it is a vein running through the hotel.
We remarked over breakfast that all the staff had a smile for a guest, but it was effortless.
As a previous reviewed mentioned the hotel is clean, not always a given in a good hotel.
Concierge, bar staff, chambermaids all deserve a pat on the back, and the biggest pat goes to the general manager for organising it all.
We shall be back again on the 25th, keep up the excellent work!!",5,2014,05,07
123,Afternoon Tea at the Marylebone Hotel,"We used a voucher to have afternoon tea here yesterday. The staff were very friendly and attentive and the food was delicious- by far the best scones we've ever had! Would highly recommend it. Lovely, relaxing way to spend an afternoon.",5,2014,05,05
123,A Very pleasant Stay in London,"My wife and I stayed at the hotel for 1 night (Thurs) in a Superior Room (Queen Bed) during April 2014.

  LOCATION:  The hotel is very conveniently located in the Marylebone area of London (W1).  It is a very quiet area and seems to be absent of police and ambulance sirens that are often heard at other hotels located on major streets.  There are numerous small businesses a short walk away for shopping or lunch.  Further south is James Street where there are a huber of restaurant cafes and restaurants for indoor or outdoor dining.  Only a 5min walk south is Oxford Street where the more major retail shopping is found in abundance.

Getting to the hotel is easy from a few Underground stations, however it may be a bit of a walk for some.  The Heathrow Express to Paddington is an option and then a short taxi to the hotel.  My wife and I have taken both the Underground and Express to hotels from Heathrow before and one soon becomes tired of dragging your luggage through the various stations and surface streets.  We decided to book a private hire car for our airport transfer and thus began the exceptional service provided by the Marylebone Hotel.

 SERVICE:  The level of service at this hotel is excellent.  I contacted the concierge Rahim who arranged a private car transfer from Heathrow to the hotel.  Rahim answered any questions that I had informatively and emails were replied to promptly.  We were warmly and promptly greeted at curb side upon our arrival.  Reception was well staffed and efficient.  This high level of service was extended to all other staff members that we encountered as well including the breakfast room staff.  

ROOMS:  I cannot recall exactly the room number we had but it was on the third floor.  The room itself was quite clean and well laid out.  The room was quiet with minimal to no street noise.  The bathroom is small but the floor is heated as well as the mirror, a nice touch.

 DINING:  We had breakfast at the hotel which was nice.  We chose the buffet option which provided a small selection of continental choices.  Overall the food choice was average however the staff were very pleasant.

NOTE:  For those of you that like to get a bit of exercise while on holiday, the hotel provides guests with free access to the gym on the lower level.  This is not a mere room with an exercise bike and treadmill thrown in it like other hotels.  This is a fully functioning fitness facility that has practically every piece of equipment to satisfy anyone.

 Overall this is a very, very nice hotel that provides a high standard of service and is located in a convenient an pleasant area.  We would stay here again (in fact we did) and recommend it to friends and family.",5,2014,05,05
123,Marylebone Hotel,Exceptionally clean. Very friendly and attentive staff. Stayed one night when going to see 'Jersey Boys' (One of the best shows I have seen). Can't fault the hotel or staff. Breakfast was excellent. Had a really wonderful experience.,5,2014,05,04
123,Dedicated well trained staff at your willing service,"A real 'home from home' for regular guests. Very little staff turnover - you are recognized and made to feel at home by people who clearly enjoy what they do. The restaurant has greatly improved it's kitchen, was good, now excellent. Superior rooms are exactly that.",5,2014,05,03
123,Very good hotel!,"Hidden 5 min away from Oxford st. this hotel is still in the middle of everything! It has a very nice lobby and the front desk staff is polite and efficient. On the same floor you have an excellent bar and restaurant that makes you want to stay rather than going out. A shame really when being in London, a city that has so much on offer. Rooms are very well decorated and the beds are comfy. They are rather on the small side, especially the bathroom, but in terms of London standards it is not to bad.
The whole hotel has a luxury feel to it and is well maintained and taken care of. I highly recommend this hotel!",5,2014,05,03
123,Nothing was too much trouble,"Went here for Mothers day last year 2013 ,we had an instant upgrade after having a lovely chat with the guy at the front desk .Price was good and a great location, if you love Marllebone high street like I do !

Upon arrival we were greeted by Bohca and Brendan they were very friendly and very helpful.The lounge, Bar,Rooms everything about the hotel was top notch. Rahim organised our weekend perfectly for us booking sight seeing, a show and shopping. The location is just a 5 minute walk from oxford street and taxis are waiting outside if you need to go further. Lovely breakfast and dinner also. I will definatly return soon.",5,2014,04,30
123,"A fantastic hotel, would definitely recommend it.","I recently had a 4 night stay in The Marylebone hotel and I thoroughly enjoyed it. There was originally a problem with our room but the staff rectified the issue promptly. I found the staff to be very friendly, helpful and professional. The breakfast was beautiful, a great choice. Unfortunately, we didn't get a chance to sample the restaurant menu as our schedule wouldn't allow it so the next time I stay here I will make a point of booking a table! Brilliant to get a hotel with a swimming pool in the heart of London. The pool and changing rooms were lovely and spotlessly clean. I would most definitely stay here again. ",5,2014,04,30
123,Great hotel in an excellent position,"Went with my husband for 8 days to London last week and absolutely loved the hotel. It was in a great position, near Oxford St and Bond Station. The beautiful lobby already indicated that the rooms were also of high quality, and we were not disappointed. The hotel staff  were all very helpful, especially in helping us find our way around London, organising theatre tickets and tours. Special thanks to Gunther, Long, Riyas & Rahim for their attention.  As we were there for 8 days, we were upgraded to a suite which was extremely spacious. It was a great bonus having a pool, spa and sauna as well. We would definitely stay there again.

123,Home away from home during my birthday,"I spent my Easter birthday in London rather than home in Florida. Staff in restaurant and front desk were like family and made my stay amazing. It was like I was their only guest. Loved the location! I walked all over Oxford Street and took the hop-on hop-off bus for touring. I hope to return soon. When I do, it will be to Hotel Marylebone also.",5,2014,04,29
123,Beautiful Boutique Hotel in the heart of London,"We loved the Marylebone Hotel, super friendly staff, beautiful hotel lobby, beautiful and comfortable rooms, with  shower and tub, Bathroom robes and slippers, the SPA is available to the guest of the hotel with excellent facilities.  The restaurant-bar had served very nice breakfast with English and continental, the restaurant 108 had a nice atmosphere.  The hotel is located a few blocks away from Oxford street and Bond street, in a beautiful and safe neighborhood.

123,Afternoon Tea,"My sister and I went here for afternoon tea with the Emerald Street 2-for-1 voucher. The hotel was lovely, and we chose to sit in the hotel lobby rather than the pantry but we would definitely go back and try out the pantry next time! Service was excellent. The waitress brought out a selection of teas for you to smell and spoke through each one of them which was a really nice touch. Our server checked on us several times, refreshing our tea and making sure everything was okay. Really relaxing setting and the food was delicious. They had a very good balance of cakes and sandwiches and I didn't feel too full like I have at some other places! Overall highly recommended!",4,2014,04,27
123,Luxury but homely hotel!,"Honestly, one of the best hotels I have stayed in London. Luxury combined with a cosy and friendly feeling. Extremely professional staff, very attentive to all our needs. The restaurant was excellent too. Will definitely return. ",5,2014,04,27
123,Marvellous Marylebone,Stayed here for wife's birthday.Upon arrival they upgraded us to a Superior Room which is large for London and well furnished. Nice Nespresso coffee machine. Excellent service from start to finish. After heading out for afternoon shopping therapy returned to a half bottle of house wine and a plate decorated in chocolate Happy Birthday writing and cake. Lovely touch. Excellent location in the urban oasis of Marylebone. Hotel is modern and very comfortable. Great gym and swimming pool too.,5,2014,04,27
123,Fabulous Afternoon Tea in 'The Pantry at 108',"The afternoon started well when the very helpful doorman escorted us from our cab. His assistance was especially well received as I was on crutches!
Despite being a little early, we were seated immediately in the plush but welcoming surroundings of The Pantry. Our waitress Judit was extremely helpful and knowledgeable when it came to our tea selections, and our waiter Aladdin was also very professional but funny.
I couldn't recommend this little secret London gem highly enough for Afternoon Tea, and by the end of our 3 hour visit we were already planning when to return for drinks, lunch and even a weekend stay!
In summary, stylish setting, great ambience, beautiful afternoon tea experience and excellent customer service.",5,2014,04,26

123,Very convenient Location,"In April we stayed four nights at the Marylebone Hotel. The Location is very convenient, just a few mins walk behind Oxford street and just a strall away from Christophers Place with some good Restaurants (e.g. like the Chaopraya eat-thai). Room and facilities were good; only the Bathroom was rather small. But clean and friendly Hotel. Would def. recommend it. ",4,2014,04,26
123,Exellent experience for first trip to London,"I am delighted to report my first trip to London exceeded all my expectations! My hotel was beautiful, clean, very modern and in a great location.  Customer service was excellent! The staff was more than accomodating on every need.  Great attention to details.  The bathroom was small but elegant.  From the granite counter to the giant  ""rain shower head"" and extra shelving above and below the counter helped make up for the space.  Absolutely loved the iPhone charger/speakers in my room.  Every night complimentary bottled water (in glass not plastic) and chocolates were left in the room.  The teapot was very new and quick to heat up water for the complimentary tea in the room.  Also, the night lights attached to the headboard were cool and useful.  This room was perfect for all our needs.  I had the pleasure to use the underground swimming pool and large steam sauna...wonderful!  The hotel lobby has multiple sitting rooms that are gorgeous.  The lobby restroom (toilet) was stunning.  Walking distance to Oxford St which is great for shopping and access to multiple underground stations like Bond St, Oxford Circus, and the Marble Arch station.  We plan to visit next year and book this hotel again!",5,2014,04,24

123,"Outstanding Hotel, Very Highly Reccomend","LOVE LOVE LOVE this hotel! This was our first visit to London for our honeymoon, and as soon as we arrived to the hotel, its customer service was outstanding. Hotel is extremely clean and inviting.  Front desk (Bocar) is very accommodating and helpful. ( other front desk employees answered our tourist questions, gave us a map, and lent us an umbrella when we had left ours in room).  Eduardo along with door men, were extremely kind and would always offer to take my trash to the bin before I would jump into taxi for me. We loved pantry 108 for breakfast. Delicious! Ash was great! He was accommodating and booked our afternoon tea time. Which we highly recommend booking if you stay at hotel. Food was delicious and (jetet?) was helpful in explaining teas and making the experience so much better! The location of this hotel is just perfect! We walked a lot of places and hotel is so close to many restaurants and shops.  (St. Christopher's Place). The rooms are very clean, and beds are VERY comfortable. Hotel has many ""boutique"" sitting areas that I loved, even a beautiful seating area next to fireplace for a cold evening. We will be back to London again ( we fell in love with this city) and we WILL be staying at The Marylebone Hotel again. Thank you for your above and beyond customer service and look forward to our next trip to stay here again.  Amazing!",5,2014,04,22
123,"Exceptional service, impressive attention to detail.","Shopping and a show - the ideal first trip to London for my fashion conscious college niece, with an aunt needing a hotel covenient for walking & bag carrying! Online searching confirmed TripAdvisor as definitely the way to go. Something that set the Marylebone ahead of so many other reviews was the obvious interest the manager, Fritz, personally takes in the posts. He invited direct contact and promised to deliver - so I took him up on it and e.mailed him directly with our plans. His response was quick, bang on point and cost saving! He matched the lowest quote I had found online (which was room only and less than the Hotel's own website) but included breakfast (which was delicious and set us up well for a day's shopping) and an upgrade which meant we weren't tripping over each other in the usually tiny London city centre hotel room nor squashed unbearably tightly into a miniscule en suite - very important when 2 women are rushing to get ready for a show having dallied over shopping! Both room and bath were spacious enough for relaxation (fully equipped with all expectations - quiet, high up away from traffic & noise, tv, minibar, tea & coffee, bath essentials etc but the surprise bottle of wine with personal note of welcome from Fritz was a much enjoyed addition) and comfortably spacious enough for depositing multiple purchases without the bags becoming trip hazards! In London terms, almost palatial. After a second day of shopping, we enjoyed interesting people watching over chilled drinking in the Bar at the back of the hotel, fronting out to the lovely Marylebone scene.

As to the staff... we arrived in the morning when our room was not yet ready...no worries, the reception staff were polite & welcoming and we were invited to leave our bags which would be brought to our room in due course (as you would expect). However, tired from an early flight, we opted to have a quick, reviving cuppa during which time we discovered the room had been made over promptly and was already ready for an early check in (a great opportunity for a proper freshen up before hitting the town). We hadn't decided on a show yet either but after a quick chat with the knowledgeable and informed Concierge, we had two tickets (reasonably priced!) to 'the Book of Mormon' (not for the faint hearted but very very funny) for that same evening. Ultimately and most importantly however, they saved my bacon when we had finished on our last day but I had forgotton to check our safe in the room....thankfully I reception phoned me early telling me they had our passports in safekeeping and what arrangements could they make for their safe return before our flights. The convenience of the hotel meant it was only a momentary break in the day to rescue the situation (more preferable to discovering the awful truth as we arrived in the airport!!). Overall, we just got the feeling at nothing is too much trouble here, the assistance is genuine, the welcome warm and the atmosphere personal. Don't get me wrong, it's not perfect (I'm not a fan of hte architecture and the corridors upstairs are low ceilinged and a bit claustraphobic) but for a good accommodation experinece in a central hotel in a major city that won't break the bank (amazing value!!) it is impossible to beat. I have no hesitation in recommneding it nor in confirming I will be back. You can believe Fritz when he responds to a Tripadvisor review, he did exactly as he said he would and more.... it turned out to be one of the better (if not the best) trip to London accommodation-wise simply because the hotel does the small things well, very well! If you prefer cold, aloof, distant staff, don't stay here. If you're looking for a warm welcome and exceptional, professional service you won't beat the Marylebone!

I promise I'm not on commission (nor have any attachment whatsoever) with the Marylebone - i was just really impressed with my experience here. This is my first review on TripAdvisor, despite using it as a constant resource, but it turned up such a treat this time I wanted to say thanks!

Enjoy your stay

Newbie!

123,Best hotel ever!!!,"While booking the hotel apartments on booking.com we mentioned M&M's
candies under the pillows as a special wish - just for fun :)) And
they've done it! We were very happy and in very nice mood after that.
Best hotel ever that cares about their clients))",5,2014,04,22
123,Another great stay!!!,"The location of the Marylebone is ideal with Oxford Street, Wigmore Hall and the Wallace 

The Marylebone Hotel is ideally situated with  Oxford Street, the Wallace Collection practically on the doorstep and, on a nice day the hotel is only a brisk walk from Kings Cross/St.Pancras or Euston stations.
Our bedroom was very well equipped with Coffee machine, Kettle, iphone docking station, iron and mini bar, the bed was very comfortable.
The public rooms are decorated and furnished to a very high standard.
Staff are friendly, efficient and helpful as as usual really enhanced our stay, we will be returning.",5,2014,04,21
123,excellent vallue for money,"nice hotel with veri nice staff!!! the only problem was that they given me a room near service elavator , fact that was very bad as i heard all the actions of cleaning room service. try to avoid it!
When i asked to change room they gave me a superior one upgrading the hospitality!!!",4,2014,04,21
123,"In hindsight, a little disappointed...","When I first arrived at the Marylebone Hotel, I pleasantly learned I could upgrade to a suite at a small cost.  I came onto Tripadvisor to write them a four-star review about this (and the kindness of their hotel staff), but then saw the pictures of what other studio suites looked like.  Let's just say mine didn't look like that.  

My advice to the hotel would be to redecorate or revamp the suite (room 726) to look more like the other studio suites pictured in your gallery.  The layout of that room is odd enough as it is (doesn't have a spacious feel) that it probably requires an extra touch.

Also, in my opinion, every hotel should have a luggage rack already in the room or a place for guests to keep their luggage off of the floor.",3,2014,04,20
123,A warm welcome,"I spent a night here with fellow retailers on a workshop. The staff attitude and helpfulness were fantastic, the best consistent high level of good customer care I have had for a while.
The rooms are modern and roomy and the bathroom was a delight. White & grey marble with modern chrome taps and accessories. The bath was lovely and deep not like the usual narrow and shallow ones you get. As a stockist of Aromatherapy Associates products it was a delight to have them as my complimentary soaps & shampoos as I am a big fan. Breakfast was delicious with plenty of choice for continental and the coffee was good.",5,2014,04,20
123,Excellent stay,Stayed here in march for a weekend. Pleasantly surprised! Superior rooms a bit on the small side but i guess normal size for LDN. Staff very friendly and helpful. Extremely good breakfast. Wellness and sports facilities: big plus! Ideally located. Will return to this place without any hesitation.,5,2014,04,20
123,One of the best places to stay in Central London,"I have booked The Marylebone for 10 nights and originally planned to review it afterwards. But I am having such a great experience that I have to rate it right now. Check-in was fast and friendly which is not standard in London. The interior design is stunning and clearly on the five star side. My room on the 7th floor is well equipped, tastefully furnished and surprisingly spacious. Having applied for the loyalty program during Check-in upon recommendation two bottles of water, a German newspaper and fast WiFi are complimentary. When my famliy arrived one day later, the overall experience continued to be excellent. Breakfast was superb with a nice variety of ordinary and creative options included. All of the staff are doing a fantastic job, but I would like to mention Aladdin explicitly as he managed to add a personal touch to our family breakfast. This guy is truely dedicated to providing a superior service and has a natural attitude of friendliness which we all appreciate very much. Keep it on, Aladdin! You deserve your name;-) I am looking forward to spending a few more nights at The Marylebone with my family. Will be happy to book it again!",5,2014,04,16
123,Amazing stay,My husband and I treated ourselves to a night at The Marylebone hotel last November to mark our 5th wedding anniversary.  It was a special trip as we were looking for a fun relaxing night away from two small children! The hotel was amazing. The room wasn't quite ready when we arrived but the team brought out tea and coffee and homemade biscuits while we waited.  The room itself was spectacular - corner views onto Marylebone High Street.  It was very quiet and peaceful and the breakup fast was delicious.  Highly recommend.,5,2014,04,15
123,Wonderful stay,"We recently spent 8 wonderful nights at this fabulous hotel, and would loved to have stayed longer.  All of the staff were helpful, friendly and knowledgeable, without being pretentious. The concierge and all of the other  lobby staff helped us get oriented each day, and made excellent suggestions for restaurants and sight-seeing. We felt very comfortable from the moment we arrived.  The hotel is very well located for touring London - close to the Bond tube station, Oxford Street, Hyde Park and the fantastic Wallace collection nearby. The area right around the hotel is quaint and adorable to walk around in, during the day and at night (very lively), and to shop or eat. We were pleasantly surprised by the excellent water pressure in the shower. Make sure you get the full breakfast, it was a highlight of each day for us.  We would certainly stay here again.",5,2014,04,12
123,Continually improving - great choice in location and value,"I have stayed at this excellent hotel  for many of my trips to London over more than a decade.
I have previously described the massive upgrade in the lobby and rooms when the Marylebone was renamed as a Doyle property. All that  continues. The lobby is attractive and the front desk efficient, professional and friendly. The rooms while small are consistent w British standard, are modern, attractively furnished, and bright. TV is nice and the wi if is free and high quality. The bathrooms are nicely modernized, nice big shower head permits shower and bath/wand use together. I really enjoyed the heated floor. Crisp, clean linens on the comfortable beds complete
the experience. I slept great, even time-challenged. Why another review? Since my last visit the 
dining area renovation has been completed and it is great. Although I did not have dinner, the two continental breakfasts I had were excellent. Nice, fresh choices. Wonderful fresh breads. Nice fruit.
And the service has reached a new level of personal attention. The staff was most attentive, using my name and just the right level of interaction for service.  So- a great experience. Updated, modern hotel in great location close to activities, attractions and transportation.. Nice amenities in adequate space. The management is clearly attentive to continuously improving the service and customer experience and it shows. They have more than earned my continued custom. I look forward to my return stay next time in London.",5,2014,04,12
123,"Small room, otherwise excellent","Booked last minute for a Saturday night stay. My only complaint is that our room was very small - if ours was ""Superior"", I don't like to think how small a ""Bog Standard"" is. I'd have had to lose a few inches to be able to take a bath. Lack of space aside, the staff were beyond helpful and the spa and breakfast were among the best we've encountered. I really can't rate the breakfast highly enough (the a la carte menu was included in the price). Very conveniently located for Oxford Street and the West End. We also had a couple of great espresso martinis in the bar.",4,2014,04,09
123,"Exceptional Service, Fantastic Hotel","From it's incredibly helpful staff to it's spacious rooms and comfortable beds, The Marylebone Hotel is easily the best hotel in it's class in London.  

We stayed in a Studio Suite, which is massive (for Central London).  The room is clean, tidy and full of amenities (Nespresso machine, digital TV, free WIFI, etc).  

The service from the staff is impeccable.  From assisting at check in through to surprising me with champagne and cake on my birthday, I haven't experienced service this good ever in a hotel.

I will definitely stay here again, and would recommend it to anyone looking for excellence in quality and service.

123,London:):),"Beautiful city to visit! Location of the hotel was fantastic . Oxford St. was 5 min walk . Great restaurants everywhere! If it's first time I recommend the hop on hop off London bus tour. Takes you every in city ! Buckingham Palace, Westminster Abbey, Big Ben , etc... Had an amazing week!! :)",4,2014,04,07
123,Great choice for a business meeting,Hosted a meeting here recently. Location is great because it is close to everything you'd like to be close to but it's in a quiet location at the same time. Standard of accommodation is very good and staff are very attentive. Good value for a Central London hotel.,4,2014,04,07
123,Excellent Stay,"We have recently been to the marylebone for a long weekend, although the outside of the building isn't the prettiest in town we found we were more than happy with our stay.  The staff on the doors are very helpful, taxis always on hand if needed.  There are lots of little areas on the ground floor where you can sit and someone to wait on you or leave you in peace - which ever you prefer.  The bar for the hotel is located towards the back, it was a nice place to visit after a night out, loved watching them make cocktails.... or just have a very nice pot of tea!!  The rooms are small but very well fitted out and functional.  Loved coming in at night and finding a little chocolate and bottle of water - nice touch.  We had breakfast in the hotel once and it was lovely, although expensive.  We also used the leisure facilities which we good, loved all the details in the changing rooms especially the straighteners...... 
All in all we had a lovely time and would recommend this hotel.",5,2014,04,07
123,Truly fabulous,"We are from Japan.  Our first visit to London became fabulous one because of this hotel.  It is in a good location ( close to Bond street tube station and Oxford Street) and taxies are always waiting in front.  Staff members are very helpful and nice. 
I would definitely recommend this hotel for you.  ",5,2014,04,05
123,Nothing special at the Marylebone Hotel,"This hotel is nothing special at all. Okay, it ticks all the boxes for facilities and all the staff say all the right words but do they really mean it? I stayed for one night on a bed and breakfast basis as i attended a dinner at the nearby Wallace Collection and wanted somewhere within walking distance. The hotel is in a warren of streets between Oxford St and Baker St and has been given an unattractive modern facelift predominantly using black.

The receptionist welcomed me and gave me all the speel in words learned by rote smiling where the instructions said she should. Everyone on the staff was perfectly courteous from the floor attendants to the breakfast staff. The room was small but comfortable. Breakfast has everything i might expect and so I would normally feel obliged to tick all the boxes. This is a compliant for star hotel and you get what you pay for. 

But..there is no life in the place. I didn't get the feeling anyone really meant what they said or cared enough. There was no enthusiasm in the place and the building and its offering inside were not memorable. Would I stay again? No, not even if I had another dinner nearby. I would rather walk further or take a tube or taxi to somewhere with a real welcome and where a hotel really cared. Should you stay there? No. You should take a bit more effort to find somewhere more interesting. This is 'Hotel Average'",3,2014,04,04
123,Room for improvement: Afternoon Tea,"I booked Afternoon Tea at the hotel's 108 Pantry and had a mixed experience. I took my mother, sister and niece for a joint birthday/mothers day treat. I have experienced some good afternoon tea's in London previously, so I was interested to see how this would compare. Experience summary is as follows:

The good points:
- Nice hotel decor 
- Nice restaurant area
- The food element of the afternoon tea was tasty
- Good location

The bad points:
- When we arrived at the restaurant there was no table made up despite us booking in advance, we had to wait around the table whilst it was 'made up' - this was literally clearing the table and putting down pre-rapped cutlery. It would have been nicer for us to wait in the bar until a table was ready. 

- The manager initially visited our table, but then a waiter didn't come over to take any orders for 20 minutes.

- When the waiter came over, I asked him for 2 additional minutes as the final member of our party had only just arrived and needed to look at the drinks menu, but after 10 minutes of waiting for him to return, I had to call him back over rather than him coming to me. All staff were too busy changing/redressing tables. 

- We ordered tea (the choice was limited to only 3 x black and 3 x fruit which was a bit disappointing) and that took 10-15 minutes to arrive and the actual food didn't arrive for another 10 minutes after that. It felt like somehow we took them by surprise. 

- I was charged for replenishments when I was lead to believe replenishments of food were included - I only realised when the final bill came. Additional sandwiches took 15 minutes or so to arrive, it was far too long and meant people had to move on to their sweet and then go back to savoury. 

- We needed cutlery that wasn't provided, I was unable to catch a member of staff's eye for quite a few minutes - staff were around, they were just keeping their head down moving in-between the lower bar and kitchen. I had to walk up to the kitchen and ask for cutlery. 

- I asked for the bill and explained we were in a rush for a train, the staff took things at a very leisurely pace so I took the bill to the front desk to pay. I wasn't happy with the service at all, so asked for it to be removed - this caused a big problem, the manager had to be called to 'authorise' the removal of service and decided to disagree with me that I hadn't experienced bad service and that I must be mistaken - this was a first for me, apparently he had forgotten that the customer was always right...

So other than the taste of the food itself, we had a bad experience. This was very disappointing, especially since it was a double family celebration. The manager explained that the service was new, which was very evident - there is plenty of room for improvement. If you want an experience with your afternoon tea, this is not the place unless drastic improvements are made. They may not want this type of business. To give you some context, this is my first ever trip advisor review, but I felt compelled to write it due to my bad experience.",2,2014,04,03
123,Great Stay at the Marylebone,Loved the hotel and staff!  Very attentive and helpful.  The facilities are lovely and very clean and comfortable.  Housekeeping was visible and accommodating every day and throughout the day.  The restaurant and bar were really great too! The health club and pool are very usable and friendly staff helpful too.,5,2014,04,03
123,Not quite good,"Staying here now for one night. Got to room and electric card didn't allow electricity to turn on. Took two calls and nearly a half-hour before someone came. Next, air-con has not worked. Just shoots air but no real cooling. Have had to have window open. They sent up go who played with it and then said it was working. It was not. Lucky not hot in London but still stuffy and warm in room. A couple of bed lamps not working either. I generally am generous in my reviews but this time I cannot recommend this hotel.",3,2014,04,02
123,Nice hotel in good location,"Very nice business style hotel in good central location, about 10mins/GBP 10 by cab from Paddington station. Stayed there before and again felt very comfortable. I would certainly return if staying in this area of London.    
      ",4,2014,04,02
123,very enjoyable stay,"Stayed for two nights here all staff very eager to help you enjoy your stay. 
We had a Junior suite which is only slightly bigger than a standard room, but two TVs and a sofa . My constant niggle is that there never seems to be enough Milk and sugar to go with tea and coffee making facilities, and the room seemed to be very dull and in need of art work or something to brighten it up.(agree with 'Fanatic2014's comments)  Bathroom was beautiful though. 
The location of the hotel couldnt be better as Marylebone is a lovely area , but on approach the very modern 70's appearance of the hotel seems to look out of place amongst the sophistication of the historical mansions. I think the hotels reception area could well be tiring slightly and in need of glamourising to match the seating areas as first impression didnt make me think this was a high end hotel.
Despite this the dining area and the cooked  breakfast  was a delight and  the staff couldnt be more helpful .",4,2014,04,01
123,Very good but just something missing,"We have stayed here a couple of times on business and it works well for us, but just feel there is something missing. Service is great, rooms, bed comfortable if small like the tiny bathroom. Maybe it lacks character or something. However, you can't take away from the great location to Oxford st and Marylebone High St and the Nespresso machines in the rooms are a nice touch",4,2014,03,27
123,Depressed at the Marylebone Hotel,"Comfortable Hotel. Great service. Great location. Depressing room. Two table lamps with 40 watt bulbs. Brown wood and brown decor. No pictures on the wall. A cave. Charming prints in the lobby could do miracles for the room as could 100 watt bulbs. As soon as it turned grey outside, I rushed to but 100 watt bulbs and that helped. Just not enough....",4,2014,03,26
123,"Very good, reasonable price hotel in London","Very friendly staff! Room was clean, quiet and nice and beds were really comfortable. Bathroom was up to date, modern and white. Complimentary bottled water and chocolate were delivered every day and room also had bathrobes and slippers!
Short walk from Oxford Street, nice neighborhood and good restaurants nearby. I would definately recommend this hotel and would stay here again. Been to London several times and this was by far best hotel i've stayed!",4,2014,03,26
123,Smallest room I have ever had the discomfort of experiencing,"I've been traveling for over 20 years all over the world.  This is by far the tiniest room I have experienced, including ship cabins.  The hotel is very nice, the room was clean, the gym was far above average, the bathroom was nicely appointed, except it too was tiny.  

In the room was a very large chair which took up far too much space given the few square feet left.  Very poor furniture choice.  The closet was no more than 14 inches wide.  If you hung both bathrobes on the hook in the bathroom (to free up closet space) the toilet paper was then somewhere hiding under the robes.  With so little space, more design functionality should be exercised.  Coat hooks near the entrance where one piece of carry-on luggage almost fits would be helpful.

Had my husband not arrived to the hotel a few hours ahead of me and already unpacked, I would have requested a larger room or found another hotel.  This room was a superior queen.  Superior certainly did not refer to size.

I also found this hotel to be too far from the Tube.  My usual hotel was being remodeled so I took a regrettable chance on this one.  I should have known better when their web site specifically doesn't show location or directions from the nearest Tube station.  I found it to be a bit inconvenient for my liking.

The hotel responded that if we were to return we could upgrade to a larger room.  I firmly believe you don't get a second chance to make a first impression.  I cannot recommend this hotel.  Perhaps we just got an unusually small room and perhaps its because we booked through the hotels website and took advantage of an offer for a three night discount?  Whatever the case, both myself and my husband are thin people and getting ready in the morning and staying out of each others way was impossible.  We couldn't get out of the room fast enough each morning.",2,2014,03,26
123,super!!,"We stayed here last Friday as I had an appointment at Harley st and this seemed to be the best and nearest hotel to where I needed to be. In all honesty,the hotel exceeded all expectations. From the doorman to room service , the staff were superb. Special mention for Gunther on reception. He was so welcoming, friendly and understanding to our requests that he deserves a personal mention.
Would highly recommend this hotel without hesitancy. Location great being a couple of minutes walk to Oxford St shops and just around the corner from Marylebone High St,where there are lovely restaurants and shops.
Usually when in London we stay at Hilton hotels but in future shall be staying here instead. In fact,staying here again this weekend.",5,2014,03,25
123,Fantastic Hotel,"An excellent hotel, in a quiet neighbourhood close to all amenities of Central London. The hotel is new, clean and with a wonderful spa and gym. Marylebone Hotel is the ideal place to stay to visit London.",5,2014,03,25
123,I was more than happy to stay here,"This is an excellent hotel.  Room, Bar, Lobby…all of them were more than great. 
The hotel staff was extremely helpful and  the location was the best.
For sure I will stay again in the hotel  in my next visit in London.",5,2014,03,24
123,Superb!,"We could fault our stay at The Marylebone Hotel at nothing. Location was fantastic, room was very well appointed and spacious. Staff was extremely helpful and knowledgeable, and made us feel well at home. Our child was particularly pleased with the stay - she received a very cute teddy bear on check-in, a complimentary tart while mum and dad had tea and was very well looked after. Her rollaway bed was just as very comfortable. 
      ",5,2014,03,24
123,Very good,"This is an excellent choice for this side of town! Service, location, breakfast, guest rooms, all is very good indeed. Perhaps only drawback that it can be busy for breakfast, so make sure to be there in time if you are on a tight schedule. Enjoy!",5,2014,03,23
123,the hotel is a gem and the location perfect,Having stayed there 5 times over as many years it has kept all of its charm. The staff is terrific and the cozy nooks and sitting areas just off the lobby are great for meeting friends and relatives for an afternoon tea and some conversation. The bar is lively in the evening but perfect for a light lunch or a drink before dinner. One can wander Marylebone High Street with it's interesting shops or take a 10 minute walk to Oxford Street's shopping delights. The underground is near by to make theatres and galleries within easy reach and there are numerous very good restaurants  just  a quick walk away. It really is the perfect location.,5,2014,03,22
123,Outstanding service with great location,"I was completely blown away by the service and friendliness with everyone I came in contact with during my stay.  The room was pleasantly large and well appointed with amenities.  The breakfast was an amazing spread of food with plenty of delicious options.  I was further surprised to discover the swimming pool and sauna, so surprised I went out and bought a swim suit.  The location was perfect, it was a short walk to the the train but plenty to do within walking distance of the hotel. The best place in the city for fish and chips is right around the corner. I highly recommend this hotel and will stay there again.",5,2014,03,21
123,"Best hotel in London, neighborhood and access to public transport is ideal","Went to London in March 2014 with a group of friends for a long weekend and was highly impressed with The Marylebone Hotel.  This a full service, four star hotel in a well-to-do part of town.  It has easy access to the tube - central line - Bond St.  And is a short taxi from Paddington and other railway stations.  Rooms were perfect with luxury amenities, comfortable beds and top notch staff.  Ring and your ice is at your door in minutes.  No waits for elevators like in other European hotels. Restaurant for breakfast had amazing cheeses and fruits.  Pool and gym also included.   And were open late ideal after a long day of sightseeing.",5,2014,03,21
123,Fantastic hotel and location,"This hotel never disappoints. Extremely friendly staff, amazing breakfast and fantastic location. I couldn't wish for more and I can hardly think of any hotel that made me feel so welcome so effortlessly. ",5,2014,03,21
123,Best Service in London,"We had the best service at this hotel, despite dining area and swimming pool maintenance.  Everything from room quality, gym, steam room/sauna, breakfast, internet speed, was perfect.  Service was way above expectations.  Highly recommended.",5,2014,03,21
123,Excellent location,"Excellent location. Pleasant staff. Great food. Very comfortable room. Will recommend and return. This hotel is set in a very attractive area and felt very safe and secure in hotel and locality. Five minute walk to Oxford street and Regents Park.

123,An excellent hotel in Marylebone,"The Marylebone Hotel has become our ""home from home"" when we are in London.  The warmth in which my wife and I are received and treated are both genuine and sincere. Value and comfort and are added bargains. 
We will be returning to the Marylebone as soon as possible ! ",5,2014,03,18
123,Service delivered!,"It was a birthday celebration for me and my sister in-law... 5 ladies going for a day spa... If you read a negative review online, the best thing to do is to talk it over with the hotel... That's what I did and boy they really delivered the goods!

Diana, the front office manager made sure she checked our spa booking & also double checked on our afternoon tea.  Friendly call back to me & confirmed all was well.

The hotel has a very comfortable feeling when you arrive, decor is very tasteful and the welcoming coffee & pastries in the lobby is a sight for sore eyes, I tell you - if you just checked in from a long trip or a stressful morning - this did the trick!  

On arrival, although Diana was busy, she took us personally to the spa and gave is the key for the lift - you def can get lost their if you were a guest but that's something that can be improved, some sort of directional signage.  The spa facilities were small in size but very welcoming & the staff were lovely.  Everything was explained well and we did the tour, unfortunately the Fitness/Spa Manager came & said the pool was closed (first time it happened since it opened!) just so happens it fell on our visit!  
Of course we were disappointed at first but they quickly reacted to making sure we had extra treatments and also had lovely drinks complimentary to make sure we were not disappointed!  We were at first but they made up for it.

Treatments and staff are all wonderful, they are an asset to the facility!  Professional treatments and staff indeed!  We would not hesitate to return, even my mobile phone was left in my dressing gown, the lady went to look for it and going it in the dirty laundry - I applaud her!

The tea was moved by the staff and hotel team - they worked with our slightly delayed timings due to extra comp treatments they nicely gave all 5 of us!

The private tea room for us was locked but all I did was tell front office and instantly the banqueting staff came.  They made sure we were all comfortable and served nicely.  Teas were explained to us, champers were poured.  Very nice selection of cakes and some sandwiches - even when one of us chose a diff tea, and replaced - it was no trouble to the staff!  Thank you for making our birthdays special even with a small cake!

All in all - I was worried at first but now I would not hesitate to recommend the hotel to my friends and industry professionals as myself!  I book events and hotels all over Europe and may even consider the hotel for a London event in the future!  A few more tweaks in marrying the spa and hotel together as one service but it's only a very minor thing!  But being open minded about positive changes is the right way!

Thank you again to everyone & I hope your business will flourish!  Just keep the personal service going 😄",4,2014,03,17
123,A fantastic birthday weekend,"We had a fantastic stay at The Marylebone. It was our son's 13th birthday and we were all made to feel very special with balloons, a lovely birthday cake and complimentary drinks. The room was perfect for us and the children (age 6 and 13) and offered a space for us to relax in when they had gone to bed. A lovely hotel, fantastic location, and a very personal touch from all the staff. A special thank you to Frits and Diana. It was a trip to remember, and we look forward to another visit. ",5,2014,03,17
123,Beautiful Hotel.,"I have stayed a couple of times in The Marylebone and I will definitely go back in the future.
This hotel is a gem in the centre of London. It is very close to a lot of major attractions of the city and shopping areas.

The hotel itself is beautiful. The bedrooms are spacious and very comfortable. There is  an amazing gym and also a swimming pool. Although the staff is nice and very helpful I found the place just a little bit impersonal, but it is not really an issue for me.

I would recommend The Marylebone to everyone going to London. It is a good choice.",3,2014,03,17
123,Anniversary,"For my first anniversary I wanted to spoil my partner so opted for the Marylebone after scouring the web for a suitable venue. We were certainly not disappointed. The room was bright, the cleanliness superb and the staff helpful in the extreme. Room service prompt and great value. I would certainly recommend this hotel to anybody ",5,2014,03,17
123,Great London Experience,"Stayed with family between Christmas and New Year so we could enjoy all the benefits of the Westend of London which it is very handy to, you can walk without needing to take cab or public transport. Staff were excellent. Great dinner suggestions. We had a junior suite which gave us enough room for our tall seven year old without having her pullout bed in the way of enjoying the room. Our bed was very comfortable, bathroom was nice and modern. Very quiet location. Lots of spaces to sit within hotel to read or check out email on phone. Good little foyer bar space with open fire. We had previously stayed at Marriott County Hall and at the Ritz but found this much better. Good business centre space as I was there for my work. While the hotel did not seem to be geared for children they always made a fuss over out daughter and would recommend this as a couple or business hotel as well.",4,2014,03,16
123,Really lovely place to stay,"This is a really nice place to stay in London - fantastic service, with lots of nice little touches, and nice rooms - definintely a cut above the rest (and a lot better than the Hilton Kensington which I often stay at too).  My only criticism is the absolutely criminally expensive price for breakfast - but that's easily solved by going somewhere else!  Tommi's burgers and Golden Hind fish and chips are both nice options for an easy meal nearby.",5,2014,03,15
123,Fabulous Birthday Surprise,"Booked a return visit to The Marylebone as part of a  'special' birthday surprise for my husband, on check we received a room upgrade to a suite, the rooms we had previously stayed in were always immaculate this one was no exception but had little extra touches for an even more pleasureable stay. Always receive a warm, friendly and pleasant welcome, nothing is too much trouble for any member of staff from housekeeping to front of house, this time Marlise and Gunter went above and beyond to ensure we had a truly remarkable stay, thank you. The hotels location is perfect,  less than 5mins walk from Bond Street tube station and Oxford Street, but far enough away to escape the hustle & bustle of Central London.  Looking forward to our next visit, wouldn't dream of staying anywhere else when visiting London.",5,2014,03,14
123,The Amazinglebone Hotel!,"I've stayed in this hotel for three nights and it has been such a lovely experience. The rooms are beautiful and clean (I think this is one of the most important things), the room service is great and polite (keep on with those delicious chocolates you leave in the rooms for night!) and the personal is very very kind. The breakfast is rich and tasty. Also the restaurant ""108"" is a nice place to dinner. And big thanks also for the free Wi-fi, because I hate when luxury hotels make people pay for it. Last but not least, the position is AMAZING. You take 5' on foot to reach Oxford Street. I hope to come back soon. Love from Italy, xx. P.S. Big thanks also to Enrico at the entrance of the hotel, he was very kind, helpful and sweet. ",5,2014,03,14
123,Small room but excellent. ,I suppose that's just London - being small in room size but otherwise this hotel was very good. Price wise also - it was very reasonable for London. Some nice small touches that other hotels could learn from. Would definitely go back there. Good location. ,5,2014,03,13
123,Very good and clean hotel,"Good location, beautiful design, cleanliness. The rooms were nice but quite small... Breakfast was not really satisfying, there was absolutely no veg but they serve very nice juices. I would recommend the gym which is very very professional and fully equipped",4,2014,03,13
123,Very good hotel,"The location is the best, 5 minutes walking from Oxford street. near Bond street station. We ordered a room for 3 pax a deluxe room-the room was small. The front desk staff in the morning were much helpful than the evening shift.
We enjoyed our stay there it is a cosy nice hotel.
We did not eat there because there are lots of restaurants around.
We will be back.

We want to thank Ocsana Loseva for helping us with our reservation.",5,2014,03,12
123,Lovely stay!,"We stayed here for our 10th anniversary, my partner organised for me and I was nicely surprised with the effort the hotel went to for us to celebrate. On check in we found a lovely personalised card and a chilled bottle of champagne ready to be cracked open! 
We went out for the evening to return and have a fab nights sleep. 
The room was more than adequate and the bathroom lovely & clean.
Breakfast was included in our stay and was a waitered / help yourself service. 
The food was lovely and very filling. I would definitely return for another stay in this fab hotel in a great location in Central London.",4,2014,03,10
123,Wonderful stay,The place to stay in London if you visit for shopping and pleasure. Very professional and friendly staff everywhere. Nice rooms and fantastic beds. Lovely breakfast buffet with everything you would need. Just a few minutes off Oxford Street in a quiet area.,5,2014,03,09
123,Exceeded the expectations!,"Wow. I cannot express the extreme satisfaction we experienced at your hotel. The bedrooms, bathrooms and lounge were decorated beautifully and the on site staff were pleasant and welcoming. Whilst browsing through the large amount of options we had of accommodation in London, it is obvious to me - and I'm sure other guests, they made the right choice. Many thanks!",5,2014,03,08
123,Spa day - really badly organised. Poor value. I would never go back there,"No record of booking at front desk at all. We had to dig up the email to prove we had one.
Left us waiting in the lobby for half an hour as they ""thought we had a room"". If not for us pestering the front desk, we would have missed our treatment and might still be sitting there now.
Absolutely zero!! explanation of how the day works, where the facilities are, etc....
Decent massage although no notice given that it had actually finished and I should get dressed (I wonder if I was allowed a shower?). In keeping with the hotels ""zero explanation"" policy I guess.
Then went for afternoon tea. Concierge showed us to our table (which btw is in the hotel lobby?! I enjoyed the long in depth work related conversation that the surgeon sitting next to me had on his mobile phone)
Interrogated by the waitress on our booking - at the top of her voice in a quiet lobby. Weird!
Then the waitress comes back and tells us the kitchen is closed for another 30 minutes and afternoon tea isn't being served. 
Odd given that they serve other food all day long.
Then she comes back 10 minutes later to say it is open and would we like to move tables.
Once you've gone upstairs, you can't access the facilities again via the lift without assistance from the ""booking police"" -  I mean staff. My partner gave up in the end and got changed in the toilets. Just shy of £200. They are having a laugh!!!
I'm sure its a nice hotel to stay in but don't bother booking a spa day",2,2014,03,08
123,"Very welcoming, superb hotel & staff","I booked this hotel for myself and several clients for one night as part of a business trip based on a recommendation and wasn’t disappointed.  After an initial issue over rates at the time of the original group booking which was swiftly resolved by the General Manager, my experience was exceptional.
From the moment my taxi pulled up outside,  every single member of staff was very welcoming and friendly and made me feel like a valued guest.  It was a lovely touch to be given a hot refreshing hand towel on arrival and bottle of water for my journey when I checked out.
The superior room was superb, spotlessly clean, comfortable bed with excellent facilities including a coffee machine, ipod docking station, robes  and wonderful toiletries.  OK, not the biggest room or bathroom in the world but perfectly adequate.
Unfortunately it was only a flying visit as I arrived late at night and had to leave early so was unable to make use of the spa, bar or restaurants but I would have loved to have stayed longer.
Overall, in an excellent location and I would have no hesitation in staying again or recommending this hotel to my clients and am pleased to have discovered this beautiful hotel.",5,2014,03,06
123,A great choice,"I spent 4 nigths at this hotel and it was a great experience. I was a little bit afraid with the size of the bedroom (considering other comments), but it was not so small. The lounge area is very pleasant. From the front desk to the restaurant, the service was impecable. The bedroom was very comfortable: nice bed and all the items that you may need. The location is nice, as I consider Marylebone one of the best neighborhoods in London, for a tourist. Strongly recommend.",5,2014,03,05
123,Wonderful luxury & excellent friendly service,"I booked this hotel as a birthday treat for my mum. I notified them that it was for her birthday and they upgraded us for free as well as putting a bottle of bubbly and a birthday cake in the room when we arrived. 

Excellent friendly staff. Great location (10 min walk to Regent street) and the spa facilities make for a wonderful relaxation after a busy day in the city. 
Thank you to the staff, you made my mums bday a really special and memorable experience. I'd definitely stay again.",5,2014,03,04
123,Pricey but luxurious,"I got this room through the HotelTonight app.  It was down to £160 from over £200, combined with the free credits I'd amassed, I only spent £50.  That in itself is still more than I'd usually spend on a single night in a hotel so I had high expectations.  Considering I'm usually an AirBNB kind of a girl, this was far and beyond the standard of place I'm used to, and I was blown away by the swish marble bathroom, thick bathrobes, complimentary toiletries and luxurious bed linen.  However, the room itself was a bit tiny (according to the fire escape map on the back of the door, it was the smallest on the floor) which is pretty irritating since there's presumably no discount for less floorspace.  Plus I'd chosen this hotel because it seemed really quirky and colourful in the photos but in practice our room was entirely cream and beige which was just a bit characterless, especially compared to the plush reception areas downstairs and the textured corridor walls.

I was also disappointed by the rubbish television selection; just the basic terrestrial channels plus several for sport.  I'd expected the full Sky package, at the very least, and was surprised by the lack of films available.  Sort it out!

That said, the staff were delightful, and the bed phenomenally comfortable.  It was quiet, calm and relaxing, despite being so central, and Marylebone really is an untapped resource for shops, bars and restaurants.  If you can afford to splash the cash (or you've got HotelTonight on your phone), this hotel is highly recommended.",4,2014,03,03
123,Comfortable but tiny room,"We had an overnight stay at the Marylebone.  First impressions were excellent as the greeting and friendliness of the staff was second to none.  From the doorman to receptionist to concierge - they really couldn't have been more welcoming and helpful.
We had a standard double room on the 5th floor.  It was clean, attractively decorated and offered some nice touches like a nespresso coffee maker.  There were lots of extras that made our stay comfortable, from an iron and board to the umbrella.
Our only complaint was the size of the room.  It was tiny!  So small that there was room only for a bed side table on one side of the bed. The bathroom was very compact too.
We would possibly stay again as the hotel is well situated for the shopping areas around Oxford Street, but we would like a larger bedroom.",4,2014,03,03
123,Upgrades were a good idea,"I have been staying at the Marylebone Hotel for the past 6 years for business.  Each year, they have made upgrades to the hotel, which is a good thing as long as they do not disrupt the experience.  This year, they were upgrading the dining area.  It wasn't too inconvenient, because we ate in the business suite, but it was tight to have the continental breakfast alongside patrons visiting the restaurant.  Overall, another good experience.  Convenient location.",4,2014,03,02
123,Reliably good for the area,"Hotels on average in London tend to run to the dowdy, old, cramped, even ""nice"" ones. The Marylebone has proven a great find on three occasions, if you're looking for something in this area. Very convenient to Bond St Tube stop (Central and Jubilee lines), a major plus. They have a lovely tea in the afternoons. Warm welcome at reception. The rooms are small like most of London, but clean. Bathrooms are teeny but manageable. I've stayed there solo and with a partner -- fine either way. 

Beds, linens and towels generally nice, though I had one room with a terrible bed randomly -- because it only happened once, it didn't deter me. 

In short, nothing amazing but certainly reliable for the location and usually a decent price.",4,2014,03,01
123,Great discovery,"This was the first time we had stayed at the Marylebone. Would definitely return as it was perfect location wise for shops in Marylebone High Street, Selfridges and getting to the theatre. Very friendly staff and welcoming lobby space to meet friends over tea, coffee or very healthy green juices. Also lovely to be able to go for a swim after a run in Regents Park!
",5,2014,03,01
123,"Excellent service, nice rooms, good location","Excellent service -- from the doorman, to the receptionist to the breakfast staff. Rooms are nice and clean, with very comfortable beds, and quiet also. I slept like a log. The location is as good as it can be, very near Oxford Street, nice restaurants nearby, etc. And then the gym -- a good-size ""real"" gym with complimentary access for hotel guests, very nice! The only drawback may be the price -- it is on the upper end, but again, this is London...",5,2014,02,25
123,Lovely Hotel,"Nice to go back to one of my favourite hotels.  We were given a larger than usual room this time and it was clean, and presented very well.  Great staff and service.    The hotel is centrally located near some great restaurants and near to the main shopping areas. The bar is also pleasant.",5,2014,02,25
123,Nice Hotel,"Nice hotel.  Staff is outstanding (helpful, cheerful).  Breakfast is nice - although more fruit would help.  Rooms are tight except for the suites.  Rooms are well appointed - in the small rooms you can do everything from your bed - take shower, turn off lights, etc.  Location is outstanding. I will make an effort to stay there - but get a larger room.",4,2014,02,24
123,excellent,"excellent hotel for business:  it may be the same for holidays. I spent only one night, but next time I'll go back to London, I'll try to stay at this hotel. Really close to the principal POI of London.
      
      ",4,2014,02,24
123,Wonderful choice!,"Just ended a 3 night stay at this wonderful hotel, what a great stay indeed! Great location, excellent, fully equipped rooms and nicely decorated rooms, with everything one needs (althogh i admit the bathrooms are a little small), and super-friendly service. We came here following TripAdvisor reviews and were not disappointed.  Will most certainly return. 
I really must commend the service at the hotel: 
Before arrival - after making reservations, I read some concerning reviews about the site I used to make a reservation, and wrote an email to the hotel to confirm our booking was accepted. At the same time I voiced our preference for a high-floor room on the back side of the hotel. My emails were responded within a reasonable time by very friendly and helfpul Celia Rojas and my requests were all complied with, as promised! Well done! 
During our stay - the staff was just doing everything possible to be so nice and pleasant.  I loved it that the hotel has excellent free complimentary email, daily supply of water bottles, biscuits and an espresso machine.  Breakfast staff also went out of its way to make us feel great welcome and home.   
After checking out - the reception offered us a couple of bottles of water for our way. 
Small things, very big difference. 
I do have however a couple of suggestions, which I hope the hotel takes into consideration.  These by no means compromised how much we enjoyed our stay:
- Breakfast - all in all a very nice and satistying greakfast, but we did lack some healthier choices. Cut veggies and greens and some skinny soft cheese choices would have made breakfast perfect. Granted, when we asked one of the waiters if there are no plain vegetables, he quickly suggested to check what can be done with the kitchen, and came back 10 minutes later with a bowl of freshly cut salad, complimentary. Superb service, but this is so basic we should not  have needed to ask for...
- Tea - there is a tea and coffee offering at the lobby. Whenever we returned to the hotel, we saw the pots but they were already empty. Please put a sign as to when these little treats are available, or make sure to take away the pots if they are done... we were looking forward to relax on the great lobby sofas with some nice tea, and what a disappointment. 
All in all, a great stay for fair prices in a perfect location!",5,2014,02,23
123,Comfy and ideal location,"Location just excellent. Near to oxford St shops and Bond st underground. Room on third floor okay but bathroom/shower small and a little hanging space. Nice Nespresso machine, and friendly staff and good breakfast. Good gym with small pool. Would return. ",4,2014,02,22
123,Really nice hotel,"Very friendly staff and nice rooms. I felt directly to be at home when i entered the door and the door man mohamad gave me a smile before he took my luggage. I can recommend this hotel. It is based in the center and Oxford Str is just around the corner.  
      ",4,2014,02,20
123,Hotel staff stole my iPhone charger cable & used my room phone,"Terrible and now I feel insecure about staying somewhere where everything needs to be locked up in a small safe or risk being burgled by the hotel staff. The hotel staff also used my room phone to make calls and took a drink from the mini-bar, which they charged me for even though they said that they would take it off since I wasn't even in the room when the charges were incurred and I discovered the error after I returned home. The hotel replaced my stolen cable but the investigations led nowhere.

It is a real pity as I would have rated it well otherwise, but as someone who travels a lot, this is the first place that I have been burgled in my room. These are serious problems at an otherwise well-presented hotel.",1,2014,02,19
123,Lovely afternoon tea,"We went on a 2 for 1 offer- what a great deal! The table was set up in e window of the ground floor, beautiful white linen cloth, pretty china cups and plates, a great selection of teas to choose from, and the sandwiches and cakes were absolutely gorgeous. It was all wonderfully fresh, the scones were among the best I've had, served with jam and clotted cream- what's not to like?
Highly recommended.",5,2014,02,18
123,Unbelievably great service!!,"I have never been treated with such respect in a hotel before.  They treat everyone as though they are the most important guest at the hotel.  The rooms are lovely, spacious, clean and comfortable.  The food and service are exceptional as well.  I intend to stay here again as often as possible.",5,2014,02,18
123,The little things matter,"We stayed at the Hotel as part of a Honeymoon break and our expectations were high as we had stayed at the hotel before.The standard of the rooms and reception are excellent but  the hotel is let down by its food and beverage service which is slow and inaccurate 
Almost every  sentence that I overheard from the waiting staff started with an apology which doesn't give you much confidence
a little training and organisation wouldn't go amiss
That said all other areas of the hotel were great",4,2014,02,18
123,Great location,"Great location for shopping in London. The bed was a little old and bumpy feeling but otherwise the room was great.
Room service was very tasty and the chef even did me a meal not on the menu and it was really good.
We had a family emergency so had to leave 2 days early and the hotel was very supportive and helpful.
Would not hesitate to stay here again.",4,2014,02,17
123,A huge a Thank you ,"I was in London for my workshop n stayed 2 nights along with my husband and my lil one.( Oct,2013).i must say that our whole stay was absolutely amazing.

Special thanks to Gunther in Reception who kindly accommodated us to have a late check out at 6pm on Sunday as my workshop was finishing late n I requested a late check out as we had our train back to Bristol at 7pm n with the lil one with us we wanted to be in the hotel for sometime.he was very helpful.The other person I wanted to thank n mention is the bell boy, sorry forgot his name( tall,slim, wears glasses) from check in to check out, he was absolutely brilliant.he just made us feel so comfortable and at home.

Thank you guys for looking after us n for all ur help.u guys are awesome!

I hope to stay again in the future.

my only critisism is i only had 2 nights , i would always stay longer .
For a central london hotel it is quiet at night and so easily walkable to the major sights, stations and theatres        ",5,2014,02,10
123,Coziest hotel in London,"I fell in love with Marylebone Hotel on my first visit in December 2011. Being a fashion designer, I have a soft spot for small details that create the right atmosphere, so I was very impressed by the wonderful smell of Christmas essence candles that welcomed us upon arrival. The Christmas decoration was lavish, the members of the staff were very polite and accommodating and our room was nicely decorated and comfortable. 
Location is ideal, only a few steps away from Oxford street. Breakfast was delicious and service was extremely friendly. Haven't had the chance yet to visit the spa, but had a look at the brochure and they offer a big variety of treatments. Since then, my husband and I, visit the Hotel about twice per year and we noticed the Christmas decoration becoming less ornate, the variety in the breakfast buffet getting slightly smaller, after all the economic crisis is affecting all of us, but the warm, cozy, friendly atmosphere always present, so we are hooked, unable to stay in another hotel in London, feeling at home in Marylebone hotel.",5,2014,02,10
123,Only Place to Stay in London!,"My home away from home! I go on a lot of business trips to London, and staying away from my family for a week at a time can be a little daunting. But the staff at the Marylebone Hotel always make me feel quite at home. They really are the friendliest group of people you will ever have the pleasure of meeting and will go above and beyond to make sure that your stay with them is as smooth and pleasant as possible! They even plan little side trips for me in between meetings so I could see more of London besides the hotel and the inside of a taxi. I won't stay anywhere else, they have a patron for life with me!",5,2014,02,10

123,Lovely :),"Stayed for a long weekend with my boyfriend over Christmas to do typical tourist activities.

Hotel was lovely, have stayed in nicer rooms as ours did look a bit tired in places but was generally nice.

The best part about the hotel was the location and staff; five minutes walk from oxford street and the concierge went out of her way for us a number of times, she was brilliant!

Would stay again when in London and would recommend to others- would have given 5 stars if room had been in prefect condition.

Thanks to the marylebone for a lovely visit.",4,2014,02,09
123,Excellent Service!!!,"I Recently stayed at the Marylebone Hotel for 4 nights on a work trip from Sydney. 
The Staff were great! I arrived early morning and even though rooms at most hotels are generally not ready until check in between 12-2pm, I was given a room straight away! 
I had gotten an eye infection on the airplane and the staff were most attentive when I arrived!
I received complimentary water with lemon & cucumber with a lovely note from reception.
They really looked after me!

Room service menu from the restaurant was excellent and very prompt.
I did not include breakfast in my stay but did eat there one morning and it was great! Fantastic selection of cold and hot breakfasts! Would highly recommend adding breakfast to the stay. Great value!
The rooms were lovely and warm, the beds were comfortable, the bathrooms immaculate and had good showers. 

All the staff at Marylebone were great from the polite smiling door men to the helpful porters to the welcoming concierge.

The Marylebone is in a great location. 5 minute walk to Oxford street. The shops and restaurants around the area are lovely too! Its also in a safe location!

Overall..... An excellent Hotel!",5,2014,02,06
123,Marylebone gem,"Possibly the friendliest and most helpful hotel staff that I have ever come across! The room was everything you expect of 5 star, quiet and comfortable;  public areas very elegant with comfortable and welcoming small spaces; a vibrant hotel bar.  On top of that all a fantastic gym with group classes available to hotel guests. Definitely to be recommended.

123,Lovely as Usual,"I love this hotel, the quirkiness the unusual furniture, the fabulous Neom candle that scents the reception and the amazing welcome and efficiency that is always in evidence. I did feel sorry for the doorman though when we asked for a taxi (tube strike week!).  We walked!!",5,2014,02,06
123,"amazing hotel, amazing neighborhood!","I stayed at The Marylebone Hotel from Dec 20-22rd, 2013.......it was a great experience. Ironically an even more special (and memorable one!) as the courteous staff there assisted me re: some initial drama (my deal, not the hotel) minutes after arriving at the hotel..........

Upon checking-in after a looooooong non-stop from Los Angeles to London, I realized my wallet was missing from my handbag. A very frightening realization.....as it had my entire life in it. Yes, everything from credit cards, healthcare cards and my California drivers license. Scariest part, this was only day 1 of my 23 day overseas trip. Fortunately I was carrying some cash in pounds sterling that I had placed in a separate envelope in my bag. Anyways........ I had a strong sense that left my wallet somewhere at the airport vs. it being stolen. Gunther at the front desk along with Rahim (manager) helped call around and yes, we finally tracked it down at Heathrow - a miracle in and of itself! 

Since my room had already been fully paid for (at the time of my online booking!), they allowed me to still check in to a room. I quickly dropped stuff off in my room and jetted off back to Heathrow. I was able to retrieve my wallet - thanks to some very honest store owners at the arrival lounge (where I stopped to buy something before taking the Heathrow Express in to London). 

Back at the hotel, finally at 9pm........I came straight to the front desk to put a credit card down for incidentals during my stay......and Gunther, with a smile on his face handed me another card along with my credit card and said ""I think you might need this tonight"".......it  was a card (voucher) for a complimentary drink at the bar. Super thoughtful.

180 Bar/ Lounge + Restaurant: very charming, great staff and delicious food. 
I ended up having a drink and dinner at the hotel that same night. Everything was great.......vibe, staff, menu + food. I ordered the fish n chips and yes, a drink - an amazing cocktail......made with fresh juices and tons of mint leaves!

Overall, loved the intimate + beautiful boutique feel of The Marylebone Hotel......had a really nice hotel room w/a smallish bathroom (smallish by American standards, not European). Random side note = loved all the fittings in the bathroom + heated floors. Also, enjoyed the spa downstairs, healthy smoothies/ fresh pressed juices @180 juice bar and appreciated the courteous staff. Marylebone itself is a great neighborhood in London. Marylebone High Street = very charming so do check the area out!

I would definitely stay here again and highly recommend The Marylebone Hotel to anyone visiting London and considering booking a room here.........

Buon Voyage........",5,2014,02,05
123,Nice place,"Elegant modern hotel. Excellent location, near shopping on Oxford Street and Marylebone Road, and the wonderful museum, the Wallace Collection. My room--737--was quiet. It was a bit small, but actually a good size compared to rooms in other London hotels I've stayed at. The swimming pool was a big--about 60 feet long and the gym facilities were good. The staff were helpful. I would definitely stay there again.",5,2014,02,04

123,Great London Hotel,"My husband and I stayed in The Marylebone Hotel for a weekend a couple of weeks ago.  The staff were very polite and happy to assist, the room was a great size for a city hotel and very clean.  The location was great, Oxford Street and Marylebone High Street only minutes away. It was a perfect hotel for us.",5,2014,02,02
123,Discreet Hotel in excellent location for exploring London,We stayed here on a Saturday night to celebrate our anniversary and dine at one of our favourite restaurants nearby. The staff were attentive and extremely polite and professional. The room (a superior double) was well appointed and furnished to a high standard. Our room on the third floor was spacious and very quiet - amazing given how close to Oxford Street this hotel is. It is ideally situated for any visitor to London wanting to be right at the heart of the city.,5,2014,02,02
123,A lovely treasure close to Oxford St.,"What a lovely hotel!  The reception room was beautiful and the staff was courtesy and friendly.  It had numerous sitting areas scattered around on the main floor. We especially loved the Red Room.  The restaurant was nice and the food and staff were great.  Kudos to the bartender for very good margarita's!  The rooms were clean and very quiet.  We will definitely be back and we will refer friends to this lovely hotel.  It has a short walk to Oxford St., where you can shop,eat or catch the Underground tube.",5,2014,02,02
123,Great Location; Great service,"Marylebone Hotel is great for a woman travelling alone - many comfortable seating areas for reading, coffee, chatting; staff who treat you with respect.
Filet steak in the restaurant amazing, and the waiter was happy to make suggestions.

Marylebone High St offers everything for shopping including amazing massages at Neals Yard. Lunch was fish from Brixham followed by shopping, massage then quick snooze. Off to Third Space gym attached to the hotel for a quick work out and swim in beautiful pool. Evening supper delicious in 108 Marlybone restaurant. The hotel itself and the location is hard to beat. 
We will will back asap.

123,Beautiful Hotel with Wonderful Staff,"I had an extremely good experience at this hotel. First of all, they have built in converters so you can plug in EU and US electronics - which seems like such a small thing but it was great! It's modern and tastefully decorated with a nice restaurant as well. But the greatest part was the staff - they went out of their way for me more than once, including helping me to get some packages packed and mailed. I would 100% recommend this place and will definitely stay there again.",5,2014,01,26
123,an oasis of calm,"This hotel is an oasis of calm; set conveniently just back from bustling Oxford Street, located in the heart of busy London. My wife and I, and our two teenage daughters, spent a most enjoyable weekend here recently. The rooms were extremely comfortable and well appointed and were most welcome after a days sight seeing. Morning breakfast was definitely a treat. The staff were most attentive and the food was wonderfully prepared. Great to be nice and relaxed before venturing just around the corner to visit the World famous Madam Tousauds. So well located! Would definitely stay here again.",5,2014,01,25
123,Really Liked this place,Was looking for a nice boutique hotel within walking distance of my company's London office which is off Regent Street . This was perfect.  Nice neighborhood.  Pleasant staff that is helpful but not looming.  Rooms were well sized and comfortable.  Smallish bathrooms but with well stocked toiletries.  Just had food from room service which was superb!  Would definitely return.,4,2014,01,25
123,Worldclass,"Very central hotel situated on a calm street with boutique style. Very personal, nice and friendly staff. Room we stayed at was maybe a bit small but worked out very well. Breakfast (continental) is good and the fruit and juice bar offers wonderful smoothies (not included in breakfast).
Access to gym which is called 3rd space, lots of equipment and classes. In summary: the staff makes the difference !",5,2014,01,25
123,Haven in Town,"A real gem, location central but quiet, and a Hotel that managed the difficult balance of providing excellent service in a relaxing atmosphere. Staff were excellent friendly, attentive and well trained.",5,2014,01,22
123,"It was a pleasant experience, we were surrounded History in a medieval .","We stayed in the Marylebone in january 2014. The hotel is located very close to Regent's Park and walking distance to Piccadilly, the Royal Academy of Arts where there was a Dumier exhibition at the time, the Theatre district and so many picturesque sites in London. The Marylebone High St is a very pleasant St for shopping and has many historical buildings not to mention many dining options. Christopher Place is 5 ms away with many other dining options.
Sherlock Holmes museum, Mme Tussauds are also within walking distance.

The hotel is very comfortable and quiet. The room was spacious which for London is not common. We had breakfast there a couple of times and it was a good option.The staff was always available and willing to help.
It is a memorable experience to stay in the Marylebone Hotel.",4,2014,01,22
123,Lovely all around,"Perfect location for central London shopping, dining, strolling and easy to get to theatre and other sights.  Luxurious accommodations for not a crazy price.  The staff is pleasant and helpful.  We only had breakfast there which was delicious - excellent latte!  But I expect the other food is worth trying as well.  Lovely areas to sit and visit and enjoy a glass of wine throughout the lobby area.  We had a perfect short break at The Marylebone Hotel and I look forward to trying other Doyle Collection hotels.",5,2014,01,21
123,Best Gem in London,"I frequent this hotel for business but it is THE place in London to make me feel at home. Outstanding service, gorgeous rooms, excellent facilities (including a real gym in the basement), wonderful food. Every aspect of this hotel is classy and the attention to detail combined with the cozy feeling it offers make it my favourite place in London to stay. Gunther and all his co-workers at the front desk start the journey and the personal service never leaves until you walk out the door. ",5,2014,01,20
123,What a Gem of a hotel from location and service,"Excellent Location, just off Marylebone high street , and a few minutes walk down to Oxford Street. You feel as though you are in a village community and not central London. The Hotel was very clean , while the deluxe room was a little small it has everything you require.The Staff were excellent making sure we wanted for nothing. This has now become our favourite Hotel when staying in W1. We will be back in Feb",5,2014,01,20
123,Excellent Boutique Hotel in Central London,"Would stay here anytime I am in London.  The hotel ambience is fresh and modern and centrally located near Oxford Street, Soho, Regents Park and all of London.  This 5 star upscale hotel has wonderful rooms, excellent beds, and the whole hotel is welcoming. The hotel staff is outstanding in all areas of the hotel. They were friendly, prompt and very helpful.  In addition, the hotel has an excellent restaurant and bar (Restaurant 108), and a trendy night scene on Fridays.  Hotel also has a nice exercise facility and pool for all guests.",5,2014,01,19
123,Lovely place,"Quality accommodations, excellent location with a helpful and friendly staff! Small delay at check-in, but the wait while sitting in the lobby was more than bearable with such an attentive staff. The Marylebone Hotel is now my first choice for accommodations when traveling to London. Looking forward to my next stay.",5,2014,01,19
123,Well looked after,"Classy and chic, we had a fantastic meal in the restaurant (recommend this in it's own right) and were very well looked after by the staff (especially when they found out that we had just gotten engaged). The gym facilities were excellent, though the spa facilities were a little tired. The room was clean and a decent size for London (we got an upgrade). The only fly in the ointment came at breakfast when we didn't realise it wasn't included and the bill came to £30+! Would happily go back, but will get breakfast at Starbucks next time!",4,2014,01,19
123,Amazing hotel,"What can I say apart from WOW!

I have stayed in many hotels in London over the years, and this is most certainly is one of the best hotel around. Location, ambience, service, quality of the room, small details, spa, gym, swimming pool and the list goes on.....they are all there and are all suberb.

I will certainly book again!

Thanks Marylebone!!

Mr Ahmad",5,2014,01,15
123,High standards,"Another excellent stay. Friendly and comfortable. Centrally located. Excellent facilities and good bedrooms with all that you need. Spa is good as is the general ambiance of the whole hotel. Will definitely stay there again.
      ",5,2014,01,13
123,Feels like five star boutique hotel - excellent,"Stayed in the Marylebone early January 2014 for three nights. Loved it. We had an initial hiccup at check-in regarding the type of room and then the keys not working  - however the matter was resolved very professionally. 
It is the service and the standard of food which makes this hotel such a great experience. Despite the fact that it is a relatively large hotel, the Doyle group have managed very successfully to make you feel that you are staying in a small boutique hotel. The lovely areas off the lobby where you can sit and relax - enjoy a tea, have a read of the papers, relax by the fire all add to the feeling of intimacy.  The breakfast buffet is of exceptionally high standard.  The manner in which the food is displayed, the obvious fresh high quality produce on offer, as well as the interesting choice from the menu, cooked fresh to order, puts this hotel above many others I have stayed in, in London.  The avocado on toast with lemon, chillis and coriander is a delight!  All served to you by staff in the breakfast room who are so very professional - discreet, efficient and exceptionally pleasant.  
Finally should mention the Spa, gym and pool area:  very modern , spotless and very well equipped just add to the experience.  I will look no further for my future trips to London. Loved it.",5,2014,01,13
123,Absolute gem in London,"My wife and I have stayed in the Marylebone Hotel many times on both vacation and business trips. This hotel has never failed to deliver on providing immaculate service and a perfect venue for a long or short stay in London. The location in Marylebone is perfect for dining out, sightseeing, and shopping. It has a small, boutique hotel feel and it is hard to remember that it is one of three Doyle Collection Hotels in London - all of which are fantastic and very reasonably priced for the capital city. I would recommend staying here whole-heartedly.",5,2014,01,12
123,"Location, location, location","If you want to be near Oxford Street with out all the tackiness then this hotel is the place to stay. It is located less than 5 minutes to Oxford Street, the nearest tube is Bond Street (5 mins) and Marylebone high street is 2 mins away. 

The service upon checking in was excellent, with very polite and friendly staff. Our room was a very spacious double, with a very comfortable bed. The bathroom was bright and airy and very modern.

There is a huge choice for breakfast so everyone should be happy although we had 2 cooked breakfasts which came to £30. Not cheap.

Because of its location the hotel is great for shopping and also the nightlife but is tucked away so the is very little noise around the hotel.

The bar in the hotel is very good although the drinks are quite pricey but you are in a hotel in central London so what would you expect?

We live less than an hour away but we chose this hotel for a weekend break and were not dissapointed. The next time we stay in London will be here again.",5,2014,01,11
123,Good business hotel,"Nice and quite hotel, centrally positioned. Nice room. Bathroom a bit small, but ok for a one night stay. Very warm welcome from the staff. Did not test the fitness, which looked great.  Did not test breakfast. 
 I Will come back for sure.",4,2014,01,10
123,Exceptional!,Such a great place to stay! Everything was perfect from A to Z. Nespresso in the room is a great addition. Staff is so polite and wonderful! I cannot find anything negative to say about this hotel! I would stay there without hesitation on my next visit.,5,2014,01,10
123,Beautiful Hotel,"This was our first trip to London, so we stayed where our friends were staying.  This hotel was beautiful.  We went the day after Christmas through New Years, so it was still wonderfully decorated for Christmas.  The rooms were comfortable, large and the bathroom floors were heated.  The staff was friendly and extremely helpful with setting up tours and getting us theatre tickets.  A few blocks from the subway, but not a bad walk.  A bit expensive, but what hotel isn't in London.  Overall wonderful experience.  Try the steak place and the itlaian restraunts across the street, ",5,2014,01,10
123,"wonderful hotel, perfect location","We booked online at the last minute and got a great rate for a luxury hotel. We could not have been happier--elegant, comfortable, friendly, great amenities, and an amazing location. We were then easily able to extend our stay. A great home away from home. Loved the pool, too.",5,2014,01,10
123,Perfect Stay,"Stayed at the Marylebone Hotel over the weekend 3 - 5 January, up in London to go to a show, have dinner and do a bit of shopping.  Location of the hotel is excellent, 2 minutes walk to Marylebone High Street and 5 minutes to Oxford Street so you have the choice between the genteel feel of Marylebone or the hub-hub of Oxford Street, take your pick.  Hotel staff were brilliant, nothing to much trouble from check-in to the breakfast room and the friendly and helpful doorman.  Room was a decent size for a London hotel, well equipped and the bed was super comfortable.  Stayed here 10 years ago when it was Jury's Inn and Doyle have certainly taken it up a step.  ",5,2014,01,10
123,Very nice hotel,"The hotel is very well located, in a quiet street but near to the shop areas. Also the tube is a short walk distance. The staff is friendly and resolutive. Everything was fine during our stay. Bathroom too small but ok. Highly recommended  ",4,2014,01,10
123,stylish rooms,"I am frequent guest and always look forward to stay here. Staff is very nice, rooms have good design and very stylish. I can really recommend these place. Centre of Marylebone offers good pubs and restaurants. It is 12 minutes to nearest tube station, but that will keep you in shape.",5,2014,01,10
123,Four day London stop over,"This hotel is perfectly situated close to great shopping, the underground and the wonderful Marylebone high street. The rooms were clean and the space was adequate even with an extra bed for our daughter.  The staff were helpful and there are numerous spaces to gather and have tea after a long day shopping, visiting galleries etc. I would recommend this hotel and would stay here again on future visits to London.",5,2014,01,09
123,Excellent hotel for business people,"This hotel is excellent for business people. Everything you might need is foreseen. Conference rooms are ok, hotel rooms are ok, good wifi but you have to pay extra. Also a nice bar. Bit strange way of having your breakfast. This hotel is good but very expensive if you are not for business in London!",4,2014,01,07
123,A Fabulous 2nd Visit,"We once again stayed here for New Year's Eve (as we did last year) and were, yet again, very impressed with the staff, who cannot do enough for you.  We wild away the afternoon in the bar with my brother and sister in law and were booked in for dinner, which was absolutely outstanding, the Halibut was to die for!!!  My brother tends to stay at the hotel on a regular basis and is always full of praise for it.  Yet again, our expectations were exceeded.  Thank you to all the staff who made this a most enjoyable and memorable New Year's Eve.",5,2014,01,06
123,Excellent hotel,My family and I stayed at The Marylebone Hotel in November 2013. We had an absolutely amazing time. The rooms were a wonderful size and the restaurant in the hotel had a lovely breakfast. The reception staff were very attentive.,5,2014,01,05
123,Excellent Across the Board,"Very cozy hot towel check in. Standard room was very fairly sized with great mirrors and bathroom. Peaceful sleep. Nice bed. 

For a Londoner or a tourist this is a remarkable location to see some of the best things in the city within walking distance in a very festive British cheerful neighborhood.",5,2014,01,04
123,Excellent service and location,"My young daughter and I stayed 2 nights in late December. Great communication prior to arriving and lovely service throughout stay. First, Nora Tacken responded to me about an enquiry related to the gym and was thoughtful and responsive when we realized her response contradicted an earlier response from another colleague. It was Nora's approach that cemented my decision to stay here despite the fact that the answer to my question about the gym wasn't what I'd hoped! 

Upon check in, the staff was great - helping us get settled despite our room not being ready. Rafael was delightful - he took care of our luggage, ensured it got to our room when it was ready, and took the time to advise us on where to find a bite of breakfast, and was very gracious when we pushed him to suggest something beyond the hotel (convenient, but we needed to get out and walk!). I've no idea exactly what his job was - he seemed always to be around and being helpful no matter what we needed! Nora welcomed us as well when we arrived and also sent a kind note and lovely welcome treat for us once we got into our room (including a teddy bear with a personalized tag for my nine year old which she fell in love with!). Many others provided great service too - Merel who despite not being a concierge, stepped in to help with advice and printing a menu while the concierge was occupied; the young man looking after the lounges one evening who quickly and unobtrusively took our order for tea and ensured a relaxing late evening reading in the lounge.  I've stayed in many great hotels for work and vacation over the years; The Marylebone gets highest service ratings. It's as if the staff is looking to do anything to make your experience better, constantly scanning the lobby to see who might need something, responding to housekeeping enquiries quickly and apologizing if they don't know the answer to something and in short, are excellent problem solvers. 

Couple this with the location in the charming and great shopping village of Marylebone (2 minutes from great stores on Marylebone High Street and a few more minutes to Bond and Oxford Streets), with only a 5 min walk to Bond St Tube/Central Line and 10 min walk to Regent Park/Bakerloo Line and you can't beat this hotel!  All of this made me completely overlook that the rooms and hallways are looking a bit worn, a towel was slightly frayed, the upholstered furniture in one of the many lovely lounge rooms needed cleaning. 

I wouldn't hesitate to recommend The Marylebone Hotel and will stay there again on my next visit. The management and staff should be commended on their approach to treating guests well!",5,2014,01,03
123,Superb dining and service,"While we did not stay in the hotel this trip, we did book Christmas Dinner at the hotel restaurant as it was one of the few places we could rely on to be open on Christmas Day and within walking distance of our flat.  We could not have asked for a more lovely afternoon.  Everything was absolutely perfect, from the service and kindness of staff to the perfect meal and wine we enjoyed.  At the end of our fabulous meal, my wife decided she did not care to walk back to the flat and the young man at the concierge desk went out personally to find us a taxicab -- truly superb treatment.  From the initiation of the reservation process with the Meeting and Events Sales Executive--from the United States, no less!--to the conclusion of the meal itself, it was an absolutely perfect experience.",5,2014,01,03
123,Good all-rounder,"We booked the hotel to see friends for New Year's Eve.
We arrived and were informed by Brendan that our room needed to be signed off by housekeeping and were asked to wait for a few minutes in one of the sumptuous lounging area. We were happy to do that. Our wait was probably less than 10 minutes however, due to this, Brendan had upgraded our room to a Deluxe suite with 2 complimentary cocktail tickets for the bar, as an apology!! Fabulous start to our celebrations.
The room was gorgeously furnished and very spacious, especially for London. The room was quiet and we only ever heard the person across the hall closing their door.

The staff were very polite, attentive and appeared to enjoy their work.

The bar was in the 'basement' with an exquisitely furnished hallway leading to it, along with again, plenty of seating and lounging areas. It was not too busy and the drinks were reasonably priced.

All in all, we would definitely stay there again. Its proximity to the shopping hub of London, almost village-like atmosphere of Marylebone High Street and being in a quiet area slightly away from the crowds makes it an excellent choice for anyone.
We travelled as a couple and would happily take our children next time.

M & N Hoare",5,2014,01,03
123,Great location for a night in London,"We stayed here on a last minute booking on NYE and were allocated one of the basic rooms which was very satisfactory, even next to the service lift the room was very quiet. The hotel bar serves up some nice cocktails too.
We were disappointed to learn that the pool was closed upon our arrival but we were promptly contacted by Nora from the front desk who apologised via a hand written note (As we were out), left a complimentary bottle of wine and offered us free breakfast the following morning. The personal service from Nora definitely exceeded our expectations. Overall a great experience, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel.",4,2014,01,02
123,Hen weekend,"We got an excellent deal on this hotel, the location was good. The only thing I can say bad about this hotel is that although the rooms were very nice a little on the small side. Would definitely come again on an offer, not sure if I'd be happy with the room size if I'd payed full price. All in all though a good stay ",4,2013,12,31
123,A most enjoyable stay,"I have just returned home from a 4 night break to London with my two children and some friends. Our entire stay at the Marylebone Hotel was very pleasant - the hotel has a friendly and relaxed atmosphere.
The continental breakfast each morning was delicious and we ate several times in the bar/restaurant and the food was liked by all. The location of the hotel is fantastic, just a few minutes walk from Oxford Street. I would highly recommend this hotel and would most definitely return. Many thanks to all.",5,2013,12,31
123,A beautiful hotel,"If you plan to stay in a London hotel on your next visit. then you couldnt find a more beautiful, relaxing,place than the Marylebone. The rooms, although fairly small, are very tastefully furnished...in fact the whole hotel is extremely tastefully furnished.The room service is quick and efficient. Breakfast is en par with a typical Scandinavian ""smörgåsbord""...a gourmets delight. The staff are friendly and extremely helpful, ......and of course.... the prices cannot be beaten for such quality either. As you exit the taxi you will be met by a smiling commissionaire, who will whisk  your bags away and up to your room. 

Situated in Welbeck Street, you are a stones throw from Regents Street,and if your tastes are towards the luxury, then Bond Street is a minutes walk from Selfridges. Just around the corner from the hotel,  you will find Marylebone High Street, with its myriad of beautiful shops and small restaurants, coffee shops and bars.I guarantee your stay will be a memorable one.
As Arnie once said ""I (we)  WILL BE BACK""...",4,2013,12,31
123,A Christmas experience,"We had a wonderful time at the hotel over the Christmas period. We had a studio suite, which was quite generous in size. Room service was excellent, meals at 108 were first class. The staff were very helpful and were flexible about our requirements. The reception rooms are many, varied and beautifully fitted out creating good ambience. Best of all is the location, in one of London's quality areas, close to two Royal Parks, and all the shopping one would ever want, especially in the agreeable environment of Marylebone High Street. Its a big hotel, but it doesn't feel big. We give it full marks.
Feed back: we would have liked more drawer space for clothes; we found the Christmas lunch excellent in content but a little slow in delivery.",5,2013,12,30
123,"Great hotel, great location, exceptional facilities","A great hotel in Marylebone, a 30 sec walk to Marylebone high street and 2 mins to Selfridges and Oxford Street.  Great onsite restaurant and room service menu (cocktails even delivered to room), the price was fantastic but only due to the great rate through booking.com.  Service is exceptional concierge arranged valet parking for me, even though not normally offered at hotel. High quality toiletries and extras like robes etc  The pool, gym and spa facilities are exceptional.",5,2013,12,29
123,Location good but tiny rooms,"We booked a Superior Room, however I really think this hotel needs to look up the definition of superior, as superior it was not. Not even enough room for a bedside table on both sides of the bed, you sit on the loo and you can touch the walls on both sides, very claustrophobic. Saying that decor is lovely and everything feels clean and fresh. Comfy bed. Hotel bar and common areas nicely done. Staff friendly and welcoming. Pool area is difficult to find and ok when you get there although steps down to it could do with sprucing up as black mould is not inviting. Also when booking I was told the car park was next to the hotel, it so is not, it is an 8 minute walk which if I had known that would never have booked here in the first place. If you can afford a higher class room and don't mind parking your car a distance away then definitely worth staying at.",3,2013,12,29
123,Excellent,"This is our second time in this magnificent boutique hotel. EXCELLENT !! Thank you ! Breakfast is superb, staff very polite, cosy atmosphere everywhere . 108 restaurant excellent ! Bathroom is tiny, but well - equipped.We will come back !",5,2013,12,29
123,Great location good value,"The hotel isn't much to look at from the outside but public areas and rooms are modern and recently decorated.
The room itself was bijoux (!) But had everything you would need for a short city break. The bathroom was tiny with no bath. This wasn't an issue for us but it wasn't obvious at the time of booking.
We had a couple of issues during our stay (first room was too noisy as right above the hotel entrance,  second room had a leaking shower door resulting in flooded bathroom) but they were dealt with quickly and efficiently and the staff were very easy to deal with.
I don't think you'd find a better value hotel in central London and we will definitely be returning.  The only downside was the cost of the breakfast - £21 per person on a £80 per night room is just too much. That said, there are plenty of delis, supermarkets,  and cafés within a 3 minute walk of the hotel so no need to pay for breakfast if you don't want to.",4,2013,12,28
123,One of the best hotels I've been to in London!,"We requested a room on an upper floor, initially we were appointed to the 3rd however this was immediately changed once talking to the receptionist. The regular queen bed room is a bit small, making it hard opening two pieces of luggage, but eventually we managed just fine. The bathroom is great with a big shower and enough space. The little details like slippers, espresso machine, chocolates, complimentary water bottles and umbrella add a nice touch. The hotel is very clean and was nicely decorated for Christmas. Location is excellent, about 5 minutes walking distance from Oxford St. and the Bond tube station. Overall we enjoyed our visit very much!",5,2013,12,25
123,Just superb....,"Centrally located with easy access to Shopping, sightseeing and Theatre areas with tube only 5 mins away. Extremely comfortable and well presented facilities/bedrooms - just perfect to relax at the end of a busy day. Superb staff in all areas (front of house and housekeeping) who made our stay all the more memorable by their attention to detail and interest in our enjoyment. Excellent breakfast and afternoon tea. Cannot praise staff highly enough and cannot wait to return.",5,2013,12,19
123,"Good location, nice room, very nice staff","We enjoyed the hotel. It is clean, rooms are nicely designed (nothing fancy, but totally nice and comfortable), lobby facilities are nice, staff is lovely. We had the smallest size room, and were happy with the room. The bathroom was too small, though. Fine for one person, but too tight for two. Maybe it was our particular room, or maybe all the bathrooms are small -- we're not sure. Next time we'd probably aim for one step up on the room (deluxe rather than superior).  Otherwise we were very happy.",5,2013,12,18
123,"an outstanding hotel experience, let down by greed","One of the best hotel experiences I've ever had (great location, great food and comfort, and outstanding customer focus from the staff) was let down by attempting to add a 'tray charge' to an already substantial service charge for room service. Greedy, and left a bad feeling as I checked out.",5,2013,12,18
123,GREAT GREAT GREAT,"Thank you so much to everyone at the Marylebone for making me feel so welcome!  My room was clean, and comfy!   The concierge was PATIENT with me as I navigated my way around London and made sure I knew where I was going.  :)   I will definitely be back!!",5,2013,12,18
123,Best position but not best sleep,"This hotel is very good, the price for that good hotel at that good location is unbeatable. But some drawbacks are present. 
1. Poor mattress made sleep the worst part of stay.
2. Deluxe room (bigger than standard room) is too small with lack of space for clothes in winter.
3. Pool is cold, area full of mold and humidity.
4. You can't open any window for air exchange
5. Weird cosmetics

Now some pros:
1. Best room service (quick and good food)
2. Very tasty breakfast
3. Nespresso on room

Overall, why not to stay again, when Kempinski Stafford cost a fortune :)",4,2013,12,18
123,Great Hotel in Good Location,"If you're after something in the West End then I'd suggest The Marylebone would be difficult to beat

Five minutes from Oxford Street and even nearer to the vastly more interesting Marylebone High street, it delivers on quality and price; the staff are a credit to the hotel, the room comfortable and spacious enough for an overnight stay, and the breakfast stand out

Our only complaint would be the queue for breakfast, which although worth the wait did take some time to arrive, but this could be put down to the majority of guests looking for a Sunday morning lie in

At the time of writing I know they are pushing for a Top 30 in London spot, which it well deserves I'd suggest",4,2013,12,16
123,Very smart hotel,"Stayed for one night on Saturday, great hotel in perfect location, with the best door staff that we have ever encountered in London, immensely helpful, very jolly and a bonus to witness, the now rare, cockney accent working in a central London hotel !  Breakfast was included in our rate and was first class in both content, taste and service.  The rooms are perfect, our bathroom was very tight, but this is central London, for us, the comfort of the bed was probably the only minor disappointment, but for one night really not a problem.

We did eat in the 108 restaurant with not so much success, my order was served cold (club sandwich) then reheated  !?!?   However, a member of staff handled the situation professionally so everything was resolved perfectly.

The location of this hotel with inspirational Marylebone High Street just a couple of minutes walk in one direction and major tube stations in the other, you really couldn't ask for more. And to top it all the cocktails are wonderful.",4,2013,12,16
123,Found it!  Our ideal hotel in London.,"We've stayed in a number of hotels in London, all disappointing in their own way and we feared that we were destined to never find our 'home from home'.  I think we have now.  Booking was friendly and efficient.  We arrived a little early, but the room was ready quickly.  This hotel doesn't think that reducing the number of staff is a good way to save money and as a result, the service is personal and timely.  We had a good sized room (possibly better than I had booked) and despite the very small bathroom, it's so well done with a good big shower, that it works perfectly.  Proper coffee makers, fruit and water, perfect cleanliness and some little extra touches by the maid service really did make the difference.  There's nothing to complain about.  We had a lovely stay and we will be back.  Thank you!",5,2013,12,16
123,Very friendly and helpful team,Only a one night stay. Very friendly and helpful team. The room a little on the cramped side but otherwise a really good stay. Breakfast was good and the room was very quiet for central London with everything I needed.,4,2013,12,16
123,Fabulous stay at The Marleybone,"We visited the hotel for a birthday trip. The hotel location is fantastic and the staff were fabulous on arrival and throughout our stay.  We stayed in a Deluxe Room on the third floor which was filled with everything we required. The room and facilities were brilliant.

We visited and used the spa facilities a number of times and can highly recommend visitors to use them. The layout, changing rooms, showers and supplies were second to none.

We didn't eat at the hotel as we had existing reservations but sat in 108 Bar on a few occasions and the staff were friendly and attentive, top marks and great cocktails.

If you want a lovely hotel in a great location, this is the hotel for you!",5,2013,12,15
123,Love this hotel - will stay again,"We stayed here for my birthday weekend and loved everything about this hotel. Fantastic, quiet location near Regent Street, Oxford Street and classy Marylebone High Street, perfect for shopping and eating. Friendly, helpful staff who go the extra mile. Stylish Art Deco decor (nicer than the usual characterless hotel interior). Room service was really quick and the food was yummy. The room was smallish with a bijou (nice way to say tiny) bathroom but well equipped and had a well-stocked mini bar, kettle and a selection of hot drinks. Decent hair dryer (what a relief), towelling robes and slippers - they've thought of everything.
All in all, a lovely place to stay. I can't think of a better place to stay in London.",5,2013,12,15
123,A 4 star Hotel with 5 star service,"From my arrival to my departure date the all personel were superb. Very friendly and proffesional.The maids they new even my name! Everybody was there to help you to find a right answer for your question. They must invest alot for training. The room is alittle bit small nothing to complain, but has everything you need. Bathroom spacious with a very good shower. The bed vey comfortable for a good night sleep. Stayed 5 nights and I did not had any complain. Free WIFI internet, free 2 bottles of water daily, ipad and iphone charger in the room, safe deposit,bathrobes, coffee tea making facilities, 3minutes walk from Oxford street!!!. On your deparure day dont forget to order from them limo transfer to the airport with a luxurious car with a price alot less than a normal taxi cab.
I will be back again and again and for sure I will recomend this hotel to friends.",5,2013,12,14
123,If only one could sleep!,"Check in was prompt and efficient, and there was ample offer of help with bags and being shown to my room.  The foyer was welcoming and beautifully decorated for Christmas.  The overall impression on going to one's room was that a substantial sum had been invested in a recent face lift.  The room itself was touted as 'superior' but was still pretty cramped, with no bath.  The heating system was antediluvian.  A thermostat controlled metal box fan in one corner of the room.  This made a noise like a Russian tractor  as it cycled on and off. The only way to get some sleep was to turn if off completely.  I then awoke at 4am, and despite a cold room found my sheets wringing wet. I thought I had developed a severe fever.  Astonishingly (for a hotel charging over £200 per night) there was a rubber mattress protector under my base sheet.  If a hotel finds it necessary to put one of these dreadful things on a bed - presumably to protect the mattress from bed-wetters (?) they could at least use an up-market breathable product or put a substantial mattress-topper over it.  To be fair to the hotel, a bill adjustment was made for the lost night's sleep, but really!! Many members of my party also lost sleep due to the noisy room heaters and I see that other Tripadvisor reviewers have commented on this.  The breakfast service was exemplary.  Ditch the rubber and update the room environment management, and this could be a decent hotel.",3,2013,12,12
123,A wonderful hotel,"We have stayed at the Marylebone hotel 4 times in the past 12months and we love it. the staff are so friendly and professional - they even recognized us in the bar when they did not have access to our names... The rooms are spotless, the food is good and the whole ambience of the hotel is lovely. Add to that how close you are to the shopping districts  yet you feel as if you're in a village - it's great!!",5,2013,12,11
123,Second try but still not convinced,"This was my second stay at this property but unfortunately I again cannot write a reaving review...
The location and overall atmosphere at the hotel is simply great, the front desk people were very friendly and quick and the concierge extremely helpful.
The size of the room was a bit better this time (although still very cramped for a 3 night stay with 2 people) but the heating system is so noisy we had to simply turn it off at night. The same goes for the water....when you flush the toilet or take a shower, your partner can't even listen to the news on the TV...again, no idea where this noise comes from...
So all in all, this hotels has a lot of plusses but a couple of very unpleasant minuses",3,2013,12,10
123,"Lovely hotel, 5* service but 3* rooms","This hotel has a lovely warm and welcoming feeling and at Christmas the place looks STUNNING, plenty of communal areas to sit and relax, gorgeous open fire...perfect for chatting over a late night drink. When we arrived it seemed lots of other people did too and i was worried that the hotel was going to be very busy and lose its 'romance' but once everyone was checked in we rarely saw anyone else and where we chose to spend our time, by the fire, we were the only ones there.

Unfortunately the rooms were somewhat of a let down compared to the rest of the hotel, we were initially booked in to a Deluxe Double room but there was a mistake made by the Gentleman at reception and we were offered an upgrade to a suite as compensation which we were more than happy with but on viewing the suite we felt dissappointed. The room was an odd layout with the seating/TV area in complete darkeness, no lighting was built it so we had to ask for a lamp, this was no trouble at all for them but was just odd for a suite.

The bathroom was TINY, smallest hotel bathroom i have seen, they have done well with the space they had but tiny all the same, the door handle was also broken and hanging off the door so you couldnt close it from the outside.

In the morning i went to turn on a lamp and the blub blew which also shot all the electrics in the room so we had to wait for an electrician to come and fix it....i know this is just 'one of those things' but it all add to the impression and experience of the hotel so should not be forgotten.

Lastly, and this is something which really bothered me...we extended our check-out till 2pm, which was no problem for the hotel, but communication obviously hadnt made its way to the Maids....i was in the bathroom and there was a knock at the door, i shouted that i was busy but they STILL entered the room...they quickly left once they reaslied i was naked in the bathroom! Once is a mistake....this happened THREE times in about 10 minutes, three times during my shower i came out to tell the maid to leave the room as i was clearly busy and i didnt want the room cleaned until we had checked out. VERY frustration, not at all relaxing and completely inappropriate.

This may sound like a bad review, its not. 

I would absolutely stay here again, the location is FANTASTIC, 3 mins walk and you are on Oxford Street with the entire world at your finger tips!!! 

For the location and hotel in general it is priced well and i wouldnt hesistate to stay again but i do feel they can improve on the rooms and also the maintanance of the rooms.

Staff service on the other hand was FAULTLESS! Amazing staff, friendly and very charming, nothing was too much for then and the door staff have great character!",4,2013,12,09
123,Amazing,"I booked this as a surprise for my girlfriends 30th birthday, wanting to make it as special as possible I spent a lot of time researching this hotel ... It was not to disappoint.. We were made to feel special and welcome from the second we arrived, the doorman who are fantastic and from the equally fantastic staff on the front desk. The room was perfect for us with everything we needed,the bed was massive and really comfortable. The decor throughout the hotel was luxury modern, with an open fire and comfortable seating all around. Everywhere was kept spotlessly clean. As it is close to Christmas the hotel was decorated which made it feel even more special and welcoming. 
We dined in the 108 restaurant for breakfast and could not compliment it enough, the staff are polite and  attentive and the food was simply delicious and had something available for everyone.

Overall we had a fantastic and highly recommendable stay and we will definitely be returning.

Thank you for making our weekend that extra bit special and truly unforgettable.

123,A real gem!,"Just had two nights in the Marylebone hotel for a short christmas break away. We really enjoyed our stay here. Starting with the location - perfect for a shopping trip. A 3-4 minute walk from Oxford street. 10 out 10.
Staff - so so friendly and efficient. They are so professional and friendly. From checkin to breakfast they are brilliant. 
Hotel building - 10 out of 10. Beautiful in every sense of the word. The bar is class, rooms perfect, pool perfect. 

Overall we really really enjoyed this stay and this is our new hotel for stays in London. Book it. ",5,2013,12,08
123,This place is lovely and cosy!,"I stayed here for my birthday weekend. They had some wine and a slice of peacan pie waiting for me. It was absolutely delicious. The location is great. Just off Oxford Circus, behind Debenhams. Not far from the tube. And the area is pretty quiet. Although its still expensive, I thought that it was worth staying here for the weekend as the staff are polite, helpful and very efficient. I didn't get chance to use the spa facilities which I regret. Overall a great stay. Nice clean rooms. Bathroom was a little on the small side, but hey it's still lovely! ",5,2013,12,08
123,Excellent hotel,"I went to London last weekend and stayed in The Marylebone Hotel, The Location is excellent. We walked everywhere. The hotel staff are so good. Not only were they really welcoming they made our stay a pleasure. The room was nice and spacious which is rare in London Hotels. The breakfast wasn't included which was a bit disappointing. Overall, i think the hotel is run by people who know and enjoy their job.",4,2013,12,08
123,Coops ---The staff are definitely 5 star people,"I have stayed at the Marylebone on numerous occasions . The reception staff are exceptional and have always made every effort to ensure our stay is an enjoyable experience - Gunther is a totally professional and very personable member of the front line team. On the only occasion I experienced a problem I was very impressed on the way it was handled by both the front line team and also the management follow up.
The prices are competitive and the location is great for central London. I would have no hesitation in recommending it for either personal or corporate purposes.",5,2013,12,07
123,Beautiful and central.,"A great hotel right in the middle of London. Just a few minutes from Bond Street station, Oxford Circus or Regent Street, yet tucked away in a more quiet side street, away from the hustle and bustle.
Our room was good sized and impeccably clean and well decorated. The bathroom a tad small, but still more than functional and well designed, with a lovely shower alcove. A complementary newspaper on our door every morning was much appreciated.
The staff was always friendly and helpful, and as a gay couple we felt welcome from before we even entered the front doors. 
We sadly never had the time to try out the spa or gym, but maybe next time?",5,2013,12,06
123,Best hotel in London,"The Marylebone Hotel is a great hotel.  I've stayed in a number of hotels in London but this is my favorite.  Great location, 5 mins walk from Oxford street and the central line so easy to get anywhere in central London, also easy to get to pretty much all the major airports.  Rooms were very spacious, breakfast was surprisingly good for a hotel and huge selection and the best part was the gym was top quality, as good as any walk in gym.  Lots of top end equipment, pool, steam rooms, was a nice break from the London streets!  On top of that, the level of service from all members of the staff was really over and above.  Very impressed and would definitely stay here again.",5,2013,12,06
123,Simply the best,"We love this hotel. All of the Doyle Collection hotels are great but when we stay in London to shop we tend to stay here due to the close proximity to Oxford Street.  It may not be the most attractive on the outside but don't be fooled, it is beautifully & tastefully appointed on the all important inside. Very clever design, modern bathrooms and some really interesting art make this a wonderful space to be in. More importantly all of the staff are great, welcoming helpful & attentive. They really do appear to love what they do & nothing is too much trouble. We were upgraded the last time we were here (2 weeks ago) so that was a big treat but we've stayed here many times & not been disappointed. Great breakfast lively bar - highly recommend.",5,2013,12,06
123,Still my first choice hotel to stay in London,The Marylebone Hotel is really a quality good hotel with friendly staffs around. This is my second visit to London and still I prefer to stay at this faboulous hotel. The location is excellent and just short walk to Oxford street and I love the cafes around the hotel. I really can't find another hotels in London which will be better than The Marylebone Hotel. I will be back next year again! See ya.,5,2013,12,05
123,A fabulous hotel,"The Marylebone is a fantastic hotel.  A great location where from the front door you can turn right and head into the Oxford Street area or a left turn takes you to the more community feeling area of Marylebone Road.
Contemporary in design.  Rooms are nicely furnished, very comfortable and quiet.  The breakfast range was wide with high quality ingredients.
But the key differentiator is the service.  Great staff who obviously enjoy working in the hotel.  From the door and reception welcome, bar service, breakfast and checkout.  Faultless with lots of little touches that delight.  I would recommend this hotel to all visitors to London.",5,2013,12,05
123,Great hotel and best breakfast in London,I stay at this hotel very frequently - why? Because its staff are exemplary. The manager Frits Potiegetor knows how to run a great hotel. A very special thank you to NORA TACKEN for making our last stay so wonderful.,5,2013,12,05
123,Great Hotel in all aspects,"This hotel is really great and this was the second time my wife and I stayed there. the room was very spacious and clean (this time we were in the studio suit but the standard room from previous time was also spacious), the staff was very pleasant and took care of all our requests. 
The breakfasts were very tasty (eggs benedict and great omelettes). And for all you shoppers - the location is excellent, just 5 minutes walk from Oxford street and Bond tube station.
Very recommended.",5,2013,12,04
123,Mr Coldwell,Faultless service and style. Small room but impeccably presented. Breakfast choice excellent. Staff courteous and polite. Perfect for short walk in to Oxford Circus. Head and shoulders above the standard most London hotels think as acceptable. ,5,2013,12,04
123,Excellent service and superb location,"There is a lot of choice of quality hotels to be had in London but the Marylebone is top of the list for me...Being a heavy business traveller its nice to haev some familiarity being away from home so often.  The staff at the Marylebone couldnt be more accomodating.  Everyone knows you and welcomes you back...Gunther in particular whose knowledge of the area adn service is always exemplory!

The rooms are very comfortable with all the amenities you would expect of a quality hotel.  The bar is very nice with a great selection of spirits and wines.

The one major benefit of the hotel for me is the leisure facilities.  When you travel away a lot an exercise regime can often be impacted but with the Marylebone you have no excuses as the facilities are outstanding.  Hotel gyms are normally medicore at best but the Marylebone have the best facilities i have ever been too (incl commerical gyms).  Free weights, classes, aerobic areas, swimming pool and even an ""old school"" gym area with monkey ropes and bars!

Would 100% recommend the Marylebone as a great location to explore London.  You are on the doorstep to all the shopping, bars and restaurants of the west end and a short walk to the Theatre district.  Business or Leisure this is a very welcoming hotel.",5,2013,12,04
123,"Very welcoming, very clean and defiantly valid for money","Me and my partner stayed here for one night, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The room was clean and pretty spacious. We were made to feel very welcomed and all the staff were polite and accommodating. We had a drink in the bar which was very relaxing nice music and waiter service. I would defiantly stay here again very good location. We drove and parked in the NCP car park just around the corner and although that was a little pricey it was a short distance from the hotel. Overall one of the best hotels I've stayed in and am looking forward to going back.",5,2013,12,03
123,A superb hotel,"A superb hotel, with a perfect location just a couple of streets back from Oxford street. The hotel staff were very friendly, always making sure we got the help we needed. The rooms were neat and clean, and the hotel have a great gym/pool/spa area. The great service provided by the staff combined with the location makes this our first choice of hotel on our next visit to London.",5,2013,12,02
123,"Great hotel, staff and location","Beautifully decorated and nice staff - Antonio needs a special nod - a
mazing gym.  Right near Oxford Street but far away enough to be quiet - Marylebone High Street charming with lots pubs and restaurants",4,2013,12,02
123,Good choice!,"We originally booked another hotel but they screwed up our booking so ended up here at the last minute, pleased we did.  Here goes:

Location
3minutes walk from Oxford Street, great location for shopping etc

Rooms
Small but spotless.  Double bed, air con (bit noisy), mini bar etc.  

Bathroom
Same theme, small, again spotless, lovely towels, good shower, shampoo, gels etc.

Staff
Superb.  Everyone went out of their way to help.  

Meals
None taken I'm afraid so can't comment.

Overall
Very happy and would return.",4,2013,12,01
123,"Great service, excellent location","We stayed for just one night but we will definitely visit again. The location was great for our purpose which was to do some Christmas shopping, located just a couple of streets back from Oxford street made popping back with all our purchases very easy enabling us to then dine without any hindrance. 
Also really close for Carnaby Street and Soho with lots of bars and restaurants.
The staff were extremely friendly and helpful, nothing was too much trouble. Our room was compact but well formed and had everything we needed.",4,2013,12,01
123,Perfect location,"We have stayed at a Doyle hotel on a couple of occasions now, and this time we were not disappointed, the hotel is spotless, the room very pleasant and spacious, a very comfy bed and plenty of luxury products in the bathroom. The breakfast was excellent and reasonable. This is an ideal location for a shopping trip in London with a 5 minute walk to Oxford Street. Staff friendly and very helpful. We'll be back and hopefully very soon .",5,2013,11,30
123,One Night Stay at the Marylebone,"My husband and I had a lovely stay at this hotel.  I have to say that the staff here are a real asset.  We visit this area of London reasonably regularly and we will definately stay here again.  The room was rather small, but very nicely decorated and a very reasonable price, so next time we will push the boat out and have a larger room!  We have stayed in other hotels in the same area, paid much more and been very disappointed.  The only hotel for me in this area of London, well done to all the staff there! :)",5,2013,11,27
123,Met and exceeded all expectations.,"I stayed at the Marylebone with my boyfriend a few weeks ago and we had the best stay. From the moment we arrived we felt extremely welcome and the service we received from then on was brilliant. 
The room was lovely, with thoughtful features that made our stay that little bit more enjoyable.
The bar and lobby facilities were excellent, and drinking cocktails by the fire made for an excellent evening. 
Breakfast the next day was wonderful, with such a huge amount on offer and great service from all the staff. This was followed by a lovely swim and time to relax by the pool. A great place to unwind.
All in all we had a wonderful time and both agreed The Marylebone was a perfect place to spend our time in London. ",5,2013,11,26
123,excelleny,"Superb hotel.
very clean, Modern but tasteful, Warm and comforting, 
staff pleasant and welcoming.
just 5 min walk to oxford & bond station.
the price that we get was the same like others hotles , non of them Equal...",5,2013,11,26
123,THE Best Value in Central London....hands down!,"I stayed four nights in a wonderful room.  Spacious by London standards and immaculately maintained through my stay.  The  staff was super in every respect.  I also had a chance to enjoy the on site restaurant which was well priced and deliscious.  Highly recomended.  The location is as good as it gets.  Oxford Street shops and main tube stations minutes away, 6 mins. to Paddington Station by cab (your link to the Heathrow Express).  I litterally stepped off the plane and was in my room in less than 45 mins.",5,2013,11,26
123,The best stay ever,"Me and my daughter visited London for a London a ""daughter/father"" weekend in mid november. We choosed Marylebone because it felt priceworth, good location and nice recommendations here on tripadvisor. It turned out to be a really good choose. Marylebone is absolutely one of the best hotels i ever stayed at. Rooms and public areas is nice and felt welcoming but not especially compared to other hotel. The big difference is the staff and the way they treated us. At frontdesk, in restaurant for breakfast and dinner, in the lobby and the housekeeping they all tried harder than i ever experienced before.
So if you plan at trip To London my suggestion is The Marylebone Hotel",5,2013,11,26
123,Excellent stay for the weekend,"Stayed here for 3 days. Had a lovely time and the hotel facilities are superb. Nice and friendly , helpful staff. Especially the breakfast is highly Recommended. Very close to Oxford street and Bond street subway station. ",4,2013,11,25
123,Fantastic well located hotel,"Stayed for two nights this weekend November 22/24th and like previous stays found the hotel continues to set the highest of standards. Charming friendly professional front- desk personnel in particular Gunther who displays great interpersonal skills in both welcoming guests and giving advice regarding local restaurants , pubs  and shopping. The bedrooms are well furnished with comfortable beds ensuring a restful environment after a busy day. Breakfast is of an excellent standard with a wide variety of breakfast options and an attentive and obliging staff. The hotels location is excellent being just a 5 minute walk to Oxford Streets myriad of shops. There is free Wifi within the hotel with great public spaces to enjoy and chill. The hotel restaurant and bar is popular with guests and has an extensive menu and drink choice. The hotel is close to Bond & Baker Street tube station and is only a short taxi ride from Paddington Station where the Heathrow Express operates from. I would highly recommend this exceptional hotel to all visitors.",5,2013,11,24
123,Wonderful Hotel.,"We recently had a special Family occasion in London & we stayed for three nights.   The quality of the Hotel , the Management & Staff was excellent.  We would rate it as one of the best Hotels we have stayed in in London over the past 20 years. It's ideally located for Shopping , Restaurants & Tourist attractions. It's a very special Hotel & enjoyed a coffee by the fire on arrival. Well done to the Doyle Hotel Group & look forward to staying in the MARLEBONE on our next visit to London.",5,2013,11,24
123,My last stay,"I am a regular visitor to London and stay in a variety of hotels, but I now intend to stay in the Marlebone Hotel whenever possible. It provides good value for money, a variety of food options at a fair price, but outstanding service. As well as having courteous staff, they have also dealt with my unreasonable requests with complete professionalism. This included travel and restaurant advice, storage of luggage over the weekend and emergency dry cleaning with the required shirt being delivered to an office address. I was impressed!",5,2013,11,24
123,Better than last time,"This is our second stay at the Marylebone Hotel. Last time we were very impressed, this time even more so. 
We arrived for a weekend break, 11 am on the Friday, the room was ready and an impressive deluxe room, the staff were very courteous. The room was clean and smart, be comfortable, the beds turned down and water left each night, I would find it hard to improve on this. 
For the first time we are only in the hotel, breakfast was excellent, the tables a little cluttered but ok, the food and selection was good. We took wine in the 108 bar (see my review of the restaurant)
There was nothing to complain about, this is our hotel of choice for the future",5,2013,11,24
123,Another great experience.,"This hotel is a sort of home from home in London at this stage.   The staff are excellent as is the level of service.   One drawback, albeit minor is the distance from buses.   We stayed for four nights this time.   The area is great for restaurants.",4,2013,11,23
123,Great experience!,"Great hotel, located in a beautiful silent street. around 7 min. walk to Bond station / Oxford St. amazing room, very clean, flat screen tv, espresso machine, safe, docking station for Iphone, well furnished. beautiful bath/toilet with heated floor. the hotel has free wi-fi and a business area with computers, free internet and printers. 1 min. walk from the hotel you can find pubs, restaurants, amazing Patisserie (Paul), and Tesco. will come back again for sure and will recommend to others.",5,2013,11,22
123,"High standards, maintained","Stayed 4 nights this month in this jewel of an hotel just off Marylebone High Street. Hadn't had the opportunity to return here in several years and thought the personnel have changed, the Doyle Collection, Irish hospitality has been maintained. Charming and efficient front-desk personnel, ready with a bottle of water or an apple to those in the (short) lines. Though a smallish room, it was well appointed, slippers, safe, Friendly and helpful room staff. Aromatherapy, flat-screen HD tv with SKY and many foreign language channels. Comfortable bed,though a 'false' double. Great public spaces with sofas and chairs to hold an impromptu meeting or stop to catch up on emails on the free wireless with a cup of coffee. Breakfast is of a good standard and not overly priced. The Marylebone is within walking distance to Bond Street tube to the south and Baker Street to the north and is a short cab ride from both King's X (Eurostar) and Paddington (Heathrow Xpress)",5,2013,11,21
123,Gone really downhill ,This used to be a really lovely hotel but in the last year it has really gone downhill. Staff are obliging but incompetent which leads to frequent mix-ups and poor service. Some of the rooms (even the superior rooms) are extremely small and you need to be careful to ask for a room away from the lift shafts which are exceptionally noisy.,2,2013,11,21
123,Amazing Customer Service,"We decided on this hotel after seeing good reviews on tripadvisor and to be fair a good deal we were offered.  I wanted the hotel to be a little special as we had planned the trip around my husbands birthday. Thankfully we were not disappointed in fact the hotel went above and beyond our expectations.  On arrival we were greeted by very friendly, professional and helpful front desk staff.  Whilst booking in we were offered hot towels to freshen up  - a very nice touch.  I had informed the hotel prior to our arrival that it was my husbands Birthday and they didn't disappoint.  We were informed our room had been upgraded to a deluxe room!  Room was very comfortable, clean and quite lovely.  Complimentary bath robes, slippers and bathroom smellies just added that extra touch.  Location of hotel is great, 5-10 mins walk from Oxford Street, nearest tube Bond Street and 5 mins from Marylebone High Street which is fab within its own right - lots of bars, restaurants and shops.  After a busy day out we returned to our room to find the hotel had provided us with complimentary bubbly, a birthday card and some personalised cake!!!  Have to say that this made us feel so special and made the stay even more fabulous.  Can't thank the management enough for this.  Didn't have breakfast in the hotel as we only stayed one night and decided to have a walk around the area instead.  In hindsight whilst we had a nice enough breakfast in local cafe think the hotels would have added to the experience and certainly seemed a better offer.  All in all had a fabulous stay and will certainly be going back.  Can't recommend this place enough.",5,2013,11,21
123,Amazing,"This is the best hotel in a big city we have stayed in! The location, the service, the facilities and the atmosphere! It is very local and at the same time very sophisticated! The rooms is so georgeous,and its always clean when you come back from your sightseeing, dinner, meeting and so on. We have been to so many hotels all around the world and many very popular and welknowned hotels, but this is deffinetly one of the very best. From now on we will always been staying at Marylebone and we will recommend all visitors to do that aswel. No mather if you visit London with friends,family your boyfriend or for a buisness trip.",5,2013,11,20
123,Superb service and great location,"I stayed with my daughter in the Marylebone Hotel for a long weekend in November for the second time. The location is excellent, close to Oxford Street and Bond Street tube station but still in a quiet street. The service was excellent, polite but still discreet. The continental breakfast buffet was very versatile and good price/quality ratio. We visitied the gym and swimming pool once and they were very nice, especially the gym very big as it is actually a private club not only for the hotel guests. I would recommend this hotel warmly.",5,2013,11,20
123,Five Stars - a great hotel.,"I have stayed in nearby hotels and this time chose the Marylebone. It really is a very high quality establishment. Every single member of staff was friendly, helpful, polite and anxious to be of service. Marylebone village is a great location for Marylebone High Street and also Oxford Street, less than five minutes walk away.

The room was a great size for central London. (Some I have been in have been half the size). The bathroom is excellent and even has under-floor heating which was great. 

The breakfast is truly superb with a superb selection of fruit, cereals, etc. and first class full English breakfast cooked exactly to order.

The 108 bar is a very nice place to sit and enjoy a couple of drinks and the restaurant in the evening is also very good. I ordered off menu, three items that were not listed. A 12oz steak, saute potatoes and grilled tomatoes. No problem. It came up exactly as ordered, without quibble and was excellently cooked.

All in all I recommend this hotel highly. It is one of the best I have ever stayed in. OK, it's a bit expensive, but it felt really good staying here.",5,2013,11,20
123,love this place,"it was the second time I stayed in the Marylebone Hotel. First time was for business and I loved it. Therefore I wanted to stay in the hotel again, just a weekend of xmas shopping with my partner. Again: totally outstanding. Fast and very friendly check-in, lovely room, amazing amenities in the bathroom, delicious breakfast, some nice gestures like little bottles of water after checking out. And if you have some spare time left, the lounge is very cosy! Will definitely be coming back and will recommend to everyone who's searching for a hotel in London!",5,2013,11,19
123,Standards maintained and surpassed.,"Last week I had the pleasure of introducing my sister to the Marlebone Hotel.  I had stayed there
several times with my husband, even under it's previous name of the Clifton Ford.  I therefore
knew it to be a wonderful hotel, in a superb location.  Imagine my delight when my sister was
equally impressed.  We will certainly be back.  We might even bring our husbands next time!",5,2013,11,18
123,Afternoon Tea,"My friend and I went for a nice afternoon high tea last week. The service was more than superb. The attendants were very patient and took time to explain their offerings thoroughly. They came to our table very often to make sure the tea and food did not run out. Also as important is the superb array of tea and dessert offerings. Real value for money!

We had a wonderful time there.",5,2013,11,16
123,A perfect hotel to stay in London,"We had a very pleasent stay(4 nights) at this hotel.It has a great location in a quiet street, excellent breakfast and a great staff-friendly and helpfull.Natalia Tolstikova at reception really looked after us very well and sent us our property left at the room.
We will definitely be back!

123,The best afternoon tea,"My friend treated me to afternoon tea at the Marylebone Hotel this afternoon and it was such a lovely experience I felt I needed to write a review immediately while it was still fresh in my mind. The service was absolutely impeccable - our waitress, Jahel was so friendly, knowledgable and helpful that I just had to write to let the hotel management know what an invaluable member of staff she is!

The whole experience was superb from start to finish. Jahel took the time to go through all the different types of tea available (samples were in small canisters to smell), she explained what all the sandwiches and cakes were (something I, strangely, have never experienced at afternoon tea before) and regularly checked whether we like more tea or cakes.

The only downside I would mention is perhaps the portions were a little on the small side (both my friend and I could have done with a few more sandwiches - only 4 mini strips of  sandwiches were provided), but the unlimited supply of cakes, biscuits and macaroons more than makes up for this if you have a particularly sweet tooth.

Overall, for the experience, service and the exquisiteness of the hotel, this was the best afternoon tea I've ever had.",5,2013,11,15
123,There is no better hotel in London!,"Reluctantly sharing this absolute gem of a hotel after a personal request for Gunther at the front desk - I owe the guys this much given they have put up with me now for years.  

Over the past 10 years I have pretty much spent 8 weeks each year in London (4-5 visits per year) and this has literally become my London 'home away from home' -  I'm a tough and informed 'critic' given I have stayed in just about every 4 and 5 star hotel the city has to offer.  My previous top hotel before this one was the Softiel in St James Place - but the Marylebone is even better!

This place has Great staff (one of the best concierge managers you will come across in London), great rooms, great facilities for meetings (with clients and or friends), great gym, great bar, great lobby, great location - getting a pretty clear heads up that I love this place!  

Also perfectly positioned for two of the best places to buy a great coffee in London - just head around the corner to The Providores in Marylebone High Steet, or the WorkShop on Wigmore street (if you need a fix before 9am).  

Lots of great local restaurants, my absolute must visit is 28-50 Wine Workshop and Kitchen (100 metres from the hotel).  

For the girls its a shopping mecca with Marylebone High Street, St Christopers Place and Selfridges all within walking distance even on the highest of heels. 

Regular travelers need to also check out the Doyle Collections loyalty program - these guys seriously get how to do boutique hotel offering for the business and recreational traveler.",5,2013,11,15
123,"Great location, great hotel","This was my third time staying at The Marylebone and their will certainly be more. Love the location , decor throughout and the staff attitude. Lots of restaurants around the hotel for the evening too.

I would not however book a standard room if you are staying for more than 1 night as they are on the small side (as are many other city centre hotel).",5,2013,11,15
123,"Excellent hotel, wonderful for our honeymoon","We stayed at the Marylebone Hotel for our honeymoon in August 2013. We wanted a place that was a little away from the hustle and bustle but still close to restaurants and transportation. The Marylebone was wonderful. It's a beautiful place, situated a few blocks from Oxford Street in a quieter neighborhood (if you don't count the kind of hilarious piano bar catty corner from it). When we checked in, they offered us a handicap-access room for the extra space, and they threw in a free bottle of champagne. We realized a few hours later that it wasn't quite what we needed and asked to be relocated. The staff were very helpful in moving us to a regular room, moving the luggage (and the champagne!) while we explored the neighborhood. Our second room, while smaller, was cozy and inviting with dark wood decor. The desk area had outlets for a variety of plug-types and an iPhone doc. The bed was comfy, and the curtains blocked out the morning light (allowing us to accidentally sleep in way too late). 

While everyone we met on the staff was helpful, we were particularly impressed by and grateful for the concierge (pretty sure her name was Alex?). We spent part of every day gathering info from her on where to go and how to get there. She got us our hop-on/hop-off bus tickets and pointed us to a number of good restaurants. She was terrific -- really knowledgeable and approachable.

We stopped into the hotel's restaurant late one night for dinner, but the music was blaringly loud and not conducive to a nice meal, so we left before ordering. As a result, we have no opinion on the food. The menu seemed pretty limited and overpriced. 

Overall, we loved our stay there. We loved wandering home after a long day to our quiet corner. If we make it to London again, we'll be sure to come back.",5,2013,11,14
123,We love this place!,"We have stayed here several times, for business as well as for pleasure, and have been supremely happy with our experience each time.  Some of the friendliest staff around, and very knowledgable too - they've saved us more than once when we had emergency purchases to make. Great beds, spacious rooms, and a wonderful breakfast, all in a very convenient location.",5,2013,11,14
123,Superb customer service!,"The Marylebone is a great hotel - relaxed atmosphere, tasteful décor, good location, impressive gym, excellent food and best of all is the service; all the staff are absolutely fantastic so helpful, polite and professional - reception, concierge, doorman, cleaners, waiters/waitresses, gym staff even maintenance!!",5,2013,11,14
123,My hotel of choice in London from now on,"This is a fantastic hotel - everyone about it was perfect. Decor & amenities are superb, in public areas and in room. Great quality about everything, nothing felt shabby / worn - unlike many London hotels. 

Service couldn't be faulted - reception / breakfast / doorman / leisure club / housekeeping. Clearly they do a great job on recruiting the right people. Again...very unusual in London!  Breakfast was great choice and quality (that was the only food we ate in the hotel). 

I got a terrific last minute weekend rate so I felt I got 5 star everything for 3-4 star prices. It is also so handy for Oxford St, just a few minutes walk - yet the streets around are lovely and quiet meaning you actually get a good nights sleep. Right off Marylebone High St so loads of lovely shops and restaurants around.  A real french feel about the place.

Warning about the pool - it is freezing! Room temperature was a bit tricky to get right for some reason.

But this is definitely my preferred hotel when I visit London from now on.",5,2013,11,13
123,"Great hotel, attentive staff, fab location","Booked this hotel as the last minute, because we wanted to be in a quiet neighborhood but near Oxford Street tube stop. Modern hotel about 4 block from shopping, and 2 blocks from the High Street which had dozens of restaurants and great shops. Our room was large, with some mid century modern touches, great amenities, free wifi. For some reason we got an upgrade which was unexpected (even when we said no thanks to the upsell at the desk).  Pristine and well cared for hotel in the middle of everything. Well spoken and multilingual staff. We did not use spa or pool. The 108 restaurant and bar was nice. 4 star and well worth it, good value for the money in central London",5,2013,11,13
123,Our favourite London hotel,"We so enjoyed our stay at this lovely, friendly, well located hotel that has such excellent facilities. We had a very quiet night (both nights) unusual for such a central position (only 10 minutes walk from Bond street). Excellent meal and breakfast also next time we will certainly use the swimming pool and gym. Cristina Sanchez at reception really looked after us well. If you need to be in central London this hotel is hard to beat!  ",5,2013,11,12
123,Pleasant stay at Marylebone Hotel,"My partner and myself just returned from a three night stay at the Marylebone Hotel. Overall we enjoyed our stay and thought the staff were helpful and friendly.  We arrived relatively early and although our room was not yet ready, they managed to get it ready within a couple of hours - although I had asked them to call me when it was available, they didn't.

The positives of this hotel and our stay:
Good location and reasonable price for a central London hotel.
Generally good and friendly service.
A clean, comfortable and quiet room with good facilities - stayed in a Deluxe room.

The negatives:
Didn't seem to be any recognition of my GHA Platinum status. One of the benefits is an upgraded room, which I wasn't offered, even though they had higher category rooms available ( I heard the front desk staff trying to up-sell to a guest who arrived later). Whenever I have previously stayed at GHA hotels, included Kempinski and Omni, I have always been upgraded.
Bathroom, although well equipped, is tiny.
Although they offer a perfunctory turn down service, this does not include delivery of ice and there are no ice machines to get your own. I asked room service for some ice and was charged £4.50 for this! Having stayed at hundreds of hotels around the world, this was a first.  I complained about this when I checked out and they said it was their policy to charge for all deliveries to the room, but they did agree to waive the fee.
Room is a bit bland and could do with some art work on the walls.

Overall we liked the hotel but it could be better.",4,2013,11,12
123,A truly enjoyable stay,"The hotel was superbly run with courteous and obliging staff, nothing was too much trouble and the little touches made all the difference.  Less than five minutes walk from Oxford St. and Bond Street tube station, quietly located in Marylebone Village.  The room was well equipped, clean, comfortable and the water in the shower was piping hot.  An extremely pleasant stay and we will definitely return!",5,2013,11,12
123,"Well located ,very helpful staff","The Marylebone hotel is well located just a short walk from Oxford/Bond street and very close to the charming Marylebone high street. We booked one of the cheaper rooms and it was very snug, due to an air on problem we then moved to a larger room , still not huge and sitting just under the gym a bit noisy at 7am . The rooms are nicely furnished and well appointed with a kettle and coffee maker, also wi if is free , the beds and pillows are very comfortable and would definately recommend them for a good nights sleep",4,2013,11,11
123,Outstanding,"Great location - on a quiet street, yet a walk to many attractions, shopping, and eateries [Maylebone High street, Oxford street, Bond Street, Regent Street, and more]. When we checked in, they accidentally gave us an uncleaned room; this was changed immediately. Even though we were very low-key about it, when we returned to our room the next evening, after a day out, we found a bottle of champagne in an ice bucket AND some delicious high-quality truffles! The hotel restaurant is also very good, and the staff were all friendly and helpful.",5,2013,11,10
123,Great location + wonderful service = perfect stay!,"We've just come back from an overnight stay in The Marylebone Hotel and it couldn't have been better. The room was very clean, quiet and well equipped and the staff couldn't have been more welcoming and helpful. The Hotel has a wonderful tranquil feel which is perfect after a busy day in th surrounding streets. We'll definitely be back!",5,2013,11,10
123,Mixed Feelings About This Place,"This is a popular hotel near Oxford St. & Selfridges. Evidently it was redone a few years ago and it has a very modern look & feel. Seems to be a destination for business travelers. We were disappointed in that as we had been staying in the country at quaint b & b types and was expecting something more ""charming"" or traditional, but the reservations were made for us by someone else. We were disappointed by our first room as it had no drawers...none. The front desk was friendly and willing to help us and showed us another room but it was the same. In our room is a long table/desk but there is nothing under it...they could have put in some drawer space so we lived out of your suitcases for several days.

Staff was very nice, particularly the door men and there is a good restaurant called 108 which is attached.",3,2013,11,10
123,charming beautifully decorated,"We were put up in this hotel as congress guests and what a delightful surprise. tranquil décor in our room, fabulous selection of places to sit and read or wait for friends downstairs. Delicious breakfast in a homely dining room. Friendly staff, brilliant location, all in all a winner !",4,2013,11,10
123,Great value in the heat of Londom,"Even staying at the start of London Fashion Week when the hotel was full we were made to feel very welcome with nothing being too much trouble.
We love the Doyle collection Hotels and out first stay at the Marylebone did not disappoint, from the door man to the chamber maids everybody was helpful and polite. The Bar and restaurant were very pleasant with excellent service, drink and food. 
Room was not massive but a good size for London. Breakfast was also very good and set us up for the day.
Only grumble was the mattress which was not up to their usual standard.",4,2013,11,10
123,Amazing service and location,"I recently stayed at the Marylebone Hotel on a business trip and had an exceptional experience from the staff.  They were incredibly responsive and the hotel provided the perfect backdrop for successful meetings.  Because the location is so central, it was a perfect central point for all of my meetings.  And at night, it was located near incredible shopping and restaurants. I would highly recommend the Marylebone Hotel for work or pleasure.",5,2013,11,10
123,"Great location, outstanding bar","Great place, perfectly located. Clean, nice rooms. Staff very friendly particularly Rahim the head concierge who was very accommodating to our requests and gave good recommendations. Bar (108) is fantastic! Alex (mixologist) made us amazing cocktails with excellent service!",5,2013,11,09
123,Tranquil Luxury In Central London,"I love The Doyle Collection hotels. Whenever I need to stay in London (which is almost weekly), the first website I check is theirs.  Why? Their hotels are quite possibly the perfect blend of luxury, hospitality & tranquility.  So when work pre-booked my hotel for 4 nights away, I was delighted to find they had chosen The Marylebone Hotel. 

The hotel is in Welbeck Street, so a mere 5 minute walk to reach Oxford Street, and the street itself is fairly quiet.  From the moment you arrive, the welcome is warm and genuine.  The doorman is quick to welcome you as he opens the door, & will immediately go to help you with your luggage.  If you have stayed here before (& they always ask), you are then welcomed back. A nice touch.

The lobby is beautifully and tastefully decorated. Plenty of opulent fabrics, stylish furniture and ambient lighting.  There are a number of areas around the hotel where you can meet friends or colleagues, sit, have drinks, chat, work, socialise, read a book... and yet it never seems busy, crowded or intrusive. Just relaxing and private.  Check in is efficient but you do not feel rushed. Oh and the hotel smells divine. 

My room was decorated beautifully in muted cream and chocolate brown tones, with a pop of red here and there.  There was a large window and so plenty of natural light. The bathroom was modern and clean, with a sliding door to maximise space and a power shower over the bath tub.  Tea and coffee making facilities are provided, there are plenty of hangers in the wardrobe, a decent and full sized hair dryer, ironing board and iron and a flat screen TV.   There's a floor to ceiling mirror which is both practical and helps make the room seem bigger than it is, and thick curtains that ensure that the room is private, warm and also extremely quiet.   A selection of magazines is provided, and there is a fully stocked mini bar.  Be aware that the mini bar is  'spring loaded' and that once you remove something from it, it automatically registers on your account Something my friend did not realise when he pulled out the mini bottle of champagne to show me!  

The bed was King Size and extremely comfortable. The room was at the perfect temperature, and as I've already mentioned, extremely quiet despite overlooking Welbeck Street.  You'll get a fantastic nights sleep here.  Oh, and the holy grail of hotels is here… power sockets next to the bed so you can charge your phone & keep it within arms reach. 

I like to stay fit when I travel, and The Marylebone has the most fantastic gym (The Third Space gym).  You've a selection of cardio equipment and there's a spin class area for you cardio junkies.  It also has a separate studio for classes, a free weights area and a retro gym area (think wall bars, ropes etc), as well as TRXs, kettle bells, cable machines, foam rollers…you name it! You can get an excellent workout here…as long as you put the work in of course. 

If you'd rather socialise in your spare time, there is a bar at the rear of the hotel, and for the more health conscious (although I didn't get to try it this time) their new Juice menu appeals to the healthier traveller. 

So what sets The Marylebone apart from other luxury hotels in London? Well it's not part of a faceless chain for a start. The Doyle Collection is a small group of hotels, all equally as luxurious but with individual styling and character.  They recruit THE friendliest staff  I've ever encountered at any hotel who have genuinely happy demeanours.  Nothing seems 'fake' or forced and they are attentive, polite and extremely efficient. I lost my scarf while staying here and I have had 3 emails in less than a week from the hotel keeping me informed as to how they have checked for it and so far cannot find it, but will log it in their Lost Property Book and should it turn up, will send it out to me. HOW helpful is that?  

When anyone asks me to recommend a hotel in London (as I travel here all the time) there are a few hotels I immediately recommend without hesitation.  The Marylebone is one of these.  Should you book this hotel? Most definitely.  Will you enjoy it? I guarantee it.  Will I be returning? Absolutely!",5,2013,11,09
123,It does exist: a truly pleasant hotel experience in London,"I stayed at the Marylebone Hotel for one night because of a Board Meeting in the same hotel next day.  I entered the hotel on a rainy Thursday in angry mood because of a very annoying mini-cab experience, but the staff at reception made me feel at home immediately. I was in a rush to go out for dinner, so they agreed to postpone the registration process and accepted my luggage for storing. I was pleasantly surprised when I came back from dinner and my luggage was taken up to my room already, just on the base of the reservation for the room being done on my name earlier. The room was facing a quiet street, was well equipped, nice interior, fair sized bathroom. But now it comes: On the next morning a friendly staff person greeted me on the corridor and I told him about a damaged silicon sealing in my shower (the rain shower is excellent, by the way!). He thanked me and promised to inform the ""maintenance man"" - what else should he do, right? I did not expect any impact triggered by my informal remark to that staff person - so you will understand my delight when I saw the sealing being repaired two hours later, when I returned to my room to prepare my check out. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",5,2013,11,09
123,Back again for a luxury half-term with kids,"My wife and I stayed at The Marylebone Hotel for a weekend last year and were very pleased with our stay. So pleased in fact that when we were booking our first half-term holiday with the kids, we decided to spend the extra money and stay at The Marylebone Hotel again. 

They do (almost) everything right at The Marylebone Hotel. First off, the location is fantastic: right off of Marylebone High Street (voted the UK's best high street for umpteen years running) and just five minutes away from the shops of Oxford Street and Bond Street tube station. (Full disclosure: we used to live on Bulstrode Street, the street that the side of the hotel faces, so for us, the location also has special meaning.)

Secondly, the service is personal, swift and friendly. Everyone - from the tall doorman (who always had a smile and a friendly word for the kids) and the efficient and helpful front desk staff to the wonderful concierge Alexandra and the exceedingly helpful attendants at the spa - helps make your stay as relaxed and good as possible. I thought the one exception was the breakfast maitre d' who was slightly cold and aloof (wanted to ask her for the window table, but never dared!). 

Speaking about the breakfast, that's the third area where The Marylebone Hotel shines. We had the full English breakfast included in our rate and when the say ""full"", they really mean ""full"". Besides the range of freshly pressed juices (orange, apple, grapefruit, cranberry, etc.) and the great selection of croissants, breads and condiments, we were also free to choose any hot dish from the (otherwise expensively priced) made-to-order menu. Beware though, the cooked food takes a looooooong time to arrive, which annoyed us the first morning but when we knew that to be the case, it wasn't really an issue. Just don't gorge yourself on too many pain au chocolates first! The lower section of the breakfast area can be quite cold, so bring a sweater. And do try to get a table at one of the dormer windows in the main room, we got one by accident (or was it planned?) our last morning there and it was so choice. 

The room itself - a junior suite - was on the fifth floor and unfortunately faced the back of the hotel, which was a little disappointing. Otherwise, it was well appointed with a superbly soft and comfy king size bed, three armchairs, a flatscreen TV, Nespresso machine, kettle and safe. Enough powerplugs for all of our iGadgets (including a European and Australian socket so no need to bring as many adaptors as I did). There were robes and slippers for the whole family (including super cute child-size ones!). The bathroom was well lit and spotless but the tap was a little bit too close to the edge of the sink so as you washed your hands, you flooded the credenza. The water also drained VERY slowly. But we survived! The thick drapes shut out any light, but there was a fair bit of noise from the corridor in the late evenings as other guests walked past, so bring earplugs. 

I can't mention the room without mentioning that the staff had prepared a wonderful welcome for the kids by placing cuddly teddies (complete with The Marylebone Hotel knitted sweaters) on the kids' pillows, along with age-appropriate books, kids' maps of London, stickers, etc, etc. In the bathroom, chunky rubber letters spelled out the kids' names on the mirror. So thoughtful - the kids loved it! 

Don't forget to bring your bathing suits as there is a gorgeous pool in the basement of the spa that was practically empty despite this being half-term! 

In summary, The Marylebone Hotel isn't cheap but it is good value by London standards, in a great location, with well-appointed rooms and great staff. Highly recommended!",5,2013,11,05
123,feel at home,"as a frequent guess of the hotel i am always get the best service i can get.
( i am traveling a lot so i can compare)
the room is always ready on time, breakfast very fresh, every body is nice , they don't extra charge for deliveries.
room service is a good and location is amazing.
last time they even let me to take a shower after  i check out because our flight was late ...so i got a room for 3 hours  complimentary.
amazing experience i am always happy to be back!

123,A home away from home at a perfect location,"I stayed at the Marylebone Hotel after a week business trip in the UK. The second I entered the hotel on a rainy Friday, I felt welcomed and at peace. 

Check-in was pleasant and my luggage was taken up to my room by a front desk officer as the concierge was busy. The room was facing a quiet street, was well equipped, nice interior, fair sized bathroom. I had booked the smallest room, which is really small, but I guess to be expected, especially in London. 

The breakfast buffet was good, lobby and bar have a very cozy, homely feeling to it. 

But the best bit about this hotel is the location: a ten minute stroll to Bond Street as well as to Regents Park. On Marlyebone High Street, plenty of trendy pubs, restaurants and coffee shops await to be discovered. All the while the hotel is in a quiet corner of the neighborhood. 

I was excited about the many classes (yoga, pilates...) they offer in the gym, however, these classes need to be booked and the gym members get to book first. So, unfortunately, I wasn't able to join any of the classes as they were all fully booked. So, calling in and booking in advance might be an option here. 

All in all, can recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a pleasant, relaxing hotel to stay at while discovering London (and doing a bit of shopping, of course).",5,2013,11,04
123,The worst experience,"The room was not ready when we arrived at 14:30, which is after their official check in time.
They asked us to wait for 30 minutes (even though free drinks were offered,which we declined).
After our complaints, they offered us 2 options. The way of the question was totally strange. [Bigger room ? or better room ?] Do you understand the diference of bigger & better ? What they actually offered were the same class room (nothing better than we booked) for 10 minutes wait and a larger room for 30 minutets.
The arguements took nearly 30 minuets & we got the same class room by the time.
We were exausted due to the trouble, and were taking a nap. 
However, we were distubed by a meaningless & insensitive phone call from the hotel to ask us [everything ok ?] 
We thought [we just told you it is not ok] but answererd [no problem].
A few minuets later, a room maid opened the door of our room without any nocks. We shouted [what ?], but she did not say anything and closed the door. We hang [do not disturb] and decided just to take the room but refuse any services which could be offered from the hotel who do not totally understand what customers want.
Then, they sent a letter of excuse to protect their reputation, which does not ease but just irritated us.
We cannot recommend this hotel to anyone.",1,2013,11,02
123,Great Experience,"This hotel is excelent, we stayed first for 3 nights at the Hilton in Park Lane and believe me the experience in Marylebone is quite superior. The rooms and the hotel are very nice, the staff is very friendly but above all the service is outstanding. Whenever you need something you get it right away they are very professional. I would recommend this hotel to everyone. Also you find good restaurants, shops, the tube, etc.

123,Couldn't fault it. Much better in real life than how it looks on the website.,Love it. Previously stayed at their other Doyle property in soho - the Bloomsbury- which is also fabulous. The Marylebone has more buzz and feels like a younger hipper clientele. They sweetly surprised me with a bottle of champagne when they found out it was my birthday - the little darlings.xx,5,2013,11,01
123,"Gorgeous, comfortable hotel in perfect location","Recently stayed in the Marylebone Hotel for a weekend with my sister.  From the door being opened it was fantastic!  Staff were so helpful, our room was beautiful with lovely high ceilings and despite the fact that you are so close to everything it was lovely and peaceful.

Marylebone High Street is only a two minute walk with lovely little shops while Oxford Street and all the big name shops are close by.  The breakfast was delicious and despite the fact it was very busy the service was excellent.  We also got delicious chocolate and hot milk one of the evenings as part of the turndown, perfect after a long day! Would highly recommend it for a lovely comfortable weekend away",5,2013,11,01
123,Excellent Customer Service in a Great Location,"My family have just completed a 3 day stay at this hotel and we can safely say that the service we received was top notch. The staff greeted you by name, were very helpful and some of the little things like fresh fruit in the lobby and the turn down service made our stay a very pleasant experience.  Location is great - very close to Oxford St and Bond Street underground. The area has a number of very nice restaurants, some of them being very popular with queue's out on to the street.  
I would have no hesitation recommending this hotel to anyone looking for a central London hotel.",5,2013,11,01
123,No better place in all of central London,"From the intoxicating smell of the candles when you walk in, to the personable service of the door attendants to the outstanding professionalism of each staff member, to the cozy, soft rooms with comfortable beds and fresh sheets to the 'real' top level 'no excuse' gym and pool in the basement....this hotel is like no other in London. Wonderfully placed off Marylebone Hight Street and minutes away from Bond and Oxford Streets, this hotel is run with a level of service unheard of in London. I am fortunate to spend almost one full week every month there on business and am welcomed back each time like an old friend. They never disappoint and are always genuinely interested in making sure that I am comfortable. There is nowhere else I would stay for a business trip or a personal visit.",5,2013,10,31
123,Perfect Location for Shoppers,"Prior to booking this hotel I spent a lot of time checking out the reviews. One of the reasons I chose this hotel was it was so close for shopping and being centre of town as well as having not so many bad reviews. Their Certificate of Excellence from Expedia was another reason which swayed me to book. 
I was arranging a surprise get away for my partners 30th birthday. I had been in touch with the hotel after booking to arrange a surprise for him. The hotel staff were very accommodating and helpful especially Rahim - head of concierge. Rahim and Alixander had helped me book the best seats for the Phantom of the Opera and arranged for a bottle of Champagne and cake on our arrival. 
We arrived at hotel few hours prior to check in our room was not ready yet so we had left our bags. The check in girl had given us fresh towels to freshen up a nice gesture and offered us tea and coffee complimentary while we waited for our check in. We decided to go for a stroll. The directions given to us by Rahim to dodge the street walkers and only took 10 - 15 mins to get to Oxford St and Regent St. We walked to Soho Chinatown in 20 mins. The hotel is very central and nearest tube was Bond St. 
The room was very spacious and clean. Loved the turndown service - water and chocolates! Bathroom was good size and lovely and bright. The only thing would be an ice machine would be ideal as there would be a charge for a bucket of ice.The hotel had a spa and swimming pool which we unfortunately didn't have enough time to check out. Felt very welcoming and loved the location. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone looking for somewhere to stay as a city break for shopping and I would definitely come back again.",5,2013,10,29
123,The Marylebone: Extremely pleased!,"We were very pleased with our choice to stay at the Marylebone Hotel for our recent trip to London. The location was excellent for our purposes, the property was well-maintained and the staff were outstanding! Our room was clean and quite comfortable. Tatiana, who checked us in, was wonderful, as was the rest of the staff. The continental breakfast kept us going all day. Overall, just a great hotel in London.",5,2013,10,25
123,"The Marylebone: A ""No Worries"" Oasis in Central London","The Marylebone provides a very comfortable environment for its guests regardless of the purpose for your visit. During our one week stay in mid-October of 2013, we experienced top notch service from the entire staff: front desk, concierge, restaurant to doorman. Every inquiry or request for assistance was met with a ""no worries, can do"" attitude.  The location was great....a short walk to a variety of cafes, Oxford Street is just around the corner and the nearby Bond Street Underground will quickly get you to your desired destination. Next trip to London, the Marylebone will be our first stop.",5,2013,10,24
123,Surprise of style and convenience,"Nestle in a quite street close to Oxford Street with taxi's always available outside the hotel. Extremely helpful and friendly staff. Rooms are medium size with small bathrooms. Extra towels and free WiFi added to the pleasant stay. The extended lobby and many couches in concealed corners on the entry floor differentiate the Maryleborne from other similar hotels. Only continental breakfast included in stay, but a a-la-carte menu is available at an additional cost.",5,2013,10,24
123,Marylebone-London,"Good location, good service and a very nice gym/spa, including a wonderful 18m long pool. The staff is very helpful, there is a choice of lounge areas where you can use for informal meetings. Close by, there are many options for shopping and Regent's park is in a walking distance.",4,2013,10,23
123,Great Hidden Hotel in the heart of London,"Loved the Marylbone location.  On a residential street, quiet, and filled with old brownstones.  Yet a quick walked to Oxford High Street and Marylebone high street.  Close to the tube, and a nice brisk walk to Hyde Park.",4,2013,10,22
123,Above and Beyond Fantastic,"The Marylebone was fantastic. The rooms were lovely. The hotel was in a great location. It had nice lounge area and the restaurant was really good (I ate there twice). 

Beyond the nice structure was a staff that exceeded any reasonable expectation. Unfortunately, I had to cut my stay radically short and Antje at the front desk made all of the necessary arrangements for me to leave early. The next morning she wasn't there but others at the front desk had everything prepared for a speedy departure. They couldn't possibly have been nicer. I cannot praise them enough!",5,2013,10,22
123,Enjoyable stay at  the marylebone  hotel,"From the day we arrived we were welcomed warmly , our room was good in size , clean and quiet .The staff were great , friendly and very helpful . Shopping area is few minutes a way . On my next visit to London I will stay again in the same hotel . I definitely recommend it",4,2013,10,19
123,Overall review.,"My wife and I treat the Marylebone Hotel as our 'Home from Home' whenever we are in London.

Even when alone in Town when required to see clients regard this as my 'home' and 'office' !

Highly recommended as an excellent place to stay inTown !",5,2013,10,19
123,Very nice but not a real 5* hotel...,"Positive things:
- Very clean
- Fantastic location
- Very friendly and helpful staff (the guys who open the doors outside are just fantastic) :)
- Very nice breakfast

Negative things:
- Wi-fi connexion is bad
- Very small room
- Not very good isolation between rooms
- They constantly enter into your room, to check the minibar and many little things... And once you're alone, they call you on the phone to ask if everything is ok... Thanks but yay, let me rest, please! :) So you better put the ""don't disturb"" thing at your room's door...
- The room service: I ordered a Cesar salad and it was just some leaves of lettuce and parmiggiano... Not worth it...",4,2013,10,19
123,Doyle have created a high quality product,"Registration was swift and professional and the room was great , if slightly too small for a superior room. Amenities are excellent. I used the pool in the spa which surprisingly for London was not overheated. The breakfast was diverse and delicious.",5,2013,10,19
123,Excellent central London Hotel,"Stayed here for three nights at the beginning of October. Central, yet relatively quiet location close to both Oxford Street and Marylebone 'village'. Some lovely places to eat locally and food prices on a par with our home city. Hotel staff in the main courteous and friendly - Enrico the concierge was extremely helpful and polite. Our room whilst small (but this is central London and we have stayed in smaller rooms in European cities) was fine - clean, warm and comfortable - this was a base as we were out for most of the time. As other reviewers have pointed out bathrooms can be a bit on the tiny side of small!! 

Lovely gesture of a bottle of Prosecco, card and home made biscuits for my wife's birthday which was thoughtful and enjoyed - thank you. We would certainly recommend and would return for a short stay when next in London.",5,2013,10,19
123,Wonderful anniversary weekend,We stayed here recently for our 10th wedding anniversary and had a wonderful time. The hotel surprised us with a card and champagne in our room which made the stay start off really nicely. The suite was spacious and well laid out. We enjoyed the pool and steam room and the gym looked great though we didn't have time to try it out. The breakfast was lovely and they arranged an alternative for us as vegetarians which was very nice. We would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone and hope to come back one day soon! ,5,2013,10,18
123,Nice Hotel Good Location,The room was not ready when we arrived mid afternoon however staff arranged a complimentary drink. There was workmen noise when shown to our room and although fully booked staff arranged another room after a couple of hours. It should be noted that a DeLuxe room can vary in size in particular the bathroom and wardrobe/storage area. The room was well appointed with modern equipment. All staff were extremely friendly and the hotel is close to good dining and shopping areas and the tube is a short walk. did not use the dining room but food provided in the Bar was fine for that type of fare,4,2013,10,17
123,"Lovely hotel...smart, yet relaxed","In London with my wife for a West End show so booked for an overnight stay at the The Marylebone Hotel through a 3rd party website. We arrived to book in around 23:15 after the show and it seemed our booking hadn't been received. After a 10 minute wait in one of the lounges we were given tickets for a complimetary drink in the bar and a room upgrade for our inconvenience - which was a lovely surprise.

The room was neat, clean and modern but very comfortable and welcoming with everything you need: tea, coffee machine, mini bar, great shower...even an iphone dock. It was also very quiet and I was kept awake by the ticking of the alarm clock, of all things! The breakfast room was busy (probably our bad timing) but once seated had a wide choice and the staff were attentive but not overly so.

Overall, a great hotel with friendly, helpful staff in a fantastic central location only a few minutes walk from Oxford Street...it even had a nice smell! Will definitely stay here again.",5,2013,10,16
123,Excellent hotel with great service,"This hotel was a stark contrast to what I had just checked out of.  The hotel, service and the rooms all were excellent.  Location is great and I would definitely stay here again.  The check in was smooth and polite. The room was spacious and had been recently refurbished. Overall the hotel had a very nice ambience",4,2013,10,16
123,beautiful hotel,"I stayed at this hotel in September and had a wonderful experience. The hotel is beautiful with a large reception area and several small lounges through the main floor. The hotel restaurant had great food although quite busy in the morning and the hotel bar simply unbeatable, music and especially the cocktails high end! enjoyed them every night.
I would recommend this hotel because of the great and helpful staff and because it is close to the underground and walking distance not only from shopping areas but also from some great restaurants,",5,2013,10,15
123,Just didn't seem up to scratch,Spent three nights at The Marylebone Hotel (Doyle Collection) Staff are very attentive with breakfast staff at pains to point out they have remembered your name. Breakfast is extensive to suit most palates and has a restaurant attached although we did not eat there. Rooms are small but being near central London one is never going to spend long in them apart from sleeping. Shower room and toilet area is bordering on being far too small and curtains have numerous thin areas that allows light through them. Beds are soft but comfortable and there is a turn down service in the evening Bizarrely our three nights had three different prices on the bill and the most and least were separated by nearly £100. Near Oxford Street and although no car parking in the maze of one-way streets surrounding does have 25% off local NCP.,3,2013,10,13
123,When we come back; we will be staying at the Marylebone Hotel.,"Our kids gave us this trip to London, for my wife's birthday and I don't think they could've chosen a better hotel, for us to call home for 6 days. The staff, could not have been friendlier or more helpful. The moment we turned the corner, a young man ran across the street, grabbed our bags and escorted us to the front desk, I wish I had gotten his name. The stay was perfect and we wish we could have stayed, longer. We will be back and we will stay at the Marylebone.",5,2013,10,13
123,London chic,"I do love this boutique hotel.  It's very stylish, amenities are excellent.  Our room (although rather small which I've realised is quite typical in London) is well organised, functional and comfortable.  I enjoyed walking the streets, there are numerous restaurants and bars in the area.  Location is excellent.   Interesting enough, on our first day we had a tour to catch and only had 2 hours allotted to get to the hotel, check-in, and head out to our tour.  Our trip from the airport (via tube), and check-in was efficient and hassle-free.  We were so stoked to have ample time to get to our pre-booked tour!  It also was an excellent hub for shopping!   Close to Oxford St., one of my favourite shopping streets in London.  We enjoyed our stay at the Marylebone Hotel.",4,2013,10,13
123,A homely hotel in the very heart of London,"Me and my girlfriend stayed in Marylebone Hotel for two nights on a weekend visit to London. It was such a wonderful experience...we immediately felt at home, hence, the review title. Friendly staffs at the check-in desk and room service was quick and excellent. Our room like the rest of the hotel was spotlessly clean with a great view from either the bedroom or the sitting room. Location is very good...shopping etc.Oxford St is a walking distance. And the price for all these beautiful and comfortable environment is very very good for a Central London Hotel. Highly recommended. Babatunde Ogunbiyi",5,2013,10,13
123,Excellent Hotel,"We stayed three nights in this wonderful hotel just near Oxford Street. A great base for shopping, enjoying the sights esp. Hyde Park, so you got the best of both worlds. 
The staff are so helpful, welcoming and genuine.  THe room was well appointed, a little small but i am 6ft and need space. It had great facilities, nice chilled bar area. Great restaurants in the back streets all around the Hotel. 
Great after sales service too!! as i stupidly left my boots in the room. A quick phone call and they organised that they were sent back to me ...what service. We were impressed from start to finish of our stay at the Marylebone Hotel.",5,2013,10,11
123,Beautifull gem in a big city,"Service - Very attentive staff. Always happy to help with a big smile and very polite.
Sleep quality - The beds were big and comfortable.
Cleanliness - Spotlessly clean.
Location - Very close to Bond St. tube station. Very close to oxford street. Great Location!!!
Rooms - For a couple they were enough. Beautifully decorated.
Breakfast - Very rich, but wish they would make some changes every other day. We stayed for 5 nites and every day it was exactly the same.
Pool - Went there once, it was a big enough for a swim.

Overall it was a great Hotel which exceeded all our expectations. The hotel has a beautiful Lobby with great art works and sculptures.",5,2013,10,11
123,Very Good but....,"Great location. Lovely decor.  Seems very popular. Rooms a bit small but that's europe.  Nice touches with fruit, candy, water but - one evening a continued problem with the plumbing unfixable and the evening manager not very helpful at first.  After a few phone calls to have it fixed I had to go down in person only have the fellow on duty ask, ""well can't you stay the night in the room?"" - what with no working toilet?  No.  It took another phone call and an hour to get moved.  This should have been an immediate fix - new room and no chit chat.  But front door and bell staff make the stay a home run!  Super friendly, knowledgeable and you actually look forward to chatting with them - Maurice was a great hotel Ambassador.  Yes, we'd stay again. The location is excellent to all of London and a short walk to the Bond Street tube.",4,2013,10,10
123,Great base for London sightseeing,"We stayed in a Superior room which was very well appointed, comfortable and very clean. The staff were very helpful and friendly. The hotel is very well situated for London shopping and the Bond St. tube station - about 5 minutes walk. There are a number of reasonable restaurants St. Christopher's Place which is about 5 minutes walk from the hotel. The hotel has gym and swim facilities that we didn't have time to take advantage of. My partner received a wonderful birthday treat from the hotel which rounded off a wonderful weekend so a great big thank you to them. Definitely consider going again!

There wasn't much storage space in the room but given the central London location I expect that this is reflected in the price of the room. We didn't eat in the hotel so can't comment on the food - I felt the £16 per head for a continental breakfast was a little steep - we found alternatives nearby.",5,2013,10,09
123,"Best Hotel Experience -Excellent Customer Service and Ammenities, Great Stay","We stayed at the Marylebone Hotel in May 2013 while in London for our son's wedding. Not only were we well hosted, but so were our entire family from the US in London for the family. The staff is welcoming, helpful, and courteous. The rooms are extremely clean, updated and comfortable. The hotel lobby, restaurant, bar and health club wonderful.The location is central to everywhere. 
When visiting London or when recommending a hotel, we will always say, ""The Marylebone Hotel"".",5,2013,10,09
123,Small boutique hotel,"Great hotel!  All staff were warm, friendly and helpful.  Front desk staff always smiling......thanks to Rahim and Alix who helped with all my questions!  Room was a little tight, no view, but the amenities and service made up for it.  Wonderful Carrera marbled bathroom, with great fixtures, lotion, shampoo, conditioner.  Also requested a refrigerator to store my meds.   Turn down service, chocolates and bottled water brought to the room in the evenings.  Breakfast buffet plentiful with meats, fish, cheese, breads/croissants, fruit, yogurt.  Location was also great.  3 blocks from (hectic) Oxford Street and Bond Street tube station as well as many bus lines.  Also 2 short blocks away from Marylebone High Street (and village) filled with small shops, restaurants and bakeries.  They can also provide their own ""airport car"" for transport to the airport.....(best to check with them for rates).  Cozy lobby with a couple of different seating areas, displaying some contemporary as well as traditional art.  Would definitely return to the comfort, warmth and convenience of this hotel.",5,2013,10,09
123,Excellent Hotel in the heart of London,"Wonderful Hotel!
Always very friendly and helpful staff. Exceptional clean room and bathrooms. Nice and well equiped bathrooms (however quite small). Very well located in a quiet area between Oxford street and Green Park.
Various good restaurants close to the hotel.
Will definitely return to this nice, friendly and personal hotel! :)",5,2013,10,08
123,Great smaller hotel in upscale london ,"Worked out of the marylebone for a week and really liked it. Location is great - central but quiet. Rooms are small but comfortable. Great home base in London. 

Staff went out of their way to make sure everything was taken care of. Would definitely stay there again. ",5,2013,10,07
123,Home away from Home at the Marylebone!!,"I had the pleasure of being a guest for 3 days this month, and I must tell you, as a fellow hotelier, I was impressed!

The staff here is very welcoming, warm, efficient  and anticipating, and made us feel really at home from the moment the doorman greeted us. Our accommodations were fabulous, literally every detail thought out, warm touches evident throughout. The multiple and intimate lobby spaces were unique and spot on.

I also want to say that the breakfast experience was exceptional. The variety, the fabulous service, and especially the creative “smoothie” offerings were innovative and really impressive.

If this is the area of London you wish to stay - you cannot go wrong with The Marylebone!!

I compliment you on a wonderful experience and look forward to my next visit!",5,2013,10,07
123,good location,hotel location is good. 5-10 minutes walk and you are on oxford street. it is also a quite hotel. region is also good. rooms are good but there is chance that your room s vies can be bad. so becarefull about that. when we enter to hotel which we booked 4 rooms; we had to wait around 4-5 hours to enter room. please when you book your room ;learn about all,3,2013,10,07
123,Great Service,"From start to finish we received great service with exceptional attention to detail. We travelled with our grandaughter and it was a lovely surprise for her on return to our room to find a Teddy Bear and other small gifts placed on the bed. We stayed here a number of years ago and liked the hotel and location, there has been a vast improvement in the leisure facilities and the hotel has been refurbished to a high standard. We liked it even more on our return...",5,2013,10,06
123,Weekend stay,"Overall the staff is great. We had some issues with the first bedroom we got and immediately reported it to the night staff. They were not helpful at all, but on the following day the assistant front desk manager was amazing and sorted it out. She gave us an upgrade to an excellent room.
Some of the standard rooms are very small, with small toilets.
The location is great, 2 min walk to Marylebone High St. The amenities are very good.",4,2013,10,06
123,Perfect!,"My daughter and I stayed here for two days, and will never stay anywhere else in London... The staff was incredibly lovely to us at every opportunity.  The room was a bit small, but a jewel box... Every detail was perfect.  ",5,2013,10,06
123,Charming elegance,"My husband & I have just spent a couple of nights at the Marylebone Hotel. We have a very sick relative who is staying in the Harley street Clinic  (which incidentally is a very short walk away). The staff were able to apply some calm to the otherwise stormy experience we would have had if we had stayed anywhere else. The check in was so easy, the staff were friendly and all remembered our names and enquired after our day. The rooms are spacious and smelt beautiful as there are aromatherapy products everywhere including candles burning in the lobby. The decor throughout is elegant but homely but definitely not shabby. The breakfast was a very calm experience and the variety of foods was wonderful. There are quiet little bolt holes all over and of course the fabulous gym/pool area and spa for the more adventurous.  Gunther on reception could not have been more helpful and nothing was too much trouble. I can definitely recommend this hotel and would not hesitate to stay here again.",5,2013,10,06
123,"Fantastic staff, stylish interior, great location: A fabulous hotel!","We travel to London regularly for both business and  pleasure and stayed in different hotels in different areas before. At the end of September 2013, we had the pleasure to stay in The Marylebone Hotel for the first time and we can highly recommand it. The hotel is ideally located  for both sightseeing  and shopping in a quiet street in Marylebone. There are many nice restaurants in the area too. The interior is very stylish with many facets. e.g. the lobby  has different areas from modern design to classic British. Cleaniness: Everywhere! ...but what the Marylebone Hotel really differs from other hotels in London is the quality of the staff. From the moment you enter the hotel (or even in front of the door!) you are surrounded by a friendly and professional team. In particular we would like to point out Nora; her attentiveness, hospitality and commitment truly impressed us.",5,2013,10,04
123,Poorly managed hotel and staff; check-in was a nightmare,"After traveling 15 hours to get to London and arriving at the front desk an hour after the official check-in time, we were told that our room wasn't ready. The woman at the desk took forever on the computer and gave robotic apologies. She told us to wait in the lobby for a half hour and we would be given complimentary tea or coffee. It took 15 minutes for a waiter to ask if we wanted to order something. We told him why we were sitting there and that we had been promised complimentary tea. The tea never came and both servers actually avoided looking our way. After a half hour had passed, I went to the desk to ask for water so I could take a pill. The woman who helped us gave me a small bottle and then turned her back to me. Apparently she had no intention of updating me on my room situation! When pressed she told me that it would be another half hour with no explanation. My husband went to the desk and demanded to see a manager. It was only at this point that a room materialized for us. We have traveled to London and Dublin and stayed at different Doyle Collection hotels on all three trips. We are even members of their club. We have never in all our travels been treated this poorly. They left a bottle of wine in our room, but that did not make us feel any better about our treatment. We don't want amenities to make up for staff and manager incompetence. Get things right from the start. The desk employee should have followed up with us and made sure that tea was brought to us while we waited. We travel to London regularly and we will never stay at the Marylebone again. The Doyle Collection owner needs to reassess their managers and staff training at this hotel. ",1,2013,10,04
123,Excellent service and location,"We stayed here over the last weekend.  Upon arrival in the morning at about 10am, we were told to take a seat on the comfortable sofas behind the lobby and were served with complimentary tea and coffee.  

The room was clean and decorated stylishly plus the air condition was good.  Bathroom was very clean and the Aromatherapy Associates toiletries are fab.   Our only concern was the size of the bedroom and bath but I suppose that this quite typical for central London hotels.  

I have to commend on behaviour of the staff that we met.  All seem very helpful, polite and willing to help.   The breakfast was definitely one of the best that I have had for a long time.  The Ginger Pig sausage tasted great and coffee was good.  Overall, we will be returning here on our next visit and highly recommend this hotel to our friends.",4,2013,10,03
123,Awesome stay,"Im a little late in writing my review but rather late than never! My husband and I had the pleasure of staying at The Marylebone Hotel on 13 August 2013. We had already stayed at a number of hotels in London during our trip and were astonished at the poor service delivery and standard of food we had experienced. The Marylebone stood out - worlds apart from the rest! From the time we checked in and were offered warm hand towels, friendly, helpful reception staff greeted us and attended to our every need. We had arrived early so our room was not yet ready so we met some friends in the bar and enjoy our afternoon and fantastic service. When we did check into our room - we were blown away - amenities that majority of hotels don't offer, cleanliness, attention to detail and a personalized gift from the GM, Frits. You can be very proud of your hotel especially the staff. The food at breakfast was beautifully presented and ever so scrumptious. We will most certainly be back. Regards Robert and Que-Anne Hatton-Jones",5,2013,10,03
123,Fabulous boutique hotel with excellent customer service,"I have stayed at The Marylebone before and returned for a few reasons:
- Location.  Situated on Welbeck street in a lovely neighbourhood, it has loads of nice restaurants and cafes although the hotel bar 108 serves very good food..  Only 5 min walk to Oxford street, New Bond street and Bond Street tube.
- Ambiance - the hotel is tastefully decorated and has lots of nice lounge areas to sit and have a drink/afternoon tea etc making it a cosy and private place to be. There's also a nice bar downstairs that opens onto the street
- Rooms are modern and well equipped albeit slightly small but this is London after all and there are worse hotels with a similar rate!  Small touches such as ipod dock, umbrella, iron, good magazines, robes and slippers is good.  There is a Nespresso machine in the next size up rooms.  There is also a spa and pool which I have not used.
- Standard of food is very good.  I have eaten in the bar downstairs on a few occasions.  The selection and quality is lovely.  Breakfast is great.  Lots to choose from and also supplied gluten free toast. We experienced excellent service at breakfast (sorry didn't get the two waiters names)
- Service is of a high standard.  The staff use your name to address you and they appear to genuinely care about you - from getting out of the taxi to getting back in!  Enrico, the doorman was very pleasant and helpful.  Gunther checked us in and was charming and ensured we had everything we needed.
The bar is nice in the evening and again, service is very good. be mindful service charge is automatically added to your bill.  We ended up leaving a good tip then realising we paid service on top of that.  Not a big deal and our fault.",5,2013,10,02

123,Great Hotel,"My husband and I were recently in London for a few night and had the pleasure of staying at this lovely hotel.  From the moment we walked in the door we were overcome by the hotel's hospitality and beautiful décor.  The staff was very friendly and Frits, the hotel manager upgraded our room to a Junior Suite on the 7th floor.  The room was spacious and the bathroom had not only a bathtub but a walk in marble shower as well.  We were sent wine and hot chocolates all to put the perfect tough on such a great place.  The breakfast in their restaurant was suburb.  This hotel is also in a great location with a short walk to Oxford Street.  I would definitely stay here again and am recommending it to all I know travelling to London!",5,2013,09,30
123,High level of consistency,"I have stayed at The Marylebone many times over the past 3 years and have visited most of the other Doyle Collection hotels in the UK.  The one thing that stands out is the consistency, in terms of comfort and service.  If anything I think service levels have improved over the past 12 months.  Room service menu is certainly improved.  It's always my first choice of stay when in London.  Location couldn't be better.  One small gripe is that I am a platinum member which entitles me to room upgrade when available.  I think I've only benefited once from this once in countless stays.  It would be nice if loyalty was recognised a bit more here.",5,2013,09,29
123,The perfect London hotel,"This hotel is located in the very cosy district of Marylebone in central London. Welbeck Street, were the hotel is located, is a very quite and calm street but only 2-3 minutes walk to Oxford Street. In our opinion this was the perfect hotel to stay at in for our weekend in London due to the fantastic location, nice and clean rooms, amazing breakfast and nice and helpful staff. 
The rooms are kind of small and not with the greatest view but that didn´t bother us when it was so good otherwise. 
The lobby and the breakfast dining room was nice and cosy. 

I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone who wants a cosy and fresh hotel with a good breakfast and walking distance to Londons best streets.",5,2013,09,29
123,"Wow, make sure you stay here","This was such an unexpected pleasure. Everyone we came in contact with was kind and efficient. From the moment we arrived, the experience exceeded our expectations:  the front staff organised an early check into our room  (such a relief after a 23 hour transit),  the turndown service with the bottle of water is a lovely touch, a bowl of apples on the desk as we left for the day is kind and fresh and the bottle of water given to us each day made our strolling more pleasant, not to forget the umbrella if it was raining, great restuarant sugestions.  Have I mentioned the fabulous breakfast??. I must mention that the bathroom while very clean is tiny the shower is a feat in design!  Oh one last thing we casually mentioned it was our 10 year wedding anniversay and a signed card and bottle of sparkling was sent up to our room for our enjoyment. The hotel had a fantastic location - we will be staying again on our next trip to London",5,2013,09,29
123,Superb service  in Central London,"This is currently my hotel of choice in Central London.  The accommodation is good and there are plenty of spaces to hold meetings.
The staff are some of the most helpful and courteous of any hotel worldwide.",5,2013,09,29
123,Nice Stay in London's Best Neighborhood,"I spent seven nights at the Marylebone Hotel for a business trip that I tacked some extra days on to.  I enjoyed my stay and the following are some of the highlights of the hotel.

While the Marylebone Hotel  is not cheap (as is typical for London hotels), they don’t nickel and dime you like a lot of other hotels do.  There is free coffee and pastries in the lobby in the morning, and if you join the Doyle Hotel frequent stay program, there is a turn down service with chocolates and bottled water delivered to your hotel each night.  Most important of all, there is free wireless Internet that is very good.

The service is good and staff is very accommodating and responsive.

The hotel has an excellent fitness center and pool that is free for guests.  I didn’t use it that much because the weather was great, but it is very handy to have, given London’s often gray weather.

Rooms are modern and comfortable, although small.  My room was probably not one of the best in the hotel as it was somewhat dark and faced into an alley. but I was not in the room too often during the day.

While there are not as many electrical outlets as I would have liked, there was one outlet for American plugs by the desk.

The food at the restaurant at breakfast time was good.  I didn’t eat there at other times, but it seems to be busy at dinner time.  Their bar was very lively as well.

The best part of the hotel is the location—right in the heart of Marylebone Village, just off Marylebone High Street.  There are lots of great shops and restaurants nearby.  It is a five-mnute walk to the Bond Street tube station on Oxford Street and a slightly longer walk to the Baker Street tube stop.  If you like to walk, Hyde Park and Regent Park are close by and it is a slightly longer walk to Regent Street and Picadilly Circus.

For me the biggest negative of the hotel was that their shower was difficult to use.  I had a staff member explain it to me but either he did a poor job or I was too tired and jet-lagged to fully understand what he was saying.  Next time I would be more proactive and have it explained to me again by someone else.

Marylebone Village is my favorite neighborhood in London, so I am sure I will return to this hotel on my next trip.",4,2013,09,28
123,Fabulous Concierge,"I just spent 4 nights at The Marylebone Hotel. Rashim Ismail ,the concierge was amazing. Anything we asked for he delivered. He knows the city as well as the back of his hand . Not only is he always pleasant but wants to make your stay so enjoyable by recommending restaurants in your budget, car service to the airport more reasonable than a taxi as well as answering your questions on british sudents school wardrobes.
The hotel was lovely, with small lounge areas throughout the first floor. Tea, a drink or rest and reading make it cozy when you want to quiet your busy schedule.Breakfast and dinner were good with pleasant staff.
My only complaint was that the room was not cool enough for us and it was a warm week in London. This hotel is not near the typical tourist attractions which was nice since you got an idea how residents in Marylebone live. It's a 10 minute walk to the tube. 
Again I felt thankful to have met Rashim and his vast knowledge of this busy city.",5,2013,09,28
123,Out of this world service,"I stayed here for business for 2 nights. To be honest, I was not convinced the first night staying here since it was not as 'pretty' as a previous hotel I'm used to, but my colleague told me I will like it. He was right - although the decor is not trendy, it is still tasteful and rooms are clean. What *really* blew me away was the sincere and warm service from all the staff. From the moment of checking in, which was very easy and fast (and offered a hot, fragrant towel) to the kind bellboys that wanted to make sure I was ok with my luggage, I felt very well taken care of. After a long voyage and arriving tired, it's a relief to not worry and be comfortable.

Some 'quirks': shower didn't drain so I had to stop it and pile on towels on the floor - annoying because i was rushing to get ready! Was fixed immediately; international plug outlet not working, was brought one to my room within minutes which was great!!

(Small) Let-down: not a big deal, but the 'lounge"" ambiance was dull and didn't offer all selections, I.e. Porto wine. Near front entrance so there was no 'cachet' or relaxed feeling although a convenient and comfortable meeting point in the morning or waiting for checkout. Morning complimentary tea/coffee and pastries always nice touch......Again, not a big deal, just me being picky and definitely not a deal-breaker.

Highlight: room cleaning! Omg. All my clothes were folded, hair dryer cord re-wrapped, makeup rearranged neatly and turn down service (little chocolates, slippers, etc) was very nice. I've stayed in many hotels and this was by far the most impressive. Also, bath amenities pretty decent, good shower gel!

Price is reasonable (approx £150/nt) for what you get especially since its in a very good shopping area if that's your thing. Would I stay again? Yes, if the price continues to be this reasonable. I will look forward to seeing the great staff again!
",4,2013,09,28
123,A nice place to stay,"The Marylebone hotel is very well located in Downtown London, walking distance to the very center of the town. Lots of shops, pubs and restaurant are just around the corner. The staff is very friendly and the room I got was nice and quite.",4,2013,09,27
123,Affordable luxury in a fabulous location,"A friend of ours was celebrating his 50th at the Marylebone Hotel so we flew in from the US and stayed here 3 nights on his recommendation.  The location is fantastic - Marylebone has a great village atmosphere with amazing bars and restaurants - and only a 5 minute walk from Oxford Street.  We arrived at the hotel at 11.00 as our plane landed first thing in the morning and the staff let us check in immediately, even though scheduled check in is at 3.00.    We booked a deluxe room as we had been told the superior rooms were quite small.  Our room was an ideal size, very clean and beautifully furnished.  The bathroom was also a good size and had a very contemporary feel to it.  The beds were very comfortable and we did not hear anything from adjoining rooms.
The ground floor of the hotel is full of different areas where you can sit and have a drink or afternoon tea.  Each area is furnished very differently so there's something for everyone, but  they are all equally inviting.

The staff were wonderful throughout - from the wait staff in the restaurant to the reception staff and the concierge.  They were all so helpful , polite and friendly.
The breakfasts were of a very high standard with a huge menu of healthy smoothies and juices and also the traditional English breakfast.  
I would definitely recommend this hotel - for the price, location, general comfort and service I think it's unbeatable.",5,2013,09,26
123,Fantastic,"From the start to the end of our 3 day stay I couldn't fault this hotel. The staff were so friendly and polite and the room we had (493) was perfect. The room was so gorgeous with beautiful fixtures and fittings. We had also requested a bath tub so the bathroom was a very good size and so modern. Fluffy towels and slippers were provided. We were even cheeky and called room service for a bucket of ice as we had bought beer from the local Tesco so just chilled it in the sink - mini bar very expensive, as you would expect. Location fantastic, we walked from Marylebone station and it took about 15 mins, but on leaving took a black cab and that only cost a fiver. 10 mins from Oxford street and so many local bars, restaurants and cafes. The room itself some might say was on the small side but it had everything we needed and for 2 people I would say it was fine, it's not like you spend a lot of time in there anyway. The hotel even had room service deliver a bottle of complimentary champagne, chocolates and a fab cook book as it was my birthday. Would definitely stay here again!",5,2013,09,25
123,How a hotel should be !,"Just returned from a stay at the fantastic Maylebone Hotel.  What`s not to like about this hotel.  On arrival we were met by a very friendly and efficient doorman. Nothing too much bother.  At check in, the reception staff took a genuine interest in our needs and fulfilled our requirements without any fuss.  The hotel décor is immaculate and housekeeping does a great job. The restaurant and bar staff acknowledge you as soon as you appear, the food is of a high quality, and FREE Wi-Fi throughout our stay.  When will other hotels realise that charging £20 per day 
(Hilton On Park Lane) is not on. I now realise why this hotel is so highly rated on Tripadvisor, its the staff that make it.",5,2013,09,25
123,Has gotten better with age.,"I was at this hotel 6 years ago but this hotel has simply gotten better. Obviously it has had a face lift in 6 years but they have recruited the staff to match. Ziby at breakfast was professional and welcoming, the quality of breakfast is superb and everywhere you look in the hotel there are staff ready and willing to help. 
The location is fantastic for shopping, or seeing the sites of london. It is just simply a comfortable, clean and well placed hotel. With all the little extras and attention to detail that surpass all your expectations. ",5,2013,09,24
123,just returned from my 5th stay,"This hotel is very convenient to shopping, restaurants, etc. The staff at arrival very helpful with luggage and check-in. I had a problem turning on my phone, they were able to do it for me. I had to send home a FedEx package, the concierge organized the whole process!
The first room was a little too small, they changed it for me immediately. 
I always enjoy my stay here!",4,2013,09,18
123,Ideal!,"The Marylebone Hotel is a very friendly hotel and right up there for service. Had a wonderful weekend helped a lot by virtue of its location. Has those extra touches like the loan of an umbrella for the rain, succumbing to afternoon tea with delicious cakes, just the treat after a few hours of retail therapy, not to mention the energising morning swim in the spa! Would definitely use this hotel as my London base again.",5,2013,09,18
123,"If you’re a “Little person” you might find the Marylebone Hotel “interesting”, but it is NOT a place for persons of norm","We have traveled to London many times, but wanted to try a new Hotel. We booked The Marylebone Hotel, and requested a “Superior” room. While the plus items for this Hotel are Location, nice finish work in the Décor and Friendly Staff, the negatives in our view really overshadow.  The “Superior” room on the 4th floor facing the street was so small you had to go in the hall to change your mind.  The room had a chair and foot stool, however, with five large bags, you had to line the wall with the bags, place the Stool in the chair, and you still had to walk across the bed to get to the other side of the room.

The Bathroom is yet another amazingly small space.  We were forced to straddle the toilet to open or close the bathroom door (they provided a cut out in the sink counter for this purpose) and getting in and out of the shower when anyone else was in the room, required a feat of disappearing generally reserved for a Las Vegas Magic act.
Breakfast buffet was disappointing, as the menu notes that one may order breakfast from the menu or eat from the buffet.  The bill for my order of Eggs Benedict came moments after the order, and I was asked three times, if I enjoyed my breakfast, with my response being each time that I had not yet had breakfast. After 35 minutes I final received the smallest saddest order of Benedict I have ever seen, and it was cold.  Talk about a long wait for nothing.  What a waste of time and money. (Only 16 pounds.)

Our advice… go somewhere else!",2,2013,09,18
123,An incredible experience!,"Past the fact the the location is extremely close to the little village of Marylebone and the rest of the centre of London , the service is beyond our expectations ! It really made our stay incredibly stress free allowing us to enjoy out trip to the fullest ! Many thanks to the Marylebone team ! We will be coming back very soon ! ",5,2013,09,17
123,Luxurious hotel in prime location.,"We just spent an amazing night at the hotel as we were using the personal shopper in Selfridges and it's only minutes walk away. Every staff member was friendly and courteous and the rooms were so luxurious with the most comfortable beds I have ever slept on! breakfast was amazing too, everything you could possibly ever want! We went to Bar 108 in the evening and it had a lovely warm, cosy atmosphere.",5,2013,09,15
123,Cant Recommend,"Stayed on business this week.
Rate high but i understand its fashion week but cannot excuse overall experience

Un organised at reception area- so many staff but all were too busy to acknowledge my arrival. 

Room small- i know its London but i had to plan in advance my movements in the bathroom to avoid damaging myself. Room smelled like previous guest had been smoking - overall not a great impression on the standard of cleaning in the room. 

I waited almost 10 minutes to order a coffee in the lounge area before i met my colleagues for dinner in the restaurant. Food was ok- very basic menu options, seems the menu was designed for women- lots of salads-  but well priced given the area. Drinks are expensive though. Plenty of wines but no great choice by the glass- Chardonnay was not available by the glass. Service was ok- again plenty of staff but one can see training is lacking here. Manager seemed distracted. However all in it was an acceptable experience.

Breakfast was a pleasant surprise. Much more organised and great choice. Overall lots of potential for this hotel to do better and unfortunately there are better options available in the area.",1,2013,09,15
123,Stylish. Tidy.,"I stay at this hotel frequently. It's well appointed. On a quiet block in a stylish part of West London. It's proximity to great dining options is outstanding. And the neighborhood is positively idyllic. 

But a couple words of advice...

The bathroom (specifically, shower) design is fraught with incongruities, and a blinding example of where style was clearly placed over function. The shower head is too low for anyone over 6 feet in height. Furthermore, the width of the stall is such that ones shoulders can touch the walls on either side (and I am by no means broad shouldered). Unless you're in one of the top tier rooms where the ceiling heights are 2""+, plan on feeling like you're showering in a vertical coffin. 

There is inadequate substrate to prevent water from careening on to the floor, requiring 2-3 towels just to mop up the pooling on the wet tiles. This is both a safety hazard, as well as an environmental embarrassment for a hotel which trumpets its green-ness. 

There's also zero ventilation in the bathrooms, which is non-sensical on every level. 

My room was also adjacent to what seemed to be a housekeeping facility. This meant the adjoining wall to my bed was constantly subjected to the banging and clattering beginning promptly at 5am each morning throughout my stay. I was most disappointed that the staff didn't disclose this as a feature for my room which I was to stay in for nearly a week. This made sleeping off the jet lag an impossibility, and a daily annoyance that - coupled with the shower design flaws (something I've raised with the hotel on a number of occasions) - can breed a prevailing sentiment of disappointment. 

Yet I continue to recommend this hotel - b/c for the money, it's the most stylish, centrally located, well-looked-after hotel in the area.",3,2013,09,13
123,An excellent hotel in London,"A very interesting hotel and location when you are in London. Great breakfast, availability of Taxis, some nice restaurants around Abd within walking distance. 
It is a modern facility that is nicely decorated and well kept. Some key supermarkets and shops around ",5,2013,09,13
123,"A Calm, Sane Hotel With Knowledgeable Staff","We stayed 7 nights in the Marylebone Hotel and found it be a home away from home. There was
no insane hustle & bustle, the staff were always friendly & cheerful. When we returned to the hotel, we were always made welcome by a little friendly chitchat. I would choose to stay in this
hotel again mainly because of the staff, from the doormen to reception, the restaurant to house-
keeping. The sidetable lamp in our room needed to be replaced but I forgot to inform housekeep
ing for a couple of days but one day I came back to the room and found floor supervisor Ms Naa
zik on an inspecion round. Remebering the bulb, I told her about it while switching on the lamp 
at the same time & bulb had been changed as she had noticed problem. Fantastic supervisor!",5,2013,09,13
123,Decent Stay,"Stayed over for 6 nights in Aug 2013 and we were rather impressed with the level of service provided during our stay. From the doorman to the concierge to the reception and housekeeping, their service levels and attitudes definitely helped to make our stay a pleasant one. The hotel spent great effort in the designing of its various lobby rest areas and sitting lounges, big plus point for guests who like to sit around with their coffee and wines. 

We were allocated a room on 2nd floor (250+) and were quite happy with the internal decor. The hotel is located off the main streets, unfortunately the room we had was next to the loading/unloading area. The noises kinda woke us up every morning from 7am onwards. It takes close to 7-8mins to walk to the nearest Bond street station. Can be a long walk if you are lugging shopping bags or groceries back to the hotel. 

We encountered minor issues with the bathroom: the basin, the bathtub and the toilet were not able to displace fluids efficiently. The housekeeping fixed the basin for us, and we subsequently opted not to call them in for the bathtub and toilet, as we did not want too many interruptions during our rest time in the room. So we lived with the constantly ""choked"" bathtub, and the toilet threatened to overflow once, before we managed to flush off on the 3rd attempt. 

The bigger peeve came in the form of the dock lock. I understand this is a feature of the room that probably many guests would not use, but it kind of became our habit. We had difficulties both locking and unlocking the manual door lock. The fact that my partner had to leave the task to me would tell you how tricky it was. On hindsight, we probably should have gotten the staff to rectify the problems while we were away from the room. 

On check-out, the desk manager sensed all was not satisfactory and took down my feedback so thumbs-up for that. He promised a better room for us on our next visit, which was a nice gesture too. I would have rated the hotel lower but for the good level of service displayed.",4,2013,09,13
123,Great Hotel in Great Location,"Visited hotel using ""Secret Escapes"" to secure a fabulous deal.  Facilities, staff, accommodation and location (only 5 minutes walk from Oxford Street/25 minutes from Theatreland) were all excellent.  Breakfast was included and this set us up for a full day of shopping and sightseeing.  Overall can't speak highly enough for this little gem.",5,2013,09,11
123,A lovely & welcoming gem of a hotel - but need to know the packages they offer.,"After weeks of deciding what hotel to book as a surprise for my boyfriend’s birthday, i decided on The Marylebone Hotel.  It had great reviews, looked lovely in the pictures and was in the perfect location for our weekend away but the deciding factor was the package that’s offered on the hotels website.

I booked the ‘Leisurely London’ package which included a nights stay, full English breakfast, 3pm late checkout and £10 food/beverage credit at the hotel. This was perfect as we had a gorgeous place to stay that night and with the late checkout it meant we were able to enjoy the hotels facilities – the swimming pool and sauna the following day before leaving.

On making my reservation I was thrilled that the hotel could arrange a little surprise birthday treat in our room upon arrival which involved a ‘happy birthday’ inscribed plate of cakes, a bottle of bubbly and birthday card!- which was actually addressed to myself and not my boyfriend which did make us chuckle but it was a lovely thought and thoroughly  enjoyed – thank you very much for that.
There was a bit of confusion when making the reservation as my confirmation mail had all the wrong information on it – i.e. details of the package… the price etc..   I contacted the email on the page which was the concierge but they were unaware of the details of the package I had booked and so was forwarded onto the reservations team who did respond quickly and confirmed the correct details of the booking.

The hotel and the staff were all amazing – very warm, welcoming and helpful- cannot fault any of that. We even got to enjoy a couple of cocktails that we fancied at the hotel bar that were not on the menu which just goes to show how great the service is there.

The room itself was also nice (I think it was a standard double) – the bathroom was a little bit on the small side but we managed and it was fine – all very clean and presentable and we even had a turn down service in the evening which was lovely to come back to in the evening after being out and about in town. Sleeping was fine - although im not too sure our air conditioning system was working as the room failed to get any cooler despite being on a very, very low setting.
Breakfast the following morning was superb!  Very tasty, yummy and filling! We decided to have it up in the bedroom and yet again the gentleman who brought it up – lovely and cheerful. The hotel facilities (swimming pool/sauna) were very pleasant and clean and I liked the idea of the separate elevator for hotel guests to access it by which meant you avoided going through the main part of the hotel.

All in all I do recommend this hotel to anyone who is looking for a place to stay in town – its close to the centre without being bang in the middle of all the noise , hustle and bustle. Its great for a treat and weekend away with loved ones. The reception and all downstairs/ common rooms etc have a very luxurious quirky look to them which we enjoyed exploring.

My only criticisms come from the lack of awareness on the packages that the hotel offers – this comes from having a knock at our bedroom door at 2pm wanting to come in and service the room despite having the ‘do not disturb sign’ on and our checkout time was at 3pm.
Also when checking out I got distracted by a charge on our bill that was an actual mistake but I then failed to notice that our £10.00 credit was not deducted off the beverages that we had ordered at the hotel bar – being as part of the package I thought that would have been automatically noted? Or deducted? 
I did send an email the next day to the hotel just to bring this sort of thing to their attention  and also on the other hand to thank them for making our stay enjoyable but I have yet to hear back which has surprised me seeing as I had  super fast responses when making the booking.

In short - great hotel – would recommend and would possibly stay again but maybe in one of the bigger rooms :) BUT…. Make sure you check your bill and details properly before leaving!",4,2013,09,10
123,Simply the best.....,"We have stayed here on a number of occasions.
It is a beautiful boutique hotel on the edge of the lovely Marylebone Village.
Friendly courteous staff within the hotel who really couldn't do enough for you,the rooms are furnished in high taste and they are spotlessly clean.
Spa area is relaxing and peaceful,just what you need after a busy day shopping or exploring London.
We stayed there 7/9/2013 for our 5th wedding anniversary and a handwritten personal card was in our room with chocolates and prosecco,a nice touch.
Dinner at 108 Marylebone is fabulous,scallops and steak to die for,washed down with Moët and attentive friendly staff it was perfect.

123,Perfect hotel for a city trip! Good value for money!,"We spent 3 nights at the Marylebone Hotel. Upon arrival we were informed that the room we booked was not available, but they upgraded the room and added breakfast for us. The staff were very friendly, the rooms clean and nice and the breakfast was definitely a highlight, especially the eggs benedict. The location was more than perfect, 1 minute to Marylebone High Street and 5 minutes to Oxford Street. We will definitley book this hotel again!",5,2013,09,10
123,"Wonderful, luxurious, attentive & a very inviting place to stay","Very well appointed and fitted out hotel. Lovely decor and finishing touches, throughout the hotel, common areas, and rooms. 

From the word go, the staff were extremely friendly and attentive. When I arrived I believe there was a wedding party/large group trying to check out so it was quite busy and noisy in the lobby, but I was graciously greeted by the Concierge/Manager whom was very apologetic about what was happening in the Lobby, he kindly offered me some refreshments, hot towels and a newspaper whilst I waited. 

There are several sitting areas throughout the lobby/common areas of the hotel, I believe they served high tea in the lounge situated behind the lobby, in cosy wing backed chairs and comfy couches along with pretty centrepieces and fireplace. Along a long corridor (& a few turns), adorned with gorgeous pieces of art you found yourself at 108, a nice loungey/bar along with a divided restaurant - which I later found out was an ""It"" place, according to my London-finance-friend.

The pool/fitness and spa centre was excellent, huge indoor heated pool with scented steam-room and a proper state-of-the-art gym (which is actually a paid membership gym the hotel shares access with), classes even available. The spa was lovely, great treatments and not too expensive considering - they were happy to fit me in at the last minute which was also great.

I only stayed in a deluxe room (as I was there for almost 2 weeks) but it was very pleasant and comfortable. As mentioned, it was beautifully decorated and had only the best finishes and fine details attended to. The bathroom was also lovely, great double shower and the best smelling aromatherapy toiletries, along with a more than ample number of king sized fluffy towels and robes. 

The bed was incredibly comfortable, and the turn down service was a lovely touch too!

The high street is not far and has some great cafes, restaurants and higher-end shops. Theres a waitrose and tescos not far away either. Bond St tube station is a short stroll which also leads you to the shopping mecca of central london. I personally think it was a great location because you felt a little removed from the chaos but only a short walk in either direction saw you on a ""champagne and tea cakes brunch"" in your oversized sunglasses and displaying the latest purchases for all to see, and in the other direction saw you shopping until you dropped or hitting the tourist beat.

I really enjoyed my stay, it was probably one of the highlights of my London stay - I will most definitely be opting to stay here when I come back to London next time.",5,2013,09,09
123,Fantastic!,"The Marylebone Hotel is a fantastic hotel in a superb location, just a short 5 minute walk to Oxford Street. The araff are very helpful, the room immaculate and excellent gym and spa facilities. Highly recommend! Will definitely stay here again.",5,2013,09,09
123,"Wow, what a place!","We loved everything about this hotel. Great location, near excellent restaurants. We absolutely loved their gym and used it 3 of 4 days. Comfortable room, good restaurant / bar for after dinner drinks. Quick trip down the road to Regent's park, a great little Tapas place (Fat of the Land) or shopping on Oxford St. We travel frequently and rarely this impressed!",5,2013,09,08
123,Good hotel,I booked this as part of a weekend in London for my husband's birthday and picked this hotel because of the location and reviews. It did not disappoint at all. We had a superior room which did have a small bathroom as others have written but it was perfectly functional and the room was very clean. The staff were friendly and helpful. I had told them that the stay was for my husbands birthday and when we got to our room we had a plate of small cakes with happy birthday written in chocolate. We were also given a chilled bottle of prosecco which was a lovely surprise and much appreciated. I would definitely recommend this hotel and I am sure we will return. ,4,2013,09,08
123,Superb service,"I just stayed at the Marylebone for two nights. Rooms are small but make good use of the space. Bathroom was nicely decorated and had great toiletries but was really small and compact. Free wi-fi is a major plus.

You receive superb service from the minute you walk in. The front desk staff is top notch. They were all professional, pleasant,  helpful and provided exceptional service. Thanks to Brendan at the front desk for assisting with a room change. Concierge desk was fantastic. Rahim was always extremely helpful and had great suggestions. The bellmen were all prompt and courteous.

Hotel is in a great quiet neighborhood. The area feels more local than touristy. Hotel is near shops, bars, restaurants and Regent Park. Its about a 5 minute walk to Bond street tube station and Oxford street.",5,2013,09,07
123,"Boutique Feel, Fabulous Location, Attentive Staff","When I come to London for work, I always want to stay at the Marylebone. The location is amazing, and the hotel has a boutique feel to it, even though its quite large and has everything you need, including a great gym and pool. The staff are really helpful, and if there is ever a problem, the staff just want to fix it right away. I recommend it whether you are a couple, or friends away for a weekend, or in London on business. The Internet is really fast, and the food is great. The scallops are yum, and they cook a steak to perfection. There's a large range of rooms, some are bigger than others, but by London standards, even the smaller of the rooms are spacious. There's an outside area with seats when the weather is good, which is great if you are a smoker, as its a non smoking hotel, so none of that stale smell in the corridors. I've nothing bad to say about this hotel, there are not buts.",5,2013,09,07
123,"Quiet rooms, great location, outstanding staff","My wife and I planned the trip of a lifetime - 9 days in London - and the Marylebone Hotel provided the perfect home base for our stay.  When we arrived, it turned out that Delta Vacations had never notified the Marylebone of our prepaid reservations!  The staff couldn't have been more helpful - serving us tea and cookies and immediately getting on the phone to straighten things out with Delta.  Later in the week, the manager even sent a small fruit basket to our room, apologizing for the problem - which wasn't even their fault!  Rafael - at the Concierge desk - was especially helpful all week long - as were the other concierge staffers as well.  Brandon, behind the reservation desk - was also very kind - especially the day of our check in when things started out crazy.  The bellmen at the door were kind and prompt - one young man stood out especially but I can't remember his name!!  He was tall, wore glasses I think, and we exchanged conversation about life and philosophy and books - an engaging young man who obviously took his job very personally.  The ""continental"" breakfast was complimentary and absolutely amazing.  Who needs ""hot food"" when one has juices and pastries and cheeses and varieties of healthy cereals and cold meats and eggs and jams and...well, we walked out into our day absolutely so filled and satisfied that often we didn't eat much again till the evening meal!  The staff at breakfast were also very professional and kind - as were the staff in the bar where we had drinks once or twice during the week, late in the evening.  There are many restaurants nearby - yet the location of the Marylebone was a quiet one - it was a neighborhood where at night, folks really did go to bed.  The Bond Street tube station was a 10 minute walk away - and Oxford street - a great shopping street that intersects down the road with Regent Street? - one of the busiest shopping streets in the world was a more distant walk but in the vicinity.  Yet, again, when we got back to the Marylebone each night...the neighborhood was separate enough from the shopping districts that it felt very, very quiet...and we enjoyed good sleep every night of our trip.  The Marylebone was expensive like most London hotels, by American standards, but I found that the room we had [a superior room, I think] was large by European standards and contained all the amenities we were looking for.  My wife and I have already determined that if we ever are fortunate enough to make it back to London, we would stay at the Marylebone again - without a doubt.  Thanks again to all the staff that helped make our week so deeply enjoyable.",5,2013,09,06
123,"Excellent service, great location, fast internet","This is definitely my place to stay in London. The service is truly distinctive and attentive, no forced smiles but warmth coupled by brisk efficiency. The time there was something wrong with my reservation (because of an agency mishap) the problem was solved swiftly and attentively. The location is superb: it is on a quiet street but literally two minutes away from Oxford street. The health club is very nice with a good indoor pool, not an easy find in London. Finally, the internet is fast and the all place is kept very clean. Bottom line: the place to stay in London for both business and pleasure.",5,2013,09,06
123,Marvelous Marylebone,"We stayed at The Marylebone Hotel from the Sunday the 25th until Wednesday the 28th of September (part holiday and part 'Treat' for our Niece's 21st Birthday). We had a wonderful time in and around the area and the hotel is well within walking distance of central London, especially the better shopping areas. The Hotel is a credit to the all of the staff who work there. Everyone was very professional and clearly enthusiastic to deliver good service. We had a bit of a hiccup on the Monday morning regarding  an agonisingly slow breakfast, however this was more than compensated for by the staff the following day. Very kind! Great food and a really nice Cocktail Bar ('The 108') which overlooked Marylebone Lane. Our rooms were very plush, extremely comfortable and boasted all we could have wished for. The ""Free"" Wi-Fi was fast, which allowed me to keep tabs on business whilst away. All of the staff were keen, polite and extremely professional. A BIG THANK YOU to everyone who looked after us so well. We'll definitely be back. We've definitely been ""Assimilated"" into the Doyle Collective!",5,2013,09,06
123,Wonderful Service,We stayed at the hotel with 3 teenage grandchildren august 2013.The service was excellent.The front desk very helpful. There was an error in room assignments that was corrected by manager Mark Heyburn in a most efficient manner. I will definately recommend warmly. Beds a little on the soft side. Children under 18 can use the pool only between 3;30 and 5:00 which was a disappointment.,5,2013,09,06
123,Exemplary service plus,"Modern rooms, comfortable beds and free hi speed Wifi. We were able to Facetime our family from our Ipad in the room. 
It is on a quiet street that is a short walk from restaurants, stores and The Wallace collection.
Two doormen open doors and track down taxi's.
We were very pleased with the hotel but choose to breakfast on Marylebone High Street which is one block away.",5,2013,09,05
123,A fantastic hotel experience,"Booked 2 rooms for 1st & 2nd Sept. My daughter came to London with my wife & I for some serious retail therapy....I carried the bags. We got smiles, attention and 5* service for the entire break. We did not stay at this hotel before but will definitely be back. It really is that good.",5,2013,09,04
123,Outstanding,"We stayed here for 2 nights to celebrate my birthday. From the moment we arrived we were made to feel special and were really looked after. Our suite was perfect, exceeded expectations. All staff were extremely helpful and nothing was too much trouble. We had room service and both drinks (especially Marilyn Monroe cocktails)  and food were fantastic, we also ate in the the restaurant and I can honestly say it was the best fish I have ever eaten. A huge thank you to Mark and all staff for making it the most memorable weekend break and best birthday ever. We are already planning our next stay at The Marylebone Hotel.",5,2013,09,04
123,Always a fantastic stay!,"This was my third time staying at The Marylebone Hotel, so I thought it was about time I wrote a review.

Granted it's expensive to stay here, but I love it, the service is always friendly and welcoming, the rooms are small but fully equipped and clean, perfect location for shopping, sight seeing and eating, plus a car park and cool bars nearby and check out is at noon so you can have an extra lie in at no extra cost!! :-)

One of the main reasons I return to this hotel is the fact that guests have free access to the gym, classes and the pool, I love this extra about the hotel. 

I am sure I will be booking a room again there in the near future. Enjoy your stay.",5,2013,09,04
123,Absolutely fabulous!,"We arrived very late at about 10.30pm, after our plane was delayed by 12 hours. The reception staff were very understanding and friendly. Just a short walk away, we went out for a late supper and sat out at local restaurant. Divine! Back for a long hot shower. Great bathroom with lovely aromatherapy products and a good night's sleep. The room was lovely. Hit the gym which was well equipped and frequented by locals. Breakfast was sublime. The staff could not do enough and easily catered for us being wheat intolerant. The decaff coffee was truly excellent. The staff couldn't do more for us and made our stay truly fabulous. A short walk to Oxford Street. Just sorry that we couldn't get in again on 30 and 31 August as the hotel was fully booked. Highly recommended and we can't wait to return!",5,2013,09,03
123,"Pretty good, service a bit slow","Overall its good, nice feel to it, very mellow surroundings, room was good and its in a great location but views not all that although thats not the hotels fault, just dont bother looking out the window. Some of the little things missing from it. Service was slow even though it was quiet, ordered a paper that didn't come until I chased it up but I'd nipped out an bought one by then, check in and out was a bit clunky but all hotels seem to suffer from this but nice staff and apart from the paper (which I'm probably being picky about) they were quick to sort things. food was great. I've stayed in others in the group in Bristol and Dublin which is why we chose it and I'd definitely go back",4,2013,09,02
123,Fantastic Birthday Treat! M&T (LUFC!),Thank you very much to my friend (T) for booking this hotel for my birthday weekend! We stayed here for 2 nights early August to visit the V&A and to see West End Show. As soon we stepped into the hotel we were met with smiles and genuine courtesy and eagerness to please - from check-in to check-out the staff were wonderful!  Also a BIG THANK YOU to the hotel Manager Frits for the lovely & totally unexpected birthday surprises!  A very memorable stay - great location and excellent facilities.... I will definitely be returning to this hotel in the near future! Apologies for late review!!!,5,2013,09,02
123,Consistantly Great !!!,"My family and I stay at this hotel regularly ,it's in a perfect spot and has a car park at the end of the road .

Great to have a swim before breakfast. 

My only quibble is that the beds are very soft !!!

All staff are great. ",5,2013,09,02
123,Great Service and staff,"What amazing staff especially Gunther on main reception extremely helpful very thoughtful and service 5 star .. Rooms great , swimming pool cleAn and lovely full English breakfast .. Great location too for all the London sights and shops .. Would stay again",5,2013,09,01
123,Thank you for a delightful weekend!,"The Marylebone Hotel is situated in Marylebone area of London. It is an upmarket and vibrant area in Central London. To the north, is Marylebone Road, to the east is Edgware Road, south is Oxford Street, and the west is Regents Street. The walk from the east to the west is between 25-35 minutes and from north to south of area should be around 15 minutes. The Marylebone hotel is bang in the middle. 

The Marylebone high street is less than 200 hundred yards at the back of the hotel. The immediate area around the hotel is full of activity with cafes and restaurants. If you walk 4 minutes southwards, you reach St James street and St Christophers' Place. Both are known for their restaurants that cater for different tastes.

For tourists, Marylebone is one of the loveliest ares of London. The hotels and food are more expensive than the average London hotel or restaurant. But you do tend to get better quality.
The area is known for its touristic appeal. The Madame Tussaud museum is less than 15 minutes walk from the Marylebone Hotel. You can reach Oxford Street and Selfridges in about 10 minutes.The Wallace Collection is westward and can be reached in 10 minutes walk from hotel. The area is also known for medical establishments and clinics most notably, Harley Street.

For those who are not familiar with the UK calendar, the last Monday of the month of August coincides with a public holiday. The Notting Hill Gate Carnival is held during that weekend.

My family and I spent the bank holiday weekend at this hotel. It was a special occasion and my daughters wanted to attend the carnival. So I booked two suites; the junior suite for my two daughters, and the luxury suite for my wife and I. I emailed the hotel in advance on the reasons for our visit. The hotel's reservation and marketing managers applied promptly with suggestions on how to make the trip worthwhile. 

We were not disappointed. From the moment we arrived till we left, we felt pampered to the extreme. the check-in was swift, and the concierge was very helpful. Our bedroom and bathroom were filled with flower petals. A flower boquet gave a wonderful smell to the living area of our suite.

My daughters suites was equally beautiful but smaller. They had a problems with a bathroom light, so the staff at front desk immediately arranged for them to stay overnight in a different room. The concierge assisted in moving some of their items. The problem was fixed the very next morning and they were back.

The weather was typically British, i.e a bit of rain and a bit of sunshine. My wife had an appointment at the Spa. She tells me that she thoroughly enjoyed it. My daughters went to one of the local hairdressers.

Back to the Marylebone Hotel. We did not eat at 108, its restaurant but it is recommended on TripAdvisor. However, the breakfast is fabulous. There is a large selection of hot and cold food. The food is fresh and cooked to your liking.

I really can't find anything bad to say about this hotel. The staff are helpful, the services is brilliant, and its location is central. It is a bit expensive but you get back every cent of your money, trust me!!",5,2013,08,30
123,Great Experience - Highly Recommended,"From the moment we arrived at the Hotel Marylebone we knew we were in for a wonderful experience.  The staff was superb - friendly, helpful, knowledgeable and professional.  The concierge went to extra lengths to help us with restaurant and theater reservations.  The hotel itself is beautifully appointed and maintained.  Our room was spacious and inviting.  We ate only lunch at the hotel restaurant.  It was very good.  Highly recommended.",5,2013,08,30
123,Would give it 5 star,"Very beautiful hotel in a perfect location. Just 5 min away from oxford street. We had 3 rooms. Avoid staying on the construction side as you'll be up very early due to the noise from outside.
Rooms sizes are big. Reception staff and bell boys are of top standard. Special thank you to Tatiana for her top notch service and her reaction towards our complaints.
The complain was on the housekeeping. Where they didn't clean the rooms thoroughly nor did they provide clean towels. Towels provided were dirty.
Overall love the stay, and definitely coming back.",4,2013,08,30
123,Great hotel,"Just returned from a lovely night at the Marylebone. Booked last minute via hotel website so got a very good deal. 

Room was great, very luxurious and had a great nights sleep. Very comfy bed and nice and quiet. Room service was very good, quick and the food was excellent. Only one downside was the lack of pay movies, just the standard digital channels. 

Staff were very friendly and welcoming, liked the hot towels on arrival!

Breakfast was great, massive choice and the best continental buffet we have ever seen. 

Will be back next time we are in the area. ",4,2013,08,29
123,Perfect for a special night in town,"The Marylebone Hotel was the perfect place to spend a night  for newlyweds. Staff were brilliant and made every effort to upgrade us to a studio room, and we were thrilled to find a complimentary bottle of bubbly and a congrats card on our return. The room was spotless and amenities excellent. Breakfast was delicious and varied and the bar/cafe very chic. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a chic and perfectly located hotel in London.",5,2013,08,29
123,Excellent & Outstanding,"My husband and I have just returned from our second stay at The Marylebone Hotel this year – and again, how wonderful it was.  A big and special thank you to Rahim, also the team for taking care of us so well, you really made our holiday unforgettable. 
  
The rooms are spotlessly clean and beds very comfortable.  The friendly staff are always on hand to help with anything you need, nothing is too much trouble for them. 
  
We can’t wait to come back, yet again,  and would highly recommend The Marylebone to anyone visiting London – it is a 5 minute walk to the wonderful shopping of Oxford Street and St Christopher’s Place for restaurants galore, whilst also  being in the lovely safe haven of Marylebone.  A one minute walk to the shops and cafes of Marylebone High Street, but still in a quiet enough street where you wouldn't realise you were so central - fantastic.",5,2013,08,28
123,"Luxurious, helpful, quiet, nicely located, wheelchair friendly","I selected this hotel after our previous wheelchair hotel near Oxford Street went into a steady decline.  Walked the neighborhood visiting various properties and viewing wheelchair accommodations.

Our handicapped room had a large roll-in shower, was quite spacious, and met all our needs.  Only wish they would replace the carpet with a laminate or wooden floor to make rolling around the room easier.

This is a luxury hotel, with mostly a business clientele.  Staff was quite helpful and welcoming - and several remarked that they would prefer having more family groups staying.

Spotless.  While close to Oxford and Regent Streets, Welbeck Street is a quiet one-way side street with no traffic noise.  The surrounding area includes a number of restaurants, and a Tesco supermarket.  While the hotel fridge has an automatic electronic billing system when you remove items to place your own inside, the front desk is happy to void those non-purchases.  Remember to ask!  

Look forward to future stays while in London.",5,2013,08,28
123,"Excellent hotel, fantastic location","My husband and I stayed here for one night and will definitely be going back. We had a standard room, which although small, was perfect for one night and was finished to a fantastic standard. The location is excellent, 5 minutes walk from Oxford Street and the nearest tube station but set in quiet area so there were no problems at night with traffic. The staff provided an excellent standard of service and were very friendly. We had the continental breakfast and the quality of the food was brilliant, one of the best continental breakfasts I've had at a hotel. We will definitely be going back.",5,2013,08,27
123,Completely wonderful,"We stayed at the hotel on the night of our wedding and cannot praise the staff and hotel enough. 
The room was fabulous and the staff could not have been for helpful and attentive. Our guests, who were not staying at the hotel, were made to feel extremely welcome when they gathered for pre wedding drinks. The location is incredibly convenient for Marylebone and shopping in the west end.",5,2013,08,27
123,Brilliant hotel and staff are the best,A wonderful stay recently at The Marylebone Hotel.  This was a special treat for my husbands birthday and we were not disappointed.  It was one of the smartest hotels we have stayed in while in London and the staff are unbelievably nice and incredibly helpful.  I would definite visit again...I hope it's soon.,5,2013,08,27
123,Lovely,"Everything you'd expect from a 5 star hotel - great service, great food, quiet, beautiful decor (it's recently renovated), the location couldn't be better, the bed is super comfy and there is fast internet and good TV service.  Didn't try the spa/gym/pool but looked great.  Only downside is the room is a bit small at the lowest price level - but reasonable for London standards.",4,2013,08,27
123,Exceptional kindness and service,"My nephew and I stayed at this hotel on 3rd August as he had a function to go to in North London.  Unforutnately, on his way back to the hotel he was mugged.  The experience was traumatic for everyone concerned but the dreadful incident was considerably lessened by the understanding displayed to us by the staff in the hotel.  Everyone was so discreet and accommodating with everything we had to go through.  We were even given an extra nights accomodation at a greatly reduced rate.

I must particularly mention both Richard and Emmanuel who were kindness itself and a credit to this hotel and it's management. 

Suffice to say that having stayed in many hotels in London over the years, it would now never occur to me to stay anywhere else!",5,2013,08,27
123,Perfect place no question,"Yes, you pay to get a new room. But remember, most of the times you pay a lot and get average place. Here you get the best. Best service, people who are ready to listen and help, all team shows all day long ambition to help. Breakfast is good (I would wish it will have some cahnges in meno for peopl,e who stay few days)
Location is superb. My aircondition was noisi but again this is a small issue. Do not hesitate just come/ But leave me some room for my next visit !",5,2013,08,27
123,A lovely place to unwind,"My husband and I stayed for 6 nights, the room was great, bathroom a tad small but beautiful anyway, service and cleaniness couldn't fault, great location, couple a minutes walk to Oxford Street and metro. Didn't get chance to use gym or pool but from the look of it was well presented. I had my 60th birthday whilst staying there and they brought out a lovely plate wishing me happy birthday, and I felt thoroughly spoilt. All staff were exceptional.",5,2013,08,27
123,"Perfect hotel, great location","Stayed here for my birthday and due to family commitments had to cut short our week in London.
The staff were very helpfull and issued a full refund for the days we didn't stay.
Room was first class and very clean, breakfast very good also.
",5,2013,08,26
123,Brilliant hotel.,"My partner and I stayed at The Marylebone Hotel this weekend for ny birthday. We could not speak highly enough for this hotel, it was immaculate all the way through the hotel, our room was spotless, and although it was compact it was perfect with everything you need. We had a swim and the pool and gym area are fantastic. 
All the staff that we saw were extremely polite, and couldnt do enough for us, hot towels on arrival and cold water for our journey when we checked out. 
The food was also great.
Also a final little touch that was very thoughtfull was that we had a knock on our room door with a member of staff wishing me a happy birthday with a lovely chocolate cake and an ice bucket with a chilling bottle of processo and two glasses and a hand written birthday card. 
We will, without a doubt be coming to stay again.",5,2013,08,26
123,"Great location, great rooms...",I loved the hotel. It's so different compared to other hotels I've stayed in London. The surroundings are peaceful eventhough you're only couple minutes walk away from Oxford Street. Our room was nice and spacious. Overall the visit was excellent!,5,2013,08,26
123,The place to stay in London,"We had the great pleasure to stay here for week in August. We couldn't have had a better experience. The staff provided a warm welcome, the rooms were spotless and fully equipped, the public rooms provided a comfortable haven of peace and the spa/ gym facilities were world class. This is my home in London from now on. The location is a quiet area behind Oxford St but full of great dining establishments. Kudos to my favorite doorman Immanuel who remembered my name three days after my arrival having not seen him in the intervening person. This is great service.",5,2013,08,26
123,SharonH,"Excellent !  The hotel is gorgeous -   but more importantly the staff were fantastic,  friendly, organised and all smile !! I took my daughter for her birthday (a lovely gesture was given from the hotel ) it was just the two of us and we loved it. We are already
 planning to come again ! Hotel is spotless, food good and spa well worth making time to do.",5,2013,08,25
123,Great hotel,"The hotel is lovely. The lobby and adjoining sitting rooms are beautifully decorated. It is in a great location near restaurants, small shops and interesting architecture. The staff were wonderful (all of them - reception, cleaning and maintenance). There is an adjoining health club which can be used by guests (clean and fully equipped). The room was not large but was comfortable enough (for the two of us).  The bathroom was clean and well designed, but a bit too small if two people wanted to fit in at the same time. The refrigerator was locked on entering the room and it took a little too long for them to unlock it. We ate dinner in many of the surrounding restaurants and then discovered on our last night that the the best food in the area was in the hotel restaurant and bar, and it was the most comfortable restaurant as well. The price of breakfast was high (double the price offered by nearby restaurants) so we did not eat breakfast there. All in all, it was a great find and we would definitely go back.",5,2013,08,25
123,Lovely hotel!,"The exterior isn't particularly attractive but the interior is beautiful.  The staff where really helpful and friendly, especially Gunter at reception. We booked through Great Escapes and got a free upgrade to a suite. The room itself was great and really quiet.  The hotel is a really short walk from Oxford Circus and convenient for the tube.  Would definitely stay again.",5,2013,08,25
123,Fabulous Hotel!,"We booked this hotel to stay in for our wedding night as it was conveniently located to The Old Marylebone Town Hall where our wedding took place.

The staff at the hotel went out of there way to help make our day special.  We had requested an early check-in which was granted despite the hotel having been very full the previous night - and we were even upgraded to a suite complimentary.

The kindness of the staff didn't stop there, after we had returned from our wedding ceremony, we were in our room when there was a knock on the door - the hotel had given us a lovely bottle of champagne (again complimentary!) to congratulate us - what a lovely and thoughtful touch.

We chose to have our wedding dinner at a restaurant in Marble Arch which is only a short taxi ride away and when we returned back to our bedroom at the end of the evening, we opened the bedroom door to another surprise - fresh rose petals had been scattered all over our bedroom, over the bed and bathroom - it looked so pretty!

The thoughtfulness and attention to detail that we received from the moment we walked through the hotel door was second to none - and it certainly helped to make our special day a day to remember!

Heartfelt thanks to all at the Marylebone Hotel, we will certainly be back and we will without hesitation recommend the hotel.",5,2013,08,25
123,Flawless Service in a Great Location,"We chose the Marylebone Hotel based on the value and location of the hotel and were not disappointed. From the moment we walked into the hotel, the service was impeccable. Everyone was helpful, friendly and the room was quiet and well-appointed for our trip. The Concierge Rahim, was the best! He heard what we wanted to do and had terrific suggestions for those sites and other tidbits that made our entire London adventure delightful. I wouldn't hesitate to stay again and recommend this hotel to my friends. ",5,2013,08,25
123,Would stay here again,Wonderful service and comfort in an excellent location. Bar and restaurant had great food and relaxed atmosphere. We Really enjoyed the breakfast choices.Lobby and seating downstairs well arranged for relaxing and meeting friends. Staff very friendly and helpful.,5,2013,08,25
123,Elaine64,"This was our first ever stay in London so we didn't know what to expect hotel wise
The Marylebone Hotel blew us away could not have wished for more.
The staff were polite and so helpful , the food was fantastic both dinner and breakfast
Only wish we could have stayed longer to have enjoyed the pool and spa which looked so tempting . But we only stayed one night and being in the very hart of London we had so much to try and fit in. Would love to return and enjoy more of the hotels facilities 
Thank you for a much needed and enjoyed break",5,2013,08,24
123,Nice hotel and room but the bathroom and roomservice-price is a joke!,"I stayed in a superior room with double bed for 2 nights. Very friendly check-in but it took a long time I think. After a while I got my key and got up to my room. I think the room was nice with nice design furniture but what the h... is a pink chair doing in my room? I can't see that it fits in this room. Same goes for the light behind it.

A joke?:
When I saw my bathroom for the first time I think it was a joke. Supertiny and I hardly fit in it! Had to go out to think. To make my stay as comfortable as possible when I am on a trip I need a bathroom that I can go into and use without any difficulties. With this I don't. It's crazy small and maybe the smallest in London? I bet it is. It's anoyingly small!

I ordered roomservice: steak sandwich, onionsrings, mash, salad and egg custard tart with ice cream. It was good (not tart) but not worth the price. £30.38!! (see pic). But the worst was the tart. This had to be factorymade. It tasted ""made long time ago"". This is not good Marylebone Hotel!

(+):
*Good location, short walk to shopping and restaurants 
*nice room, nice design.....but.....
*staff 
*very good bed
*internet included in prize
*fast check out

(-):
*Superdupertiny bathroom 
*tv too high up on the wall 
*small windows 
*crazy roomservice price (steaksandwich, a few onionrings, small salad, mashed potatoes and custard tart was £30.38!! see picture) 
*custard tart was not good 
*expensive room
*reading light (bed) 
*ceiling decor
*long check in time
*......awful pink chair and the light behind it (see pic.)",3,2013,08,23
123,enjoyed stay in london,"we enjoyed our stay in the hotel because of the generosity and excellent service from the staffs, they are very helpful. My only concern was, the rooms were very small and you can hear  voices when you're in the room when someone is passing by because lobby is too narrow. we were not comfortable in the first two nights because the carpet of the room was wet till we asked for other room.
      ",4,2013,08,23
123,Best price/benefit,"The service, the rooms, the location. Everything so good! Very above my expectations for the price. I just hope I'll always have room available for me every time I come to London. The hotel lounge is huge and we can wait comfortably while the room is being prepared.
Thanks Marylebone staff!",5,2013,08,22
123,Fantastic Hotel,"Great hotel, nice designer rooms in a traditional English setting. Superb service and attention to all the finer detail. Perfect location for the West End shopping and entertainment scene ...will be back so long as they don't get carried away with their rates!!",5,2013,08,21
123,Great location,"My friend and I stayed here for a girly catchup midweek. The location is about a 5 min walk from Bond Street underground station and Oxford Street, so fabulous.

The hotel is very nicely furnished in the lounge areas, of which there are several nice areas on the ground floor. We stayed in a deluxe room, which was a reasonable size, with an excellent amount of storage space in both the bedroom and bathroom, so good if you are staying several days. The room had a coffee machine and tea making facilities. Toiletries in the bathroom were of good quality.

The selection at breakfast was excellent. Something for everyone.

I would stay at this hotel again, particularly if part of a special offer, as this trip was. I wouldn't hesitate in recommending it, both for it's great location and service.",5,2013,08,20
123,Consistently Excellent Service,I have stayed at the Marylebone Hotel a numer of times over the past year. The service from the staff in all the teams is always consistently high and you get a warm welcome on arrival. My  rooms and bathrooms have always been spotless and any specific requests that I may have are always provided promptly. The breakfast is top notch and a good starter to the day ahead. The Gym and swimming pool are excellentfor that bit of much needed exercise,5,2013,08,20
123,Mammy standard,Like being mollycoddled by your mother after a long time away . A breakfast selection that's shames most hotels and I have seen my fair share in my job over 41 countries . Staff top class . Excellent Location in London a short tube trip to most of the sights ,5,2013,08,20
123,Walking Distance to Oxford Street,"This hotel is very close to Oxford Street (Bond Street is the nearest Tube Station).  Once I was just took a short walk I ended up in Debenhams.  This hotel is recommended for people who love to shop and wants a short trip back to the hotel.  However, you need to walk going to places around the Hyde Park, since it's not practical to take the tube from Bond Street to Marble Arch.

I would say this hotel makes use of the natural light from the outside. Try checking out the lobby and the dining area.  Breakfast was delicious, I got hooked with their cottage cheese and the cereal.  The dining area staff were also nice, though they identified me by my middle name and not by my real surname whenever they ask for my room number.

The room had enough space, though the shower area was small, I'd sometimes bump my elbows on both the wall and the bathroom door.  Soundproof can be improved, as I could hear the guests from the next room or the ones walking along the hallway.

Actual travel period was July 2011",4,2013,08,20
123,One of the best hotel experiences I've ever had,"I had the pleasure of staying at this property this past July, after a mishap at another hotel (they didn't have ac in the sweltering July heat). My friend and I met Rodderick at the sister property, the Bloomsbury, who helped book our stay at the Marylebone. As a marketing professional, I understand the value of customer service, and as someone who travels often, I appreciate it even more. The top-notch staff go out of their way to ensure that their guests have an exceptional stay, with each interaction perfectly orchestrated and accompanied with a smile. They are attentive, and they listen to their guests, and they create personalized  experiences. You feel like you are a family-owned boutique hotel, while getting all the amenities of a large hotel network.

The hotel is about a 7 minute walk to the Bond street tube station, just minutes away from the congestion of Oxford street, but far enough to have a relaxing nights sleep on a quiet tree lined street. The location is extremely central, and all the main attractions are walkable. There are many cute cafes, restaurants, coffee houses, and boutique shops, as well as a farmers market on the weekend.

Like many of the comments here, the standard rooms are small (queen/full size bed), but there is ample space for two people. I was upgraded to a Deluxe room (with a king size bed and very appreciative of that), which was more than enough space for two people. The beds are extremely comfortable, and the staff leave bottles of water at your bedside during turn down service. A big plus! The in-room continental breakfast is excellent and the delivery is prompt.  

If I could give this property more than five stars, I would. The team here (a special thanks to Roddy, Mark, Elisa) really excels at what they do, and they exude positive energy that translates to exceptional experiences for their guests.  I'm still raving about my stay to my friends and already look forward to my next trip.",5,2013,08,19
123,A Lovely Hotel in London,"We stayed at the Marylebone Hotel just before a cruise in Aug. 2013 and found it to be in a quiet neighborhood close to restaurants,shopping and the Underground. The staff is friendly and made our 3 night stay very nice. Our room was small but nicely decorated with a comfy chair and nooks for other amenities. The bathroom was beautiful but I found the tub needed a rubber mat or decals on the bathtub floor as it was very slippery and hard to get in and out of for me. Also you need to put your key card in a slot just as you enter to turn on lights which is different and takes getting used to. We loved this hotel and would recommend it highly.",5,2013,08,19
123,Excellent location,"We booked this hotel mainly due to the location as its very close to the main shopping street. Upon arrival we were handed a hot towel, reception was very welcoming & we felt very looked after by the staff straight away.
The room was very clean & the bed was lovely, the bathroom was very small but it didnt cause us any problems, the shower had very good pressure. 
We ate at the hotels 108 restaurant, the food & service was excellent although quite pricey, especially the drinks at the bar as they added a service charge for the drinks at the bar which i was surprised by. 
I would stay here again on our next trip to London.",5,2013,08,19
123,"Wonderful hotel for location, quality, value and staff","I had booked the hotel for 3 nights for a long weekend in London to celebrate my wife's birthday in conjunction with some shows, meals and other treats. One of those was afternoon tea in the hotel's 108 Restaurant and I had asked Frits Potgieter, the hotel manager, if it would be possible to have a small birthday cake to go with the tea. That request led to a totally unexpected series of surprises including a room upgrade to a lovely suite, birthday cards in the room, several complimentary drinks and a birthday present of a cook book. But perhaps the nicest thing was that throughout our stay different members of staff kept wishing my wife a happy birthday. I have no idea how they could all have known or remembered. I can honestly say that our stay at the hotel made my wife's birthday and I can't speak highly enough of the hotel and its staff. The hotel itself was very centrally located just 5 minutes walk from Bond Street tube and the same distance from the village-style area around Marylebone High Street. The room rates were also very good value given the high quality of the hotel and its location. And the afternoon tea was lovely too, including the not so small birthday cake! I have stayed in a number of hotels in London over the years and I would thoroughly recommend the Marylebone Hotel to anyone and I would definitely stay there again.",5,2013,08,18
123,London Trip,"Perfect hotel. The location is amazing. Just a short walk to Oxford street, and plenty of breakfast places. The rooms sizes were very good for London... The service was amazing, really welcoming staff. The rooms are clean and nicely decorated. I will definately be staying here next trip to London too! Highly recommended.",5,2013,08,18
123,Fantastic hotel,"My second stay, this time for a special birthday. The hotel staff are wonderful, the rooms are amazing - best hotel experience ever! Great location, minutes from Oxford street but with the village-like feel of Marylebone which also has fab shops, pubs & restaurants.",5,2013,08,17
123,Modern central London hotel,"The Marylebone hotel is located just off Oxford Street (behind Debenhams) and is a stones throw away from Marylebone High Street with its bars and restaurants. 

The rooms are compact (you would struggle in a standard room with lots of luggage), but they are sleek and well equip. They do vary in size and shape (we had two standard rooms on the first stay - one had a bath, the other only a shower, and the sizes were significantly different). On my return stay in the hotel, the doorman remembered my name and I was upgraded which was a lovely touch.

The best thing about this hotel for me was the access to the Third Space Gym, which is a private gym located in the basement of the hotel. You could join their classes for free and use all the facilities, which includes a large swimming pool and fantastic changing rooms.

We were on room only packages and to be honest ate breakfast and dinner out on the High Street rather than paying the hotel prices. There is a cocktail bar which is buzzing and we found ourselves having night caps there most evenings. 

The location and facilities will definitely draw me to return to the Marylebone hotel when I am next in London. 

The pictures attached are the upgraded suite",5,2013,08,17
123,Lovely hotel and very friendly staff,"We had a great stay at the hotel. When the concierge Christian found out it was my birthday he arranged for a bottle of proseco and a delicious chocolate brownie to be put in our room, which was a lovely treat. 

The location of the hotel is great, a 5 minute walk to Bond street station and all the shops. 

The room was perfect for a short stay, with a very comfortable bed. My only negative was that the shower head was spraying in different directions, which did make it lose power a little, but that's a very minor thing. 

We did upgrade to the full breakfast for an extra £5 each, which was very nice, but perhaps this should be included in the price anyway, as the stay isn't cheap. 

Overall, a lovely stay. 
",4,2013,08,17
123,Great find for Marylebone/Fitzrovia,"This hotel is in a great location, and represents good value for a stay in London. The facilities are verygood, and of a high quality. Yes, the bathroom was small, and only had a shower, which is a minus if hou like a bath, and the room wasn't massive, but have experienced worse for more money in London. We had a turn down service, free bottled water, and hooray,  free wi-fi, which a lot of hotels don't provide. The biggest bonus for us, however, was the friendly, courteous, helpful and charming staff. Would highly recommend this hotel.",4,2013,08,16
123,Smallest room I've ever stayed in,"Some great things about this hotel , the location is great especially if you like to shop, great gym, nice bar and above all else excellent service. However, I left the hotel feeling slightly disappointed with my stay, obviously London is expensive but for my £181 per night stay i was given a tiny tiny room. 2 people would not have been able to get in the bathroom at the same time and if you are a larger gentleman or Lady you will have no chance. Also the bedroom was inadequate for a hotel of this standard. I did ask for a change of room when I arrived but was refused.

Cost
Pint £6.50
Glass of wine £8.50
Steak £23 - on a plate on its own with no chips or vegetables
Breakfast £21 for a hot breakfast. Continental came in with the price
Burger £14

Tips
For food: plenty of choice but leave the hotel from the rear through 108 bar turn left and within 20-39 meters you will find the Union Cafe, the food was excellent

Drinks
Avoid the £6.50 a pint bar and for an authentic London pub go in the small and friendly Golden Eagle across the road there are also plenty of other nice pubs / restraints to choose from",3,2013,08,15
123,"Great London find, excellent location and service","Loved this hotel.  This is a sophisticated hotel with beautiful décor and fantastic staff.  Rates were reasonable by London standards.  Location was perfect just a short walk to the Bond Street underground station and in a great area close to restaurants, cafes and shopping. Easy walk to Hyde Park, Buckingham Palace. Reception and Concierge services were great. When booking, I had some questions regarding which would be the best type of room and I emailed Frits Potgieter, the hotel manager who had responded to previous Tripadvisor comments.  I received a quick response and Mr. Potgieter welcomed us on our arrival when we checked in and the room more than met our expectations.  Our room was fairly spacious and beautifully furnished with a sitting area.  Nightly turn down service (with chocolates) enhanced our experience.  The bathroom was stylish and functional.  The gym is one of the best gyms I have ever been to (including private luxury gyms) with fantastic of equipment, huge pool and steam room.  A couple of negatives; limited closet space, bathroom lighting not great and the air conditioning was not optimal (but we were in London during an extreme heat wave).  Given our overall experience, we would still give The Marylebone our top rating and will definitely return there when we next visit London!",5,2013,08,14
123,Difficult to find this combination in London,"I have stayed at over 20 hotels in London over the past years and feel that it's truly difficult to find a quality place in a decent location at a affordable price. The Marylebone Hotel is exactly that. Staff was mostly attentive. The room small but well equipped, with the exception of the shower (rainshower... But almost no water coming out...). It was reasonably clean even for my very high standard. Location is perfect, 5 minutes off Bond Street Tube Station on Oxford Street. Quiet just around the corner there are a few restaurants and pubs. 10 minutes to Paddington station by taxi for your connection to Heathrow.",4,2013,08,13
123,Best Hotel experience ever!!,"My husband and I  stayed five nights with our daughter and grandchildren.  I can't rave enough about this hotel. The  decor, pool and spa,  amenities in the room, ambiance, food,  afternoon tea service, presents for the grandchildren....everything was absolutely perfect. And if anything could make this hotel even better....the concierge team and  supportive and  caring staff were at our beckon call every minute and couldn't have been more helpful and friendly.  I give this hotel the highest recommendation possible and can't wait to return.",5,2013,08,12
123,Gorgeus,"I spent almost a week in The Marylebone Hotel. It was one of the best experience I ever had in a Hotel. Every member of the staff was very professional, always available to support, kind and very friendly.
I would for sure suggest this hotel for a great stay in downtown London.",5,2013,08,12
123,"My safe choice in London, when I travel alone","For the last 5 years, I have chosen the Marylebone Hotel for stay, when I travel alone, for some crazy shopping spree. The hotel it's very close to my favourite shopping area and it's in a nice and quite street.  The hotel is very elegant , with some trendy living rooms, the rooms are small but very cosy and clean. The queen sized bed  and the sheets are very comfortable. I've stayed in a superior room for 5 times and in a deluxe room once ( this last one was still small, for a deluxe ) and I  much prefer the superior, for myself is just perfect , with a good rate too ! The staff is very kind. I had in room dinning, almost every night and the food and the service was nice too. Next summer I'll be staying again at the Marylebone Hotel. I feel like at home.I feel safe ! I would recommend this hotel to all my friends ! Good quality , charming and with great prices !",5,2013,08,12
123,Fantastic Stay,"We stayed recently for our Wedding Anniversary - the suite on the 7th floor was great and the roof terrace had amazing views. 

The location was ideal as we were seeing a show, great tickets were arranged for us by the hotel and everything was organised and completely hassle free.

The staff all looked after us very well, we will certainly be back.",5,2013,08,12
123,My favourite hotel in London,"Great staff, very friendly, professional, and helpful. Both the hall and the rooms are nicely decorated, the business centre is provided with meeting rooms, computers and printers. I strongly recommend it!",5,2013,08,12
123,Review of our recent stay @ The Marylebone Hotel in London,"We stayed in a deluxe corner room for 9 nights and was extremely pleased with their friendly and efficient service. They want you to have the best experience possible and go out of their way to do so. The front desk and concierge staff were great and always willing to asssist you with a smile, not to mention that they rememeber your name!
Our only complaint was that the bed could have been more comfortable.
All in all, a great stay and we would definitely return to The Marylebone Hotel again.",5,2013,08,12
123,Excellent hotel in excellent location,"My husband had organized a surprise weekend in London for us and chose this hotel because of its perfect location: you are close to major shopping areas (5 min walk to Oxford Street) but still a very nice and quiet area. The quality of the hotel (friendly staff, well furnished rooms, breakfast) was perfect. At first we didn't get the breakfast as we expected it to be overpriced - it usually is in such hotels - but the friendly staff didn't make a fuss about it upon check in. Instead they recommend a few places within walking distance. At the end we tried the breakfast and were not disappointed. 15£ or 21£ if you wanted a warm alternative as well, which is pretty much what we ended up paying at the nearby coffee place. I will definitively come back for my next trip to London. I just hope they will not bump up the prices because of all the nice reviews coming their way :-) ",5,2013,08,12
123,Wonderful honeymoon celebration!,"My husband and I stayed at this hotel to start off our European honeymoon between June 24th to 30th, 2013. We loved everything about our stay, the staff were all so professional and welcoming, the facilities were top class, great location and the rooms very modern and so comforting! 

Upon arrival, we were greeted with hot towels to refresh ourselves and were informed that to help us celebrate our special occasion we had been upgraded complimentary of the hotel. This was not only wonderful but shortly after settling into our gorgeous room we were shocked to receive a bottle of Moet to celebrate further! 

The concierge at the hotel were always so helpful, sharing many great tips and local knowledge- we must say a special thank you to Raphael who was most helpful to us! 

The hotel is about a 3 minute walk from Oxford street where there is a tube station to get you to wherever you need to go and all the shopping you could ask for! As you walk down Wellbeck street towards Oxford, on the right hand side there is a small cafe called 'Gino's cafe'. They serve amazing breakfast and great coffee in there which we ate at nearly every day, the service was fantastic and very affordable!

Highly recommend this hotel to anyone wanting an enjoyable time in London. Thanks again so much!

123,Fantastic Trip - cannot wait to return!,"I stayed here for 2 nights with my husband to celebrate my birthday in London. Had such an enjoyable stay and the staff were so friendly and nothing was too much trouble. At check in we were warmly greeted and even though we were early this was not an issue, we were able to go to our room immediately. We stayed in a deluxe room which was definitey spacious enough for us both and more than you would expect in a city centre hotel. Everthing in the room was perfect from the abundance of towels to the Nespresso coffee maker and Armotherapy Associates toiletries which were very welcome after a long day exploring London! The hotel is situated in a perfect location and very central to all the main shopping areas but still nestled in a quiet street with some lovely cute shops and boutiques nearby. I returned to my room on the evening of my birthday to a lovely birthday treat from the staff, birthday cake, bottle of Prosecco and a birthday card. This was an amazing treat and definitely not something I have ever received in any other hotel I have stayed in. Would recommend also booking breakfast as this is very good with plenty of options for the continental but I opted for the pancakes which were freshly made and definitely some of the best I have eaten!  I look forward to returning soon, maybe for some Pre Xmas shopping.  Cannot recommend enough.",5,2013,08,11
123,"Loved it, we'll be back","Friendly, smiling, efficient staff who remembered our names and the purpose of our trip.  We chose the hotel as it is very close to Harley Street where my husband was having treatment over the four days of our trip.  Concierge staff were brilliant in fetching and carrying ice packs at four hour intervals up to the seventh floor.",5,2013,08,11
123,Great hotel,"Fantastic stay, lovely room and friendly staff. To top it all off lovely lady Nadya arranged a complimentiry bottle of porsecco for my boyfriend birthday. Would definitely recommend and will be staying again soon.",5,2013,08,10
123,Great Hotel but avoid standard room if there's more than one of you,"I stayed here for one night with my teenage son. We got a really good rate for a standard room in an absolutely fantastic location. Breakfast was among the best I've had in London, particularly the cooked. 

My only issue was entirely self created. I accidentally booked a double instead of a twin. The hotel was full so they couldn't change us. The beds in the standard room are queens and I'm more used to super kings. It seemed small. The room was also very compact although well furnished. Nice touch that complimentary water was provided at bedtime. Had I been travelling on my own I'd have been very comfortable. But with the two of us in the room it did seem pretty congested! 

Beds were comfy but unfortunately some guests returning to the hotel were a little on the loud side returning to the room at 4 in the morning. This was absolutely not the hotels fault and they were apologetic about it when we checked out. 

I'd happily stay again but if there was more than one of us I'd make sure I was at least in the deluxe room.",4,2013,08,09
123,"Excellent stay, excellent location, excellent service!","I have stayed here a number of times for business and enjoyed it so much, that I took the biggest test of all and brought along my wife for a 2 night leisure break to celebrate our anniversary and her birthday (yes they fall together - poor planning on my part!).  For info we're late 30's/early 40's.

I can state with all honesty that our stay at the Marylebone was one of the best that we have enjoyed anywhere and I mean anywhere.

The hotel itself is first class.  Tucked away in a peaceful off street, surrounded by wonderful little boutiques, restaurants and traditional English pubs, yet just a few minutes walk from the bustle of Oxford Street and handy tube stations, the location simply cannot be beaten.  The hotel rooms are extremely comfortable and the ambience in the living areas is relaxed and stress free.

The friendliness of the staff is what struck me most.  From the doormen who greet you with a friendly smile, the genuine reception staff who will go to any lengths to ensure your welcome and stay is a pleasant one and the catering staff who will treat you like royalty - everyone one of the team is doing their part to make you feel at home.  Make no mistake, you won't just be a hotel room number at the Marylebone!

I had some queries in advance which I emailed to the hotel and I received a prompt and efficient response that tended perfectly to my needs. From manager down, the effort is made to ensure that the service given is top notch in every detail.

If you're from out of town and are looking for a hotel that will give you a real taste of London, I think you'd be nuts to look anywhere else!  Well done to all at the Marylebone and thanks for a great stay.  My wife tells me we'll definitely be back, so thanks also for the brownie points!! :)",5,2013,08,08
123,"London in style, in comfort and within budget!","I travelled to London with my pregnant wife, sister, her 1 year old daughter and my mother and I can't recommend the Doyle Marylebone Hotel enough. All the staff were very warm and accommodating and the hotel is a perfect location and in great condition,,,,, clean, comfortable and chic. The hotel suited all of us event though we ranged in ages from 1 year - 67 years!

The food and beverages are a good price (not too expensive for the area of London it is in) and there is a good atmosphere in the bar.

 The location, close to Marylebone High Street is absolutely brilliant - if you visit make sure to take some time to explore this area.",5,2013,08,07
123,"Amazing staff, gorgeous breakfast,","We stay with this hotel every 6 months for a night and we always find the staff extremely helpful and friendly. The hotel itself is beautiful and very well kept. There is a gorgeous selection of food for breakfast.

123,Best hotel I've stayed at in LDN,"Marylebone Hotel is in a great base from which to reach the highlights of central London, whilst being within a village feel location. I took my wife for her birthday, and having rung ahead, we were upgraded from deluxe to a suite on floor 7. This was well equipped with an interesting rooftop view. Proseco, fruit and birthday wishes were provided upon arrival.  The service was top draw throughout. Cheers for the upgrade Gunther BTW. The decor was plush, breakfast; quality. The gym, spa and pool were sizeable. Marylebone is a chilled blares for somewhere so central. The value for a place of this calibre was beyond our expectations. An excellent stay and would stay again.",5,2013,08,06
123,Great choice,"First of all, I´d like to thanks the front desk attendant Mrs Nora because she was excellent. She provide me B-day cake in my room. All the staff were courteous. The room service was efficient, my room remained clean all the time. And the address of the Hotel is perfect!",4,2013,08,05
123,Average,"I was expecting a designer boutique hotel (Tablet Hotels recommends it), but this is really a massive tourist hotel with hundreds of rooms, low ceilings and flocked brown wall paper. Tiny rooms as well. Design elements in the lobby and bar look tired and contrived. On the positive side, they tried really hard to please, reception was very helpful. Location is good for the Marble Arch/Marylebone area.",3,2013,08,05
123,Fabulous location shame about the glitches!,"A beautifully situated hotel with amazing staff. We had the best welcome ever ,nothing was too much trouble. Well appointed room and so quiet and peaceful,yet centrally located. The most comfortable beds,but there were a few glitches. When we returned from dinner neither of our key cards worked ! Five floors down to get new ones - no apologies! Next morning tried to use the nespresso machine . It didn't work!! There were some Kenco sachets so we made do- but for £200 a night without breakfast I would expect better. I mentioned it on checkout and although they apologised,they didn't offer practical help such as a coffee or maybe a discount or upgrade for a return visit. It is a shame - it promised so much but didn't really deliver! But the beds were divine!",4,2013,08,05
123,Cream Tea a Delight!,"My wife and I decided to have a treat and go for a nice English cream tea over the weekend!! 

Top class service from our waitress (Jael I think her name was)!! Overall made the whole experience that much better! 

Well done team, first class! :)",5,2013,08,05
123,"""A perfect world""","Having been working overseas for three months I booked a deluxe double for a reunion with my wife and asked by email if they could do anything special. Boy did they!

We found on arrival that they had upgraded us to a suite! Room 745 no less. In doing so, they have set the bar very high for themselves as we will definitely be back.

From the very moment we walked in until we reluctantly collected our luggage on the third day, the staff were astonishingly personal and kind. The only issue was that occasionally they lacked the English skills necessary for efficient or natural service. I'd they'd like help with this, I'm happy to oblige as I have been teaching TEFL for nearly 20 years. 

The room was beautifully appointed with a turndown service and a free bottle of prosecco and truffles on the first night! 

Breakfast was lovely and very high quality. If you can get a room package with it included you will do well. One thing that surprised us about a breakfast of such quality was that it did not seem to be seasonal at all. For summer in the UK, there were no fresh berries, for example, but rather tropical fruit. It seems a shame not to capitalise on local provenance. 

 We wished we had had time to check out the gym and the pool but we were so busy out and about. We can do that in future though as I doubt very much that we will consider staying in any other hotel in London. Even though it is not cheap, we felt it was far better value than cheaper hotels where you pay a little less but get far less in return.

As we were walking away, my wife summed it up by saying she wished she could live there. ""It's a perfect world,"" she concluded.",5,2013,08,04
123,"Great Hotel, Great Staff, Great Location and last about Mr. Frits Potgieter","Great Hotel, Great Staff, Great Location and last about Mr. Frits Potgieter
I’ve stayed there for 6 nights (booked two rooms). The hotel is located in a quiet street not far from Oxford Street (Underground “Bond Street”). It is a lovely hotel with great and very helpful staff. The rooms were very comfortable clean and well Furnished. They include free WIFI.
The breakfast is very rich and nutritious. The hotel has few quiet and much decorated spaces at the ground floor. 
Before coming to this hotel I read reviews on Trip advisor site and notice that Mr. Frits Potgieter (Manager at the Marylebone hotel) is replying and commenting on every review (which I already fine as very good thing). During my stay I asked about him and been told that currently he is at Washington for three months and will return to the Hotel acting as Hotel Manager. I noticed that during his absence he continues to comment on travelers reviews! 
Well done.
I definitely recommend this Hotel.",5,2013,08,04

We were given a lovely room but it had a dodgy bed. We complained. They could not have been more helpful, immediately re-locating us with no fuss or further questions. Fantastic staff. Attentive and genuine. Lovely pool. Lots of small details just right. They have got the price right and the room right. Not going anywhere else again! The Marylebone area is also buzzing and fun and accessible.",5,2013,08,01

As soon as we pulled up the concierge were at the taxi door to help us out with our pram and bags - as someone else has mentioned nothing was too much trouble for them and they were extremely helpful and friendly for our short stay! The room was perfect for us and our 9month old baby, plenty of space even with the cot that the hotel kindly provided along with clean bedding for baby and a selection of baby toiletries which i felt was a nice touch! Great location and easy reach to most places. We will definitely stay here again on our next trip.",5,2013,07,31

123,Excellent staff and location,"We arrived at the Marylebone Hotel exhausted after a grueling day of travel that began with a long drive from Central Italy to Zurich before flying to London.  The staff could not have been more helpful and accommodating - from warm towels at the check-in desk to speedily fulfilling some special requests in our room, they truly helped us unwind and settle in for what was a phenomenal 4 day London stay.  

The concierge, Mr. Rahim Ismail, was most helpful in securing some very difficult theatre tickets for us (don't know how he does it!) and assisting us with some excellent suggestions about other attractions, shopping and transportation. 

The hotel's restaurant, 108, was perfect for late night dinner after theatre.

We will definitely be staying at the Marylebone Hotel on subsequent visits to London!",5,2013,07,29
123,Wonderful weekend,"My husband and I spent the weekend in London and stayed at the Marylebone hotel.  We'd a super time.  I'd mentioned in my reservation that it was our wedding anniversary and we were upgraded to a deluxe room and were surprised on the Friday evening with a lovely bottle of prosecco in our room along with a hand writen congratulations card from the team.  We really appreciated this and it made our weekend all the more special.
Our room was lovely, nice size, spotlessly clean and on the 5th floor so we'd a bit of a view.  The aircon was very good and badly needed. The room was very quiet and had every required convienience including a proper Philips hairdryer, fluffy robes and slippers and nice bathroom treats.  We also had chocolates left at night for us!
The only two down sides of the room was the bed - two twins pushed together with no thick matress cover to hide the gap, just a sheet and the other being that the bathroom was tiny - could only fit one person at a time.  The bed was comfy once you didn't lie on the gap.  A cover would make such a difference.
Breakfast was continental and really good.  Huge selection of yummy things.
The staff were all so friendly and helpful.  Alixandre at the front desk was a huge help with recommending and booking excellent restaurants for us.
The location was 5 minutes walk from Oxford Street (10 mins to Selfridges).  It's located in a really nice area without any major street noise.
I'd definately come back again!",5,2013,07,29
123,Worth the Price,"We stayed in the Marylebone in London this summer because we had had a wonderful experience in its sister hotel (the Westbury) in Dublin two summers ago. We were not disappointed. Everything was superb, from the location to the view from our window (think Mary Poppins flying with her parasol over the roofs and chimneys of London).  Breakfasts were outstanding. The thermos of hot milk at night with chocolate was over-the-top. The location was perfect. Our family was able to walk to Trafalger Square, Big Ben, Buckingham Palace; ie, most of the must-see tourist spots, yet we were in a charming, quiet neighborhood. The staff were gracious; they truly made us feel as if they were our hosts, helping us with our every need, making sure we had a large enough van for a family of five ordered at the right time to get to the airport.The Marylebone will always be our hotel in London.",5,2013,07,28
123,Very impressed,"Me and my partner came here for my Birthday, when we got to the hotel at 11am we were greeted by Alexa who was very friendly and pleasantly suprised us by upgrading our room because it was my birthday. Our room was lovely situated on the 1st floor; was nice and cool with the air con. Very clean and well presented. 
Whilst we were in our room we heard a knock on the door and a lovely lady was stood there with conplimentary champagne on ice with cakes with happy birthday wrote in chocolate.  I was so impressed with how personal they were with us and making our stay extra special for my birthday.  We had breakfast included in our package in which we were glad we didn't pay fpr separately as we felt it was overpriced for what it was however service was very good.  
We would definitely recommend this hotel and would stay again ourselves. ",4,2013,07,28
123,Not quite a 4 star experience,"After reading Trip Advisor reviews of this hotel, I decided to call to ask to speak with Frits, the manager, as we were celebrating a big wedding anniversary. He was away for a fortnight so we were told instead to ring back on Monday to speak with someone else. That person was also not available by phone but by email promised we would be looked after. Arrived at 2 pm for check in and it was smooth. Told our upgraded room was ready but had to pay £5 extra to upgrade from a continental to full English breakfast. Newspaper would be charged unless we joined the Doyle Collection. No application needed, just an email so duly supplied one. Then read with Doyle Hotel Membership an upgrade lottery is offered to all members. 

Our room was on the 7th floor. The air con filter needed cleaning as the room was hot despite leaving the air con on full blast for 2 hours. There was a krups nespresso coffee machine with no instructions on how to use and no, the water reservoir was NOT at the back of the machine as one might expect. Had to call for the housekeeping supervisor to show me where the reservoir was. The room came with safe, hairdryer, shower cap, cotton wool, toiletries and a selection of teabags and coffee with cups and spoons in the drawer in the built in wardrobe. Nice touch to see an ironing board, iron and umbrella also. There was a kettle for instant coffee too.

Had a coffee but with whole fat milk as there were no coffee creamers or half and half. Nice to have a complimentary shortbread biscuit. The mini bar fridge was full and sensored, but a small bottle of water was priced at £3.50.

Decided to explore the spa. Was told I could wander the hotel to the spa in my bathrobe and slippers. So donned in a robe and slippers found that I had to take the lift to the 5th floor, then walk all the way to the rear of the hotel for the special lift to the spa. Once inside this special lift, the doors closed and the lift would not move. The lift got very hot without air conditioning and it demanded a room key to operate. I put one room key in and it flashed red! I started to hyperventilate as images of being trapped in a hot lift with no air came rushing into my head. Luckily I had both card keys with me and the second card worked. Light turned green and it moved.

Down I went to the basement. Stepped outside and announced at the spa, this was my first time at this hotel. Got greeted with 'do you want to book a spa treatment? The steam room and sauna are on the gym level, not here.' So back I went inside the dodgy lift and pressed for gym. Stepped outside to a maze. There were no signs to the pool or sauna. Looking around I seemed to be the only one wearing a robe as I was now near the street entrance to this spa! I found the gym reception desk and was told the sauna was in the ladies changing room and a kind gentleman pointed me in the right direction. Once inside the changing room, I still was lost as to where the sauna room was, again no sign. Luckily a lady inside pointed me to the right door. I opened the sauna room door and gasped. It was so small, fit for one person to sit in this cubicle. 5 minutes later I thought I would try out the steam room which was by the basement pool. I opened the steam room and the extreme heat blasted at me. There was no way a human would survive inside! I quickly closed this door and trekked all the way back to my room, advised to take the service lift which was marginally quicker. 

Once inside, I turned the tap on to for a bath. To my chagrin, I discovered that the temperature knob was jammed upside down! Only cold water! So I rang reception and was told it worked by a control on the left? She would send the housekeeping supervisor to show me. I went back. Nope, no control on the left. The supervisor confirmed the nozzle was indeed jammed and called for maintenance. Here I sat in a hot room with the air con noise on full pelt waiting impatiently to take a bath. The maintenance man came and fixed the nozzle but now noted the drain was blocked and he didn't have the right equipment so would have to return.

I was only staying one night to celebrate, so rang through asking for a room change. Reception was good and changed me to a room next door. To my delight, the air conditioning unit was working in this room so I did not have to deal with the 30C temperature inside and outside.

The rest of the stay was uneventful. My partner commented how reasonable afternoon tea was priced at £9 until I pointed out that was for scones alone and with tea and sandwiches cost £25+ service charge + £4 tray charge. Dinner prices were also high with a burger priced at £14. So we ate outside.

When we returned to the room, housekeeping were refreshing the room and left 2 small chocolates by the bed and 2 bottles of water. It would have been nice to see a sign near the bottles to say they were complimentary as we pondered whether this would be billed at £3.50 each if we dared sip. We couldn't decide so rang reception to confirm yes they were complimentary.

Morning breakfast arrived on time. The prices were £16 for continental and £21 for full. We had offered to pay the extra £5 for full as our room price was B&B with continental. However when the trays arrived, the toast was burned, mushroom was one single mushroom, one wee potato coin, 2 poached eggs, one sausage and one tomato. Thank goodness I am on a diet. The continental came with juice ( very palatable orange juice), tea or coffee with hot or cold milk, cereal, and fresh watermelon. The waiter insisted we sign the bill for £42 even though we were on a B&B rate.

My partner's comment on the size of the bath tub was that it would not fit anyone over 5'3"". Lucky me! And did management give us any champagne? Nope, not even a card to say Happy Anniversary.

Check out was quick although we left quite early. The bill was correct. Nice to be offered a bottle of water to take with on a hot day.

All in all a nice boutique hotel but only for pool and gym extras. Meals were too expensive, sauna too small and steam room way too hot to be safe! Would appreciate more signage! Next time, will try the Holiday Inn next door.",3,2013,07,25
123,Fantastic experience year upon year.,"I think that this is probably the 10th year we have stayed at the Marylebone hotel (formerly the Clifton Ford) and the hotel and its staff continue to deliver upon an awesome hotel experience. From being greeted by the doorman to the welcoming hot towel and water at the front desk, you know that you are in for a good experience.  The staff are friendly and helpful and go out of their way to make your stay as effortless as possible.  The rooms are spacious, tastefully decorated and comfortable. Given that Britain was going through a heatwave when we were there, the in room a/c was a necessity. Sitting about 3-4 blocks from Oxford Street, it is convenient to shopping, transport, the theatre district and museums. Overall, I will continue to recommend it to friends and colleagues as an awesome place to stay. We love it!",5,2013,07,24
123,What a great find in Marylebone,"My wife and I spent six nights in a superior room at the Marylebone in late June 2013. Wow, this place was great. It had everything we wanted a brilliant location, quality fittings, spacious rooms, superb and interesting architecture, friendly and efficient service, a mix of restaurants and bar and good value. On arrival we had a lovely high tea and late that night a tasty Eyton Mess for late supper in one of the many rooms around the hotel for guests to use. Really wanted to check out the pool a gym - maybe next time. 
The hotels location was very convenient, about 5 minutes from Oxford St and just a little further to the much better quality Regent street as well as Bond Street station. There are a huge number of interesting restaurants close by. We had a 22 year old daughter bunk in a trundle bed for a couple of nights while she was passing through town. The room was a bit tight with a third person (especially with a third big case) but plenty spacious when we got back to just two of us.
What I really loved about this hotel was that it was a high quality but not pretentious. You really feel like visiting a friends house where you can be yourself and enjoy! I can see this becoming our go to hotel for London.
",5,2013,07,24
123,"The Marylebone Hotel, London - Great Hotel","I stayed in this hotel with my mom during our visit to London first week of July.  The location is excellent - just next to the Oxford street, next to the Bond Station.  Around the corner there is a small grocery store (Essex) and all the popular coffee chains.  The staff is great - so patient, friendly and happy to service you - makes you feel very welcomes.  Especially noted was the excellent, professional and friendly attitude we received from the head concierge, Rahim, who was willing to provide us with detailed tourist information, recommendations and excellent tips. The gym is absolutely amazing!!!  I did not expect to have such a great gym.  It had excellent amenities and you can sign up for classes as well.  The only comment I had was that we had to ask several times for shampoo and soap to be refilled when they were emptied and the room temperature was a bit tough to adjust, however these were all corrected when noted.  We ordered a car ride to the airport on our last day and for some reason in the last minute discovered that there was no note of our reservation that we made with the front desk the night before... however the staff immediately corrected this too (they negotiated an appropriate rate with a cab and paid the difference so we arrived on time and paid the rate of the car service).  So all in all excellent service, friendly environment and really great hotel.  I highly recommend this for anyone coming for a visit to London!",5,2013,07,24
123,Fantastic hotel experience,"As a regular visitor to the Marylebone Hotel I sometimes forget how wonderful it is until I stay somewhere else. Everyone is so professional and friendly. Nothing is ever too much hassle. I've see the staff taking responsibility for any problem a guest has and dealing with it themselves - not passing it onto someone else. Their attention to detail is excellent and if there is a problem, e.g. the pool was out of action for a couple of days, they make sure that you are informed by telling you about it at the reception desk and having a notice in your room. One cold winter day when I was checking out, they had complimentary 'coffee to go' for anyone who wanted it. I really can't recommend them highly enough!",5,2013,07,22
123,Beautiful hotel. Great Location. Amazing Staff!,"My partner and I had the pleasure of staying in room 131 July 1-4 at the recommendation of our friend Gunther. From the second we arrived we were impressed with the superb service. The front desk attendant Alexa and concierge Alexandra were gracious and helped us with excellent tour and dinner recommendations. 

We arrived to an impeccable room with high ceilings, stylish decor...and flawless bedding. 

Breakfast was included with the room rate and it was amazing. I'm gluten intolerant so I was very happy to see they a delicious option for me: eggs Benedict on gluten free toast. So yummy!

The location is amazing just a few blocks from our favorite department store Selfridges. 

Great gym too! 

Thank you Gunther. The hotel was the best part of our stay!",5,2013,07,21
123,Out of this world !!,"I honestly can't recommend this hotel enough ... I e-mailed Frits ahead of my arrival to the hotel just ask a few questions and explain why we where staying at the hotel .. (Sort of honeymoon) we arrived to very friendly and help staff who couldn't do more to help us .. We had been upgraded to a better room than booked , room covered in rose petals chilled bottles of champagne and lovely card congratulating us . We visited the spa the next day where we found the most lovely staff ever , super helped advised of places to go things to do as we had nothing booked . Spa treatments where brilliant . Location of the hotel is perfect , close to everything u need ! On our last night we had hot milk and lovely chocolate lollies left for us , loads of personal touches which were so lovely. Staff at reception helped whenever we asked with directions etc . Overall this hotel is a 5 star hotel in our eyes . Can't wait to come back and bring out children ! Thanks for an amazing stay !

123,Amazing!,"Loved this hotel! Well-appointed, friendly, professional and efficient service and an AMAZING head concierge Rahim!  He is a consummate professional, attends to his guests, remembers them and makes things happen for them!  He found me 3 nearly impossible-to-find West End show tickets in minutes!  He's amazing!  The hotel also has an exemplary bell staff team.  My superstars were: Armel, who went far beyond the call of duty to assist me.  He was helpful, patient and attentive; Emmanuel and Rafael.  Front desk agent Babu was also amazing and attentive; my wonderful stay started with his courtesy and professionalism.  This hotel is a gem, but with superstars like Rahim, Armel, Emmanuel, Rafael and Babu, they make it nearly impossible to choose to stay anywhere else!",5,2013,07,16
123,very satisfied,"Pleasantly surprised with this hotel. Chosen for its location close to Hyde Park, but also Oxford street, Leicester Square and Covent Garden are within walking distance (up to 30 min). Delighted that on arrival at about 11 am we were allowed an early check in as there was one one room available. Fanny, who was at reception, was ever so pleasant and accomodating. Room wasn't huge, but felt very comfortable, very quiet as well. Leisure club has excellent facilities. Staff generally appeared very friendly and helpful. I would have no hesitation recommending this hotel to anybody",5,2013,07,16
123,Our New Standard of Excellence,"Quality, quality, quality and the best management and staff we've ever encountered in our wanderings throughout Europe.  Five star hotels are ""five star hotels,"" by which I mean they all provide excellence in decor, comfort, attention and cleanliness.  The Marlyeborne matches any we've stayed at in the past, but exceeds any we've visited in their personal attention to their clients (or at least to us.)  
We (wife, granddaughter and I) spent our four days in London during the beginning of July at the Marlyebone.  It was the first stop of our get acquainted visit to the city and immediately became our haven from the onslaught of all the  sites and sounds of London.  That is, London was fast paced....and we kept up..., but it was soooo nice to get back to the smiles, attentiveness and comfortable welcome of the Marlybone.  From the people at the front desk and door to the general manager and director of room services to our housekeepers and to those who staffed the dining areas, we were always made to feel that we were their center of attention.  It was a special feeling.
Thanks to all of you who made our stay the best in memory.",5,2013,07,15
123,Amazing!,"We have never been to this hotel before, but I can garantee that we will come back. I recomend this hotel to everyone. Amazing facilities and service. I have never stayed at a luxuryhotel like this before and it is worth every pound!",5,2013,07,15
123,Jewel in Marylebone,"My partner Karen and myself have just returned home from a stay at this wonderful hotel. The location is great,situated less than 5 minutes walk from Oxford Street. The hotel is spotlessly clean  and well laid out,nice comfy chill out sofas just off the reception area and a great bar and restaurant to the rear of the building. The staff are very welcoming and their professionalism and attention to detail is exemplary. I celebrated my 50th birthday during our stay and the staff made it even more memorable by giving me a birthday card,cake and some champagne. Thankyou Maria (Restaurant 108) for organising that.We will most definitely stay at the hotel again.",5,2013,07,14
123,Smart hotel in great location,"To state the obvious, London is a very large, expensive city, with tons of options for accommodations. Any decision about where to stay in London boils down to what area of the city you wish to be in, your demands for certain conveniences and what your budget will allow. In our case, we needed a hotel for one night at the beginning of a visit to England, and while we wanted something with more character than the standard business class hotel, we didn't want to pay a lot for what would be a fairly short stay. We zeroed in on the Marylebone area and researched hotel options, ultimately deciding on The Marylebone Hotel based on the many positive reviews on TripAdvisor and other sites. We knew the room would be small -- though we didn't realize how small the bathroom would be! -- and that the property was a bit off the beaten path. As it turned out, the location was great for us and offered us a chance to do some shopping on Oxford and Regent Streets and choose from a wide range of great restaurants -- all within walking distance of the hotel. And while the room and bathroom were smaller than we're used to, the furnishings were attractive and in good repair, the bed wonderfully soft and the rain shower head in the tiny shower powerful and amazing (not too concerned about water conservation, I take it.) For our one night stay, The Marylebone Hotel ticked all the boxes. 

I would definitely choose to stay here again but assuming we would be staying longer, I would definitely  book a different class room -- we had a superior standard, I believe -- so we would have more room. That said, for the price we paid, I was satisfied with the room we booked this time and felt as though we got a good value for our money. The key for me was I had the appropriate expectations about the hotel and accommodations, and I had booked at a rate I thought was fair.   

A note about the area . . . Marylebone is a very pleasant neighborhood and depending on where you are, you're convenient to major rail stations, Tube stops, serious shopping and many of the areas where tourists want to go. All in all, this was a great choice for us, and I would recommend this property to friends -- with the caveats stated above.",4,2013,07,12
123,Concierge,"I stay at the Marylebone Hotel on business trips. It's location is great and it's staff is excellent, particularly the Head Concierge, Rahim Ismail. He is efficient, friendly and goes the extra mile in ensuring customer satisfaction.",4,2013,07,11
123,Boutique hotel near the west end,Wonderful hotel in Mayfair near Marylebone High Street. Regents Park a short run away. West end accessible as is the British Museum. Good access to Bond tube and city.  Hotel has a decent restaurant with complimentary breakfast. The bar is a nice place to end an evening. Rooms nicely appointed. Hotel staff pleasant and knowledgable about getting around.,4,2013,07,09
123,"Some good features, some things to be aware of","First the good points: excellent location near restaurants, shops, sights; rooms are clean; staff is professional; nice little touches such as tea and coffee and fruit offered free of charge in the lounge area, and free WIFI throughout the hotel. Two things to be aware of: the bathrooms are about the size of an airplane WC, at least mine was. You literally had to straddle the toilet to wash up in the sink, and climb over the toilet to get into the shower. I weigh 115 pounds and someone more weighty than me could not comfortably or safely use this bathroom. Also the pricing is weird, randomly most people though they paid less for their room, had breakfast included and my booking did not. I don't eat breakfast anyway so I didn't care, but for a couple or a family that does, this could be annoying so pay attention when booking.",4,2013,07,09
123,could have been better,Stayed at the marylebone hotel saturday 6th july for my wifes birthday arrived at about 245 to a nice welcome from the receptionist she asked how we were and had we travelled far she asked if it was a special occasion I said yes my wifes birhday she then checked details on the computer and said she would sort out something special if we would like to come back in a hour which was no problem as we needed lunch and it was such a hot day (for london) it was nice to get out of the hot check in area at this pont a member of staff came over to reception with some cool flannels only to walk past me to the gentleman just booking in next to me would have been nice if we could have been asked anyway we went of had a nice lunch and a drink in the hotel bar then returned to reception at about 430 we saw a different member of staff who checked to see if our room was ready it wasn't she rang housekeeping to ask why room 392 was not ready but I don't know what was said anyway she had a look at the computer and gave us room488 on arrival at the room there was a welcome card and fruit on the table but not for us there was a knock on the door about 10 mins later asking to take the fruit away and card would have been nice if we had recieved something but no we later got ready to go out for dinner only to find one lift working so we found some stairs only to find they never went to the ground floor only fire exit so had to go to floor 1 wait for lift I think the stairs should better signed as there is other stairs as we later found we did enjoy our time in London and the room we had was nice just felt we could have been better looked after,4,2013,07,09
123,little slice of heaven,"This hotel, although a little expensive, is worth it when visiting London. So many times in London and you get minimum service and average accommodation at expensive rates. This hotel delivers on great friendly service, attention to detail and trying to maintain the high standards. An easy walk to Oxford street, Baker street or Regents Park, its in an almost perfect location. Nice quiet side street in a residential neighbourhood with even a couple of decent local pubs nearby. Would stay there every time in London if I could get decent rates",5,2013,07,09
123,"Wonderful wedding,","We had our wedding reception at the hotel, as we wanted a modern styled venue, within 18th century Westminsterf.  It was a fantasic experience & all of our guests have given us positive feedback.  

We had a choice of menu - the food & service were spot on.  All of my endless pre-wedding requests were met.
Our guests enjoyed their stay & the quality of the rooms are actually 5 star.",5,2013,07,09
123,Location & Comfort,"The hotel is situated just five minutes walk to Bond street tube station and another minute down to Selfridges. It's on a quiet road in the heart of Mayfair and Regent's Park is also just a short stroll. Marylebone High Street is just around the corner too. I would normally stay closer to Hyde Park when in London but I've found my new base in this place!!

Wonderful welcome, we arrived early and the girl tried her best to get us checked in there and then but we were heading to Wimbledon so were fine not to be checked in immediately but it was great that she tried. The rooms are big in comparison to most London hotels but smaller than what some may expect. The bathroom was spotless and looked like it was brand new. The bed and pillows are very comfortable and over all the room size is excellent. The Nespresso machine was missing but housekeeping brought one within minutes of me ringing which was faster than I expected. Room service was quick but the quality for the price was probably the only disappointing thing.

Check out was very efficient, the fact that the bell hop was coming along the line and tagging bags for storage really helped things move along, many hotels could learn from this. The small bottle of water was also appreciated. Overall, the hotel really took me by surprise and I've found my new London home!",5,2013,07,04
123,"unbelievably genuine, warm guy's working here","Initially stayed in July 2011 for several days whilst my wife was undergoing serious medical treatment at the nearby London clinic.  While the modern style/fab facilities were obvious to the naked eye what struck me most was the genuine cheerful disposition, happy to help approach from the staff.  The first evening I met Roddy the GM doing his midnight rounds, checking all was ok.  From July 2011 to March 2012 myself and my darling wife stayed every three weeks for a couple of days at a time.  The hotel now knowing the reason for our stays regularly upgraded us to deluxe rooms, even junior suites I have run my own small business for over 30 years and regardless of the industry your staff are your ambassadors.  Here they obviously must go through a rigorous interview procedure, as they consider their work here a pleasure and not a job.  I returned to the hotel in April and May 2013 with my 2 kids (young adults) for shopping/football weekends.  Having not stayed for over a year we were welcomed back by amongst others Michelle (reservations), Elisa (front of house) Chelsea FC supporter Raheem (concierge).  I cannot emphasise enough how much the guys here genuinely cared and looked after us.  The very least I could do as a return gesture of goodwill is to write a report on the hotel.  The downside to this honest tribute is that it will probably be more difficult then ever to get to stay in what is an already very popular hotel.  Hope to see you soon guy's and again thank you very very much

123,Amazing,"My wife & I spent the weekend in London for her birthday & I chose the Marylebone Hotel due to its excellent reviews. But even they didn't do it justice. On arrival, we were really impressed with the look of the hotel & the staff were really polite & attentive. We were then told that we'd been upgraded to one of the Penthouse Suites as it was my wife's birthday. It made the whole experience even more special. Everything was perfect & I can't thank the staff enough for helping to make the weekend everything I could've wished for for my wife. I would definitely recommend staying at The Marylebone to anyone. I couldn't fault anything. The location is perfect too. I'd like to thank all the staff for our wonderful stay. Ian Brown",5,2013,07,04
123,Great getaway,Hotel is situated 5 minutes for Oxford Street so my wife had a ball shopping while I rambled around the area enjoying the ambiance. Lovely pubs and bistros and outdoor dining. The hotel was most welcoming with very nice friendly receptionist who had us booked in and on the way to the room in minutes. Lovely room at the back of the hotel was quiet and comfortable and we slept very well indeed. Breakfast was great with a super selection to choose from. This set us up for each day. The bar adjoining the restaurant does lovely food and has a lovely comfortable feel to it. Again staff were magic and nothing was any trouble to them.,5,2013,07,03
123,Compact but nice,"Great location, staff brilliant, rooms nice but very compact, check bed size if your any where near 6ft.. Service and location makes repeat likely. Very close to Wallace Collection and Oxford St.
Good restaurants a stones throw away. Hotel has good food and very decent bar.",4,2013,07,02
123,"Great Location, Excellent Customer Care","We stayed at this hotel for only one night and found it to be great.  We arrived ahead of our checkout time but our room was ready.

We had a couple of minor issues eg a light globe which had blown and a box of laundry for a previous guest which had been overlooked but these matters were attended to immediately and we were offered a complimentary breakfast by a member of the management staff for the inconvenience caused.  I must say that we have had worse issues than these to deal with in the past and have never received such consideration.  When we arrived back in our room after dinner we found a note of apology, a bottle of wine and some delicious chocolates.

Our room was spacious, the beds were extremely comfortable and the bathroom and its products were great.  Even the hair dryer was powerful!

Our breakfast was excellent and both the dinner and the quick lunch we had prior to our departure were of good standard.

All the staff with whom we had contact were polite and professional and we would highly recommend this hotel to anyone wanting comfortable accommodation in a central location.

Well done Marylebone Hotel.",5,2013,07,02
123,"Nice Location, Friendly Staff","This was my first stay in London.  Nicely done hotel.  There was some construction going on while I was there (The reason for the rating a 4).  I was never bothered by any sound from it, though it was somewhat unsightly as I had to walk through some of this area to get to my room.  It looks as though it's almost completed.  Room was big enough for just me, but I feel a couple would be fine as well. 

Staff gave good directions and recommendations.  I'm a fan of trying new places when I travel....but I would stay here again.  The gym was fantastic!",4,2013,07,01
123,Amazing!,"A big thank you to all the staff that made our wedding stay at the Marylebone Hotel amazing.
From the moment I arrived on the Saturday morning with all six of my bridesmaids to get ready in the beautiful suite I was so impressed. The service and staff were brilliant and the suite was absolutely jaw-dropping! There was so much space not once did any of the girls (or their partners!) have to go into the bedroom. There were comfortable seats/sofas for more than 9 people, air con/heating, desk area for the hair and make up artists, full length mirror screen, very large balcony, separate bar section and tv's/ iPod dock for our music. 
We were allowed early check in so my hair and make up girls could get started straight away and there was champagne and fruit waiting in the room. We had a lot of bags and boxes of wedding cakes etc that the staff transported for us. I couldn't wait to show my husband the room after we were married!
Breakfast the following morning was very impressive and we loved the facilities in the gym - getting up and having a swim and steam room was luxury!
Upon checking out all of our things and gifts were brought down to our car and we were given water for our journey. We loved being congratulated on our marriage by all the staff.
We are hoping to come and stay again for our first anniversary!",5,2013,07,01
123,Air Con ruined trip!,"Really like this hotel, been before but really dissapointed this time as the air con failed in our room and it reached 25deg in there! Complained and the staff were nice about it but didnt offer another room, just some complementary drinks. This was really tough for my poor wife who was 8 months pregnant and not coping with the heat and not really into complementary drinks either! They did give us a fan unit, which didnt really help

The next evening they had fixed it and it was much cooler, but that first nights sleep was dissapointing and meant we were tire for our trip to Wimbledon to watch the tennis. Otherwise this is a greatly appointed hotel and great location, just dissapointed....",3,2013,07,01
123,Excellent staff and very comfortable surroundings,"Stayed here for the Taste of London Festival at the end of June.  Were welcomed by a really friendly member of staff before heading off to our room which was huge ... bowling alley proportions!  The room was very long and quite narrow and wound around the back of the lifts which was a concern at first but didn't cause any noise disturbance.  Room was immaculately clean and very comfortable.  We used the pool and steam room etc. and it was lovely.  At it's busiest, late on Friday afternoon there were about 7 of us in the pool. It is quite long and narrow with a serious swimmers lane but because of the layout, it doesn't lend itself too well to just splashing about although there are a great selection of children's pool toys etc. available. At the quietest it was myself, my husband and one other.  The changing rooms were immaculately with everything catered for from the Redken shampoo and conditioner to the hair straighteners.  Our first nights sleep was disturbed by a banging noise when the neighbouring room used their water so in the morning we reported it to the very receptive reception staff.  Unfortunately, the message was a little lost in translation and when we returned we found they'd spent a lot of time trying to locate a noise created by the water system in our own room.  We were immediately offered the opportunity to consider moving but with only one night left for our stay, we declined.  As luck would have it, we had no further problems the next night anyway but the key for us was how very considerate the staff were who made sure that nothing seemed too much trouble.  We asked for and were granted a much appreciated late check-out which was expedited really efficiently.  I would definitely stay here again and at the time of our booking it was by far the best value hotel of its calibre in the area.  I'm delighted to have had such a great experience as we've booked into a sister hotel in Dublin at the end of September so I now have great faith that will be every bit as positive.  Certainly one of the very best customer service experiences I've had and would highly recommend it.",5,2013,07,01
123,Enjoyable stay,"Hotel is immaculate. We stayed on an early booking discount. Our room was clean, comfy and well equipped but did feel small. The bathroom was equally as lovely, but again, small and felt more like a cabin. 
We ran out of time to use the pool. However coming in late hungry at 1am, the bar man kindly made us cocktails and a club sandwich which was great!
Our room rate didn't include breakfast, but we used it anyway. This was the only small let down, felt expensive for what we got.
All staff were helpful and courteous 
Would recommend ",5,2013,07,01
123,"Classy hotel, great location!","It exceeded our expectations. The hotel was well situated close to Oxford St and Bond St, but on a quiet residential street. Staff were friendly and helpful. Our room was adequate and nicely equipped. ",5,2013,06,29
123,Fabulous Hotel!!,What a lovely hotel. Very good standards and the staff are so helpful. Everyone was so welcoming and went out of their way to make sure everything was how we wanted it. We felt like a king and queen. We had got married the day before so this was a short mini break. When mentioning to the hotel staff they immediately sent a complimentary bouquet of flowers and champagne to our room along with 2 congratulations cards. Richard behind the reception desk and Rahim in Concierge were particularly attentive. We could not have asked for better service from these 2 gentleman. They are a credit to the hotel.,5,2013,06,27
123,Good hotel close to all.,"A very posh hotel, the sort where your feet sink into the carpet.

Rooms are a good size for a London hotel and spotlessly clean with iron, trouser press minibar plus a Krups coffee machine, great room coffee for a change.

Hotel is very formal and staff are helpful enough but rather in a robot fashion.

We drank in the bar which has a great buzz atmosphere, not particularly cheap but you are in a hotel bar. You get some great characters turn up in the evening.

Check in/out very smooth. location just off of Oxford Street.",4,2013,06,24
123,A weekend in London,"Very well situated for shopping and eating out!

Already at check-in the staff were wonderful. We arrived early from Stockholm and they had a room waiting for us. And after warm towels and complementary bottles of spring water we went to the room. The room was a superior with a queen sized bed and it was absolutely wonderful. The furnishings stylish and smart. The bathroom prepped with aroma therapy products, bath robes and slippers. The staff turned down the bed each evening and supplied us with complementary bottles of Welsh spring water.

Overall the hotel was really very stylish, with little sit down areas here and there. And as a guest you have complementary access to the gym and the pool which we, unfortunately did not have time to try out.

We dined in at the hotels restaurant (108) one evening and the food, although a bit on the pricey side, was worth every pound. The staff, again, very tentative, looking after us exceedingly well. The bar section where we had pre-dinner cocktails was a bit loud with the DJ playing House.

My fiancé and I would happily go back to this hotel again.",5,2013,06,24
123,Trendy tranquility in the heart of town,"Having seen that the rooms varied in size, we phoned ahead to request a quiet room and as nice a room as possible within the standard range. We weren't disappointed. Not huge, but this is london. I'd  say the room was about 20 square metres. Spotlessly clean, comfy beds, nicely furnished and very quiet. Considering that this is walking distance to Oxford street, that's quite a feat. We were going to a late night concert at Wigmore Hall, a five minute walk away, as are the trendy shops and cafes of Marylebone HighStreet. For this part of town, the location is unbeatable. We enjoyed cocktails in the hotel's fantastic bar, one of the best mojitos I've had and a great atmosphere. Staff are spot on, helpful without being intrusive. It's true the bathrooms are small, at least ours was, and two large guests would struggle to be in there together. But I'd rather have small and spotless than large and mouldy. We loved it. There are so many grotty places to stay in London, this is worth paying a bit extra.",5,2013,06,20
123,"Fantastic location, small room with comfortable bed.","Stayed here on May during Champions League for 3 nights accompanying husband. Quite a tiny room, no view, but the bed was super comfortable. I was expecting a bath tub instead of shower. Superb locations, easy to get around Oxford St. and other places. The staffs are nice and friendly. The hotel is modern and stylish. Overall I enjoyed my stay here.",4,2013,06,20
123,Small Rooms,"I have just come back from a night at this hotel. I was very disappointed with the size of the room and bathroom, a larger person would have had a great deal of trouble getting into the bathroom and shower. We were opposite the lift which was quite noisy in the morning.Size of the room aside, it was spotlessly clean and the bed was very comfortable. I booked a package that included a credit for £10 to spend on food or drink, but this was not shown on my end bill, I had to queue at a busy reception to get the bill rectified, while there I mentioned how small the room was for a superior room and the receptionist told me to put in a request for a room on a different level if I booked again as these were bigger. I do wonder why I was not just put in one of those in the first place.
 I would stay at this hotel again, the location is great, it's very very clean, and the breakfast, bar and service was very good.",4,2013,06,16
123,Smart and Stylish hotel in the heart of the city,"Stayed at this hotel for 2 nights and was really impressed by the hotel. It has got a new-age kind of a feel to it and the staff is very courteous. Located at stone's throw from Oxford Street, Bond Street this hotel would be perfect for people looking for a nice blend of business and leisure.

I was there on a leisure trip. The rooms are decent in size and they have decent sized bathrooms also. All the necessary amenities which you would need during a business trip is available for you, or you can call the hotel staff and they'll arrange it for you. They have a really cool automated mini bar which automatically calculates if you have consumed anything from the mini bar, this really adds to the whole feel of the hotel being new age and tech savvy.

The have a really lavish breakfast spread and the food quality is top notch. I didnt have time to visit the hotel pub but it looked pretty nice from outside. Maybe i'll give it a try next time.

All in all, a very satisfying stay at the hotel",4,2013,06,16
123,Great convenient no frills luxury hotel with superb service,"Stayed with wife for 5 nights. What a breath of fresh air. Rooms while average in size are un cluttered and well appointed. 
Location is just great for a mix of business, shopping and holiday. But the real highlight is the staff. Take a bow. What outstanding service. Awesome and really makes a stay.",5,2013,06,15
123,Fabulous stay,"I adored this hotel.  The staff goes above and beyond to make your stay comfortable.  The service is exceptional.  The rooms are comfortable.  The bed was incredible.  My husband and I loved drinking in the bar after long days of sight seeing.  The cocktails were unique and strong-just how they should be!  The only reason I did not give a five star rating is because of our experience on the first day.  We were very jet lagged and exhausted and wanted to rest upon check in.  We tried to lay down and there was literally a jack hammer going off right above me.  Horrendously loud construction noise.   I was eventually moved to a quiet room but the process was not fast and a bit frustrating given the fact that we were so exhausted from overseas travels.  The staff did upgrade us to a much bigger room at the same price, however.  So everything worked out great.  I just wish they had warned us about the construction.

Other than that minor glitch, our stay was extraordinary.  Nice location, walking distance to so many things, including a fabulous cheese shop just around the corner.  I would stay again.",4,2013,06,13
123,The best 4 Star Hotel in London,"I have stayed in many Hotels in London, mainly on business and sometimes with my wife. The Marylebone blew me away in comparison to HI and Radisson et al predominantly down to excellent service , hospitality and Amenity standards.
I only book here now as the location is excellent, the staff are without doubt better than many five star Hotels and the rooms are clean, excellently dressed all be it a little small but pound for pound this really is the best in central London

Ill be back very soon

Gavin",5,2013,06,13
123,Expensive but worth it,"Stayed only one night as part of a longer holiday having made the error of staying in an budget hotel due to location close to st pancreas on outward journey . The difference in standard was incredible our only regret was that we didn't stay longer . A note to self for future reference , pay the £ 7 taxi fare ( st pancreas ) & don't skimp on the hotel .   ",5,2013,06,13
123,Fantastic Choice,"After reading many reviews of this hotel, I contacted Frits Potgieter with some queries regarding rates at the hotel and also concerns about the size of some of the rooms. As I was going to be in London for 5 nights I wanted to be sure I would not be in a small pokey room or have a bathroom that was the size of a closet.
I was offered a special rate for a superior room with an upgrade to a deluxe room & breakfast included in the rate. As my flight was arriving early in the morning & my departing flight was a late one, I arranged to pay 75% of the nightly rate to book the room from the previous day and also have a late check out.
On arrival I found the reception staff to be extremely friendly and welcoming, Mr Potgieter had asked to be notified when I arrived and he came to reception to welcome me personally to the hotel. I was told that my upgraded room had been upgraded to a Studio Suite. I was disappointed that the room had a queen bed as opposed to the King I was expecting in the deluxe room; but the receptionist said to me........I'm sure you will be happy with the room. The room was on the top floor (734) and I have never had better accommodation in London. The room was extremely large, beautifully furnished, with a truly magnificent bathroom. There was a bottle of wine, truffles, fruit and chocolates on the table courtesy of the hotel. The view from the room was lovely.
The bathroom amenities were exceptional & there was always a good supply of towels provided.To nitpick,there was no place to hang a hand towel once used and I needed to plan how to move in the shower when washing as it was very small. The rain shower attachment, luxury of a bath and marble like tiles more than made up for these small inconveniences.
The evening turndown included mint chocolates & 2 bottles of water - 1 still & 1 sparkling. The bathroom was always freshened/cleaned as part of the turndown service as well. Additionally there would be a pastry or dessert left on the table - but having been spoilt during the week, I was disappointed when these treats weren't there over the weekend. The room was prefectly cleaned by housekeeping daily and they managed to do so at times that were convenient to my schedule without the need to specifically ask for the room to be done.
Breakfast in the 108 restaurant was mixed. The buffet was exactly the same every day with no variation whatsoever apart from the 'juice of the day' which I really appreciated. I often mix fruit juices and it was  pleasing to see that the hotel was creative in doing this as well. The portions of the cooked breakfast were quite small, specially the waffle. The service however was exceptional & the manager/ess would always remember guests names when they left the restaurant which is a lovely touch I haven't seen elsewhere. I have to mention that on one day I left a container of Stevia sweeteners on the table. When I went down for breakfast the next day and mentioned it to the waiter, he confirmed that they had found it and said he would bring it to me. After searching for 10-15 minutes however he returned and said it had been lost or thrown out as it was nowhere to be found. I was very disappointed to hear that. A few minutes later he appeared and asked me to write down the name of the sweeteners and they would go and buy me a new container. In amazement I wrote down the details - I certainly hadn't expected that offer to be made.  Happily though, a short time afterwards, he appeared with MY container which had been moved to lost property. A special commendation therefore goes to Gavin for going to such lengths to assist.
Both the concierge & reception staff were extremely helpful when asked for information, the doormen were always friendly, down to comments about the shows I was going to and I think the winning formula here is that you are staying in understated luxury, with impeccable service, yet you really feel like the hotel is an extension of your home. What more could you want? The location is perfect- easy walk to Oxford Street, Regent Street and all the facilities and transport options available from those areas. There were always taxis available outside the hotel for the times when I chose not to walk. The high street shops are also minutes away as are a number of wonderful cafes and restaurants. In particular I enjoyed The Golden Hind (see separate review). On departure the bill was accurate and check out was swift.
I will definitely return to The Marylebone on my next visit to London, which i'm hoping will be in the next 6 months.It's an absolute no-brainer. Kudos to Frits Potgieter & his entire team.",5,2013,06,12
123,"Overall, a good hotel in a great location, but a shaky start.","I booked this hotel for 9 nights direct through their website for a stay in May.  I booked a 'Junior Suite' and found that what constitutes a junior suite can vary quite a great deal.

We tried to initially check in at 1pm on a Friday afternoon.  I was advised that our 'booked' room (on a high floor away from lifts) wasn't ready but was offered an alternative that was ready - on the first floor next to the lifts.  I said this was not acceptable and would wait until our 'booked room was ready.  This turned out to be after 9pm that evening.  Slightly grumpy, we were shown to our 'booked' suite - a slightly larger than average sized bedroom with a coffee table and a couple of chairs in it.  I told reception that in my opinion, a couple of chairs and a coffee table do not a 'suite' make, but I was too tired and fed up at this stage to do much other than a bit of unpacking and fall asleep.  The insomnia kicked in at around 3.30 (as it does from time to time) so I had a lovely few hours in the bathroom until spouse spice woke up, there being no separate sitting area to retire to.  

When the phone stopped working (regardless of the extension dialled, the only area of the hotel we could reach was the spa) spouse spice lost patience, unplugged the phone and delivered it to reception.  This prompted a young man to visit us in our room, test the phone, tell us it wasn't working properly (duh!) and offer to move us into an even smaller room.  At this point I was ready to move out and find another hotel.  However, I was fortunate enough to have our 'issues' escalated to the duty manager, who listened to our 'history', understood that moving us to a smaller room really wasn't going to make us happy, and said they would move us to a more suitable room the next day.  

They were true to their word; Natalie co-ordinated our move to our third and final room on the Sunday morning, phoning us when the room was ready, and the rest of our stay was just fine.

The rooms are stylish, if somewhat irritatingly 'dysfunctional' - there are a couple of tiny but stylish drawers but you'd be pushed to get more than a handkerchief and a sheet of paper in them, so if you're staying more than a couple of nights in anything less than a suite, don't expect to be able to unpack everything, especially if you're also doing some shopping.  Beds are comfortable and with good linens.  Towels could be larger, but the toiletries are pretty good quality.  I would have been more impressed with housekeeping, had I not found a dead sock under the 'sideboard/storage unit' on our 5th day.  Pop down to the Nespresso shop on Regent Street to buy some supplies for your coffee machine (and get a free coffee) if you're staying more than a couple of nights. 

The location of the hotel is fabulous, within easy reach of the chi-chi Marylebone village and Bond Street/Oxford Street/St. Christopher's place.  Free WiFi in rooms and lobby.  

Overall, I was happy despite a wobbly start and would return;  door staff are especially friendly and helpful - top marks to them.",4,2013,06,12
123,Nice hotel....... nothing special :(,"My husband and I stayed at the Marylebone Hotel in early June 2013. 
To be honest when booking the hotel what swayed it for me was the amazing reviews that people had given when staying there for a special occasion, birthday, anniversary etc i read lovely reviews of being met in reception with glasses of champagne, chocolates and cards in the rooms and even room upgrades (which is always lovely!)

when booking the hotel the receptionist asked if it was a special occasion to which i informed her that we was staying for our 7th wedding anniversary.......

When we arrived at the hotel we was really impressed with how clean and well decorated the hotel was, the receptionist wished us a happy anniversary and took our bags.

When we was shown to our room which was a superior room we was a little disappointed, the room was very small and so was the bathroom.

We spent most of the day in London and came back just to get ready for our evening out.

When we returned late that evening we was very surprised to realise that our room had been entered as the slippers was on the bed and some water on the bedside table, i'm not saying that this isn't a nice thing for the hotel to do but we was a little annoyed as we was not aware that hotel staff would be going into our room that evening and felt a little privacy invasion.

we booked the leisurely London package, not so leisurely as we was awake by 7am by what we guessed was the service lift and staff being quite noisy! as parents of 2 young children we was really looking forward to our lay in!

Breakfast was fantastic, continental spread laid out in the main part of the breakfast room and a wonderful full english cooked to order really set us up for the day.

When we checked out of the hotel, the receptionist asked if we enjoyed our stay, which for the most of it we did but for the price of £249 for 1 night I wouldn't say that it was any better than the Edwardian Radisson just off Oxford Street which offers exactly the same for £99 a night.

As i said at the beginning the reason I was swayed to book a more expensive hotel was the great reviews on here when people had booked for special occasion, so just a friendly note to the hotel when people can read on trip advisor that other couples have stayed for their wedding anniversary and had such amazing treatment such as being met at reception with Champagne and chocolates and wine in the room, even rose petals on the bed as a sweet gesture then really this really should be the same for others celebrating their anniversary.

Will we be returning? Maybe not.",3,2013,06,12
123,Always great hotel and the best location in London,"Having lived in Marylebone for several years, I love to come back to the neighborhood and stay here. Overall this an excellent property, super  location, and good value as far as London hotels go.  This place does just about everything well. The doormen (Karoly and Rosty in particular - sorry for the misspellings!) are amongst the best in London.  The gym and pool are superb!  The bar and restaurant very good (it has improved over time and the difference is noticeable).  I stayed in a Jr. Suite and it was of a comfortable size with good bathroom. Toiletries (Aromatherapy products) and bed linens are great.   Housekeeping service and timeliness was fantastic!  

Just a couple of suggestions for improvement: replace those purple velvet swivel chairs in the room. The velvet is wearing down and they just look cheap/tacky.   What a difference new chairs would make – maybe cream leather like the bench at the foot of the bed.  Also, I stayed for 6 nights this time, and the continental breakfast buffet never changed once (not even 1 item on it) the entire week.  Everything was of high quality, but you need to add some occasional variation to the offerings there.  Also, please encourage the breakfast service staff to relax a little and not be so mechanical. They are a great team, but seem to be reading from a memorized script - from the initial greeting to departure.  The breakfast restaurant manager (Spanish I believe) may be running just a little too tight of an operation. For example, I saw him telling a server (in plain view of customers) how to more properly tie his necktie and button up the top of this shirt.  Ease up on your team just a little and let their wonderful, hardworking personalities shine through a more.  

As I said, these are just a few suggestions for improvement during an otherwise excellent stay.  The Marylebone Hotel remains my hotel and location of choice in London.  It was nice to be back in the neighborhood.",5,2013,06,10
123,Wonderful hotel,"It was our second stay at this great hotel, we had such an enjoyable and pleasant stay due to  the staff  being so extremely helpful and friendly . I  feel I have to make special mention of Mark Heyburn   and  the  Rahim Ismail for their exceptional service. The room was very comfortable and spotless  and extremely quiet. I look forward to our next visit",5,2013,06,10
123,Afternoon Tea at The Marylebone Hotel,"""Absolutely Amazing""

I booked a private room and afternoon tea for my birthday party at the Marylebone Hotel, the food and service was fantastic, both waitresses were so polite, helpful and friendly. The management team were brilliant.

All my guests loved the venue, it is stunning inside and in a perfect central location.

I couldn't have asked for anything better!",5,2013,06,10
123,"Sophisticated, elegant luxury","We were very impressed by The Marylebone Hotel when we stayed there this weekend. The room was elegantly decorated in a modern take on Art Deco style. The marble tiles gave the bathroom a luxurious feel, and the room was quiet, so I enjoyed a good night's sleep.

The staff were very friendly - in particular Richard on reception and Gavin our waiter at breakfast. I raved about the breakfast all the next day. There's a fabulous selection for the Continental Breakfast, with Bircher muesli, smoked fish and goats cheese tartlets amongst the more unusual items on offer, that made it stand out from the norm. In addition I had a fabulous Eggs Florentine and my husband had the Full English, both of which were cooked with the same attention to detail that you would expect from an evening meal - there was no slacking in standards just because it was Sunday morning.

I should mention the cocktails that we had the night before, which were the kind of great modern mixes, like Cucumber Fizz and Millionaire's Mojito that make you wish you could drink more without falling over!

Really very pleased with our stay and have already recommended it to a friend. Thank you.",5,2013,06,10
123,The Marvellous Marylebone,"We stayed in this fantastic hotel on our very first ever trip to London. The reception staff were very welcoming (as was the very kind gentleman who was on door duty) They upgraded our room to deluxe and explained all about opening times of the restaurant, room service ect. Our room was lovely, bed was made up to a high standard, the bathroom was very clean and tidy and towels were provided. The bathroom was a bit small but I do not really understand why anyone would need extensive room to use toilet and take a shower. We only had two problems with our room, firstly, it was extremely hot. I believe that the air conditioning was broken, however we informed reception of this on the first evening and they immediately provided a stand alone air conditioner and the main air conditioning was fixed by the next day. The other little problem was that there was no instruction manual for the coffee machine, but lets be honest, instant coffee doesn't ruin your weekend. Breakfast was lovely, very well presented and cooked to perfection with many different choices available, and once again the staff were excellent and made you feel special. Overall I was very impressed with this hotel, set in a very central part of Oxford street but tucked away from the nose of the busy city. Close transport links, close to pubs and restaurants and the shops! Very big thank you to the Marylebone for making our first trip to London so memorable!",5,2013,06,09
123,Perfectly located hotel. Great service.,"Spent 4 nights here and enjoyed my stay thoroughly. The staff were great from check-in through to daily breakfast to the housekeeping staff.  Everyone I had contact with were friendly, helpful and a credit to the hotel. The only complaint I had was the construction work going on outside (that was audible) but that was hardly the fault of the hotel.

Location wise, I found it to be perfect.  A short walk to the Bond Street tube station and a short hike to other touristy areas of London.  With so much to see in London, being (a fair) walking distance to attractions allowed me to take in the city on the way to attractions.

The free wifi was a great touch and download speeds was good.  I had no problems at all going through big presentation files sent to my email account.

All in all, a great stay. Highly recommended.",4,2013,06,09
123,not as good as last time,"I have stayed here quite a few times and mostly it has been good,  this time they put us in quite a small room which was fine but we paid the same price as we normally do for much larger rooms, so we felt a little bit let down,   
the bathroom is a little dangerous in my opinion,  it is so small that it is a struggle to get in and out of the shower/bath and we are not large people,  if you are not that bendy then most people would find it unsuitable.  

The bed was very lumpy and uncomfortable.

The mini bar was not working,  the wifi was so slow it was unusable at times.  

I also found that my belongings had been gone through,  this must have happened when the room was cleaned, but I could not think of a reason for my clothes to be moved, nothing was taken.  

On the positive side the hotel is quite nice and has a good location.

I think I will try somewhere else next time.",3,2013,06,07
123,One of the best hotel I have been!,"Me and my mother went to London to her birthday on May 2013, at the moment we get to the marylebon and we did the cheak in we realised that we are at the best place:
the service wes great(they send us cake&wine for her birthday), the rooms are big and so nice, the brekfast is with all the favorite things, the hotel staff were so friendly and kind and it was 5 min walking from Oxford st.
I am traveling a lot and for shure I wikk came back!",5,2013,06,05
123,A truly delightful experience,"I found this Hotel to be a fantastic way to spend our last four nights of a month long trip. The service was outstanding from beginning to end, with staff warm and welcoming at all times whether the Doorman, the Front-desk or housekeeping. The room whilst a little 'tight' was spotlessly clean, quiet and well equipped with an excellent shower, lovely bath products, comfortable beds and pillows and a proper hair dryer. We had room service one night which was delicious and prompt,ate in the restaurant one night which again was a great success and had facials in the spa one morning.The Spa staff need a special mention as they were very helpful, friendly and accommodating with our booking and delivered truly excellent facials (and these I know about) and we just wished that we had more time to indulge in more treatments, so thank you so much ladies. Great job, great service.
The location just near Bond St Station was terrific with lots of shops and cafes very nearby and taxis readily available.
This hotel unlike a number of others on our trip (all fed back on Trip Advisor) lived up to our expectations and we would loved to have stayed longer.
Fabulous.

123,Great hotel,"Booked a surprise trip for my partner's birthday, the reservation team were a pleasure to deal with and every detail was attended to! Our room was great(upgraded) and we were given a bottle of bubbly and a lovely chocolate birthday cake which was delicious.
The breakfast was really good and the gym one of the best I have seen.
We were very impressed with the staff, very well trained and professional ,and the hotel was both comfortable and stylish.
This hotel is in a great central position ,ideal for visiting London.
We would gladly recommend this hotel and return again ourselves.",5,2013,06,03
123,"Great location, pleasant staff, variable rooms","We enjoyed a return three night visit to the Marylebone, our favourite London hotel for many years.  

As usual, we appreciated the excellent location in atmospheric Marylebone and close to Mayfair.  There are excellent public transport links on nearby Oxford Street together with restaurants to suit most tastes and most pockets.  

From outside, the hotel is an ugly mid-20c intervention into an handsome 18c residential streetscape but the elegant interior is contemporary cool.  There was an excellent selection of art on the public walls, although much of it appeared to be a temporary exhibition.  Staff are professional and pleasant and there are some five star touches e.g. a good doorman service.  There is a good leisure facility and a pool but we didn’t use it.  Free and uncomplicated WiFi is available throughout and there is a business centre.  Extras are otherwise expensive.

The main problem in this hotel is the variable size and quality of the rooms,issues which appear unconnected with the price.  This time we were lucky, as our ‘deluxe’ $500 room turned out to be well sized (if not spacious) and well furnished.  The bathroom was tiny but it was cleverly designed, well-equipped and well lit.

Overall, especially given its location, we think the Marylebone is one of London’s best hotels in its price range and were it not for the room lottery we would grade it 5/5.

Tip - the nearby 28-50 restaurant is a good venue for a casual meal and the equally nearby Orrery excellent for a more formal one.",4,2013,06,02
123,Amazing stay in a fabulous location!!,"My daughter and I stayed at the Marylebone hotel for the weekend as a birthday treat! Wow, what a fantastic hotel! The welcome we had was so genuine and lovely. I emailed the hotel prior to our arrival and mentioned that it was my daughters birthday and as a surprise they greeted us with champagne and upgraded us to a deluxe room! They then surprised my daughter with a cake and card which made he feel even more special. 

The receptionists were all very accommodating and couldn't do enough for us. They were so helpful (special mention for Tatiana) and offered to help with everything from taxis, directions and hotel services.

The hotel itself is in a lovely quiet area but within two minutes walk to Oxford Street, Mayfair, Bond street and Regents street. For people who enjoy shipping and lunching in fabulous restaurants/cafe's then this is the hotel for you! 

Our room was lovely and clean with great amenities. The bathroom was spacious and the bed was very comfortable. Although the room was on the smaller size it didn't really bother us.

The breakfasts were delicious and even the fussiest eater would be happy! By far the best we've had in a London hotel.

The spa/gym was also fantastic and we thoroughly enjoyed our morning swim and sauna in a serene surrounding. 

The hotel reception is of a very high standard, the lobby is very welcoming with intimate seating areas and nice decór. 

When we left we were handed two complementary bottles of water and the concierge went round the corner to find us a cab to take us to Euston station. We only paid £8 for a taxi to the station. 

Overall a wonderful stay and we can't wait to come back!

123,"Excellent service, rooms need attention.","Booked two nights here, but checked out the evening before our reservation ended.

The staff here were excellent, I can't praise them enough for their service, however, the pool was under maintenance and we had booked the hotel because of the excellent swimming pool, and at check in we were told this, though the staff failed to inform us that the sister fitness centre by Piccadilly Circus had a swimming pool and fitness centre open to hotel guests for free. In fact when we came down later in the evening to get directions or a taxi for the fitness centre, the staff did not know whether we could us the facilities free of charge or not, though eventually the duty manager confirmed this.

The room was ok, size was fair, though the bathroom was much too small for the price even though we had booked the larger deluxe double. You could barely avoid stepping into the loo when getting out of the bath with overhead shower.

The bathroom sorely needed updating, with open pipes on show, grubby tile grout and badly fitted shower screen, meaning water spilled all over the tiny floor space after use. The ventilation was inadequate to clear the tiny room and the heat and steam buildup was unsatisfactory.

The room itself, decor was fine and the blackout curtains were welcome, but pointless as on the day we arrived, it was fairly warm and we required the windows open owing to the fact that the arthritic air conditioning unit barely blew a cool breeze at maximum and was so noisy it was preferable to open the windows to the sounds of London City. By morning, with the sun streaming in, windows as wide open as is allowed and ancient air con running at full steam, we were still too warm to stay asleep at 6am, besides the droning air con woke us up far too early, thought the bed was very comfortable.

All in all, not a great stay and it was a very tiring night which we did not want to repeat so cut the visit short and drove the four hours home instead to arrive home gone midnight.

We shall not be staying again.

Incidentally, we booked via Booking.com which overcharged us compared to booking direct so avoid Booking.com",3,2013,06,01
123,Lovely hotel. Rooms slightly cramped but very comfortable,"I stayed here on a business trip and loved the service and quality of the food. 
The room was clean, and the small extra touches were very welcome. 
My only disappointment was the space available in my room and the fact that I managed to bruise myself on the sink as it has an edge that juts out near the doorway. 
I would definitely stay here again- the bedding was the best I think I have ever experienced!",5,2013,05,31
123,A real delight,"we have stayed , my wife and myself in the Marylebone for three nights, celebrating my 45th birthday (it was my 4th time here - two business and two for pleasure). The rooms was fine (we have been upgraded to a  mini-suite, so its  size was generous), we had a wonderful welcoming with a ""birthday cake"" waiting in our room, excellent location,  Breakfast (included in our room price) was really good - including the option of ordering your preferred kind of coffee (something which is important for us in the morning), and above everything - the most friendly staff  I have ever seen in a ""city hotel"". All employs welcome you with a friendly smile - and more important, do their outmost to assist you in everything needed. 
one of the only hotels which give the slogan ""home away from home"" a real meaning.",5,2013,05,31
123,Anniversary Break,"We stayed for our wedding anniversary and we both thought this was an excellent hotel.  we were upgraded and had a gift and card from room service.

The room was great, the hotel has a real quality feel, and I also thought the staff were all very friendly and got all the little things right.  We felt at home, even though we were only there one night.

We did not have dinner or tea there, but the breakfast was excellent.

Would definately recommend and stay again.",5,2013,05,29
123,"From Setting to Service, your Stay has to be a Success","My first experience with The Marylebone Hotel was shortly after leaving the airport and realizing I had been spelling the place wrong for the days leading up to our trip here. Nonetheless, after mentally (and verbally) correcting myself somewhere around 700 times, I became more aware of how to pronounce and spell this establishment. And while that was a personal victory for me, the larger, more important accomplishment, is The Marylebone Hotel itself: a place staffed by generous and informed employees who will do everything to make your stay in the swanky yet classy hotel one you will not soon forget.

As our cab pulled up to the curb, a doorman greeted us and carried our bags up the steps with ease. His fluidity was something to witness: I'm pretty sure my seatbelt was still buckled and the man had already disappeared indoors with our suitcases. Efficiency is the name of the game for the staff here, and they do a tremendous job of setting the stage for your stay, no matter how long you're in town.

When you walk in, you're in the lobby, which should confuse absolutely no one who has ever stepped foot into a hotel before. To your right is the front desk, straight ahead are elevators, and off to the left are a few seats that are impossibly comfortable - no, seriously; go sit in one and see if you can get up without considering a nap. There's also a small concierge-like desk to the right near the front desk but I honestly am not sure if I ever saw anyone sitting at it in the days we were there. I seriously doubt it is just there ""for show,"" but hey, stranger things have happened.

You can take the elevators up from the lobby or you can be adventurous and make a beeline down the hall past the desk and down a hallway through a number of posh sitting rooms. The decor in this place is elegant without being obnoxious. It's really hard to explain without seeing it but suffice it to say, I was thinking about seeing how many chairs I could fit into my suitcase without anyone noticing. Anyway, the hallway will take you past the restaurant (more on that shortly) and will dead end into a small alcove with another elevator and a stairway leading down into the bar area (more on that, too). Hop this elevator if you have no luggage with you and you end up either in the back end of the hotel floor you select bypassing the crowds, or you end up going down the stairs to the bar for a round of scotch before sleep.

As you head toward your room, you'll probably notice this place is narrow. If you have a penchant for practicing your breakdancing routine while sleepwalking, you will want to kick that habit before checking in here. After rubbing your hand along the wall to confirm if it is as soft as it looks (answer: pretty close), you'll come to your room and reality will set in: these rooms are small. But it isn't as oppressive as you might think or as others have made it out to be. If you've ever lived in a college dorm, you'll know what to expect - it's that size and that layout, only there aren't seven other guys yelling at a Playstation and no one has hidden beer behind the ceiling tiles. So really, it's not as scary as some reviews say. Oh, it's small, don't get me wrong, but it is very much functional. About the only hiccup I found was trying to shut the bathroom door with ease with me still in it. I suppose if I was a former circus contortionist, that would have been easier but I never quite mastered it. Perhaps I need to review my basic motor skills.

But hey, you're in London - you won't be in your room for long. You'll be downstairs eating breakfast at a great buffet with plentiful seating. Then you'll be back in the same lower part of the restaurant pounding something called a Kiwi and Blackberry Sling (which was really quite good) as the night becomes morning. All the while, the same courtesy and friendliness everyone at the desk and the lobby displayed for all guests extend to the dining rooms, and their servers and hostesses. As an added bonus, the food at the breakfast is delicious. I know, I know... ""hotel breakfast buffet"" and ""delicious"" typically do not belong next to each other in the same train of thought but trust me: wake up early and grab a round of food. You will not be disappointed.

And perhaps most importantly, the location of this place cannot be beat. You're not too far from anything major, and you've got a great spot for walking out to a few nearby pubs and restaurants before coming back and making your way to that back elevator in the place I mentioned earlier, so as not to stumble about and embarrass yourself in front of the other guests. Then again, they probably would not mind. The whole place exudes a sophisticated style that welcomes everyone, even those of us who misspelled and mispronounced the name of the place a few dozen times.",5,2013,05,28
123,Very pleasant hotel,"The staff and rooms are very good and the restaurant also had a good selection and had a good atmospehere.
I booked the hotel as it was convenient for my appointment the day after, however I did require peace and rest and this sadly was not achieved due to some noisy late guests",4,2013,05,28
123,Good Location / Small rooms,"The hotel's location is excellent. Just a few minutes walk from Oxford street.
The staff was nice but nothing awesome.
The rooms were too small. If someone booked a much larger class rooms maybe I'll stay more satisfied with the hotel.",3,2013,05,28
123,AFTERNOON TEA,"So I booked Afternoon Tea, for 4 of which 2 of had speacial birthdays, and it was nooo problem at all for the Staff (especially Maria, Monika and Margaret) to arrange ALL the requests that I wanted. I have never heard of this hotel, tucked snugly behind Marylebone High Street, and upon getting there , was amazed at this lovely hotel.

I have been to many 5* hotels for afternoon tea, but nothing surpassed, this experience, held in a private drawing room decorated beautiful with the biggest and widest TV plasma I have ever seen.

We were thoroughly spoilt by Magaret and Monika, and when the birthday cakes were presented to each celebrant, well you would have thought it was being presented to the Queen :O).

Cakes, Sandwiches, Scones, were to die for and the varierty of teas' were execeptional.

All in all a fantastic, mesmerising experience, and I will definitely be going and is worth going back there.

A very big thanks to Monika, Magaret and the team for making this birthday Afternoon Tea, a memorable one for the birthday celebrants.",5,2013,05,28
123,Afternoon tea,"Four of us had afternoon tea at the Marylebone Hotel on Saturday 25th of May. I got an amazing deal and have to say overall that the experience was excellent. We were served by Margaret who was charming throughout and very attentive. We were sat in an area just behind the reception, which seemed slight exposed, but there was a party of children in the next room, so perhaps this is what we were seated here. The tea itself was very good. Interesting fillings and lovely flavoured bread . Scones were delicious and the cherry bake-well was lovely. I also really liked the fact that we were allowed to smell the various teas at the start which I thought was a great touch. All in all, very good experience especially for the price.",4,2013,05,28
123,Hotel of Choice in Central London,"This is an excellent hotel in Central London that I use frequently on business but have also used for a recent family break.

A few minutes walk from Oxford Street but Wellbeck Street is a quiet street and to the rear is Marylebone High Street which is not as well known as it should be for interesting shops, restaurants and ambience. Do not miss a walk down it if you stay at the hotel.

Staff are unfailingly professional and helpful, the wifi is always excellent, a wide variety of room types - I have stayed in most of their room grades but am completely happy with a Standard Room (although upgrade if you want a bath rather than a shower).

The gym and pool are great - perfect for proper exercise and not as in many hotels merely there as a gesture.

The hotel restaurant is a neighbourhood style restaurant and serves good quality but not excessively complex dishes.

I have stayed in a large number of London hotels and on business trips this is my first choice at the moment and likely to remain so if they continue to sustain the same excellent quality.",5,2013,05,26
123,amazing hotel in cool london zone,"wonderful location, excellent SPA, excellent Gym, very nice furbishing, fabulous smell all over the lobbies. small bathroom in superior room. In deluxe room big bathroom, but when they give you a room with bath for disabled persons, they should ask you if it is ok for you: someone can find it very uncomfortable.",4,2013,05,26
123,Nice hotel closed to Oxford street,"We stayed at Deluxe room (291) for 2 nights with our 6 month old baby. Room was spacious as compared to european standard. Clean and bright! 
The front desk officers are friendly and helpful. Hotel is well located about 4-5 minutes walk to the oxford street. We were happy for our stay except for the refurbishment noise which started from 9am to 5pm. Baby was awaken by the loud drilling sound during his mid-morning nap. It was quite annoying!!!  We had to bring him out quickly to avoid the noise.
I called the receptionist and made a complaint. They were very apologetic and offered to change for another room. Appreciated it but it was very troublesome & hectic to pack and move to another room when you're travelled with a baby. 
When we came back to the hotel in the evening; we received an apology note from the front desk manager (Diane), a plate of fruit plater & a pack of olive chocolates. It proved that they are customer-oriented!!!

Don't forget to try the fish bar just opposite the 108 restaurant & bar. It's cheap & nice!!",4,2013,05,25
123,Very Comfortable Stay,"First time I have stayed here.  Location is very convenient for Wigmore And Oxford Street (Oxford Circus and Bond Street tube stations), yet has a very calm, relaxed feel.  Facilities very good, clean, modern.   I had a Junior Suite, so relatively spacious and comfortable.  Excellent breakfast and very attentive and friendly staff.  Would definitely recommend to others.",4,2013,05,25
123,"Location,Location, Location !","This hotel is particularly well located for Harley st., Wimpole st.,The London Clinic,The King Edward vii hospital and the countless other consultancies in London.Also close to Oxford st.etc.The hotel itself is modern and very well appointed.
I spent a week there ,the staff the food and general ambience all rate 5 star.",5,2013,05,25
123,Wonderful hotel at a great location,"We love the quiet Marylebone area, nice cafes, shops and restaurants close the main shopping streets. The hotel had comfortable, fairly large rooms (Deluxe) with a nice decor. The service was impeccable.",4,2013,05,24
123,Well located hotel,"We staid at this hotel the 18 to 20 of may. It is very well located, just a few blocks from oxford street and Bond street tube station. The lobby is very nice and the staff very helpful. The gym was well equipped from what we could see. But the room was no great hit. We staid in number 258. It is a very small room. Could be ok for one person, but for two it was way too small. The bathroom is also very small. If there had been shower instead of bathtube it had been more space. The climate system was extremely noisy, difficult to sleep with it on. But it was too hot to turn it off. The bed was good. The towels thick and nice.  If the room had been bigger I would return but not if it was not possible to get a larger room.  We had breakfast at the hotel. 16 pounds per person. There was a lot to choose from, good bread, fruit, english yoghurt and it is possible to add warm dishes for an extra cost. There is cafes close by if you prefer that for breakfast. Safetybox in the room and a kettle, complimentory water. Everything was fine except the size of the room and bathroom and the noisy climatesystem.",3,2013,05,24
123,Decent hotel in a different bit of London,"Stayed for one night earlier this month and was impressed by the service and the room - comfortable, clean room and great bed. Close to The Wallace Collection too, which is worth an hour of anyone's time. Decent, reasonably priced hotel - get a deal from something like Secret Escapes - that I would certainly stay in again. Excellent breakfast as well which was included in our rate.",4,2013,05,23
123,Home Away from Home,"Had not been to London in many years and wanted a central location as we only had 3 days to explore.  Such a good choice!  Not only is this small gem of a hotel beautifully appointed, the staff is wonderful and welcoming - the most important part of any hotel experience.

Each day as we headed out, we stopped at the front desk to verify that we had chosen the best routes for our adventures.  They always gave us quite good advice.  Special thanks to Rahim for arranging our airport transportation.

Looking forward to our next visit.  Best wishes, Patricia",5,2013,05,23
123,What a great find!,"My wife and I had never been to London before, so we left it to our agent to find us a 'Boutique-y hotel, in a good location, with great service.  We were not disappointed.   There was not a single person there that disappointed us.  They were so happy to help us in any and every way possible...as a businessman, I wonder....how are these people trained so well!!!!  OUr room was a lovely 'boutique' style room....not overly large, but certainly more than adequate...with wonderful amenities.  The staff repeatedly kept on checking up on us....'is everything to your liking'!  We toured London on our own.  Again, the concierge(s) were awesome in suggesting what to do on what day, as well as how to get there....Underground vs. taxi!  The Proseca was a wonderful little addition.  Again, as a businessman, in the 'service' industry, I am extremely impressed at how well this staff treats their guests. And yes, we felt like guest in their hotel.  And yes.  The hotel is extremely well maintained!    We love the Marylebone!",5,2013,05,22
123,Amazing hotel- made to feel very special,"We have just celebrated out first wedding anniversary back at The Marylebone Hotel after having our reception at the hotel last year. We were treated from the moment we arrived with being upgraded to a luxury suite, a gift of a bottle of prosecco and the least expected was a complimentary meal in the wonderful hotel restaurant. We really had a wonderful time and will certainly be returning for more anniversaries in the future.",5,2013,05,20
123,New hotel of choice,"I stayed only one night on a layover this month but if that one night is any indication of how the Marylebone is run, I would go back without hesitation.  The staff are extraordinarily attentive and courteous.  The room, while boutique-hotel sized, was quite comfortable and nicely furnished and -- a real plus -- extremely quiet (but admittedly it was the last room on the hall, which helped).  The public spaces are elegantly understated (the furniture appears to be George Smith),.  If the hotel lacks the overall character of its four- and five-star cousins, what it lacks in character is more than made up by the astonishing care taken by the staff -- from the doormen to the front desk to the restaurant and bar.  The level of service felt far more gracious than nearly every other hotel I've experienced in London, including several with far higher prices. (There was a knock at the door ten minutes after I arrived in the room just to check if everything was okay; now that's something I'd call unusual.)  The Marylebone certainly isn't inexpensive.  But it more than delivers on its promises for rates that aren't outrageous by London standards.  This one-night stay was so pleasant that I look forward to returning.",4,2013,05,20
123,Great Location,"Nice clean Hotel would stay there again but with a few changes. Our room was so so small, they called it a superior room; don't let names fool you it was anything but!!! If you opened the bathroom door it just cleared the toilet, as an example. The A/C was also very noisy; we had to turn it off at night, luckily the nights where cool so we could open a window. My advice is before you book a room ring them up and tell them what you are looking for and what you won't put up with and let them choose a room to meet your requirements. Booking on line is ok but a bit of a lottery if you are picky about the room you want. We only had breakfast in the Hotel, couldn’t ask for better, food was cooked well, loads of choice so would recommend it. Best of all was location, for central London the parks and all it was great, so as a base to explore you wont go wrong with this hotel.",3,2013,05,19
123,Great time!,"Really nice staff, good prestations for my 5 days in London, very good location next to Oxford street, breakfast is awesome, good food, my room was very confortable but a bit small, swiming pool avalaible, hotel is quiet, the area is safe!",5,2013,05,19
123,Awesome stay.,Close to Oxford street and all deparmental stores. Tubes servicing all sites wanting to see. Stones throw from Hyde park for a great walk!  breakfast great with good variety and reasonable. Staff friendly and very helpful at all times.  Clean and a great area to sit and read downstairs or have drinks with friends.,5,2013,05,18
123,Comfortable and well located,A great location within easy reach of the main sights and theatre land.  The hotel is comfortable and modern but lacks character.   The service we received was pretty average with the room unavailable for 15 minutes despite a 4.30pm arrival.,3,2013,05,18
123,Great staff and location,"We would normally choose a smaller hotel but have stayed at the Marylebone Hotel several times because of its great location and it doesnt feel like a large hotel, the staff are great and many remember your name. The gym is amazing, not a hotel gym but a proper gym within the hotel building.The restaurant has wonderful Ginger Pig steaks too!",4,2013,05,14
123,Was not expecting it to be...but a remarkable hotel,"I have lived in London for a well over 10 years and typically stay at the Berkeley.  Not any more.  The Marylebone Hotel is without question the best combination of service, style, price and location to be found in central London.  The staff is incredibly helpful straight across the board.  So many nice people.  Thank you Gunther et al.  Extremely well located within waking distance of Oxford Street.  Lot of resraurants, shops and conveniences in this area and a great starting point for just about any London destination.  All of this for a fraction of the price that it will cost to stay at the Connaught, the Berkeley and other 5 Star hotels.   Terrific hotel that deserves all the accolades.",5,2013,05,13
123,Scrumptious Afternoon Tea,"Wonderful experience.  Hotel staff is gracious and I loved how the different teas were introduced.  Teas are loose and in what look to be large test tubes and you are invited to smell them as well.  My companion and I elected to each try three teas--all yummy along with the food.  I never felt rushed.  In fact, just the opposite.  I texted my husband a picture of me on the cozy sofa and he asked if someone would also be providing a duvet since I looked so relaxed!  A much needed respite during my busy sight seeing trip to London.  And, at two for one, quite a deal!",5,2013,05,13
123,"1st class, great service, super location","My wife and I booked at the last minute and had not stayed here before. The hotel was in a great location, just off Marylebone High St with its small town feeling but 10 mins from Oxford St. The service from the staff at the hotel was 1st class. The rooms were very good albeit on the small side and the quality of the furnishings and fixtures was very high. We had 2 nights at the hotel and had a great time and would definitely recommend this hotel.",5,2013,05,10
123,Walking Distance to Oxford Street and Bond Street,"Stayed for one night as the next day was moving into the Hilton Paddington.Great Breakfast and good service overall.Back Entranceof the Debenhams on OXford Street is only about 200 Metres away.
Also waht made it memorable was watching Manchester United win the EPL this year and also next day Chris Gayle bazing away to his 175 for RCB.",5,2013,05,10
123,Again a pleasant stay,"We again stayed at The Marylebone Hotel, the four of us.The good service started at the door already and it carried on subsequently.Very nice rooms, good beds and spotless bedlinen, furniture and fittings are in good condition, no stains on the carpet, sufficient lamps, lights, and amenities.The bathroom size in my room though was reminiscent of my hotel in the Akasaka area,Tokyo, e.g. it was far too cramp.Toiletflush spilled water night and day, i guess the handyman may have had a few days of sickleave? Getting into an elevator was an excercise of very patiently waiting, and it allowed some meditation sessions in front of the closed door. The breakfast was yummy, it should not be missed. We're looking forward to return to The Marylebone, London.",4,2013,05,10
123,From Zero to Hero,"My husband,15 month old boy and I have just come back from London where we stayed at the Marylebone Hotel for 4 nights in a double superior room. After reading the extremely positive reviews on TripAdvisor, I was disappointed to see the room we were initially given. It hardly had enough space to fit the baby cot, the sink was clogged and the room was unimpressive. We complained and were told that the standard double superior room is 19 sq. m. and this is standard. Now, I know very well how small London hotel rooms might be, but expected more from this hotel. After the second or third complaint, we were upgraded for free to an executive room, which is why I am giving this hotel 4 stars, otherwise I would have given it 3 at most, simply because I expected a lot more from it. The executive room was wonderful - and what I was expecting to get in the first place. The service at the hotel was overall excellent and the location - hard to beat! We didn't have breakfast included so I can't comment on that, but the room service food was quite good.",4,2013,05,09
123,Wonderful short break in this marvelous hotel,"I have just returned from a 3 night break with my young neice. The break was to celebrate my birthday. We were upgraded to a deluxe room and had a bottle of bubbly and cake delivered to the room on arrival, which was greatly appreciated The room surpassed expectations, the staff helpful and polite at all times, and took time to make my neice (7 years old) feel very special and included. We had a great nights sleep despite the room being near to the lift the noise was minimal. I have only praise for the hotel, the staff, the location. We only ate breakfast in the hotel but enjoyed this very much. thanks once again, hopefully will get the chance to return soon.",5,2013,05,08
123,Great service & location,"I have stayed here twice and both experiences have been extremely positive.  Staff go out of their way to help, room service food is good & the rooms are clean & modern.  Breakfast was definitely worthwhile.  Decor is trendy without being over-the-top.",4,2013,05,08
123,Excellent all round.,"We stayed as a party of 12 ladies for a hen weekend and instantly felt welcome ( we had an age range of 28 to 78 ).  The hotel was beautiful and the service first class.  Nothing seemed too much trouble for the pleasant staff.  They kindly arranged the breakfast tables so we could all sit together and the food was excellent and served quickly.  The good location was a bonus as we had booked this on a tight budget and had used a limited deal offer.  I am familiar with London and have stayed in many hotels, many costing a fortune and definately no better than this!  Strongly recommend, we will be back, its posh but not stuffy!",5,2013,05,08
123,Superb hotel,"Located just around the corner from Bond Street and Oxford Circus, this hotel is in a fantastic location.

The staff are very attentive to your needs, and the evening treats that appear are a pleasant surprise. The rooms are very modern and clean, the only gripe is that at times the mood lighting is not bright enough!

Will be coming back to this hotel without a doubt!",5,2013,05,07
123,Comfortable stay,"Stayed at The Marylebone Hotel over a weekend in London.

Location of the hotel is good, it's right behind House of Fraser, walking distance to Oxford/Regent Street. Plus there are a lot of good small eateries around, very nice area. 

Size of the room is good as compared to many other European cities which offers really small rooms (I booked a superior room and was upgraded to a deluxe room during check-in). Room was spacious and clean. I've also booked the breakfast, which is worth every single penny. The serving size was huge, and on top of the paid breakfast meal, you can still have the food from the international buffet table.

Would totally come back again if i'm back in London!",4,2013,05,07
123,"friendly, ideally located","the friendliness of the staff starts the monent you step in to the reception and includes EVERYBODY, concierges, doormen, receptionists restaurant staff and housekeeping staff, it's really exceptionmal.",4,2013,05,07
123,Long standing guest,"When travelling to London I have been staying at the Marylebone Htl for many,many years even before when it was the Clifton Ford. The all round service received has always been of high standard. The location is perfect to move about London, in my case I find I can go to most places just walking plus suitable transport nearby when required. It is important to mention it is near the railway stations when arriving or departing from London",5,2013,05,07
123,Business & Pleasure,I stayed here for full week before Easter.........great hotel......staff were wonderful.....very helpful and friendly.......room was great! Breakfast was super......if pricing was a little confusing! Dinner was excellent.......Location is fantastic....hope to come back.,5,2013,05,07
123,One of the best!,"Having stayed in many hotels worldwide over the years, especially some of the better 5 Star hotels located throughout London city, this hotel can stand up and show them all thing or two! From the moment we stepped out of the taxi to an overwhelming greeting from the doorman, such as Rafael & co! We were assisted with our luggage straight away and whisked in to the front desk for check in. Here l had the pleasure of dealing with the extremely friendly and efficient Fanny, who not only made us feel like we had just arrived home but proceed to explain the various facilities of the hotel with easy and most of all a warm smile! Our room was upgraded to a studio suite, which by London standards was a great size, clean, quite & a comfortable bed, with all the added extras of a luxury hotel. Could not have asked for more!
What really stands out is the levels of customer service, from ordering a bucket of ice which took less then 5 mins and felt like the member of staff had been waiting outside the door ready to serve! To making a reservation in the hotel restaurant 108, all done with the greatest of easy and efficiency. The food was very good and we got plenty of assistance and smiles when we dined on Saturday night from all members of staff.We also tried the pool & Sauna in the hotels spa, the third space, which as hotel gyms go is a credit to them and l know why it is known as one of London's Premier clubs! Other reviewers say its is hard to locate, l disagree as it is sign posted from all floors in the hotel and can be accessed from the lifts.
The hotel has plenty of inviting area's to relax and enjoy a quite drink or catch up with friends. I believe the afternoon tea is fantastic and there were plenty of small groups enjoying this facility during our stay and they all seemed to be having a fantastic time. 
After a day of enjoying London during Sunday, we arrived back late to the hotel and after a quick change we wanted to go out for a later dinner. Sure enough within minutes the very friendly Rafael at the door had recommend a restaurant, but also ran up the road to fetch us a taxi, all within a 5 mins period -superb! 
We had breakfast delivered to the room on our last morning at the precise time we requested. It was beautifully presented, delicious and fantastic value for money.
Finally our time came to check out and we had the pleasure to meet a fellow Irishman at the desk, Richard. What a top gent he is and a real asset to the hotel. He was warm friendly and like all staff at the hotel, they had such a presence about them and perfectly suited to their role. 
We both work in the hotel industry, l sell hotel rooms and will recommending this hotel on a daily basis. My partner is a GM of a 4 Star hotel and he thought that they are a excellent team and the hotel was a real find. We will be back to stay in the next couple of months and would just like to say thank you to the Marylebone Hotel for making it a memorable birthday weekend!",5,2013,05,07
123,Great hotel in a great location,"Have stayed here several times over the last few weeks, and after trying several hotels around the same area, this is my definite favorite. The rooms are not the biggest, but they are immaculately designed, and the beds are very comfortable. Service is second to none, and the staff are super friendly. Will definitely come back!",5,2013,05,07
123,Wonderful location!  Great hotel!,"I can highly recommend Marylebone Hotel!  It is superb value for money.  We have stayed in a Deluxe Room and it was very spacious.  The hotel is in a beautiful location - a few steps from Marylebone High street which was amazing!  Don't miss Daunt Books!  Lots of small special shops and places to eat as well!

The hotel is close to everything and I will definately return with my family!  Staff was very helpful and friendly and the free bottle of water a great gift!  There was even free coffee and tea in the reception area!  

Great hotel!",5,2013,05,06
123,"Five stars: Service, Location, Room!","This is a wonderful hotel... The service is clearly the result of a company that prides itself on attracting, and keeping, staff who are determined to welcome you as valued guests. I was truly impressed and that's why I am starting with a nod to service, even though my usual higher priorities of location and room were also ideal.
This is a mid sized and well renovated hotel, the rooms are a decent size and are modern and well appointed.
The biggest draw for me, other than the exceptional staff, was the location. It's tucked away, very close to both Marylebone High Street, Oxford Street/Oxford Circus and Regent's Park. This is a great London location to enjoy shopping, and strolling... as well as great running in the park. I highly recommend The Marylebone as a west end base for business or pleasure.",5,2013,05,05
123,Great hotel!,Great hotel! Great location! Great breakfast and staff! Clean rooms and comfortable beds in the superior rooms. Simply a great stay for us!! We spent several hours in front of the computer to find a good hotel in London and we are so happy that we chose this one. We have stayed at other luxury hotels in London with rude staff and we think that The Marylebone Hotel is the best hotel we have stayed at where we felt very comfortable with the staff. We will be back :-) Thank you!,4,2013,05,04
123,Great hotel,"Just back from a one night stay.  The service at this hotel is faultless.  The staff across the board could not do enough for you.  The hotel is in a great location just behind Oxford Street.  The rooms are very clean, comfortable and well furnished.  The hotel restaurant served excellent food at reasonable prices. I have definitely found my hotel of choice in London",5,2013,05,04
123,Afternoon tea: - superb experience,"I had arranged to have afternoon tea with a group of very special friends at The Marylebone Hotel and it was superb! From the private room they gave me (without request or extra cost) to their fabulous service, it was excellent. The staff were kind, attentive, polite and highly professional. The hotel was very clean and lovely decor. The afternoon tea was delicious and they catered wonderfully for the vegetarians amongst us. The afternoon progressed at our leisure with no time restrictions and I can say, that my guests and I had a wonderful celebration. I can highly recommend. Superb value for money too and great memories. Thank you!",5,2013,05,03
123,"Great hotel, great location","A great hotel in a great location. The staff are very friendly, the incredibly well equipped gym and pool are fantastic and the rooms are very nice. The only downside is there is no pay tv! It won't stop me going back though ",5,2013,05,01
123,Fantastic Hotel,"My husband and I spent a weekend at The Marylebone Hotel and it was fantastic experience. The customer service we received from staff was excellent.  The room was spotlessly clean, very comfortable, bathroom was lovely and the bed and bedding of high quality.  The staff are all extremely helpful and friendly, especially Gunther who arranged for a complimentary bottle of wine for my birthday and also a personalised birthday card sent to the room which we thought was a very nice touch.  Overall highly recommend this hotel and we would not hesitate to stay there again when in London.",5,2013,04,29
123,Excellent,"Have stayed in  many hotels all over the world, but would have to give The Marylebone Hotel 101%.   Rooms were beautifully decorated and comfortable, staff extremely helpful and made our stay such a pleasure.

We will definitely be going back and would highly recommend it to anyone wishing to make their time in London memorable.",5,2013,04,29
123,"Good, but check your credit card statement!","Many aspects of my stay were excellent, whilst others could certainly be improved. I got the best price through lastminute.com - do shop around and use Quidco when booking for ~10% extra cashback. Do not book direct through the hotel.

Check-in:
The cold towel I was given on check-in is a nice touch, especially on a hot day. Check in process was difficult, however. The man behind the desk could not find my booking despite giving my name and my colleague's name. I had to pull my laptop out to show him the booking reference, but he eventually found it. 

Room:
Clean and modern, which is a nice change from some of the ""premium"" London hotels. Was not warned about the construction activity going on right outside, which meant a bad night of sleep - although I am sure if I had asked to move they would have accommodated. Bed was comfortable enough and bathroom was very clean and fresh.

Lounge area:
Service was slow, mainly due to the fact that the seats are around various corners meaning you are not immediately obvious to the waiting staff. I ordered a cheese and pickle sandwich, which was quite dry and tasteless especially for the price. Again, I didn't complain about this so gave them no chance to rectify, although the standard should not be so poor in any case.

Gym:
Decent size, lots of treadmills and other machines, not too busy after 9am, so this is a good aspect.

Luckily, I checked my credit card statement a week after staying at the hotel to find a charge of around £130 on there. I enquired about this charge, and was told that this had been put on for a lunch on the day of my stay. Staff were apologetic and got back to me by email to reverse the payment, which they acknowledged as a mistake: ""We had a guest dine in the restaurant who was under the name of 'Westcard' and the restaurant manager made a honest mistake with the charge onto your account."" I was not sent a note to say that these charges had been placed on my card, but they admit this was a failure on their side. I am yet to receive the refund, but understand this takes several days to emerge. I was offered a free meal ""on your next stay"", which whilst a nice offer, will not materialise for me as I cannot recommend the hotel or stay there again for this reason. This is a shame considering the regularity with which I stay in London, and my experience has been marred of what was otherwise a decent hotel.

Mistakes do happen, but I do not understand how this can be allowed to occur when I had checked out at the time that ""Mr Westcard"" paid for his lunch. Luckily this was a small amount and did not put me over-limit, so no fees were incurred, but do watch out if you stay here that similar does not occur.",3,2013,04,26
123,Local luxury,"If you need a base in central London then this is well worth checking out.  Part of the Doyle chain of hotels, it is about 5 minutes walk from Oxford Street and Bond Street. The rooms are always clean and the beds of a high quality.  Staff are unfailingly friendly and courteous. The 108 bar opens onto Marylebone Lane where there are a number of good places to eat, and in the vicinity, should you decide not to use the hotel restaurant. Highly recommended",4,2013,04,24
123,Just PERFECT,"I was in London recently on business and stayed at the Marylebone. First of all it's located centrally and in quite a perfect area. Secondly the service was amazing. The gentleman Gunther at the front desk was amazing, so nice. He made me feel so comfortable. Then the room was great and clean. Free WIFI. There is a great restaurant/pub attached to the hotel which was nice. I ate there, had pan seared fish, spinach and their garlic mash... just fabulous. This is my go to hotel from now on every time I am in London on business. I highly recommend this wonderful hotel. All praises from me!!",5,2013,04,23
123,Not what I expected,"Disappointing from arrival, works going on outside the hotel, waited in the lounge area almost 15 minutes before I could order coffee, inaccurate room service and lengthy check out lacking any form of personality, plus side is location is superb, generally nicely appointed hotel but the finer details lacking ",1,2013,04,21
123,Great service!,We stayed for 4 days at The Marylebone and the staff have been tremendous. We were caught by surprise to find a bottle I champagne in our room and a card to congratulate us on our wedding anniversary. It is these little touches that showed how much they value us as guests. ,5,2013,04,20
123,city break,"By far the best hotel experience iv had yet, beautiful, clean, friendly helpful staff from the moment we arrived nothing was too much trouble, room was cozy and clean, the bedding was luxury and the bathroom beautiful. The hotel bar has a great atmosphere and a good selection of cocktails. Little extras like free wi-fi and complimentary water and chocolates was a lovely touch. I must also recommend the hotel spa, massage and facial was heaven. Worth every penny and location is perfect. will be back!!!!",5,2013,04,18
123,Excellent service and perfect position,"When in London, the Hotel is just in the right location, for shopping, for convenient transportation, etc.
The Service and the support from the concierge (contact Andras) is excellent and effective, all the staff is very supportive and ready to find the best solution for you.
In one word, a very good solution when you travel for business and/or for leisure.",4,2013,04,18
123,Vacation trip,"Location and service really make a difference. All the facilities were very convenient for the purpose of a vacation trip.

Although the hotel is located on a very quite area better to get a higher room to avoid any traffic noise 

The business center is very helpful for check in and the Wi-Fi service available all over the hotel as a complementary service is very appreciated",4,2013,04,17
123,My London home,"I spend over 50 nights a year at the Marylebone and the hotel never fails to disappoint. The location is perfect, rooms are extremely comfortable and the staff are first rate. For such a centrally located hotel the rates are not extortionate and they have a really good loyalty programme that handsomely rewards frequents guests.

I particularly like the fact that the staff remember you and go out of their way to welcome you back each time you return. No wonder the Marylebone is my London home.",5,2013,04,16
123,The hotel provides the best hotel experience,"The best hotel ever I stayed in in London .. Great in everything, location, Clean, welcoming staff and friendly. I enjoyed the gym experience and dinning in. 

The staff is great in serving and limitless with tourist support ",5,2013,04,16
123,excellent location with amazing service,"loved the experience in being in Marylebone hotel and for sure will go to the same hotel everytime i visit london.

our kids age ranged between 17 to 13 were so happy of the location and safety of the area, close to shopping and restuarants.

very friendly staff who tried their best to help.",5,2013,04,16
123,Loved the Marylebone,"Travelled to London with my 11-year old from LA. Great location, very comfortable, lovely and helpful staff. Chose it because of the pool -- my son is a competitive swimmer -- and it was so much better than i'd hoped. Great location, great health club, close to regent's park for running, close to tube stops. Walked to British Museum. Thank you!",5,2013,04,14
123,Excellent!,"Booked the hotel because it was close to Oxford Street, when the purpose of the trip was shopping with my daughter. 

Was greeted by a very nice employee who took our luggage and escorted us to the check-in desk. Brought luggage up to the room and showed us around the room and explained where everything was, all with a natural smile.

The hotel is about 7 minutes walk from Oxford Street.

Would highly recommend the hotel and would definitely order it again, next time shopping in London is on the agenda!",5,2013,04,12
123,Excellent Hotel in Convenient Location,"We had an overnight stay as a birthday treat and were upgraded to a deluxe room by the hotel.  Very good reception staff noting that it was a birthday booking.  The room was very clean and comfortable, although perhaps a little tired in places.  Teas and coffees provided in the room but surprised to see only 3 milks in a double room!  Breakfast was exceptional - an amazing selection of cereal, bread, fruit, pastries and yoghurts plus the option of cooked.  The English breakfast arrived very quickly and was perfectly cooked and presented. Our waiter was very attentive, both in offering 'top ups' and clearing plates etc.  We didnt visit the spa as didnt have time but the location is ideal for shopping in Marylebone High Street, Oxford Street and the West End etc.

Check out by Gunter was efficient and we were offered complimentary bottles of water for our journey home.

Would not hesitate to stay there again.",5,2013,04,12
123,Amazing hotel and location,"We booked the hotel mainly from the pictures on the hotel website, and the proximity to the main ""drag"" of shopping outlets.
We arrived from the back road, and walked up the side of the hotel, to which we weren't enamoured... It looked dated and old.
But, on turning the corner and seeing the main entrance, our hearts lifted. 

The main entrance and front is lovely, and the doormen are a great touch, always smiling and very polite and well turned out.
We were spoilt for choice for people to help us on the reception. The lady that we dealt with asked us if we were there on a special occasion, to which we were of sorts, due to my husband being away for 4 months from the next week - needless to say there was no special treatment, which we didn't expect, but seemed an odd question to then amount to nothing!

The room was lovely, we were on the third floor.. The bathroom was small but usable, so unlike some other reviewers, we didn't find it an issue.. Though I would say that it was quite awkward to get out of the bath seeing as the sink and shower screen were equally long, not leaving much room for manoeuvring!!
Lots of things to use in the bathroom, I.e. shower gel, shampoo and conditioner, plus cotton buds, cotton pads and a selection of tea.
The hair dryer didn't have an attachment, just the open end.

We did get woke up at 0800 the next morning to sawing and banging from upstairs, not sure what that was, but we mentioned it to reception who said they would investigate. Not much good to us but hopefully for someone else.

Unfortunately the spa was closed, but the pool was open, so we went straight there - the pool is cold but once you've swum a couple of lengths, you're fine. The showers are amazing!

The bar is fantastic! Red walls and candlelit.. Gorgeous.
The staff are friendly, polite, ready to please and help.
Oxford street and Regents Park are within 5 minutes walk, and the nearest tube is Bond Street.

We would return, but not sure we could afford more than a couple of nights!!
Very expensive, but we felt it was worth it for our particular celebration.
Should we return to London later in the year, we would definitely stay again.
",5,2013,04,11
123,great!!!,"Fantastic hotel!! Staff is amazing!! Very helpful people specially Rahim Ismail (very attentive and caring guy) and Fanny (spanish girl, muy buena referencia para gente que viaje desde España). Breakfast was good too, though they could offer something hot...

Over all, very good experience, will surely take this hotel into consideration.
Un hotel para repetir ;)",5,2013,04,11
123,Amazing Experience,"The Hotel is amazing, very well located in the city, with very confortable and nice spacious rooms and a very helpfull staff. I have to mention Gunter and Amelie that work in the reception, they were so helpful and kind, just ask them whatever you need, they will help you. Also Rafael working at the door was extremely kind. The breakfast was also the best!
I would definetly stay in this hotel again and would recommend to my friends.",5,2013,04,11
123,Wonderful hotel that has a genuine welcome,"Whilst I only stayed for a couple of nights I was really impressed by the attention to detail in this hotel. The service is excellent, the staff are very welcoming and helpful without being intrusive. The room itself was well appointed and the bed was very comfortable. I did not get to use the leisure centre and pool but it looked good. The food and drinks in the bar in the hotel were very good. Yes a good fine that I shall return to",5,2013,04,11
123,Above & beyond,"We were extremely fortunate to win a nights stay at The Marylebone Hotel after dining at 108 Restaurant on a previous trip to London.  We were informed we won by email, which was a lovely suprise on it's own.
When we contacted The Marylebone to request an extra night's reservation they could not be more helpful, as my daughter was going to a concert at The 02, and we were meeting with some other family members the following day.  When my daughter & neice checked in they were very well looked after by Richard on reception, and extremely happy with the room they had been allocated for the night, and again upon our check in we were very warmly welcomed by Richard on reception, we then chose to have afternoon tea with some other family members, which I would highly recommend, we were served by Monika, who showed us several teas on offer, explained how the afternoon would proceed, and was extremely helpful and informative, for which we would like to say Thank you for making our afternoon feel very special.  We had a lovely stay, during which time we once again visited the 108 Bar/restaurant, with excellent service, and breakfast in the morning set us up for the day, they have an array of fresh fruit, cereals, and wonderful breads on offer, also a scrumptious cooked menu to choose from, with service obviously being of paramount importance to this hotel.  We would definately stay again when we are in London.",5,2013,04,09
123,"Great location and service.Overall great stay,","We've stayed at the Marylebone hotel for a few nights, it's a great hotel, not perfect though.Overall we had lovely stay,I would definitely stay there again, and recommend it to friends going to London.   
The good: the location, just perfect, steps from Oxford st., it's close to Regent and Bond street, the Hyde Park etc. Many great restaurants and cafes and boutique shops just around the corner.
The room, very well equipped, modern design, quiet and cosy, the tea facilities , the cookies and chocolates  were nice treat.  
The service-was great , staff always ready to help. 
The gym and spa- really great place to relax, though the water in the swimming pool was freezing!
The bad: the bed was too soft for me, felt bit like sinking in it (perhaps personal preference)
the aircon-was very noisy, 
The bath-  was tiny,the smallest i'have ever seen, only fits one person",4,2013,04,08
123,Lovely hotel in a great location,"We chose the Marylebone due to its great location in Marylebone Village, offering lovely relaxed shopping and restaurants.  The hotel is beautiful and the staff very friendly and helpful. We stayed in a recently renovated double room on the 3rd floor, but were very disappointed with the size of the ensuite - it was by far the smallest we've ever experienced and bordered on the unworkable, and we are both small size individuals. The main problem is the sink vanity unit which is far too big. How this design was ever approved is beyond us!  It would not put us off staying there again, but anyone of average size would seriously struggle.",4,2013,04,08
123,Great Hotel,Recently spent a week In London. Found Hotel Marylebone on Trip Advisor. Visit exceeded our expectations. Staff was excellent especially doorman Rafael. Everyone went out of there way to insure our stay was enjoyable.Very clean and quiet hotel. Rooms were a bit on the small side but very efficient in there layout and did not lack anything we needed. Even had an  electrical outlet which did not require a converter as we are from the US.Very close to bond street tube stations Regency park and a number of great restaurants and cafes all walking distance from the Hotel. If you are looking for a Nice hotel with great staff in a great location for a very fair price look no farther and make a reservation at The Hotel Marylebone. You wont be disappointed!,5,2013,04,08
123,Fantastic & Gorgeous,"perfect location and best service!!!! 

very well located, few blocks from Oxford Street, plenty of restaurents and supermarkets close by!

excellent service from reservations, doorman , checkin, concierge, house keeping, all. food in the hotel restaurant was fabulous! i stayed 5 times in this hotel and i will do it again!!!

I just have compliments to make to hotel's staff. They really care for you. thumbs up especially for Gunther and Raphael!!! best service ever!!!!",5,2013,04,08
123,A good location,"We spent a long family week-end in two separate rooms. The decoration contemporary of very good taste. We liked a lot the neighborhood, there is a lot of good restaurant around. It is also very close for the shopping. The pool is part of a club and there is some hour rules to be able to use it.  ",5,2013,04,07
123,Excellent value afternoon tea - well worth a visit,"This afternoon tea was great in that it felt like a really special occasion. We were shown to a huge sofa with a coffee table laid out ready for afternoon tea. You would never think that we were on a 2 for £25 offer. The staff were extremely attentive and keen to assist, although prone to forgetting to bring us extra jam or water when we asked for it! However, I really enjoyed the explanation of the tea options. I also loved the fact that we could order as many different types of tea as we wanted. I was very grateful that they changed my sandwiches to suit my dietary needs of no fish and mustard at short notice. The sandwiches themselves were tasty if a little dry around the corners. The scones unfortunately were bizarre. They looked beautifully golden but were underdone (somehow!) in the middle - very doughy indeed. The quality of the food was good but let down here and there but some poor baking. It's hard to summarise the Marylebone. In terms of value for money and feeling special, it was perfect. It was only slightly let down by some poor baking.",4,2013,04,07
123,Fantastic,"I just have compliments to make to hotel's staff. They really care for you. The hotel is beatiful. It is 3 or 4 squares apart from the Bond Street tube station. The location is amazing! There are lots of pubs, restaurants and well know stores just near by. I definitly will stay there again the next time I visit London!",5,2013,04,07
123,excellent service,"very well located, few blocks from OXford Street, plenty of restaurents and supermarkets close by, good business facilites, and excellent service from reservations, doorman , checkin, concierge, house keeping,all. food in the htoel rstaurent was ok, especially for vegetarians like me, the gym below the hotel was fabulous. only disppointment was that the rooms were small, maybe a little smaller than most good london hotels.",4,2013,04,06
123,"Perfect location, wonderful service and great value for money","I booked the hotel based on the positive reviews online, but I have to admit it surpassed all expectations. From check in to check out everything went so smooth and the staff was splendid. There was a wonderful spa included in the already very reasonable price. Nice neighborhood. I will definitely book Marylebone hotel for my next stay, I could almost consider going back quite soon just to stay at the hotel again. No joke.",5,2013,04,04
123,"Warm welcome in cold, snowy London.","My wife and I with 2 friends spent 3 nights at the Marylebone Hotel over the weekend 22-25th March. It proved to be a very cold weekend with lots of snow on the Saturday. The hotel however, compensated greatly for the inclement weather, with friendly helpful staff during check-in. As we waited for our rooms we had a delicious cup of coffee to warm us up. 
The hotel is well situated for Central London, handy for both Tube station and main shopping areas. 
The staff where all very helpful and friendly and nothing was a problem to them. 
The breakfasts selection was very eclectic and I think that most people would have been catered for.    
We ate dinner on two occasions in the restaurant and the food was well cooked and presented  by attentive staff, whom we could not fault.
The room was a large double/junior suite with a large well designed bathroom and walk in shower. It was tidy at all times with an excellent standard of cleanliness. We also had a large TV, which included Sky sports, which was very well received on the occasion we gave up on the London weather and returned to the hotel for refuge. 
If or when we return to London the Marylebone Hotel will be top of our list for another visit.",5,2013,04,04
123,Great Location- Great Staff!,"Being from London originally, and now living in California, i know the city really well.
I always stay in Marylebone, as its walking distance to everywhere. Ive stayed at various hotels in the area, and its my pleasure to now make this hotel my Marylebone hotel of choice. The staff are friendly, and the rooms are new and fresh. Hotel bar and restaurant are splendid. If you prefer to stroll outside, there are numerous coffee houses and great restaurants. Great pubs are within staggering steps away. Whether wife my wife or alone, again- this hotel is 5*.",5,2013,04,04
123,Another Comfortable stay,"Stayed one night this week, as usual, friendly staff, clean comfortable room, great service, hard to ask for more in central London.  The staff make the place, they are always smiling and happy to help, they must enjoy working there!",5,2013,04,04
123,Best Location in all of London,"This was my 6th Stay at this hotel, and every time I come back I am overwhelmed by the service, decor, and the staff. The hotel is definitely a hidden gem off the busy Oxford street, but, in a location that is walking distance from everywhere you want to be including Marylebone, Knightsbridge, Mayfair, Soho, and Piccadilly. While you might want to take the tube, these locations are easily within a 20-30 minute walk. The rooms are updated, modern and have a boutique flair and the colors are soothing. The staff will bend over backwards for you and there is nothing that they can't arrange for you from theatre tickets, to football matches, or afternoon tea.
They can do it all. I love the FREE wi-fi, lovely lounge area and library as well as complimentary business center. Don't hesitate to make it a romantic weekend, or a family affair. They can and will make certain that your stay is TOP Notch. I will continue to come back!!!",5,2013,04,03
123,"Great (not great, excellent service) in the middle of marylebone","Stayed at a suite here with family just before Easter. Suite is great for 3 persons with two tv's. One of the friendliest hotels i have ever stayed in. The staff (especially Raphael at the door) are genuinely welcoming and happy to assist with whatever. Hotel location is great, walking distance to lots of restaurants and shops and they have a lovely indoor pool and gym. Walking distance to Oxford Street and the tube stations of Bond Street and Oxford Circus. They have free tea/coffee fruit and croissants in the mornings available (great for a chilly London morning). Free, fast wifi is also included. The room service meals were good, they took up to an hour one evening to deliver and gave us on the house with plenty of apologies. It is a 4* hotel with 5* service. Would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to stay there. Smalls rooms synonymous with London but excellent service.",5,2013,04,03
123,Delightful Hospitality,"We stayed over Easter and had the most wodnerful stay. The location is as good as it gets and the hotel is beautifully presented. The cleanliness is second to none. To top it all the staff is what really makes this hotel stand out from the crowd. Nothing is too much trouble. They anticipate your every need and do so with a genuine smile. 
We'll be back!",5,2013,04,02
123,Almost Perfect,"We stayed here over Easter. The staff were very helpful, friendly and not intrusive. The room was small in comparison with other similar rated hotels we have stayed in, but spotlessly clean with all facilites provide including free wi-fi. The bathroom was however, a spotlessly clean cupboard with all mod cons. Our bathroom had a bath which may have encroached on the available space ! To get in and out of the shower (over the rim of the bath)was to say the least difficult. Breakfast (continental) was short on choice, however, the quality of the food was excellent.
We chose the hotel for it's spa, however, the inside lift was broken down and the only means of access was to leave the hotel and take a short walk to the street entrance. not exactly ideal with the weekends cold weather.
Check in and out was seamless and trouble free, you even get free water on leaving, a nice touch.
A larger bathroom and would get a perfect rating.",4,2013,04,01
123,Wonderful Hotel... Would highly recommend it.,"Stayed in this hotel with my daughter for four days over Easter period. This hotel is central, safe, welcoming, comfortable and the staff could not do enough for us.  The hotel was spotless ,our room was very modern and the maid service was impeccable. We had a  problem with the door mechanism on the third night . When I explained to the hotel staff early next morning I was immediately upgraded to a suite!!! The staff could not have been more  kind or  understanding.We intend to return again in October. Highly recommend this hotel, particularly if you are a mother and daughter team.",5,2013,03,31
123,Brilliant hospitality!!,"My wife and I stayed at this hotel 6 consecutive days in March. We were very much nervous because this was our first trip out of Japan and our first stay at a hotel in London. Our main concerns were about bathtub and other equipment like hairdryer. So we e-mailed in advance to the hotel and we received a very quick reply from Johan, the reservation agent, that they do have hairdryer in each room and he would request for a room with a bathtub for us.It was in a sense unexpected to receive so quickly a response, and that with such kind words. When we reached the hotel, we found that the hotel was really brilliant. The location was nice and convenient to get to tube stations, the staffs were all very nice and kind, the room was nice and tidy and the dishes served were nice and delicious. We really enjoyed our stay at this hotel and are absolutely satisfied with their hospitality. We will definitely book this hotel when we have a chance to visit London again. Many many thanks to everyone who gave us the great pleasure to stay at your hotel!!",5,2013,03,30
123,Weekend in London 22-25March 2013,"One of the best hotels we have stayed in . Accommodation first class., room great size, and spotless as was the rest of the hotel. All staff were, very friendly and helpful, Breakfast fantastic choice and freshly cooked to order.Evening meal in hotel was reasonably priced and of excellent quality. Location was ideal just off Oxford street, but in a nice quiet location.Very handy for transport links for sightseeing around London. I would definitely stay here again, and have already recommended the Marleybone Hotel to friends.

123,Excellent Birthday Stay....22/03/13,Staying at the Marylebone Hotel was a fantastic experience. From the second my girlfriend and I got there we really were treated like royalty. The rooms were a good size and very clean with all the facilities you can think of. It was my girlfriends birthday and we had champagne and chocolates sent up from the hotel staff thanks to Amelie who worked at the front desk. Room service went out their way to get us some hot chocolate and were very professional. The morning breakfast was absolutely fantastic/delicious. We had such a great time that we wanted to stay another night but it was unfortunately fully booked. We want to say a special thanks to Amelie at front desk who made our stay so special. We will be staying at this hotel again for sure.....Look no further guests- i promise you this is a hotel with so much more!!!!!,5,2013,03,28
123,An excellent hotel,"Beautiful rooms. Beautiful decoration. Excellent location. Excellent service. 
Very good breakfast, they don't charge children. Flexible with check out time. 
Good quality of beds and sheets . A shirt walk from Oxford street and from st.Christopher place.",5,2013,03,27
123,Brilliant Experience from a Disabled Guest,"I have lived in London and stayed in many 5* hotels and my experience at the Marylebone exceeded all of them. From the moment of my arrival, I was looked after, made sure my bags were in my room, offered a room upgrade and care assistance as I was unwell. The concierge made sure I was in and out of my taxi safely.

I had a large room with a comfy double bed and large luxurious bathroom with towels and robes. My only complaint would be that the shower was not very powerful and there are no drawers for your things but otherwise a perfectly comfortable room.

All the staff from the front desk to room service made sure I was alright and were friendly, attentive and polite, more than can be said about most London hotels.

The furnishings and food were exceptional if not a tad expensive but that's London for you.

I'll be back in a few weeks and look forward to my breakfasts and luxury room:)",5,2013,03,27
123,Wonderful Hotel!,"Loved my stay at The Marylebone Hotel.  It’s a boutique hotel, in one of London's most fashionable neighborhoods, nestled among charming town houses and only a few short minutes walk to Bond Street Tube Station and not to mention Oxford Street and Oxford Circus.  Rooms are stylish and updated and the staff was just exceptional.   A very courteous young man called Cian Brock was one of the staff there and provided me with tips and advice on not only the hotel amenities but the surrounding area.  I travel to London quite a bit on business and will definitely be making The Marylebone Hotel a top pick.",5,2013,03,27
123,"Great Hotel, Great Location","8 of us stayed at The Marylebone for a weekend away. The location was great so much to do around the hotel and so central for the tube to anywhere, the staff were very helpful and made a real effort to make sure we were comfortable. Just a really nice, intimate feel even though it has over 250 rooms. Really happy and will definitely stay again.",5,2013,03,25
123,construction work and rude staff,"DON'T STAY THERE UNLESS YOU ARE SURE THAT NO CONSTRUCTION WORK IS GOING ON!!! because the hotel will not care to put you next to the construction area or in a room where electricity comes and goes.
I stayed at the Marylebone Hotel in London from the 12th to the 18th of this month.
I have stayed in the hotel in the past and had positive experiences there. Unfortunately, this last visit was a very bitter experience. 
I was put in a room next to a construction (or remodeling) area, and when I came to asked to be changed I was treated like a nuisance instead of being treated as a guest. 
The women that checked me in, and who was really annoyed by my request and rude, told me that as I was staying many days it was impossible to accommodate me in another room. This was an extremely strange response, as I have never before being punished for staying for long in a hotel, and because I was not told in advance that construction work was going on at the hotel and I would be put in a room that smelled like paint and with a lot of noise. 
The lady was so rude that another staff member interrupted her and offered to solve my request sometime in the afternoon, and so they changed my room.
The second room where I stayed had electricity problems. The light kept coming on and off, I assume that because of the same construction going on in the floor. I had to call more than once to get the electricity restored. After the experience with the rude lady and because I had a lot of work and little time I didn't even bother to ask for a room change. She had made very clear that it was impossible on my first time requesting a change. 
In a way, I guess this problem could have been easily taken care by the hotel being more considerate on which rooms are acceptable for a stay. Nevertheless, I should say that it was the person that did my check in, that was so rude, what spoiled my stay in a hotel that I used to love more than the construction or electricity problems.",1,2013,03,25
123,Highley recommended when staying in london!,"Our visit to this hotel was a very enjoyable experience.Staff were very friendly and helpful.Breakfast was high quality and a fair variety,even thoughts it's expensive,you get what you pay for.
A fantastic location for exploring London!",5,2013,03,24
123,"Fantastic hotel, the restaurant is lacking","Stayed in this hotel for five days on business. I went with the higher room size and when I arrived they offered me a 'disabled equipped' room as it was even more spacious. I went with that and had an almost studio sized room right in central London.

The rooms are great, all the staff from the doorman to reception to housekeeping were friendly and competent.

The hotel has a full commercial gym and pool in the basement which guests have free access to.

The only downside was the restaurant. One morning ""the chef didn't see"" my order which meant I waited over half an hour for breakfast. This is not good when you're headed to an important business meeting. I only ate in the restaurant one evening and it was a disaster. It took ages to get a table, even though the restaurant was not full, we had to repeatedly walk from our table to get the attention of our servers. Plus the food was poor. Strangely room service, which comes out of the same kitchen was always good and on time.",5,2013,03,24
123,"The Marylebone Hotel, London","A lovely stay in a great location. The staff could not be more helpful. We were assured, when booking, that we would be allocated a room suitable for a wheelchair user and were not disappointed. We felt that this was a first class experience without being intimidating. We will certainly return and next time try the spa. It was not cheap but not bad for the location.",5,2013,03,23
123,My new favorite London spot,"I went on a business trip to London for 3 nights, and had work events in (expensive) Mayfair but wanted to stay in the lovely neighboring neighborhood of Marylebone (where I used to live).

The Marylebone Hotel was a great find, recommended by a friend who lives nearby and uses the terrific gym.  Every member of staff I encountered (Gunther, Richard, Alexa) was charming and professional; the room was small but perfectly formed; and with free wifi and coffee & croissants in the lobby in the morning, the Marylebone Hotel had everything I needed.  I will definitely be back!",5,2013,03,23
123,Amazing weekend stay,"I stayed at the marylebone hotel on a friday for my birthday. When we arrived we were greeted by a concierge who welcomed us, took our bags and gave us a hot towel. When checking in we were surprised to see that we had been upgraded to a suite room as it was my birthday. The head concierge Raheem? was amazing at his job. he took us to our room, explained that we had been giving champagne and cake for my birthday :), explained the use of the facilities and explained the local area to us. The room was great, lovely and spacious. gorgeous furnishings and had the most comfortable bed ever! We also had a big bathroom with a bath. We couldnt fault the room EXCEPT from the time we checked in until the time we checked out we heard a door sliding open continuously throughout the day and night. We later found out that our room backed on to the cleaners cupboard, which was unfortunate as we lost sleep throughout the night. When we returned from a meal out we decided to sit in the drawing and get a drink, i told one of the members of staff that we were waiting in the room for some drinks and he explained that some one will be with us shortly. After waiting patiently for half an hour no one came so we made our way back to the hotel room. Other than these two faults our stay would of been perfect. And i hope to stay at marylebone hotel again very soon :)",4,2013,03,22
123,Brilliance in a hotel.,"This hotel has consistently outperformed any other hotel that I have ever stayed in. From the warm, friedly, efficient service when you checking in to the professional way that all of your requests are dealt with. Nothing is too big or small a task. I have stayed in this hotel many times and each time that I arrive it feels like I am coming home.

Usually I stay at this hotel for business but I have also brough my family to stay and they we equally enthralled by it. My 8 year old daughter insists that I bring chocolate muffins home from every trip!

Well done and thank you to all of the staff here for 'going that extra mile' .

I",5,2013,03,22
123,fantastic,"excellent as always, well looked after by a very good team. From the concierge to reception staff, restaurant . alaways friendly and smiling and try and help as much as possible.the location is great, easy access to good shops.",5,2013,03,22
123,The Marylebone is amazing,"Went for a quick business trip and they were fantastic. The staff is courteous and helpful all the time. The rooms are spacious, clean and cozy with all the amenities - good bath products, mini bar, complimentary coffee maker, etc. Outlets are beside the bed and accessible (so you don't have to move furniture and plug in your phone across the room!)
The Concierges were amazing - great with restaurant reccos and their associate Alix even helped me ship something by messenger out last minute. Very helpful. 
My only complaint was the heater in my room clanked from time to time.. even in the early morning hours.
Restaurant and food are great too. Great quiet street, but still accessible to things. Really a gem of a place right in Central london....would definitely go back.",5,2013,03,21
123,FANTASTIC WEDDING DAY,"We had problems finding a hotel which met our menu needs and flexibility in central London without breaking the bank. The Marylebone Hotel not gave us what we wanted menu and everything that goes with providing a three course luncheon event, but they bent over backwards to accommodate our every whim and needs.  The team functioned as one, each knew the bride and groom's full details, were met on a personal basis by each of the team members, we were upgraded to the Penthouse as a surprise gift and on the actual day, we were treated like celebs, including every guest - thoroughly satisfactory day which I will never forget. we have now adopted the bar as the place to be when visiting London.  Thank you all at Marylebone P&J",5,2013,03,20
123,This is the perfect hotel for your trip in London," the hotel team is very helpfull and very kind. The location is just perfect near Oxford Street and New Bond Street. The hotel is beautiful and rooms are very well decorated.
The staff speaks french if you need assistance. The spa and the pool are perfect after a shopping day!
",5,2013,03,20
123,We are staying here again next time in London...,"I chose this hotel for a special birthday vacation with my wife to the greatest city in the world simply based on how much the manager Frits paid attention to his guests here on TA.  An odd criteria for hotel choice, yet any manager that would take the time to respond and listen to his guests in the manner as he's done is hard to find.  Anyway, the Marylebone will be receiving our business again.  Alexa and the rest of the front desk staff was wonderfully helpful in checking us in after a long flight. The ""superior"" room had everything you could need, though I would say if you're used to large bathrooms you'll find these rather small, but it wasn't an issue for either my wife and I.  The restaurant and bar are all great options with wonderful service if you don't feel like heading out.  The bottle of wine sent to our room was a nice touch - thank you.  The neighborhood surrounding is vibrant, yet quaint with great places to shop and eat.  We did not meet ONE staff member who wasn't pleasant or helpful.  Well done Frits and staff - keep up the GREAT work!  Your hotel is EXCELLENT and my home away from home now in London.",5,2013,03,19
123,Second Trip January 2013 Fantastic,"I recently stayed at the Marylebone Hotel in London for the second time in January 2013.  This trip, I was at the Marylebone Hotel for 16 nights, and it was just as wonderful the second time as it was the first. It was like coming home seeing some of the familiar faces from my trip in June of 2012. The hotel staff greets you from the moment of your arrival with a warm smile and makes you feel very welcomed. I felt once again like I had just come home. The warmth and feel of the Marylebone Hotel is to me so unusual because you are in a hotel, and it just does not feel that way in most hotels. It is a very comfortable and inviting hotel, and the staff are amazing people. Magdalena, a young lady I met my first trip, was still there, and her welcoming greeting and smile made me feel like once again I was home. I met Richard in the Marylebone bar, and he was so warm and gracious it was such a treat to go down and have a cup of tea or a nice glass of wine. I also met Maya in the Marylebone Bar,  and she was such a delight to talk to and took great care of me. I can recommend this hotel to any “weary traveler”; it is a respite from the storm, so to speak. The numerous sitting areas are all so uniquely different you feel like you are in totally different places, and yet you are in a hotel and feel so comfortable and are made to feel so every day in this hotel by the genuinely professional staff who make you feel important. How lovely is that? To feel like you are home and yet important. Any problem is treated with care and concern. I will stay at the Marylebone Hotel every time I travel to London, which hopefully will be twice a year. Once again, the very professional and capable concierge Ismail is there to provide any and all assistance you might need for any activities from theatre tickets to a city tour; everything can be arranged through him. I am not a good traveler, but this hotel makes me feel like I am a good traveler because when there I am at home. The staff is bar none the most professional and courteous staff I have had the honor of staying with at this hotel. Once again, the food in the One 08 Restaurant was delicious and served to you with a smile and a kind word; I can’t wait to go back. Thank You Marylebone Hotel staff for taking care of a traveler. I look forward to coming back to the Marylebone Hotel, my home away from home very soon.",5,2013,03,19
123,Very Good Experience,"My family (me, wife and seven year old) had a very good experience with this hotel.  It was very clean and the staff, particularly at the front desk, were very friendly and helpful.  The manager of the hotel was at the front desk from time to time helping guests including us.  He made us feel welcome and took a great deal of time to help us with our siteseeing, playgoing and eating.",4,2013,03,18
123,"We will be back , fantastic","My Wife and I stayed here on a trip up to London for our anniversary. From the minute we arrived the service was superb,  the doorman greeted us with a friendly smile and asked if we needed any help. He showed us to reception where we were dealt with quickly and the receptionist(Amelie)  quickly discovered it was our anniversary and unknown to us until later arranged for some wine and chocolates to be sent to our room! Room was the usual small London hotel room but decorated to a high standard and with a v comfortable bed. The best thing about this hotel, apart from the location, is the staff. Always friendly and helpful! I would highly recommend a visit!",5,2013,03,18
123,Afternoon Tea,"My family and I attended afternoon Tea on Mothers Day. Margaret who served us was warm, attentive and very friendly. The cakes and scones were very good but the sandwiches were somewhat disappointing. The bread was hard, they had obviously been sitting out for some time, which was such a shame as everything else was perfect.
Other then that a wonderful hotel and would definitely visit again.",4,2013,03,16
123,"Smart, modern comfortable hotel","It's hard to fault this smart modern comfortable hotel only a short walk from Bond St station and Oxford Street. Our superior room was spacious and comfortable (although it's hard to imagine a smaller bathroom) with all facilities, and the good wi-fi is now available free throughout the hotel. We only ate in the restaurant once, but food served in our room was good and efficiently served. The staff are exceptionally friendly and helpful, and we particularly appreciated the bottle of bubbly given us by a manager when we told him the reason for our visit. Our room averaged under £200 per night, which, while not cheap, we thought good value for what we got.",5,2013,03,13
123,"Excellent afternoon tea, would happily go back!","Friend and I had afternoon tea at the Marylebone Hotel and were well impressed by the offerings. The cakes, scones and bread were all of excellent quality and it was a nice touch to have the sandwiches on different types of bread, it made it a real fun experience.

The service too was absolutely fantastic with a very helpful waitress who let us smell the various loose leaf teas on option before we made our choice and even said that we could change to another flavour if we wanted another pot of tea after the first. 

Can't recommend this hotel high enough!",5,2013,03,12
123,What a super weekend,"Another grear weekend at the Marylebone, we brought friends who handnt stayed here before and were most impressed, its a great location for going anywhere. If you dont want to go into the city Marylebone high street is full of great shops, restaurants and bars so you can still have a chilling time.

checkin / checkout cold towels on checking in with fruit of the day and bottle of water on check out for your journey all complementary with a newspaper of your choice.

Breakfast is a relaxing experience with great service.

Already thinking of my next visit!",5,2013,03,12
123,Not good,"I'll keep it simple
- no concierge assistance 
- long bland check in
- small room
- noisy ineffective air con
- walls need looked at in bedroom 
- service felt very standard, not personal
Will not return to this hotel, sorry ",1,2013,03,10
123,our stay 09-10/02/2013,"My girlfriend booked this hotel as she had great experience in the past with this Hotel. As I usually stay in the Le Meridien Picadilly or Hyatt during my visits in London I was very surprised during my stay there. The staff is VERY friendly and attentively. Andreas from the Reception/Conierge desk managed to organize us two excellent seats for the ""Mamma Mia"" Musical at 4 pm Saturday afternoon.

Due to the nice staff, central but very quiet location of the hotel I would not hestitate to return to the Marylebone Hotel",5,2013,03,08
123,Great Service & Friendly Staff,"After a long days travel to Paris for business the friendly greeting at the hotel check in desk  was just what i needed ! The Staff where very helpful and arranged for a Macbook charger to be sent to my room. The late night room service was excellent and the rooms where comfortable, modern and clean.",4,2013,03,05
123,"It has it all,location,service, good price.","It was our second stay for three days this time.We stayed in a standard room which was small but cozy and it had everything,the heavenly bed,a big flat tv,boiler for coffee and tea,complimentary 2 bottles of water and candies everyday,cleaning twice a day,toiletteries,bathrobes and slippers and good central heating.The staff were very polite and eagar to help,especially the concierge(thanks for helping me with rail routes and charging of my laptop).
A couple of things for those coming for the first time.Bring an adaptor for your chargers  and do not mess with the fridge too long because it is a clever one and automatically charges you when you get things out of it.Fortunately at the reception they take your word for granded and charge only the ones consumed.I have not tried the breakfast nor the spa.",5,2013,03,05
123,Top Class Hotel,"I am just back from a 3 night stay in London, The Marylebone Hotel was superb, from the moment we arrived through the doors to the time we had to say goodbye, the service was impeccable. Every member of the team were welcoming and so helpful. Our room was spacious and the bathroom was the same, with a powerful shower. Each morning we enjoyed our breakfast where there was a great choice on offer. The leisure facilities were a bonus and offered gym and spa all under the one roof. We definitely will be back as the Marylebone made our visit to London. Keep up the good work!!!",5,2013,03,05
123,Great location and value for money.,I'd highly recommend this hotel. Rooms are a good size.Great value.Has tea making facilities. Easy walking distance to Oxford Street. I have stayed in many hotels in London and this hotel is the best value for money I have experienced.,5,2013,03,04
123,"excellent hotel, perfect location, great service","if you want to be in central london, close to bond street subway station, in a quiet plae with restaurant and shops close by, do not doubt to come to this one instead of others more close to oxford street. this is the best no doubts.",5,2013,03,02
123,Excellent Hotel,We cannot recommend this hotel highly enough. It was my partner's 40th birthday and he was made to feel really special. The staff are extremely friendly and accommodating with a real focus to detail on providing a memorable experience. We wouldn't normally recommend hotels however it would be unfair not to for this hotel. We would definitely stay again. Thank you all at the Marylebone Hotel for an excellent stay.,5,2013,03,01
123,Very Good Hotel,"Visited this hotel again in February,  seems to be the only place I stay in London at the moment.  Service and staff are really good and location is great for Central london,  hotel clean and stylish.  The hotel lobby is pleasant and the bar is very inviting.",5,2013,02,28
123,Great end to holiday,"This was my second visit to the hotel, spending one night while in transit back home from our honeymoon. The hotel is centrally located, is beautiful and most importantly offers an excellent service. The room we were allocated on the first floor was small but this is normal by London standards and had an ensuite shower. The hotel also offerred storage of our suitcases should we have wanted to free up space in the room. It was very comfortable and very tastefully decorated and included all amenities one would expect from a hotel of this category ie tea/coffee making facilities, bathrobes and slippers, ironing board, laundry facilities to mention a few. Bigger rooms are also available with larger bathrooms too having stayed in one such room on a previous visit. The breakfast is excellent and highly recommended. Would definitely return to this hotel.",5,2013,02,27
123,Best service I have ever received in a hotel,"I have just returned from a  memorable weekend in the London where I got engaged to my now Fiancée.  I have to say that the staff at the hotel did everything that could possibly have been done to make our stay comfortable, relaxing and more importantly memorable.  I have travelled to many hotels across Europe in my line of work over the past 15 years but have never received such a high level of friendly service like we received in the Marylebone.  
 
On check in they gave us a complimentary upgrade of our room and went above and beyond our expectations in making this occasion even more special.  I would have no problem in highly recommending this hotel to anyone who wishes to mark a special occasion.  A special thanks to Richard who right from the off looked after us so well and looked after all our needs.  
 
The hotels location too is perfect just off Oxford street and close to many famous attractions.
 
Thanks again to all the wonderful staff at the Marylebone hotel and we definitively hope to return soon.  
 
Paul and Angelina",5,2013,02,26
123,Nice Retreat,"Finally stayed in Marylebone Hotel. It caught my attention on a late ""drop in dinner"" some months ago, when I still received a very good dinner when all other places were closing doors.

Reception in the Hotel was very kind and personal.

 The superior room was nicely decorated, Nespresso machine, tea, bathrobe, sandals etc.

 Newspapers in the morning. (In case you want other then english newspapers, tell them) 

My room was on the first floor , patio side. For anyone wanting to stay more than a week-end I would recommend upper floors for additional day light. 

Mattress was not so convincing, for being a queen size bed (two people on one mattress) I would have preferred a more firm mattress, but for a week-end, it was ok.

Bathroom was more on the basic side, it would benefit from renovation (tiles, sanitary installation,  mouldy ceramic joints). Nice shampoo and bath gel though.

Wifi was functioning fast and reliable.

Breakfast was exceptional, with very convincing service.

Gym is very recommendable. Didn´t have time for Spa though.

Salons are very cosy and nicely decorated. Try to spend some time there, they are beautiful..

Got some great umbrellas to spend the day in rainy London. Thank you.

Hotel Restaurant is very good, I recommend it.",4,2013,02,25
123,Amazing hotel!!!,"Just back from a fantastic stay at this hotel. I informed the hotel that i booked this trip as an anniversary present for my partner,upon arriving we were upgraded to a beautiful suite and greeted with a bottle of champagne and a card.  The room was so lovely,so often in hotels in London the lobby may be nice but the rooms never match up,this was definitely not the case. The room was just as beautiful and as stylish as the rest of the hotel. The customer service was the best I have ever experienced, they really go above and beyond to make your trip enjoyable. The location is also fantastic, 5 minute walk from Oxford Street. I will be recommending this hotel to all my friends and family and would love to stay here again.",5,2013,02,25
123,Simply awesome,"We already know that rooms at London are small and functional, but this place gives larger rooms than usual with a beautiful new fashion style.

Located in a perfect place, close to the main shopping areas (Oxford and Regent Streets) and  Hyde Park in one of my favorites London neighborhoods.

It has a very good gym, much more than functional, if you are accostumed to train (weights and cardio) on a regular basis this gym will fit your needs.

In the other hand... the price. But I have to tell you that there are much more expensive hotels in London which are simply worst than this one.

I have been there many times, because my job and with my wife. And all the times and in all rooms my/our experience was awesome.

If you go with your couple and you can afford it don't think twice. If you go for business and your company can afford it... don't think twice as it is located close to a subway station, few stops from Victoria RailRoad station, connecting you fast and easily to any place you have to go to work.",5,2013,02,25
123,Best deal in London," The Marylebone combines the best of English service with a great location and provides an outstanding experience for a reasonable (for London) price. They manage it by offering small rooms but this is a good tradeoff for me as the rooms are well designed and perfectly serviced. Highly recommend.",5,2013,02,25
123,"Very rude, degrading reception behaviour","I had a business meeting at the Marylebone Hotel (we did not stay there) but I am still recovering from the shock of vulgar behaviour at the reception desk. In the most disgraceful manner I had been accused and threatened by a reception attendant – for something I had not done. He shouted, threatened - and insulted. I have it all on my mobile as he also left a message on my VM.

A quick, dry apology came about after a few hours but did not even begin to erase the shock and embarassment. I was shaken for a good few hours - not to mention that my meeting was ruined.",1,2013,02,25
123,Just ok,"Confusion on arrival between doormen and reception staff , they were all busy discussing something rather than look after waiting guests, then  Unfortunately i must have been given the smallest room in London when I recently stayed here, poor air con contributed to a sleepiness night, I waited exceedingly long time to be served tea in the lounge, altogether not what I expected.",2,2013,02,24
123,Seamless Business stay,"Checked into the Hotel on 18th for a early morning check out. Was very impressed with the friendly Staff and the seamless check in to check out the next day early morning. The concierge were extremely helpful with helping me out with a dinner booking at an excellent place nearby and assisting me with directions which was appreciated. The checkout was excellent with the thoughtful bottle of water, and they helped stow away my bags for a later pick up . Must make a special mention of  Mr. Rafael at the concierge who was extremely helpful throughout. Please continue the good service and i look forward to staying here the next time.",5,2013,02,24
123,Not quite boutique hotel but ideal for Marylebone High Street,"I chose this hotel as a last minute replacement for the Montcalm after having my booking cancelled due to an issue with the two adults plus one child capacity. I was really expecting alot from the hotel but apart from the really well designed bathroom, I wasn't that impressed. Sure it's clean & comfortable with free in-room wifi but I really expected more for this price. Nothing really glaringly wrong except for the lack of a real view but I just felt that there are better alternatives in central London within this price range. Location is ideal for Marylebone High Street.

If I could work out how I'd give the hotel 3.5 out of 5.

Just not my cup of tea.",3,2013,02,24
123,Should be no.1 hotel in london!,"In my honest opinion this hotel should be no.1 based on location/hospitality/service - for everything that you require to make a hotel stay a pleasant one, it has it all! A trip to London is made all the more ""special"" when you stay at ""The Marylebone"", we'll be back!!! Any other hotel just wouldn't ""come up trumps!""",5,2013,02,24
123,Stylish service - Classy Afternoon Tea,"What a brilliant find!  I went with a group of friends and was not sure what to expect. All I knew was we wanted somewhere to chat, eat and be merry. The Marylebone hotel was simply great great service - in fact 5* plus!!! The staff there really made us feel like royalty. Excellent customer service. 

The afternoon tea was great and beautifully presented. I loved the 'introduction to the tea'. Very clever idea. I have been to some great places for afternoon tea and maybe they had an edge with the food. To be honest for me the whole experience with friends counts. This did it for me! 2 for 1 at that - fab!!!!

123,Fantastic Afternoon Tea,"Amazing afternoon tea! Yesterday, it was my 5th afternoon tea in the last five month...And as always it was Brilliant!! Staff is very welcoming and professional. Barbara did an excellent job by explaining all the teas and food and taking care of us. Tea selection is very good and scones are top!!! Nami!! Location is really good and the atmosphere is very relaxing. Highly recommended!!",5,2013,02,24
123,Amazing afternoon tea!,"We had a fantastic afternoon tea at this hotel. We went on a special deal so were a little wary about what we would get, but shouldn't have worried at all. We were given a special room just for us, which was very comfortable and spacious. The server was lovely and explained the teas to us and let us sample them, and also explained the food to us. The tea was nice, but the food was fantastic! The desserts and scones in particular were amazing, and the sandwiches were really nice as well. We are definitely looking at coming back here ASAP.",5,2013,02,21
123,"Absolutely,consistently exceeds expectations!","Always welcoming,nice touch with handtowels at reception and water bottle as you check out....always comfortable beds and great buffet breakfast with extra polite and attentive service!We stay here 6 times a year at least and they always recognize us.Great discounts on local car parks too!",5,2013,02,21
123,Current favourite London hotel,"Beautifully designed. Impeccable service. Small but perfect modern-luxurious rooms. Highly recommended.

And here are some words to raise my review to the required 200 character minimum. characters, characters, characters etc.",5,2013,02,21
123,Service like a 7 star!,Service like the Grosvenor House. Alexa at reception should be a manager (helpful considerate and super efficient) and Rahim the concierge should be promoted-this hotel just gets better and better!!!! Never staying anywhere else,5,2013,02,20
123,Amazing Night,"My partner and I checked in at the Marleybone Hotel for Valentine’s day, we were greeted by lovely, friendly and polite staff and first impressions were great the hotel looked beautiful!

We were taken to our room to be pleasantly surprised by an upgrade! we were delighted. I had also requested to have bath which was also arranged !

Our room was clean, well presented, stylish and just what we wanted. later in the night we were given a complimentary bottle of Champagne with chocolate strawberry’s (as it was valentine’s day) making our night extra special. 

we loved the hotel and we will be returning!",5,2013,02,18
123,Now my regular London address,"Can't beat this for location maybe 10 minute easy walk down the street to Oxford St. I need to shop all the major London Dept Stores twice a year so this location is perfect.

The rooms are not big, but almost never get a big room in London unless hotels are slow and that is rare. Mattresses was not in good shape and spoke to GM about this and he said they were being replaced. The in room and the bathroom amenities are outstanding and everything is provided for. And they have outstanding Turkish towels which of course are the best.

Check in and staff are very, very accommodating and concierge as well. One really very nice feature is the amount of sitting room in the lobby very spacious and relaxing.

Also, suggest taking the breakfast plan as it is a lovely (to use a British word.)",4,2013,02,18
123,"perfect service, great staff","I was staying in the Marylebone Hotel from Jan 20 - Jan 24, 2013 in room 385.
It was again a perfect stay. Everyone from the staff was so friendly. A big thank you to Rahim the best concierge ever. As well the doorman Nail was amazing, excuse me if I wrote your name wrong. They  were great, always smiling means to me that they like their work, congratulations to the manager as you have a very great staff working for you.
The location is as perfect as it is close to Oxford Street but quite in the night. I was always outside during the day so I have had rs in the night...best burgers in town. 
I am sure that I will come back soon again whenever I have to stay in London. Big thank you and greetings from Switzerland.",5,2013,02,18
123,Outstanding stay,"Gorgeous funky hotel in fantastic location. I used to live on Welbeck Street many moons ago so coming back was a real treat. Had heard good things from a reliable friend and was in no way disappointed.  Individual stylish rooms on ground floor for relaxing in, gorgeous bedroom and friendly staff throughout. Delicious breakfast choice this morning which came quickly and was so fresh and tasty.  We will be returning in next few months as now new favourite.  Thanks Marylebone Hotel for a lovely stay and the teddy bear for my daughter.",5,2013,02,17
123,Good stay,"Stayed here for 1 night recently on a cold January evening. Check in was smooth and quick, we arrived before the check in time but they found a room available for us which was a great start. We were on the 5th floor at the end of the corridor, so the room was quiet.

The room was an okay size, decent heating system but the shower room was the smallest shower room we have ever seen. You could barely move in it without banging into something, so luckily as we were only staying one night it was bearable but I wouldn't like to use it for longer than one night (I would upgrade to a bigger room) also the wardrobe does not have space to hang a long coat.

We had afternoon cream tea in the lounge area which was lovely, and it was quite busy so had a nice atmosphere. Service was quick and friendly and the portion size was very good. We had a drink in the bar later in the evening before heading out and it was very busy and once again good friendly service.

We didn't get a chance to use the pool or the gym, but this is complimentary for hotel guests. We had the continental breakfast included in our rate and we aren't big breakfast eaters so this was sufficient for us, plenty on offer.

This was our first visit to this hotel and we really liked it, loved the location and we will certainly return.",4,2013,02,17
123,Exellent hotel in  pleasant area,"Stayed for five days, at first bizniz conferencing, private in the weekend. Very satisfactory stay, recommendable breakfast, nice front desk staff, pleasant night bar. Some difficulties with TV signals in the room at times, but not important. ",5,2013,02,17
123,Much Better This Time!!,"After our first experience at the above Hotel we were invited back to stay for a complimentary night with breakfast.
I have to stay this time the hotel was spot on, all staff were very friendly and our room very good. The Deputy Manager did go out of his way to ensure we had a good stay, which we did.  I particularly chose this Hotel originally because it is so central and I would certainly go back again.  Breakfast was very good only they did forget my husband's coffee!!  Never mind.",5,2013,02,17
123,"Great location, wonderful service","This hotel is in great location with a good selection of restaurants within walking distance.  The staff are fantastic, every person I had contact with was welcoming and helpful.  Room was small but extremely well appointed.  Take away coffee and croissants in the morning if you don't want a full breakfast.",5,2013,02,16
123,Positive surprise,"My first stay lasted three days in this hotel. The service was good everywhere, the premises looked fresh and clean. A good choice in central London. Only thing negative was a bit of noise just outside my room, close a service elevator. Change the door! I did not have time for a swim, but a colleague was very satisfied with the pool.",4,2013,02,15
123,"Great location, exceptional staff","Great location - Welbeck Street in the dark is uninspiring, but the hotel is warm and inviting, and you're so close to the heart of Marylebone. Great staff are the real differentiator - it's not unusual to meet 1 or 2 friendly, helpful people but everyone we met made us feel welcome. Superior rooms aren't huge, but they are quiet and nicely decorated and appointed. It's underplayed on the hotel website but the gym here is superb - 'The Third Place' is as good as David Lloyd etc. and has an 18m pool.",5,2013,02,14
123,5th Year Staying Here,"I stay here on business trips to London every six weeks or so. I choose this hotel because the staff are FABULOUS. Always the same crowd, always very helpful, and interested in the guests. The public spaces are very comfortable. The rooms small -- but so what? The prices are appropriate. If I have time, I try to have the tea and scones. Also fabulous. Improvements after 5 years of coming here? I can't take the frantic check-in any more! For reasons I just don't understand, the check-in process is always complicated, and hectic. and too loud. Also, sadly, I have stopped going down for the really excellent breakfast because one is asked so many questions about your room and what breakfast plan you (don't) have by the staff, and forced into the table I never want, that it is just not a relaxing way to start the day. Pity, because as I say, the Irish breakfast is otherwise a must. But Marylebone High Street is just behind the hotel, so tons of choices there. Great, great hotel in all other respects. Best Concierge in London. Thank you!",5,2013,02,14
123,Beautiful,"We stayed at Marylebone Hotel between 26- 30 December. We had a really warm welcome, small but very nice room (Executive Deluxe), clean and elegant.
the Hotel is just 5 minutes walk from Oxford Street. 
Ill stay again in my next visit.",5,2013,02,14
123,disappointing,"Booked Superior room for three nights. Looked impressive from the photos. Room very very small. Ordered room service, room entrance so narrow that the girl had to walk at a sideways angle. Bathroom again very small with a nice shower but same leaked all over the floor. Restaurant food , looked lovely but had to be returned as it was stone cold. A real let down. 
One plus though that the staff were lovely.",3,2013,02,13
123,Excellent!,"A terrific hotel in every possible way.  

The standard of service is exceptional, staff are extremely efficient, professional and friendly.  We loved the courtesy call from reception about 10 minutes after we had arrived to check that the room was to our satisfaction and the offer of an umbrella when we were leaving on a very wet day.

The hotel décor is wonderfully elegant and modern throughout.  Our room was delightful, fresh and inviting. I would concede that it was not the biggest hotel room I have ever stayed in however it was most definitely one of the nicest and came stocked with slippers (a very disappointing omission from even 5 star hotels), the best hair dryer I have ever used in my life and still and sparkling bottled water with the turn down.

Personally, I find choosing a hotel in London can be such a gamble especially as the star rating often means nothing but my goodness this hotel is an absolute gem.  Cannot wait to return and have in fact already made a reservation for some of the family to stay in April.

Great location, fantastic staff and wonderful surroundings.  Book it!",5,2013,02,13
123,Excellent hotel,"Stayed here last weekend had an amazing stay- Great location.

Staff were so friendly and helpful could not fault them at all. Hotel is decorated lovely. Gym facilities were really impressive.

Rooms were quiet which is great to ensure a good nights sleep and the turn down service was a really nice touch.

Was my first visit to London but when I'm back the Marylebone will definitely be my hotel of choice!!!",5,2013,02,12
123,Perfect Hotel and Great Location,"I was attending a 2 day course at the Royal Society of Medicine and the Marylebone Hotel was the perfect location for me to stay for one night. On arrival the check in was very slick and the staff were very friendly and efficient. I was pleased to have received a complementary room upgrade. The room was excellent and very quiet so guaranteed a good nights sleep. I enjoyed using the swimming pool, sauna and steam room, unusual for a central London Hotel.
I met up with family who live in London and ate at the 108 restaurant and we had a very enjoyable meal. A varied menu with a perfect range of choices. Breakfast was also a pleasurable experience with a freshly cooked full English breakfast and attentive, polite staff.
I would thouroughly recommend the Marylebone for anyone looking for a central London Hotel with great facilities and location. It will be top of my list when I am next in town.

123,Excellent! Excellent! Excellent!,"We stayed back in November to celebrate my partners birthday, I can honestly say it was one of the best Hotel experiences I have ever had ( and I have stayed in many in my time)  Nothing was too much trouble, lovely room professional friendly staff who without exception went the extra mile.  Our room was not quite ready and without hesitation we were given a token for a complimentary cocktail.  When we came back from our trip to the Theatre a birthday card and some chocolates had been placed in our room-- a really nice touch.  Finally, one of the nicest Hotel breakfast's I've ever had.

It will always be the Marylebone for all our trips to London from now on!",5,2013,02,09
123,Frustrated at reception,"I have stayed here a number of times and I can't believe I have not commented on it before. In fairness I will start with the positives. The location is very good, lots of nice restaurants and coffee shops near by and close to the shopping in Oxford street and little boutiques everywhere. The bar is nice and has a good atmosphere as does the lobby area and all the nooks and crannies to have tea and relax. There is a health club. It is a good value hotel for London, it isn't first class.
The bad bits are some of the rooms. There are 257 I believe and they run from tiny to satisfactory. Today I have eventually checked In to a small room which is fine but the bathroom is a disgrace, it's so small. This is the second room as the first one I was given was directly behind the lift and you can here the mechanism every time it moved! It was bigger, as was the bathroom but I could not stand the noise.
Reception are very friendly except when there is a problem and really they do not deal very well with complaints. Three staff members stared at me in bewilderment when I commented on the bathroom size. I had to replace the key card for new room TWICE and I had to go down 3 floors and a long walk because it would not work. 
Stay here for location, choose your room carefully and try not to frighten the reception staff.",3,2013,02,08
123,Politeness and service,"I travelled to London on business. The first thing that impressed me was the warm welcome at the Reception and the speed as well as freindliness of the staff there as they went through the process of registering me in.
The accommodation was very good. 
The breakfast was not only good but the same politeness and readiness to serve characterised the staff there as well.
Overall it was an excellent experience.",5,2013,02,07
123,1 night -Perfect,"My husband and I spent 1 night recently at the Marylebone Hotel and totally enjoyed our stay .  This hotel ticks all the boxes..excellent welcoming staff, lovely room and excellent breakfast. Because our stay was so short we did not get a chance to use all the facilities but we certainly intend staying at this hotel when we make our next trip.The location of the hotel is perfect as it is so near Oxford Street and the Bond Street Tube station in one direction and Marylebone in the other. Many thanks to all the staff .",5,2013,02,05
123,Amazing boutique hotel,"A real pearl central situated near Oxford/Piccadilly with great staff, stunning interior design and a huge spa / fitness centre. I warmly recommend, the only ""negative"" point (as in quite much city hotels): the Superior Rooms are quite small. Apart from that I really enjoyed my stay.",5,2013,02,05
123,Brilliant hotel in a fab location,"We just spent one night here this past weekend and it was a wonderful experience! I searched for a long time to find a good hotel in London that wasn't prohibitively expensive and I'm so pleased to have found one. The rooms were clean, quiet and very nicely decorated. The public areas all looked lovely and the barman made a mean mojito! The location is fab, only minutes from Oxford Street, Marylebone High Street and all the lovely shops, restaurants and bars. What really made our stay special though was the staff, they absolutely gave 5 star service. Everyone who worked here was friendly, courteous and professional. Anca on the front desk was particularly lovely, on hearing it was my husband's birthday, we were immediately upgraded, given complimentary cocktail tickets and wine was sent up to our room! A lovely hotel and we will definitely stay here again next time we're in London.",5,2013,02,05
123,a home away from home,"This was my third time in London and the occasion has been my wife 60 birthday. I am a Travel agent for the past 14 years specialising in internatioonal leisure travelling. I choose the Marylebone part thanks to feedback from my clients,part due rewiew in trypadvaisor and part being the location close (but not on) to oxford street and the bond street tube as in this way we could avoid the perennial noises of oxford street that carry on at night as well. From the start I was very pleased with my choise as the staff was very fryendly and did their best to satisfay our needs and help us with suggestions in reffer to how better move around town.
I made a reservation to a superior room and got upgraded to a deluxe room and that was a fantastic accomodation for a weeek in London. The english brekfast that is served at the hotel with the basic continental brekfast is defenitly more than anybody can eat (I grow up in Italy and I know somthing about food and taste)and the variety ensure that nobody could leave the brekfas unsatisfied.I will defenetly reccomand this hotel to my clients as I did even before I personally was lucky to enjoy such hospitality.
By the way I personally for 5 years in my Kibbutz had implemented and directer a bed and brekfast resort and I can appriciate the effort needed to obtain such level of service.

My deepest gratitude for making our stay in London unforgettable.",5,2013,02,05
123,A Perfect Vacation,"My husband and I spent 4 nights at the Marylebone Hotel.  He had already been in London for work and I was meeting him for a long weekend, having never visited the city before.  I had emailed Frits, the manager a few times before my stay, asking questions about room size and directions to reach the hotel.  He was extremely helpful in answering all of my questions.

I arrived at the hotel early in the day, before the normal check-in time after an overnight flight.  I had let the hotel know this in advance and they had said that they would put me in a room early if one was available.  Well, they did even better than that.  We were upgraded to a larger room on the top floor.  The room was beautifully maintained, the bed was really comfortable and we had plenty of space to spread out. 

While I was still downstairs, waiting for my room (maybe a 10 minute wait), the front desk staff set me up with a cold drink in the lounge and Frits came out from his office after he must have seen on the computer that I had just checked in, to meet me.  I felt so welcome and happy to be there.

The little touches were wonderful.  From a fruit plate sent up to water and chocolates with turn down service, everything was perfect.

The location of the hotel cannot be beat.  A 5 minute walk to the Tube, easy access to all the major sights, whether on foot or public transportation, and a porter who went out of his way to find a taxi for us one night.

I look forward to visiting London again, and when I do, I will absolutely be staying at the Marylebone!",5,2013,02,01
123,Excellent Hotel Better than 5-stars hotels,"This is the 5th time we have stayed at the Marylebone Hotel which is becoming like second home even for the few days we stay every year. We will be definitely staying there whenever we visit London every year. The hotel is located 5 minutes from Oxford street and from the minute you enter it you feel its coziness, nice smell, warm atmoshere and luxury. The porters, the reception staff, the breaksfast manageress, the housekeepin staff, the gym reception staff and the people serving breakfast are so polite and helpful. 

I travel 2-3 times a month and stay at 4 and 5 stars hotels so i can compare. I have not found a better service in any of the otther hotels i stayed. This hotel is really a model when it comes to customer service and attention to customer needs. The people are so helpful always with a smile making you feel great. I would suggest that other hotels send their satff there to experience the customer service and be trained through such experience. I am sure this customer service starts from the very top (here i have to thank Mr Garreth Walsh) and has been instilled to all hierrachy of the hotel staff. This is how all business should function with regards to customer service.

Breakfast is excellent! Spoilt for choice! and the people serving you always with smile and asking you if you need anything else.

The swimming pool and spa are great and the gym huge with state-of-the-art machines. 

The rooms are excellent with very confortable beds.

We stayed in room 642 from 24th January - 30th January 2013 (6 nights) and all people at reception, housekeeping, gym reception and breaksfast room were great to us during all days. They really deserve to be given credit by the management team because they do really make this hotel unique.

We highly recommend this hotel and look forward to our next visit to london and stay at the hotel

123,"Great location, good value, friendly staff, tiny bathroom","Stayed for one night in December for Christmas shopping. Chose it for location, price and after comparing reviews.  It exceeded my expectations.  The staff are great, the public spaces are very comfortable and the bar is lively.  The room was small but well designed with good quality modern fittings and furnishings.  The only problem was the bathroom: the inward opening door passes through the entire standing space; I am small and still found the arrangement very awkward.  If the bathroom had a sliding door there would be no issue.",4,2013,01,31
123,Almost perfect,"We stayed at the Marylebone Hotel for 3 nights last week.  Checking in, the people at the front desk were very warm and welcoming.  The room was small but very comfortable and clean.  The heating system did not work well, but they did attempt to repair it.  The lobby has many seating areas which make it pleasant to just relax with a drink and a newspaper.  A problem arose when I called the concierge for the phone number of American Airlines.  After I called the number she gave me I was presented with a bill for 38 pounds for the call. I had never been forewarned that this wasn’t a toll free call. After much haggling, they reduced the charge to 19 pounds.  The night assistant front desk manager took a particularly hard line and made little effort to be accommodating.  If not for that, I would give this hotel a resounding 4 star rating.  Special kudos to Gunther and Celia at the front desk.  If I owned a hotel they would be my first hires.",4,2013,01,28
123,"Great Hotel, Best Location","I stayed at this hotel several times years ago when it was called Jury's Clifton Ford, and it was a total disaster. I put up with it because it's such a fantastic location. 

But now it's under new ownership (Doyle Group), and it's great. The staff are energetic and helpful, the rooms are clean and very adequate, room service is efficient, the new restaurant's very good, and the location's perfect.  Marylebone High Street, with every convenience, is one block away. It's about 4 blocks to Selfridges and Marks and Spencer Oxford Street. New Bond Street is a 5 minute walk. It's also close to Harley Street and anybody visiting the American Intercontinental University in Marylebone.

I'll continue to stay here when in London.",4,2013,01,28
123,Very good Hotel,"The staff are fabulous at the Marylebone Hotel - everything else is very good in key areas Cleanliness, comfort, food availability and of a very good standard - The location of this hotel is excellent for Oxford St - Bond St - Importantly for me is it's next door to Harley St and all at a very good price - Many thanks and congratulations to you all",5,2013,01,27
123,great hotel,"stayed here already a couple of times, stay 200 nights in hotels in a year, this is in my top 3. Excellent rooms and service.
The place makes you feel at home..everybody is very friendly.Try even to speak your mother tongue if possible. the rooms have everything you need on a business trip",5,2013,01,27
123,Do I have to tell everyone how much I like this hotel?,"I am a regular and finnicky business traveler to London.  I have searched and searched for the right combination of style, quiet, location, amenities and service.  Marylebone has it all.  Often very hip hotels are so darn loud, you can't sleep!  Here, the rooms are very quiet, both from street noise and from noise generated by public areas in the hotel.  Gym?  Pack your bathing suit, cause the beautiful indoor pool opens at 6:30.  Do I have to tell management that NO hotel lets guests take fitness classes for free? I have enjoyed yoga and other classes as a hotel guest.  Business center?  Always open, nicely furnished, easy to use and access.  Breakfast?  Lots of fresh fruit, goodies, cereals. Young, energetic staff wants to please.  I couldn't be happier.  Don't tell your friends.",5,2013,01,27
123,The Very Best,"Excellent hotel in every way.  Friendly and efficient staff providing first rate service throughout.  Ideal venue in Central London, slightly away from the buzz, offering relaxation and serenity.  Superb food and pleasant restaurant decor with more than a homely touch.  Nice bar and pleasant range of comfortable lounges and quiet corners.  Room was perfect and room service was very good.  Accommodates guests on business and those on leisure equally well and provides a balance.  Very clean and tidy and everything seems to work just right.  Lots of attention paid to individual guest requirements.  The very best hotel and highly recommended.",5,2013,01,26
123,Afternoon tea,"Just had afternoon in this well hidden hotel. Lovely treat, smooth background music, professionnal service. Small mistake on the bill corrected straight away when spotted. Thank you very much Barbara!",5,2013,01,25
123,Good hotel - nice rooms great staff,"I am a regular visitor to the Marylebone Hotel. The front desk are great and as a regular visitor they always greet you by name even if it is a few weeks since your last stay. The rooms are all very nicely furnished in a comfortable contemporary style. I don't often have dinner in the hotel as I am often out for business dinners but the breakfasts are great and cater for all tastes from the full english to a great buffet spread. 

Recommended for a stay in the west end and the very village feeling of Marylebone High Street which is on your door step.",4,2013,01,24
123,Lucky enough to stay here every week!,"I am lucky enough to stay at this hotel on a weekly basis and it never fails to disappoint. The staff always remember my name and I am greeted in a genuine manor. The front desk are always efficient, friendly and really are a pleasure to deal with! 

The rooms are great, never had a bad room yet. Spacious, bright and I always get a great night sleep! 

The gym and pool are incredible and I use it every week. It really is the best gym in London so very lucky to have it as part of the hotel. 

My only slight gripe is the room service. I don't eat meat and try to avoid gluten as much as possible and there are no options. I have tried asking for different options; fish fillet etc but they will not cater to it. Most frustrating when I stay there every week. 

Other than that I can not recommend this hotel more highly! If you do stay regularly then make sure you join the GHA discovery loyalty scheme... One of the best loyalty schemes around. I also stay at their sister hotel in Bristol regularly and can also recommend that!",5,2013,01,24
123,"Great location, good atmosphere, small rooms","I have stayed here a couple of times over the past yrs. I appreciate the good, stylish atmosphere and the great location. Despite its elegant design, the atmosphere is very warm and pleasant. A lot of locals share some of the hotel facilities and it really is a nice and cosy place. The rooms are rather small (even the suites) which you will find in most hotels in London. The decors is pleasant, stylish and modern. Bathrooms can be very small. Depending on your room type, you may find the walls thin which may or may not bother you at night. Breakfast is fabolous in the hotel restaurant and food was excellent for dinner as well (the place gets lively in the evening which adds to the nice atmosphere). Friendly, well trained staff. I will come back.",4,2013,01,24
123,So Friendly and Helpful,"Nothing is too much trouble for any of the staff.  All are very quick to help and find solutions to any problems. Very friendly reception, concierge and doorman.  Rooms smart.  Ideally located for the village atmosphere of Marylebone High Street as well as being a stone's throw from Oxford Steet at the Selfridges end.  We always stay at this hotel when in London having tried others in the vicinity.",5,2013,01,24
123,Great gym. Average rooms,A central London hotel with a superb gym.  Pity the rooms are so small. However the service is very good and the concierge and front desk staff a delight. Very well situated and in very good condition. Well done,3,2013,01,24
123,What an extremely pleasant experience,"I stayed here with my girlfriend for one night on the 18/1/13. It was amazing. The staff were all so friendly and helpful without exception. The room was outstanding, very spacious & very comfortable. We had a slight problem working the coffee machine out and within 5 minutes there was a member of staff there helping us who then brought us extra coffee pods! Only thing I could comment on was I was woken up at 5am from the next room as it seemed I could here a lot of their noise and their sinks etc. But that's just being picky. We had lunch in the hotel and both had Steak ciabatta and chips. It was delicious & great value. We used the swimming pool facilities and the pool was a bit chilly due to the cold weather and snow but the lovely steam room kept us warm. Unfortunately we had no time to use the gym facilities but they looked very impressive and had a lot of state of the art equiptment. We were gutted we only had one night and can't wait for our next stay! The hotel, the rooms, the facilities & the staff all made for such a special experience.",5,2013,01,23
123,A wonderful place to stay,"I have just returned from my fourth stay at this hotel. It just gets better. It has a warm, friendly atmosphere, and the staff is outstanding. I like the restaurant/bar, and the social areas surrounding the lobby make it possible to stop for a coffee or a drink in a convenient spot. My room was lovely, and the service was perfect. It's so convenient to Oxford Street and also to the charming Marylebone High Street. You have a sense of neighborhood, but you're so close to all the major sites in London. I am planning my next trip and wouldn't stay anywhere else.",5,2013,01,22
123,Great Hotel,"Had a family weekende at this fantastic hotel. 
Location was great. Near shopping in Regent/Oxford street. Marelybone is a vey nice area in itself. The area is also very quiet. The hotel has a lot of great facilities with gym, swimmingpool, bars etc.
The staff was really friendly  and the service was fantastic. We got a very warm welcoming and the staff was always there to help.
This is my new favorite hotel in London and I will recomend it to all my friends in Norway. Will definitly stay here again.
Thank you for doing our stay so great !",5,2013,01,22
123,Super comfort,"Great location, great rooms and best of all a fantastically comfortable bed.  This is a classy hotel that I have walked pass many a time and quite Tardis-like in that it is bigger on the inside than the out! It exudes restrained good taste. A very brief overnight stay but would be hit on my shortlist for a future occasion. Nespresso machine in rooms and free WiFi a bonus.",5,2013,01,22
123,"Most excellent staff, and a great place to stay!","When stuck with Heathrow snow chaos and a series of cancelled flight, the staff was going out of their way to help me rescheduling and reorganizing and made me feel very well taken care of - they were truly amazing, special thanks to Alixandra!!! On top of the people being incredibly caring and flexible, my room was great, the breakfast buffet extensive and very good, the lounge a nice place to hang out at, and all this in a quiet little street in the midst of London! This jewel was recommended to me by a friend, and I will definitely come back here the next time I'm in town.",5,2013,01,22
123,Great Surprise at a Great Location,"Considering its somewhat somber facade, and having stayed there before it had gone through renovations, It is now a surprisingly great facility - reception, rooms, gym, restaurant and bar are all up to scratch. Reception and restaurant staff were always very friendly and helpful. Mix that with a great Mayfair location, it is recommended.",5,2013,01,18
123,Amazing!,"My boyfriend needed to come to London for work and his father secured us a room at this hotel...After many flight delays and walking in the rain we finally made it to the hotel! We were greeted by the friendliest doorman ever and proceeded to the reception area to get our keys. The woman working the front desk told us that unfortunately the room wasn't ready yet...to make up for it she gave us vouchers to get a free drink at the bar! So unexpected and lovely! After having a drink at the amazing bar(bartender was also super friendly) we were given our keys and taken to our room which just so happened to be the penthouse suite! We had no idea! This room is GORGEOUS! Neither of us have ever stayed in such a nice room.The entire staff was so incredibly helpful and kind...We seriously never want to leave! 
The location is also great. Just minutes away from Oxford street, but not close enough to constantly hear all the noise and traffic.",5,2013,01,18
123,great hotel,"good hotel . good location most of all fantastic staff,nothing too much trouble,spent a weekend in october and again in jan.the staff really friendly and helpful will go again next time in london;great location for shopping also soho and covent garden in15 minutes.marylebone high street also agood place to eat plenty of pubs.",5,2013,01,17
123,Honeymoon Stay Outstanding,"We stayed for our honeymoon night on Friday 11th Jan. All I can say is the hotel is fantastic, their customer service is something many other hotels need to take note of. We were made so very welcome. Decor great. Staff wonderful. Breakfast fabulous. Cocktails brilliant. Location so very central. Spa facilities aimed at the after work busy exec rather than a relaxing time and the pool felt chilly, we didn't hang around. But sofas, papers, magazines, chilled out vibe, teas and coffees all at your disposal for relaxing in the lounge areas. Upgraded to a fab suite which was quite small but just lovely. The bathroom was big but had one of those fixed glass screens which mean it's a bit difficult to keep clean all the way round the bath and that showed which had we paid top price for might have been a niggle. But the rest of the room was fabulous. Location was fantastic. Contiental breakfast was exceptional, such a choice and lovely staff. It was definately the staff that made our stay. They were incredible.",5,2013,01,16
123,Great location and good price,Very smart hotel in a great location especially for shopping and galleries. Nice decor and very calm atmosphere. Would recommend it without hesitation. Very quiet area at night time so a good night's sleep not a problem.,4,2013,01,15
123,Service plus,"I have stayed here before and have alway senjiyed the location, ambience and rooms. This time they seem to have upped their game even more. Every member of staff went out of their way to make sure our every neeed was met. We usually holiday in 5 star hotels, and have not been served better in any of them.
We arrived early, and were give vouchers for 2 free drinks to help us pass the time, so we went to the bar leaving our bags with reception. By the time we had enjoyed the drinks and a light lunch, the barman told us we had been allocated a room. We went back to reception to pick up the keys and luggage, but the luggage had already been taken up for us. As I said - 5* service.
They noticed that we were there exactly one year after our previous stay, so I told them that we werere married from there last year, and were returning to celebrate our anniversary. When we checked out they waived our bar bill as a thank you for returning.   A charming and thoughtful surprise.
See you next year!",5,2013,01,15
123,Peace and Quiet,"My Sister and I stayed at The Marylebone on the night of our work Christmas Party. We found the staff to be very welcoming, attentive and nothing seemed too much trouble. Our room was very quiet,comfortable and spotlessly clean. We had everything we needed, tea/coffee, iron etc and housekeeping were very quick when we requested some extra still water. The only criticism we would have is the shower room was a bit small, albeit it with a lovely shower and beautiful essential oil toiletries so only a minor moan. We would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone visiting or on a shopping trip to London, perfect for Oxford Street or the quieter Marylebone High Street.",4,2013,01,13
123,We'll be back!,"Very well situated in a quiet street just a very few hundred meters from the West End's shopping turmoil the hotel may not be an architectural landmark but once you step inside....just look at their website:what you see there is what you actually get!The staff were welcoming and smiling after already having helped us over the phone with a reservation issue due to a cancelled flight.Our room (147), although superior, was rather compact and didn't have what you call ""a view"" but it didn't lack any of the amenities you might expect.Now, if you need space you may want to upgrade.Express,Continental or full English breakfast: lots of choice and good quality well worth the price.The Health Club,Pool and Spa is far beyond what you can find on most hotel premises, take our fitness enthusiasts' word for it.Throw in free fast WIFI throughout the hotel,complimentary mineral water in the room,a choice of free newspapers at breakfast,fine toiletries and more towels and bathrobes than there are hooks and hangers and you get a perfect place to stay.We are returning customers and will be!",5,2013,01,13
123,Oasis in the heart of the West End,"My wife treated me to a surprise stay at the Marylebone, after eating at a nearby restaurant. It was a memorable stay - we were immediately upgraded to a superior room. The service was impeccable, my wife had to change clothes for dinner, and found the room all made up again for my arrival! She had mentioned it was a surprise birthday stay, and the Front Office had thoughtfully supplied us with a bottle of bubbly on ice, and a handwritten birthday card. Very nice touch - above the call of duty.

The bar and restaurant on the ground floor is plush and well-stocked, as we know from previous visits. The pool as part of The Third Space was empty when we went for an evening swim, so we had the place all to ourselves.
For the last day, we treated ourselves to a massage in the spa - it was very comfortable and pleasant, and the masseuse asked us if there was anything special that needed doing, and customised the message to our needs. All very good.
The checkout was efficient and unhurried, like the rest of the service.
This is a great hotel to stay in if you want some peace near bustling Oxford Street!",5,2013,01,12
123,Excellent - the perfect place to stay in London,"We spent 3 nights at The Marylebone Hotel between Christmas & New Year & thoroughly enjoyed our stay. From the excellent efficient welcome & upgrade to a Deluxe room to the quick & easy checkout - we couldn't fault anything. Even the cost was Very reasonable! 
The room was a good size for London with a huge comfortable bed, a nice walk in area to store bags & put out clothes, hair dryer, iron, nespresso coffee machine, large flat screen tv & iPod player. Add to this a lovely bathroom with all the amenities - then we had no complaints.
We also had afternoon tea in one of the many lounges in the hotel - this was excellent (& we've tried many afternoon teas in London) & at £19 per head it was a very good price.
We didn't try the restaurant but the bar was nice & comfortable & the snack we had was nice.
The hotel also has complimentary coffee/snacks at various times of the day in the lobby.
It is very near the main shopping streets but is very quiet & when we come back to London we would be very happy to stay there again.",5,2013,01,12
123,Genuinely friendly staff & a beautiful hotel,"I've stayed here on business a few times over the past few months, and every time I am met with genuinely nice staff who do not fake their interest in guests, but genuinely seem to enjoy their job and go out of their way to help you.

The warm welcome and the beautifully decorated rooms and lobby make this hotel feel luxurious and welcoming.    Room size can vary. I have stayed in a very small room which involved moving furniture to draw the curtains, however on the whole this is rare. 

The only down side is the fact they charge so much for breakfast and the breakfast is so poor value. I prefer a cooked breakfast, however you can pay over £20 for one item. I paid £23 for an omelette that wasn't even tasty.  Unlike other hotels where you pay extra for a cooked option, you do not then have the option to choose multiple things from the hot menu. You only get one!   The buffet option is poor.   I'd advise eating breakfast elsewhere. 

Apart from that, this is a great hotel. I just hope it stops raising it's room prices so often.",5,2013,01,11
123,Always enjoy staying here!,"Was down in London on business and had a couple of meetings at the hotel so I thought it made sense to stay here. I have stayed plenty of times in the past few years and always enjoyed it. It's a real treat place to stay as I generally find it quite expensive.

The location of the hotel is great. Marylebone High Street is a lovely area to shop in - loads of independent shops/cafes etc plus a few high street chains, but not too many.
I would recommend 'Bonne Bouche' for breakfast if you don't have it in the hotel.
A few minutes walk from the hotel is St Christophers Place, James Street and Oxford Street. The Underground (Bond Street) is about 10 minutes walk from the hotel.

As I went for the cheapest possible option for a room this time, I was given a standard small double. The room was small and cosy and bed comfortable was good quality bedding. It had a full en-suite, this was small but had all the facilities needed. Everything about this hotel is high quality but it is expensive. The TV in the bedroom was modern but a bit 'fiddly' and awkward to use.

The downstairs lounge and bar areas are lovely with loads of comfy chairs and sofas to relax in. The hotel bar is modern and chic and is ideal to have a drink in before going out in to town.

All the staff that I spoke to were friendly and professional.

I would stay here again happily but only if I've saved up!",4,2013,01,11
123,2 night stay in London,"I have used this hotel many times for business and accomodation.  This was the first trip I made with my family.  At check in Antje had obviously checked through guest arriving that day and had recognised my name and organised an upgrade to a one bedroom suite with an adjoining double room.  The accomodation was fantastic, luxurious, private and very spacious.  We were also given a fruit bowl later in the day and provided with discount vouchers for the spa at reception.  The staff throughout were very helpful and its location is second to none.  The leisure centre got well used and from a childrens point of view they could nothave had a better time.  The breakfast was excellent on both mornings and on the second day the staff remembered orders from the previous day.  Unlike other trips the bar was not well used but while quiet it was very comfortable.
I have stayed at the other two Doyle properties in London previous and they are excellent hotels but definitely the Marylebone suits all our needs,  leisure and business.  I have recommended it to many colleagues and friends and will continue to do so!",5,2013,01,08
123,Immaculate,"A well located hotel in the heart of fashionable Marylebone; where the staff is highly efficient and helpful; and the accommodation spotless, at prices that compare well with prices of London hotels in good locations. I did not partake of food at the hotel so am in no position to comment on that.",5,2013,01,07
123,"Water, water everywhere...","We wanted to like this hotel, we really did.  However, apart from the terrific location, there were several issues that prevented this...

The first room we occupied was quite nice, except that the windows - which were closed - leaked copious amounts of rainwater.  Judging from the condition of the windowsills, this was not a new problem.  Upon reporting the problem, We were offered the choice of remaining in the room for a week - although repairs during the rain and holidays could not be guaranteed - or be moved to another room, which we did.

The second room - an upgrade to a junior suite on the top floor - had windows that did not leak, but they also did not function - only opening a scant millimeter, instead of the ""4 inches"" advertised.  The exterior of the hotel is all glass-enclosed, and obviously flawed in design, if these two rooms are any indication.  

The second room also featured a poorly-designed sink faucet - it was too short, and when turned on, water constantly flowed all over the counter.  In addition, when either the sink or toilet was used, the plumbing made an extremely loud noise that did not stop until faucet was turned off or toilet had finished refilling its tank.  The sink did not drain properly, taking several minutes to empty even a small amount of water
.  
We did not find the pillows comfortable - hard, lumpy feather pillows, obviously past their prime - but the bed itself and linens were fine. The room itself was kept clean, though the heating system threw out clouds of dust - it had obviously not been maintained on a regular basis.  As a result, we chose not to use it.

The swimming pool area is badly in need of rehab - overhead pipes constantly dripping into the pool water, obvious leaks and many stains along most of the walls, badly-stained wooden walkways around the pool.  Though the pool water was chlorine-free, the water temperature was kept uncomfortably cold.  The one plus was that children are only allowed at certain times, giving them time to cut loose and enjoy themselves, while also allowing several hours of refuge for serious swimmers and those attempting to relax.  

The very young, very attractive staff members were either overly-anxious to please or very obviously not happy to be working in this hotel.  There seemed to be ""no grownups in charge"", and  emails were addressed  using first names only, which was unprofessional.  To be clear, we only complained about the first room - realizing that probably nothing more could or would be done about the various problems we encountered, given the weather, holidays or general state of management of the place.  The lobby was nice, and the English breakfast was fine, though  pricey,  The Continental alternative seemed adequate, though one could do much better for the money by eating in any number of places a block away.

Long story short - this hotel is badly in need of renovation and maintenance, and does not deserve its ""luxury"" status.  As it stands, it is not a good value for the money.  The only real plus is the location, though there are many hotels nearby that would probably be better choices.  The pool would have been a plus, but had a negative effect, instead.  Would we return?  Certainly not in the near future, and definitely not in the rainy season!",2,2013,01,06
123,Flawless!,"Staying over new year, we had expected the hotel to be quiet but it was pretty much fully occupied. The staff were extremely welcoming both at reception and the main entrance. We arrived well before normal check in time before our room was ready but the check in staff insisted this was not a problem and that we leave our luggage. They said it would be in our room when we returned after some retail therapy and it was! The room was spotless and very nicely appointed. Even the decor was blemish free with no scuffs on the walls or marks on the carpets. Tastefully furnished with everything you could possibly want or expect in a four star hotel. Unusually these days, there was a 'turn down' service around 7pm which we have never experienced at any four star hotel anywhere in recent years. They even placed mints on the pillows ... nice touch! The bathroom was very compact but well fitted with quality features including plenty of premium toiletries. Even the corridors were immaculate and rich in feel. Really couldn't fault the hotel or location which is ideal for shoppers and theatre fans alike. This is a very smart, well managed and clean hotel with very friendly staff. I doubt you could do better at the price level, so get booking.",5,2013,01,05
123,"Good location, elegant, pleasant staff, tiny room","We enjoyed much of another return visit to the Marylebone, well situated close to the eponymous High Street, the better end of Oxford Street and multiple public transport options.  

The public areas are elegant and comfortable and the staff were as usual pleasant and efficient.

The big downside was that our ‘superior double’ room appeared to be a tiny converted closet, which was not even connected to the central heating system (heating came from a noisy stand-alone fan device).  There was a small bed, one chair and one bedside table.  The bathroom was equally tiny.  Sold as a single, this room could optimistically be called ‘compact’.  As a double, perhaps the best descriptor would be ‘intimate’.   As we are familiar with the variable room sizes in this hotel, we had booked a ‘superior’ and the Front Desk confirmed that ours was indeed such a room.  One wonders what a ‘standard’ room would look like.  

We still think well of the Marylebone in many ways but recommend that guests check their room size before confirming and that couples avoid 622 unless they are really good friends.",3,2013,01,05
123,Excellent service and reasonable rates (for central London),"The Marylebone is an extremely fine first-class hotel, in a very fashionable area of central London and with friendly, attentive service.  Although probably a quasi- “boutique hotel,” it has none of the all-too-precious pretensions of similar properties, and lacks the snootiness of many of the established English hotels.  The décor is a modern, but warm style, with several spacious sitting areas, an agreeably priced breakfast (16 GBP for a nice continental buffet), a very adequate gym, and a comfortable, inviting bar and restaurant, which neighboring residents also use.  The room hallways are small (almost cramped), and my deluxe queen room, while very clean and well maintained, was average in size, with a nice bathroom and comfortable bed. My rate booked on the hotel’s website was an extremely fair 185 GBP (plus VAT).  Neither sybaritic nor Spartan, neither “charmingly cozy” nor cold and impersonal, the Marylebone is pleasing and comfortable.  It presently deserves its high TripAdvisor rating, and I look forward to returning to it.",5,2013,01,04
123,beautiful hotel,"The Marylebone is a beautiful hotel in a great location for shopping and sightseeing. There are many good restaurants on the doorstep and it is a nice safe area to wander around on an evening. Great breakfast and a nice bar area for an early (or late) evening drink.  We didn't have time to try dinner at the hotel unfortunately, nor the spa or pool. The only disappointment for me was that, despite booking in advance and emailing to say it was a special birthday for my partner, I'm sad to say there was no acknowledgement of this from any of the staff.",5,2013,01,01
123,A Fantastic New Year's Eve,"We met up with my brother and sister-in-law to celebrate New Year, this hotel was my brother's recommendation and I can now understand why.  From the moment we stepped inside the hotel nothing was too much trouble.  The rooms are fantastic, we had a suite, the staff are exceptional and the service beyond compare.  We had booked in for dinner which was quite delightful and thoroughly enjoyed the evening, ringing in the New Year in the bar with champagne.  I would not hesitate in recommending this beautiful venue to anybody and we will definitely return.",5,2013,01,01
123,Wonderful Hotel,Stayed here overnight for a birthday trip to London. First time visit to this hotel prompted by good reviews on TA. Not disappointed at all. Great welcome at check in with apologies for room not yet being ready (we did arrive early) but followed up with surprise complimentary wine and birthday cake found in room later on - nice touch!. We had booked a superior room which had its own lounge area and was very well furnished in a contemporary style. The common areas of the hotel are very well appointed with plenty of places to sit back and relax. The only criticism is that the staff didn't seem to 'patrol' these areas very often and when my wife and I arrived back from a shopping trip to relax and have a coffee we couldn't find anyone to serve us. Great breakfast in the morning with very attentive service and plenty of choice for both continental and full English (even though the hotel is Irish owned so you would have expected a full Irish!). Well recommended.,4,2012,12,31
123,Excellent Stay,"My husband and I stayed at the Marylebone Hotel for two nights between Christmas and New Year.  The reception process was welcoming and very efficient and our room was compact but well equipped, overlooking Welbeck Street, but not disturbed by traffic noise.  The bathroom with large walk in shower was good and the Aromatherapy Associates products are wonderful and addictive!  The bath towels are soft and sufficiently large to wrap around a large person (me) comfortably following a shower and good quality slippers are provided as standard along with dressing gowns so relaxation following a shower is assured. During our stay, we had showers in the morning and before going out in the evening and the towels were replenished and ready to use.

I requested additional toiletries and these were provided in generous amounts, which was wonderful as previously mentioned!

The bed was comfortable and the quilt and pillows aided very restful sleep after busy days.

The hotel is well situated, standing just behind the eclectic mix of shops and restaurants of Marylebone High Street and within a short walk of the major stores on Oxford Street, but thankfully peacefully located...

The restaurant was excellent for both breakfast (which we had only on our first day) and dinner (which we had on our second evening).  The fillet steak and fries were perfectly cooked and delicious and the Biggles Sausages were wonderful.

The staff throughout the hotel were helpful and friendly and always used our names once they knew our room number.  My sister and her husband met us in the bar on our first night, and they remarked on the overall ambience and felt they would like to stay when they were in London again.  

Checkout was seamless and we were offered assistance with onward travel plans and water for our journey.  The scented candles burning the the lobby add to the overall relaxing atmosphere and premeate the upper reaches via the lifts.  Next time we are in London we will not hesitate to book at The Marylebone again.",5,2012,12,30
123,Fantastic hotel,We have recently stayed at the Marylebone Hotel on a number of occasions throughout December this year. We were always able to check in early and the staff were very helpful and accommodating throughout our stay. The bedrooms are extremely comfortable and well equipped along with the lounge / restaurant areas. The location is perfect within an easy walk of Oxford Street with lots of great restaurants nearby. The best thing about this hotel is the staff who really go above and beyond to ensure the guests have a great stay. In particular Gunter was so very helpful during our stay and on each occasion went out of his way to ensure we were comfortable. We will now always return to this hotel when visiting London as they can always guarantee a top class stay.,5,2012,12,28
123,Excellent location for shopping in London,"The Marylebone Hotel, is an under-stated, but excellent place to stay.  The warm welcome on arrival at reception is much appreciated and whenever I have checked in early, there has always been a room available straight away.  (This is a real bonus)!  Once you have checked in, you are offered a hot flannel to freshen up your face and hands, and this is a nice touch.  The rooms are well appointed, and clean and comfortable.  The breakfast offers choices from a simple continental selection to a full cooked English breakfast or other hot alternatives.  The bar is always buzzing and a great place to meet before heading out for the evening.  Taxi's are always readily available outside if you need them, and the tube station at Bond Street is a 5 minute walk away.",5,2012,12,27
123,Superb!!!!,"We stayed at this lovely hotel at the beginning of December for 7 great nights on a pleasure trip to London. The staff at the reception was very polite end eager to help us with anything we needed. Check in was complete with no problems and just in a few minutes!!! After our check in we requested a room with a bathroom and not a shower that was initially given to us and they just full fill our wish. Very good beginning for their hospitality!!! The room was excellent,clean with so many amenities!!
The location of the hotel is great near oxford street and several pubs and restaurants.
on every single day our room was perfectly clean. And they did a very good job about having everything right in our room. The food servise was also great !! As for the hotel itself...nice decoration with friendly staff!! At our check out we asked for a late checkout and we were pleased to here that was ok for us to leave our room later!!!
It is a great hotel in london , great location,great staff and the rooms are super!!!
Thanks for making our staying with you such a pleasure!!!
we will be back for sure!!!",5,2012,12,20
123,Four trips to this hotel in central London,"When I arrive people greet me by name.  This hotel  features excellent very personalized service.  The hotel is recently renovated with excellent rooms that are relatively large. Breakfasts and dinners are both excellent at the hotel.  The location is totally convenient as you are sitouated between Oxford and Bond with outstanding shopping and restraurants.  You are an easy walk to Regents Street and Piccadilly.  Excellent tube access. I travel extensively for business and find this to be one of my favorite places to stay.  

There is an excellent exercise and pool area for this hotel.

Afternoon tean excellent.  This is a very civilized hotel in a world class location",5,2012,12,20
123,It is a super place,"We have tried this hotel in the past and we managed to get a room this time before the Christmas holidays.
This was a combined business and pleasure trip.
As you get in the hotel there is a nice smell of Christmas spices that makes you feel a homely atmosphere. The staff at the reception are super needless to say that the service at the check in is quite efficient, beds and bedrooms are good and very clean, except the standard room which is extremely small, really not good for two people. 
We stayed a total of six nights thanks to Heathrow closing and BA not having seats on the planes till Friday (still BA has not compensated us but this is another issue). 
The first four nights we spent it in a superior room which is OK as far as space in concerned and the other two nights in a standard room which as I said is good for one person but for a couple is no good. For starters the bed is too short (I am 1.86mtrs and my feet were out of the bed), however the rooms are always clean with new towels supplied every day. One last complain the hotel needs to do something with its extractor fan. Our second room was at the back and every night for at least 2-3 hours we had this smell of burned meat which was not good at all. I would have given and very good to this hotel, but having tried two different rooms I can say very good if you get a superior but just OKish if you get a standard room
The breakfast was poorer than the previous times we stayed although I suppose was OK considering. 
In general is good hotel allround good for business but also for shopping as it is a 5 mins walk from Oxford Street and all the shopping places.
Will go again as we like it!",4,2012,12,20
123,Affordable Luxury in London,"We stayed at the Marylebone Hotel on one of the busiest pre-Christmas shopping weekends in December.  Even though we were just ten minutes from Oxford Street, Welbeck Street was calm and peaceful and felt a million miles from the hustle and bustle.  The hotel staff were friendly and efficient on check in, helpful with late night restaurant suggestions (shout out to Caffe Caldesi) and friendly every time we met someone either at reception or in the hotel.
The room was quiet, tastefully furnished, well maintained, the tea making facilities and nespresso were welcome for putting our feet up after a day of pounding the pavements.  The bathroom was spotlessly clean and Aromatherapy Associates bath and shower products were a lovely change from the usual bathroom hotel products.
The pool was clean and the changing rooms were superbly kitted out.  
The rate was very good for a hotel so close to the city centre.
The only minor issue was the addition of a food service charge to the bill post-Express check out.  However, the staff were helpful and efficient in resolving this as soon as it was brought to their attention. 
I would be happy to recommend this hotel to anyone looking to stay in London either for business or leisure and I look forward to staying here again.",4,2012,12,20
123,Spoiled,"Earlier this year i stayed in this hotel and we had a bit of an unpleasant experience. The GM reacted to my review and offered a special deal when visiting next time.  And they kept their promise and even better, an upgrade to junior suite for the entire stay. There was a nice fruit basket and a bottle of excellent wine. Every evening tea with a chistmas cake. 
I very much like the staff, friendly (not trained friendly) . Concierge and the bell captains are great. 
Thank you very much; we will be back.",5,2012,12,19
123,Afternoon Tea,"Fabulous afternoon tea and on a buy one get one free offer it was only £9.50 each. One of the best afternoon tea I have had in London. Recommend to everyone. Relaxed atmosphere, excellent food, attentive service, could not fault it.",5,2012,12,19
123,Afternoon tea delight!,"Can't fault this beautiful building, lovely attentive staff and fabulous food. A luxury indulgence of afternoon tea with 5 varieties of sandwich 2 types of scones and 3 cakes! Go when you are hungry with lots of time to luxuriate over the endless tea. I choose Chinese black with rose buds which was refreshing and really different. Wasn't staying here this was just a visit to the lounge but a faultless one none the less.",5,2012,12,18
123,Favorite in London,"Very serviceminded and friendly staff! Hotel is located in walking distance of Oxford street but there is no annoying noice as the area don't have that much traffic. Nearest subway station is Bond street on Central line.

The rooms are spacious even though the bathroom is a bit small. Bathrobe and accessories are of course in place. Complimetary water and chokolate in the room.

The bar is very spacious with high ceiling which makes it a bit noicy on busy nights but still worth a visit. The breakfast was nice but not top notch.",4,2012,12,17
123,Very good but...,"This was my first stay at this hotel and overall I was very pleased. Location of the hotel is excellent and the front desk staff do a great job and make you feel welcome. The room was ok, nice design and pretty comfortable but the bathroom proved to be a challenge...again nice fittings but the bathroom is way too small...e.g. you have to open and then close the door again to enter the shower. 
I would have rated the hotel very good if it were not for the fact that in the morning there was a queue of about 20 people all waiting for a free table/seat for breakfast. I waited for 5 minutes and as the queue did not get shorter, I left without having breakfast. 
My reservation was made by the company (almost neighbors of the hotel) so when upon check-out I was asked to pay the bill, I informed them that the company was probably paying as they usually do. Since I checked out on a Saturday morning, the receptionist told me there was nobody at hand in the offices to check how the reservation was made and what the payment method was. 
I paid, no problem but left with mixed feelings and although I visit London quite often for business, not sure whether I'll stay again at this hotel.",3,2012,12,17
123,Rather a disappointment,"I really wanted to love this hotel, which is conveniently situated just off Maryelebone High Street, and near Oxford Street. The lobby is modern, stylish and has a luxurious vibe. Nice, helpful staff. Free, fast wifi. And the rooms... well, they were just okay. Which would be fine if I hadn't expected more.

The first room I went to was a bizarrely far walk from the elevator - about 6 minutes! If someone's mobility wasn't good, that would be frustrating. And the room itself was tiny, with almost no room to fit my hand luggage sized suitcase, no bedside table, and blinds that didn't do a very good job of keeping out the light. Since we were there for 6 days, I asked reception if they happened to have a bigger room that they'd consider moving us to, and they said yes, and moved us to one that bizarrely turned out to be even smaller (though a normal distance from the elevator). I couldn't understand why they'd put me to the bother of moving for no reason and when I asked was just told all the 'superior' rooms were essentially the same size. It felt like a single room, for example there was only space to hang up one towel, etc. I wished I'd stayed in the original room, particularly when the toilet blocked (they fixed it the next day when I complained), the shower was lukewarm at best (I complained but this wasn't fixed), there were hardly any plugs, turning off the light required gymnastic flips over furniture to reach the switches, and the space in which to get out of the bath was so small (and angled over the sloping bit of the bath) I had problems getting out though I'm not fat. And every day the beds were made up in such a way that I had to untuck all the sheets from the bottom of the bed so they would reach up above my waist when I got into bed! The staff were all very nice, but I was glad to leave this hotel, which promised more than it delivered.",2,2012,12,14
123,Gets it for business in Central London,"First thing to know - this hotel is nowhere NEAR the Marylebone tube station (the nearest is Bond Street).  Once you have found your way there, though, this is well worth checking out.  My room, while not huge, was well designed and comfortable both for working and relaxing. There are lots of little nooks and crannies to sit down in and have a conversation.  The staff were unfailingly helpful.  I love the free WiFi!  And it has a very creditable gym, which is a hard-to-find amenity in most British hotels.  The food was delightful.  I was here for a business meeting and it's the best venue for that particular meeting we've ever had, by a long shot.  Breakfast, which in my case was included, consists of a pretty nice buffet of cold options or you can order warm food. I never have enough time for that, but found the buffet was fine.  The bar is busy, but the drinks are good.  I much prefer this hotel to others in the area that I have more or less been forced to stay in.",4,2012,12,14
123,Home from Home,"For five years I have based my twice yearly visits to London in the Marylebone Hotel. I choose so to do because of its location near Bond Street, Regents Park and institutions in the area. Its location near Marylebone High Street and off Marylebone Lane means that it is close to one of London's most perfect 'village' streets packed with shops and cafes, Daunt Books, and near many great restaurants.
The deluxe rooms are generously proportioned, and there is plenty of space to stretch out and to work. Most have views over the rooftops or views into the streets and lanes around.
The gym downstairs is excellent.
There are many lounges - suitable for meetings of various sizes, and a lively bar off Marylebone Lane.
Most importantly, the staff does not churn. There are familiar faces at the reception desk, the concierges and doormen are friendly and efficient. The welcome from them is consistently warm and helpful.",5,2012,12,13
123,Great value for money for business and private travel,"I have been in this hotel more than 20 times over the course of five years so I feel that I should finally write a review.

The location: great proximity to Mayfair and Oxford Street if you value that. There is a lot of great non-touristy restaurants in the area (Marylebone) as well. And since it is tucked away in the quiet streets, the quality of sleep is always good.
Service: consistently great and attentive from all staff.
Decor: the lobby is quite inviting but the corridors upstairs look a bit odd with the wall covering and carpets and low ceiling (not a deal breaker in any case).
The rooms: they are quite nice and practical, the size varies according to your room rate.
Food at breakfast: also quite satisified.

To sum it up, I think the management intended to position the hotel as good value proposition and I would give them a high mark for their effort.",4,2012,12,13
123,Michele M,"I first came to the Marylebone Hotel on a business trip on April 2012. The excellent services of every member of the staff helped me grantly in my work. I came back in December on a leisure trip and felt right away back at home. The room was fantastic, the meals excellent and we could take our time in a cosy and quiet atmosphere. I needed to find special shoe laces as a Christmas gift and two front desk members went behond their duty to find me the correct address. Not only is the location perfect nearby Oxford Street, but the exceptional care of every one in the hotel makes it a place to keep in mind for any future trip.",5,2012,12,12
123,Excellent Restaurant,"We discovered this restaurant by accident. It is miles apart from a normal hotel restaurant in terms of feel and service. Being slightly separate from the main hotel we didn't feel awkward which can sometimes be the case when eating at a hotel but not staying there. The staff were friendly, funny, and entirely welcoming. The lady who was our main server last night was a joy. The food is well priced and the taste was outstanding. I'm feeling hungry just thinking about it. There is also a nice bar which is great for a quick meeting or for drinks with friends.

Will certainly return.",5,2012,12,11
123,Amazing afternoon tea,"I booked an afternoon tea with the promotion 2 for the price of 1 for a baby shower. We were seated in a very nicely decorated room, at a very big table with super comfortable chairs. It really felt like we are at home. The service was absolutely great. The waiter offered a great selection of teas, which we were able to try before ordering. I had forgotten to mention in the booking the dietary requirements, and the chef was able to prepare baby friendly food for my pregnant friend while we were there. We stayed for a couple of hours, and we truly enjoyed this afternoon tea experience. I will definitely come again for afternoon tea there even when there is no Christmas promotion. Thank you very much for the extremely friendly staff and the excellent service",5,2012,12,10
123,Another fantastic experience!,"We first discovered 'The Marylebone' in Feb 2012 after booking a weekend away with my partner.  We thought the location, facilities and staff were exceptional and we felt very looked after.  We enjoyed it so much that we decided to book again at the beginning of December 2012 for my partners 30th birthday.  We had high expectations having already experienced a wonderful time back in February, and we were not disappointed.  I particularly liked the fact that it felt more like a 'boutique hotel' rather than a large chain with hundreds of people.  It felt very cosy and the decor is wonderful.  I would not hesitate to go back.",5,2012,12,10
123,friendly staff but horrible breakfast experience.,"The Stay in the hotel was quiet good. Nice and friendly staff, beautiful and cozy rooms, clean and tidy environment and good location. I had a beautiful experience in the hotel until i went in to the breakfast hall. The start of the breakfast was quiet pleasing. A beautiful good morning greet at the entrance of the restaurant with a big smile by one of the girls made a good beginning. Wonderful selection of food in the buffet, amazing variety of eggs for breakfast and good service. Everything went well until i head the manager or supervisor in shift behaving very rude with  the waiter. The waiter was serving a guest and talking about directions helping them get to the locations in London when he approached the table telling the waiter she had lots of other guests to look after then just entertaining one of the many. This was not a good comment made by the manager. On top of that in just a few minutes of time i realized that all the tables she was looking after was occupied and rest of the tables where some other waiter was looking after was completely free. No matter how well you present things, unless you know how to look after your employees you will never be able to look after your guests. 

After this experience i never felt like going to the breakfast hall. It was a terrible experience",3,2012,12,05
123,Great location + Great service,"My husband and I stayed at The Marylebone Hotel for 2 nights for our wedding anniversary. The hotel location is great and the most important the staffs are very friendly and helpful. Nora, the front desk receptionist and Roddy, the Project Manager both are super helpful and nice. They really makes us feel like home. We definitely will come back to London and must stay in this wonderful hotel!!",5,2012,12,04
123,Wonderful stay!,"We spent a couple of nights at The Marylebone Hotel and had the most wonderful stay. The facilities were excellent, the environment was very cosy and all of the staff were very friendly and helpful. Simply put we had everything we needed when we needed it! I highly recommend.",5,2012,12,04
123,Great girly retreat just off Oxford Street,"Myself and a friend wanted a special treat for a girls theatre and shopping trip in the capital and the Marylebone Hotel ticked all the boxes. The location is great, just a short walk to Oxford Street, Regents Street etc. The staff are very welcoming and friendly and the rooms are beautifully presented. The on-site gym, swimming pool and treatment rooms were an added bonus of which we took full advantage. Our trip was thoroughly enjoyable and we only wish we would have stayed longer.",5,2012,12,03
123,Great Central Hotel,"We have stayed at this hotel a number of years ago and I was pleased with our stay on this occasion.  We booked a great deal through Octopus.com.  It is a great central hotel with plenty of restaurants nearby.
My one sticky point was with the breakfast - we had booked to include breakfast when we went down on the first morning they said that we had to pay £5 extra per head for a cooked breakfast - I was never told that the breakfast that I had paid for was a continential on checking in or when I booked - the service was terrible we waited for over 30mins for eggs. On the 2nd morning we decided against a cooked breakfast because we didn't have 30mins to sit and wait and had to ask for tea & toast on 2 occasions! When checking out they again tried to charge us the extra for the breakfast on both mornings until I explained that it was never clarified what kind of breakfast was included so they took this charge off.
Overall the rooms are lovely & modern although the room that we had reserved was on the small side, the minibar fridge wouldn;t open but it didn;;t bother us.  They left complimentary water in the rooms on both evenings which was a nice touch.  Overall all the staff besides the slow dining room staff were extremely helpful and friendly and we would return on our next trip to London.",5,2012,12,03
123,A very good all round hotel,We stayed at the Marylebone as part of a weekend trip to the theatre combined with a bit of Christmas shopping. It was well located for the shopping as it was just off Oxford Street and about 5 minutes walk from Bond Street tube. The staff were really friendly and helfpul throughout the stay and the rooms were lovely. It was a pleasure to enjoy a breakfast that you could order rather than pick from a buffet style breakfast. It was also nice to enjoy a vibrant bar that stayed open until a decent time. The only areas for improvement we could see were a simpler to operate shower and a box to put your speedy checkout  forms in as we had to queue which defeated the object! Overall it was really good and we will go back.,4,2012,11,29
123,Stand above the rest,"The Marylebone is a super hotel . It is in an convenient location . Like many other comparable hotels in the centre of London it has excellent facilities, is stylishly decorated, has good,clean rooms, the food good, the bar lively. However, as a frequent traveller, particularly to London, what sets the Marylebone apart from others is the staff ; all staff whether in the bar, restaurant or room service are friendly and efficient, but the care and attention shown by the front desk in particular stands above other hotels. They make the hotel very easy to recommend.",5,2012,11,29
123,Penthouse Suite,Spent our wedding night at the hotel & upon arriving we were promptly upgraded to one of the penthouse suites with flowers & champagne waiting for us. The staff couldn't have been more friendly or professional & the hotel & room were first class. Amazing breakfast too. Excellent hotel - highly recommended!,5,2012,11,28
123,"Fine Hotel, Great Location","Recently stayed at the Marylebone while in London on business.  The pro's are great location, nice and efficient front desk and door staff, comfortable beds, close to Bond Street Tube station, great shopping at Oxford St and great eats on Christopher street., fairly reasonably priced for London.  The Con's are:  there was construction in the area, a few alarms go off in the neighborhood which woke me up.  This may not affect everyone but I'm a light sleeper.  The breakfast that's included is continental which amounted to coffee and very tiny danish, very small bathrooms so for a female, not enough shelf space.  This hotel was definitely designed by men!  

Overall a good experience, I'd return.  I have stayed in many hotels in London and it wasn't the smallest or most expensive or stuffiest.  I am on a quest to find the perfect London Hotel one day that's in a great location, affordable (dare I dream?) and slightly posh/chic!  I'll let you know when I find it!!",4,2012,11,27
123,great location and staff,"This is a great hotel right in the middle of Marylebone  - 5 minutes walk fro Oxford/Bond street and the west end, yet iwith its own little villagey atmosphere.  It's stylish, contemporary in design, yet quite cosy at the same time.  The food is good: only had breakfast but it was excellent.  The bedroom (mine at any rate) was very nicely decorated, spotless and a lot bigger than most I've stayed in in london.  The bar is quite buzzy and is away a little from the main part of the hotel - it feels like a seperate Marylebone bar which I liked.  It has a pool and a gym, which (i think) is rare enough for so central a hotel) And the staff are wonderfully obliging and attentive.  For its price, it is a superior hotel than many in London I could think of.",5,2012,11,27
123,Excellent afternoon tea,"I recently enjoyed an afternoon tea at the Marlyebone Hotel and was really impressed. The hotel is luxurious and comfortable - a good combination of modern with more traditional features. The afternoon tea was tasty and well presented, and the staff were very friendly and knowledgeable.",5,2012,11,26
123,A Hidden Gem in Marylebone,"This one is not to be missed.  We recently stayed there for our fifteenth anniversay, first trip to London, and can not say enough about this hotel.  The staff was EXCEPTIONAL, the location couldn't be beat and the rooms were modern and comfortable.  I travel often for work and the staff at this hotel were some of the best I have ever encountered.  We arrived early, flight overnight and they accomodated us with a room immediatley, Gunther at the front desk was amazing, allowing us to sleep off some much needed jet lag.  Throughout the trip we visited the conceirge, Rahim, if you have the chance to work with him you will have the best trip in London!  He provided us the best information on tours, shows to see, places to dine and took care of all the arrangements leaving us nothing to do but enjoy our trip.  We will definitely be back!",5,2012,11,26
123,Great Service,Why aren't all hotels like this one - stayed for two nights on my own for family event - from the moment I arrived service was amazing.    Although the hotel is large it feels like a boutique hotel - the staff really want you to enjoy your stay - a big thank you!,4,2012,11,26
123,Absolutely fantastic!,"amazing and caring service. a top hotel in a great area and easy access to Oxford Street.
Great quality in all aspects at all times made me feel home! I will definitely return to this hotel at my next trip and can only recommend it to any business or leisure traveller in London.",5,2012,11,26
123,Review for bar at The Marylebone Hotel,I have had two great visits to this bar at The Marylebone Hotel.  The bar and restaurant is called One08. Fantastic venue for meeting for a drink.  My friends loved the atmosphere and decor.  The cocktails are wonderful.  Do try the Napoleon Blazer which is a delight.,5,2012,11,26
123,Really great hotel in fabulous location,"My husband and I just stayed 2 nights here with a couple of friends and we had the best time. The outside of the building isn't great as you approach along Welbeck Street but as soon as you step inside, that doesn't matter in the slightest. The foyer is contemporary smart and there are lots of comfy areas to sit and relax, watching the world go by, the bar is great and stays open until 0130 am weekends, breakfast is lovely and - for anyone with the energy - the gym is really big and well equipped; the swimming pool is nice too. The room was perfect, with lovely touches like a smart black brolly (which we needed!). The one thing I was a bit disappointed about was the size of the shower room, which was absolutely tiny - I also specifically call it a shower room as there was no bath! But a really wonderful stay overall and we will all most certainly be going back.",5,2012,11,25
123,A perfect stay,"Excellent,helpful kind staff. Hotel spotlessly clean and cared for.well appointed rooms. A delight all around,quiet and tasteful furnishings. The staff could not do enough,could not believe I was in London!",5,2012,11,25
123,the best hotel i have ever stayed at,"we stayed in this hotel for a weekend after getting married.  upon arrival we were upgraded to a better room.  it was amazing.  there is a swimming pool, gym on site etc.  the breakfast here is so good, with loads of fresh fruit, and pretty much everything you could want at breakfast time.  
the room we had was spacious and well equipped, with safe, slippers, bathrobes, umbrella etc.  the staff are so helpful and warm, they even give you two bottles of mineral water each night.  we couldn't fault this place at all.  
the location is very close to oxford circus tube, so is well placed for the west end, oxford street shopping, restaurants, etc",5,2012,11,25
123,"Well-situated hotel, but make sure you get a quiet room","I checked in here for 1 night from yesterday. At check-in they have at least now got more cultures represented than the (exclusively) eastern europeans they had a while ago, (who were almost all very rude). Now we have some Indians and Pakistanis as well, much better vibe and attitude!

The hotel foyer looks good and has a great new gym and pool, as well as free wifi. Maybe I was just unlucky with my room allocation, room 148. It was near service elevators and a service area, one could hear the staff the whole night. 

There are also no coffee-making facilities in the room, which is VERY small.",3,2012,11,25
123,"Excellent hotel, perfect service","I stayed 8 days in this hotel. The personnel fo the hotel is outstanding.and did everything to make our stay comfortable.. 
The location is perfect and the nearby restaurants  and being near to Marylebone High street is a plus.
We needed special assistance because my daughter had just had a surgery, they loaned us a wheel chair for a couple of days.
The room service was effcient and thecleaning personnel very accodomating to our timetable.
THe only minus is the size of the rooms that are small related to the status of this hotel.",4,2012,11,23
123,convenient location but...,"I stayed in the hotel for 2 nights, 14-15 November...very convenient location, check in efficient, I have not used any of the facilities of the hotel nor had breakfast.
I stayed in a standard room which was on the small size with an equally small bathroom , paid 230 pounds/night ( available up grade for 40 pounds plus).
The two inconveniences: 
1.ceiling was rather low and
2. on day of departure an early check out envelop was slipped  under the door plus at 10.00 am the room service knocked the door to clean the room. Lady left immediately after stressing out to her checking out time is 12.00 noon. I always stick to check out time and I felt kind of annoyed.",3,2012,11,21
123,Good place to stay,Stayed in this lovely hotel for 4D/3N. Love the location - 5 minutes walk to the subway in bond street. Room was spacious and very generous for London hotel.Staff was attentive and helpfull and it is quite easy to get a cab as there always one stand by. Went for a dinner and had their restaurant and choosing their Set dinner. food was ok but service was attentive. Will deffinetly come back to Marylebone on my next trip to London.,5,2012,11,20
123,Great location and service,"I stayed here for seven nights this month, and enjoyed both the location and the service. The staff were extremely attentive (even remembering my name). The rooms were clean and comfortable. I appreciated the in-room safe, and that the evening turn-down service provided both still and sparkling water each day. 

Other good things:

* I needed to receive and ship parcels while staying there, and the concierge was very helpful. 
* Noon checkout was lovely.
* The location is very central, and an easy walk to the high street (with shops and restaurants).
* The wifi was fast and reliable. Also free!

The hotel offered many other services, but I didn't use them.

The only real downside was the price, but even this seemed fair for the area -- there were more expensive places in the same area, and the Marylebone's service was impeccable.",4,2012,11,20
123,Excellent,"I've been to London a few times, and this is by far the best Hotel I've stayed in. It's also the most expensive one, since we usually go for Hotels in the budget area. The Staff is friendly and serviceminded in every way. The Hotel is nice, room was clean, and large enough. Location is excellent, just a stones throw from Oxford Street. There's really not much to complain about, but I don't understand why housekeeping knocked on our door at least two times the morning we was checking out. Don't they have lists from reception showing who has checked out, and who has not? I also think housekeeping must hav tidied up my dirty underwear one day, and probably stored it somewhere in the room in stead of letting it lay on the floor. Which would have been nice if I had noticed it before I got home...",4,2012,11,19
123,One of the Best,"We seldom stay in this neck of the woods but wanted somewhere convenient for shopping for my wife whilst I was on business.  The Marylebone is just 5 minutes walk from Oxford Street and at the right point for Bond Street and surrounding shopping areas once you want to leave the hustle and bustle of Oxford Street behind.

We had booked a ""superior"" room (actually the lowest priced standard room) which, although on the small side, was equipped and decorated to perfection - better than many 5 star hotels I have stayed in.  Wirelesss internet that was (a) free and (b) worked immediately with a 3 bar signal - a rarity in many hotels.  And a bed to die for (and the sort I hope to die in!).  

I could go on, but would just say try this hotel; you won't regret it.  Probably worth paying the little extra for a de luxe room, which from the hotel plan looked significantly larger.

Oh, and terrific check-in staff with a really good attitude.",4,2012,11,17
123,Elegant and comfortable hotel.,Second stay in this hotel - although our studio 'suite' was not quite what we expected - rather small and odd shaped - we enjoyed our stay.  The many public lounges are stylish and comfortable and service second to none.,4,2012,11,17
123,Lovely hotel- it's the Attention to detail,"Stayed one night.  The hotel is  very elegant.  The doormen will escort you from the taxi.  Swift check in.  We had a bite to eat in the bar which was lovely.  The deluxe room was roomy, functional and had all the little touches that make the difference - good lighting, heavy drapes, robes, slippers, water, cotton wool, nespresso coffee maker (although didn't appear to work properly) alarm clock etc. the decor was lovely.
There is a health club and spa which I didn't see.  Breakfast was very good.
The staff in this hotel are well trained - it shows.
Only criticism is the soundproofing isn't great - I could hear a conversation in the room next door.
Great location in a nice part of London and a 5 min walk to Bond st tube.  Looking forward to returning for a longer spell",5,2012,11,16
123,Great stay. Perfect location.,"Ideal location for Oxford Street and Bond Street. Staff were very helpful and pleasant. Comfortable rooms and nice and quiet for such a central hotel. Bathrooms are small but have everything you need in them. 
Would definitely stay here again.",5,2012,11,16
123,Perfect in every single way.,The hotel is a perfect haven of tranquility. The staff are customer based professionals who work extremely hard at meeting every need of the guest. Bledar and Magdalena particularly stand out as perfect examples of the way guests should come first. Saris manages the team who always strive to achieve perfection. ,5,2012,11,16
123,Great Hotel and Location,"We took a leisurely london deal at The Marylebone last weekend. Although busy check-in was fast, and we took the opportunity to upgrade to a studio suite..lovely lots of room, very clean, comfortable bed and a wall of windows looking over the rooftops. Service at breakfast and at the bar was faultless and the quality of food excellent. We never tried the room service (there are so many great restraurants within 5mins walk). We'll be back next weekend. G",5,2012,11,16
123,Best hotel ever:),"This hotel is the best we have ever stayed in. The rooms are small, but perfekt. The bed is soft and the pillows are superb. Its in a quiet street, but only 500 m from Oxford street. The staff is very helpfull, and the service here is great. The breakfast was very good, and you could upgrade for 5 pounds if you wantet english breakfast. They have a superb fitnessroom and a great pool. The food in the restaurant is also very good and its not expensive to eat there. We will be back, that's for sure. We just love this hotel:)",5,2012,11,16
123,Perfect,"I just have to tell that this hotel is a perfec stay in London. Nice rooms and friendly people working there. Perfect service. If you go to London make this hotel your first choice.
This is wht we will do.

123,"Great location, great service, great room",We stayed in November for 3 nights it was the best location we could ask for. The service was very good. They cared about our requests and needs. We had a nice room definitely our new home in London. Shame it was only 3 nights,5,2012,11,13
123,"""Superb""","Family stayed there in november 2012 in two studio suites. Had a wonderful time at this hotel. Rooms nice and clean and the service tops.  Perfectly located a five minutes walk from Oxford Street.  Well situated when going to restaurants in the evening.  Highly recommend this hotel and will be back soon.
O.Th",5,2012,11,13
123,Super Stay,"Great location,really good staff and lovely room. The 4am room service burger and fries went down a treat. Stayed on the 7th floor with great views of the city. Loved the Nespresso machine in the room.",5,2012,11,13
123,"Nice hotel, great location, wish we booked a deluxe room though..","stayed for 1 night on Friday, used it as a base for shopping and going out in the evening, the hotel itself is impressive - great lobby area, bars etc, with a nice pool, however I did find the room on the small side (we stayed in a superior room) the bathroom was tiny, shame because the style and design was good, with decent toiletries, in hindsight we should have opted for the deluxe room - the deluxe rooms have the nespresso machines and seem much roomier. one of the reasons we chose this hotel was because of the spa/pool, for relaxing after shopping during the day, it was quite stressful actually getting to the pool and spa area (you have to go via a different lift) we made it to the spa and asked how we get into the pool, the receptionists gave us some dud directions and we ended back where we started! getting back from the changing rooms to the main hotel wasnt straightforward either - so ensure you have concise directions before wandering around in your dressing gown as we (and quite a few other guests) did  :)
the staff were very efficient, friendly, breakfast next morning was excellent (lots of homemade healthy options on the breakfast buffet, we didnt feel the need to upgrade to a cooked breakfast. 
Overall, for the cost, this is a good value choice for central London (much nicer than the big chain hotels and same cost if not cheaper than some) the location is spot on (5 mins walk to Selfridges/Bond St/Oxford st, and we easily walked to Soho/Covent garden in the evening, we will definitely consider this again next time in London",4,2012,11,12
123,First class service,"Just back from the Marylebone Hotel and had a very enjoyable stay. The hotel itself is lovely - our room was a decent size for London and the space is used cleverly to allow for storage, while the decor and finishings are of a high standard. The main feature for us though was the helpful attitude of all of the staff members we came into contact with - they really couldn't do enough for us and as a result we won't hesitate to return to this hotel. The pool is also lovely and quiet if you get a chance to try it out.",4,2012,11,11
123,Trips over itself,"It's a nice hotel with a good location, but it trips itself up. Had requested an early check-in. Arrived after check-in and still no room was ready and it was an hour before it would be ready. Requested the mini-bar be emptied, but it wasn't until the second day and the second request before it got done. Had lint on a blouse. Went to get the baggage tag off my suitcase to use as a lint brush and the hotel had ripped it off. thermostat wasn't working so they had to bring in an electrical heater. Closet door was a slider that only covered part of the closet. There were too many chairs for the size room so you kept bumping into them. Will say the staff was friendly and helpful. Breakfast was very good and included in the price. Hotel sleeping area was quiet.",3,2012,11,10
123,Great business Hotel in London.,The Marylebo is a great business Hotel in London. Good location and easy access to train station. Love the rooms and service. Staff very professional. Oxford Street only a few blocks away and great dinning and entertainment options. Beautiful and trendi. Highly recommend it,4,2012,11,10
123,Fantastic hotel- stay here if you can!,"Everything about this hotel is of a high standard. We were able to check in early and were given lots of useful information about the area. The public areas, rooms and gym are all excellent and the staff are friendly, approachable and knowledgeable. We will return!",5,2012,11,10
123,1st time in London,"The hotel is in a great location. Shopping,restaurants, pubs all in walking distance. The service was outstanding. Rahim Ismail  head concierge was extremly helpful in planning sight seeing and restaurants.  The only thing that I can say that I wish there was more space to store clothes in the room.",5,2012,11,09
123,Amazing hotel with superb staff and great location!!,"This was my family's first trip to London.  We could not have stayed at a nicer hotel with such a great location to Oxford St. and many great restaurants.  Our room was perfect with great amenities. I cannot say enough about the staff. They went out of their way to make sure our stay was most pleasant.  We especially took a liking to Rafael, who really went out of his way to help us with everything we asked for and more! I highly recommend this fine hotel! We were truly treated like royalty.",5,2012,11,08
123,The Best Hotel in London,"Right in the heart of London, the location is fabulous whether your familiar with the area or a first time visitor to the UK. Excellent professional service with always a most welcoming and friendly smile from all the staff. The studio suite was most impressive with it's layout allowing one partner undisturbed should you need to work on your laptop or make a cup of tea in the early hours.
Beds very comfortable which is a huge bonus when you have travelled from Australia. Buffet breakfast will leave you spoiled for choice or you can have the full English breakfast experience. The concierge is most helpful for all your needs and the manager Mark Hayburn will always assist with any special requests. I highly recommend The Marylebone Hotel where you will be spoiled and pampered and feel very much at home.",5,2012,11,07
123,Penthouse Luxury,"I travelled to London last week for business and stayed in the Marylebone. This was my first stay in this hotel and I was really impressed. Staff were very efficient and friendly, the penthouse suite completely impressed and the hotel bar was relaxing, fun and a great place to unwind.

The location close to Oxford Street is very central and I found a very nice steak restaurant close by.

All in all 110%!",5,2012,11,05
123,Absolutely Top Notch,"Couple who stayed two nights - staff are exceptional - breakfast food excellent - location is less than 5 mins walk from Oxford St and plenty of restaurants (concierge is great for these) - standard Double Room was relatively small but bed was large - Bathroom had lovely extra's - Room was quiet - Hotel is Superb and the gym facilities are fantastic - Highly recommended - Top Notch !! ...""I'll be back!""",5,2012,11,05
123,perfect small london hotel,"Stayed two nights on a girls trip with my 9 year old daughter. We loved the location, the rooms and the interior design of the hotel. The room did not have a view, but that also meant no street noise  at all. We booked a normal double room, and it was not big, but big enough for us. The bath room was one of the smallest bathrooms I have ever used. But the amenities were great, the bath robe lovely and everything cleaned to perfection. 

The staff was very attentive and service minded. A lovely touch that there are fresh fruit, apples, at the front desk. That was perfect for my 9 year old who loves apples :-)",5,2012,11,04
123,"PERFECT - fantastic experience, great staff 10/10","The staff were amazing - so very friendly, attentive, room amazing, facilities incredible but didn't have time to use them all, location excellent. We were truly looked after and made our special occasion very memorable - WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND. 10/10 THANK YOU FOR A WONDERFUL TRIP. Most def stay again.",5,2012,11,04
123,Charming hotel with friendly staff!!!,"I loved this hotel! The hotel is very cute and charming and the staff very friendly and helpful!!!
The rooms where clean and nice. 
The breakfast was expensive but really good!!! 
Close to shopping and good restaurants!
I really rekommend this hotel to 100% and i Will defenetly go back!",4,2012,11,02
123,More than expected,"The Marylebone Hotel staff was perfect. Andras at the concierge was very friendly and attentive and helped us a lot. It was possible to buy tickets for tours,musicals and plays, etc. The hotel is conveniently located just a few minutes from Oxford Street. I would like to mention Gunther, Rafael, Raphael and Karoly who were equally professional and helpful. The hotel's bar is a great place to relax after the daily marathon trying to see as much as possible of London - nice atmosphere.  My wife and I stayed there 10 days last month, October 2012.",5,2012,11,02
123,A total gem just of Oxford Street,"Excellent service - especially the concierge.
Friendly airport pick-up in style - smooth ride and good value for the money.
Unusually high quality in-room dining service!
Make sure to enjoy the breakfast buffet - too good to rush.
To improve:
The spa standard is not really in class with the rest of this splendid hotel.",5,2012,11,01
123,Great stay,"I liked this hotel a lot. Nice friendly staff at reception. I got a free very early check in and free coffee in the lobby ( just as well because on the menu it looked quite pricy). The room is not big and the bathroom is tiny but the decor is lovely and the bathroom has black granite surfaces. The impression is overall "" upmarket"" even if  a little tight for space. Toiletries were divine and bathtowels  big and fluffy. High quality linen on the bed contributed to a good night's sleep. I turned off the  aircon as it was a little noisy but the temperature stayed comfortable overnight. Turndown service is good - I'm a sucker for the little chocs and coffee supplies were replenished in the evening.
I'm not sure I'd eat in the restaurant again as there are plenty of local great places to eat. It was also a little expensive. The chips served with my main course were divine though and staff were friendly and attentive. I'd stay again ; that's the best recommendation!",4,2012,10,30
123,Marvelous Marylebone,"My wife and I stayed at the Marylebone from the 19th till the 21st of October 2012 and could not fault the hotel in anyway.  From check-in to departure the experience was second to none.  The location of the Hotel is incredible with Marylebone High Street an oasis of calm, but only a stone’s throw from busy Oxford Street and beyond.  With a raft of restaurants nearby we did not have the opportunity to eat at the Marylebone but breakfast was tremendous.  Having eaten out both evenings the continental buffet was more than enough! but a traditional cooked breakfast was available at a small cost.  
We have stayed at many top class hotels throughout the World but the Marylebone gives them all a run for their money, and may just be the best yet.  We are actively looking forward to our next stay and would have no hesitation in recommending the Marylebone to all discerning travelers.",5,2012,10,30
123,The best hotel I have ever stayed in London,"I have been several times in past in the marylbone hotel - all of them during business trips. This time I took with me my 13 years old son for his birthday. Beyond the ""regular"" classic superlatives (e.g very nice room, excellent location and fantastic spa), what makes the different in this hotel are the people! The present my son received from the hotel for his birthday, upgrading our room, the smile we received whenever we meet somebody from the staff and the wish to assist you in any possible way makes you feel like a real ""home away from home"", a feeling hard to receive in urban hotel, and even more rare in London.
I can only wait for my next stay in this fabulous hotel.
Thank you!",5,2012,10,29
123,Friendly and well positioned hotel,"We were only at the Marylebone hotel overnight but we look forward to going again next time we're in London.  Very friendly and well run hotel, our room was lovely and had a wonderfully comfortable bed.  Good supply of quality toiletries, large fluffy towels, powerful shower, robes and slippers.  Coffee pods/tea making facilites - really good attention to detail in fact.  Fantastic breakfast, even though it is a 'continental style' (which can often be basic!) it was full of goodies to set you up for the day.  Marylebone area is a quieter more civilised part of London I think, thanks to our friend Gill for recommending we'll be making this our favourite from here on in!",5,2012,10,28
123,Excellent staff,This hotel is expensive but you pay for what you get.   The staff were extremely helpful and courteous with housekeeping at least three times a day.   I went to dinner one evening and returned to find that my jumper had been folded up and left at the foot of the bed.   One drawback is that the hotel is not on a bus route.,4,2012,10,27
123,Stands apart on service...,"London hotels can be pretty unfriendly places at times but The Marylebone is the opposite. Without exception the staff were exemplary, from the receptionist who sorted a room problem immediately and efficiently, to the breakfast staff who were super attentive and genuinely interested in making sure you had everything you needed, to the check out staff who chatted warmly whilst multitasking my departure! 

The hotel is excellently located just North of Oxford Street shops and amenities. Don't be put off by the exterior as the inside is opulent and luxurious with many stunning seating areas well away from the reception where you can relax.

I didn't use the gym but heard some people saying it was great, so overall an impressive effort with the added benefit of staff who seem to be happy working to make your stay a welcoming experience.",5,2012,10,27
123,On Welbeck in Westminster,"A very nice hotel in a terrific area of London, blocks from Oxford Street and Covent Garden. The Staff was attentive and our room was more then comfortable. At first I was worried that we had booked into one of those paint by the numbers businessman's housing locales but we ended up very pleased with our choice. The Marlebone area has much going for it, shops, pubs, coffee bars and all located on the areas high street. Would certainly return to The Marlebone.",4,2012,10,25
123,!Oh what a hotel!,We stayed in this hotel the first weekend in october and from the moment we arrived till we left the staff couldnt do enough for us.The hotel is both luxurious and comfortable and you get a really nice feeling the moment you walk in the doors.The location of this hotel is spot on and walking distance to all the shops etc.I cannot wait to go back to stay at the Marlbone as it is a real treat.The food is also very good in the bar and a lovely atmosphere for a drink.,5,2012,10,25
123,Great Gym and Location,Great location for access to Oxford and Harley Streets. BEST HOTEL GYM I'VE EXPERIENCED. Staff very friendly and helpful.  Unfortunately limited for those requiring suites with king beds which are badly configured with miniscule bathrooms.,3,2012,10,24
123,Fantastic Weekend in London,"My husband & I stayed here last weekend and were delighted with everything!  At check in the helpful receptionist (Gunther) asked if we would like to upgrade our room for an extra £40 which we did and we were not disappointed.  Our room was lovely with a huge sitting area.  The bed was really comfortable and the bathroom was great with really nice toiletries, gowns and slippers.  Our room rate included the Continental breakfast, we could have upgraded to include a hot meal for an extra £5 but we were more than happy with the Continental selection.  The location of the hotel is superb - walking distance to Oxford Street etc, really handy for the underground and a 2 min walk to Marylebone High Street which is a delight - it's just like a little village.  We didn't eat at the hotel as we were meeting up with friends and there is so much choice of restaurants within walking distance.  Everything about our stay was great and the staff are very professional and friendly.  I will definitely book this hotel next time we are in London - hopefully it will be soon!",5,2012,10,24
123,A slice of chic in central London,"From the moment I arrived at check-in I was made feel at home by the friendly staff.  My de-luxe room was very comfortable and unlike most hotels I stay in, I actually had a very restful night's sleep.  As I was on my own on business I had dinner in the bar, which was good, with a good choice of wines by the glass.  The common areas in this boutique hotel are welcoming and chic and I spent a while reading downstairs before retiring. I enjoyed the photographic portraits on the walls depicting individuals in the wine trade.  Breakfast was excellent, with great attention to detail, even the pumpkin seeds were lightly toasted!  All in all, I would rate the Marylebone very highly, as I would its sister hotel, the Westbury, in Dublin, where I stayed earlier this year.  I will definitely be back.

123,"Great Staff, Great location, Great Hotel!","We stayed on the 23rd October and were impressed right from the start. The lady at reception was delightful and handled our check-in perfectly. We requested a quiet room, and got it. The room wasn't large, but very well appointed. (I appreciated the iPod player and charger). The bed linen was excellent and the bed very comfy. Toiletries in the bathroom were excellent. Everything worked, was clean & well presented. In short, we liked everything, (and that's not something we can normally say about London hotels). We particularly enjoyed the bright and attentive staff, they put a smile on your face right from the start.  Thank you The Marylebone Hotel.",5,2012,10,23
123,Lovely hotel. Very helpful staff,"Got the chance to go to London for our anniversary last weekend. Oct 19- 21st 2012. Had a fabulous weekend. Hotel is so central and close to shopping , dining , attractions , and parks. Boutique style , well laid out , has all the amenities you require. Space is an issue in most hotels in London but I must say the layout is done very well . Shower and beds are magnificent which is a big big plus in my opinion. Staff are so helpful and very nice and accommodating to any and all needs. If you get the chance give this hotel a try! Top notch in my book , and I'm fussy!",5,2012,10,23
123,Fine hotel. Excellent staff.,"Stayed here 20th October 2012. The room was laid out so well that the space issues always attendant in London hotels were minimised. Very comfortable beds, excellent shower, great toiletries. Very good location for shopping. The staff were the best I have ever dealt with in any hotel in Europe. Nothing was too much trouble, they were always courteous and knew their jobs perfectly.
I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough.",5,2012,10,21
123,really enjoyed the marylebone,"I stayed at the Marylebone Hotel on a recent business trip and loved it. The location is great--just off Oxford Street and very near Hyde Park. I found the service to be very helpful and responsive. The room was quite large and well appointed for the price. Not a great view, but very quiet. I would definitely stay here again. Only downside was almost getting pickpocketed right near the hotel.",5,2012,10,20
123,Outstanding,This hotel is outstanding. From the minute we arrived the staff did all they could to help make our stay as great as possible. The breakfast the best I have ever had in London. Very clean. Room very quiet. Great service. Great value.,5,2012,10,18
123,SPOILED BY SOME WEIRD SERVICE,"Quite a small room but very nicely set out and decorated. Generally the staff here were very friendly and helpful. However, when I arrived I was given a room key which did not work - I had to go back to reception and returned with another key - this worked but I discovered the room already occupied and so I had to go back to reception again to get this sorted. Hard work really and not what you want when you are keen just to check in after a long day.

I stayed two nights and on the second night discovered they had removed the tea and coffees etc - I got a knock on the door at about 8.30 in the evening with a lady wanting to know if I wanted water .....just so weird.

Breakfast was okay but it was tiresome to have the staff explaining the breakfast arrangments to me....too early in the morning for a speech I am afraid.

Overall - a good hotel but some weird service stuff.",3,2012,10,17
123,Staff outstanding,"The greeting and the attentiveness of the door men and reception staff is superb, check-in fast. Lobby, bar area sumptious.
The room I had was disappointingly small, but had all the facilities.  The remote for the tv didn't work, but to be fair to the hotel I didn't ask for a repair as I was tired on arrival back from dinner.
I didn't use the restaurant except for breakfast which was very nice. The pool looked great. 
The location is excellent-5 mins behind Oxford street.
As a solo business traveller, it was safe and clean. I do recommend- but I would want a little more space next time!",4,2012,10,17
123,Nice place to stay,Perfectly located hotel. Close to Regent's Park and Hyde Park which are excellent if you like running. Lots of nice art galleries and beautiful shops close by. Staff were very friendly. They serve good cocktails in the bar. Luxury room was nice but has an extremely small bathroom. Hardly any place to put your own stuff. The towels were wonderful though. Light in the room could be better. Also the matrass could be better. But overall I had a good time staying at this hotel.,4,2012,10,14
123,Most excellent value in central London,"Very attentive and unpretentious staff, from the bellman to front desk to restaurant.  The location couldn't be better with Mayfair, Marylebone and Oxford Street shopping practically at the doorstep!  I consider this one of the best hotel values I've experiencedin a very long time.  I highly recommend for both business and holiday stays in central London.",4,2012,10,14
123,Great Location and Excellent Service!,"We are staying for our Honeymoon trip at London.

Basically, the location is good, near to Oxford Street (within 5 min walking distance) and to Bond Street Station.

The hotel is really have a lot of personal touch that i feel so warm to stay. Every night they will give you chocolate and a bottle of sparking/stilled water as complimentary. And also, as mentioned earlier, the hotel knowing that our trip is for Honeymoon, they gave a bottle of champagne to us and upgrade our room to Deluxe Room. 

The interior design of the room is also great and modern.

Definitely is A+ hotel. Is strongly recommend to stay! and....I will be back! :D",4,2012,10,13
123,relaxing hotel and wonderful location,"Thank you to all at The marylebone for making our stay a truly memorable one. All of the staff are exceptional.  Travelled with 3 children and gifts were left in our luxury suite for them, (lovely touch), Rooms spotless and spacious.  Breakfast excellent.  Thank you to Nora at reception, Rahim Head Concierge and Fraz at the bar for the warm welcome we received.  Hotel very central in a quite area very close to Oxford street.  Looking foward to returing to The Marylebone in the near future.",5,2012,10,10
123,Enjoyed staying there,"Contemporary boutique hotel in the heart of the fashionable and eclectic Marylebone, a stone throw from the Oxford Street and Bond Street tube station. Spacious rooms are nicely designed, quiet and comfortable; a pleasure to come in and relax after a busy day, working or shopping.

The staff is very friendly and make you feel genuinely welcome; a service with a smile. Enjoyed staying there and would certainly recommend to everyone.",5,2012,10,10
123,Best staff!,"Our stay at the Marylebone was memorable, some of it not for the right reasons, but most of it good. First and foremost I have to say that the staff, notably the reception staff, have to be the most accommodating, polite and smiling staff I have ever experienced in any London hotel, bar none!
The rooms are city sized, which by most standards are fairly compact. They do however have every amenity that one wants plus some others you might not expect. The hotel is geared up around the business traveler and from that perspective is excellent. Notably the way the vast lobby is divided up into numerous comfortable ""living rooms"", all with complimentary WIFI, perfect for casual meetings.
Our stay was for 2 nights, and I have to say that our room for the first night wasn't great, it was right next to the service elevator and the service closet, so we had a lot of banging and crashing when we were trying to get some rest to try and catch up on 9 hours of jet lag. Note to one self, don't get a room which ends in 48 ie 548. We asked to be moved for our second nights stay, and once again the staff were very accommodating and extremely apologetic. They moved us to a better room, gave us a complementary breakfasts and even a bottle of wine. I can not fault them for the way they handled things.
All in all, as someone who passes thru London 2 or 3 times a year, I feel as if I have found a hotel that I feel at home in. I highly recommend the Marylebone, and I will be back.",4,2012,10,10
123,A London gem!,"The replies from the manager to reviews on here encouraged me to book the hotel. He obviously cares!
Well the hotel certainly didn't dissapoint. From the minute of stepping through the door, each and every member of staff went out of their way to welcome, assist and pass the time of day with us. I would like to especially thank Nora, one of the many receptionists who not only gave us a great welcome but also acted on a passing comment from me in a casual conversation with her. It was a very, very special anniversary for us and she arranged champagne and chocs in the room on our return from visiting the sights. There was no fanfare, no boasting just a quietly arranged suprise.What a lovely personal touch- thankyou Nora! The hotel is in a quiet street but great location too. It boasts tasteful, luxury modern furniture but manages a relaxed atmosphere but it is the staff who made our stay so unforgetable. Any future visits to London we will be booking The Marylebone again (and again) and I am sure the staff will make a point of remembering who we are. That is customer service and being looked after is what most of us want. Thankyou to the very approachable manager James and his team. We will be back and so will a lot of our friends. A London gem we have found!",5,2012,10,09
123,Nice and quiet,"I booked a so called double superior. Luckily, I was on my own, because room, bed, bathroom was tiny. However, for one person it was fine, very modern and nice design. Also the room was well insulatwd and quiet which is important to me, no traffic noise or slamming doors. I had to turn off the aircon as it was absurdly noisy, like being inside an airplane! But since I didn't need aircon I never asked hotel staff whether this was actually normal, so I don't know. Staff was very nice and helpful at checkin and checkout, even offered me to bring the borrowed umbrella when I left.
First night there was no water bottle in my room, which annoyed me a bit but I didn't mention it. second night there were two bottles - odd.
There was self service coffee and pastries in the lobby in the morning. I went for the breakfast buffet. It was on but over priced (like in all London hotels) at 20 gbp. Waitress didn't bring my ordered toast and didn't offer more coffee, so I had to ask for it (not many guests around at that time, but I guess she was new to the job or something).
Entrance to large fitness center including 20 m pool is included, I can highly rexommend it, super modern and clean.",4,2012,10,09
123,A stay never to be forgotten!,"When the hotel heard that my boyfriend was intending to propose we were upgraded to the Penthouse Suite with it's own roof top terrace which is an excellent place to propose!  Champagne and rose petals...the hotel went out of their way..Excellent food, room and service.  In fact the hotel was outstanding and what a fantastic location.",5,2012,10,08
123,Name - not a number!,"We stayed here for one night at the end of September, to attend the party of a friend. We had planned to have a lie in, missing breakfast; however we had not anticipated being woken by the installation of a flagpole outside our window! (We were on the first floor, above the entrance) To be fair to was a Monday morning, and it was normal working hours. However, when I called to reception their response was swift and generous. The workmen were delayed by half an hour and we were offered a complimentary breakfast. Very, very clever of them:-).

The breakfast was without doubt the best we have ever had, along with service to match. Why very clever? Because we will be going back, and probably back, and back. The Marylebone is located 2 minutes from one of the best shopping districts in London, including the wonderful Daunt book shop. It's service is stunning, the decor delightful. You're treated like a name not a number, what more can you ask for?",5,2012,10,08
123,I was very impressed!,"A walking distance from Bond Street, Marylebone High Street, Baker Street, Piccadilly Circus, Regent Street and Oxford Street, this hotel is a gem on a quiet street in one of London's high-end neighborhoods.  The hotel is luxurious without being highbrow or ostentatious.  I had a truly incredible time here, which isn't something I confess often during my travels.

From the moment I stepped foot in the Marylebone Hotel, I was treated like royalty.  From the Concierge to the GM, everyone was truly interested in ensuring I get the best service ever.  That came evident when the GM gave me a free night and free breakfast (~ £350 or $520) to compensate for the renovation noise I was hearing in my room.  The noise wasn't too bad and didn't last for long, but I did report it and that was their response!  I didn't even ask for it! I was truly impressed.

My room was made up twice a day and a fresh basket of fruit and a bottle of champagne were delivered to my room on the first night.  The room was spacious and the bed was plush (it was hard getting out of bed in the morning it's that comfy.)  The bathroom was good sized and luxurious.

I can keep on singing this hotel's praises for a while longer, but I'll leave you with this:  if you're looking for a true London experience, stay at this hotel and make sure you walk around the neighborhood, especially up and down High Street.  Stay at a cafe and read a book.  You will love it!",5,2012,10,08
123,Excellent great service,We arrived at this hotel after having an awful experience with the bloomsbury hotel. we went to the desk and a young man named Gunthen delt with our booking. unknown to him we had already paid for our eveining accomadtion with the bloomsbury hotel who had told us that they had no rooms so when Gunthen told me we had to pay i was a little upset and explained what had happened moments ago he then said excuse me and went to get Mr Mark Heyburn the manager. well what can i say apart from outstanding service he immidiatly delt with the problem in hand and got us a room and what a great room it was he went far and beyond to help us in every way possible and took alot of the stress away we cant thank you enough Mark you are a credit to the company and people like you make this world a pleasure to be in. The room was fantastic the hotel was fantastic and the staff were extremely helpful no problem was to big or to small the hotel itself is beautifully clean well decorated and the food was outstanding im glad we were moved to this hotel as it made our eveing enjoyable and i will be staying here again as for the bloomsbury well i have nothing more to say on that matter its the marylebone for me  :),5,2012,10,08
123,A fab experience,"Just back from a weekend stay here and had an excellent experience overall. The hotel itself is gorgeous; modern and luxurious. The public areas are elegant and classy and our room (superior twin) was very nice indeed. The bed was like sleeping on a cloud and there were nice touches like your very own coffee maker in the room. The towels and bathrobes were good quality and soft. Breakfast was extensive with plenty of different options, try the eggs benedict,  but a tad expensive. However I would definitely recommend it if your budget allows, if not there are plenty of cafes in the immediate vicinity. The gym seemed to have plenty of equipment, but we only tried the pool which was a bit cool when you first got in but not too bad after a short while. The ladies changing rooms were kitted out with hairdryers, good quality straighteners and shampoo, shower gel, body lotion etc., so no need to bother going back to your room to get ready if you don't want to. The staff here are very welcoming and helpful - they manage to make you feel quite special without being OTT. Check in and out was effortless.

Our only small gripe was that we didn't manage to master the shower. Even filling the bath was a bit of a trial as the pressure was low and it was difficult to regulate the water temperature. Had it not been for this The Marylebone would have got a well deserved 5 out of 5. If I could have rated this hotel 4.5 I would have.",4,2012,10,08
123,Awesome service...awesome all around,"Truly the best I've ever experienced. Everyone was extremely nice, very helpful. And I must say the best concierge ever! Rahim Ismail...very helpful. Goes above and beyond any expectations. Made my stay in London extremely easy and fun. I was traveling with a friend celebrating her 92nd birthday and he made sure her stay was the best! Everyone here very courteous and friendly. Will definitely stay here again. JKF. ",5,2012,10,07
123,"Fab hotel, fab staff, fab location - book it if you can!","We came here for a special anniversary and the hotel staff could not have made us feel more welcome.  We were upgraded when we arrived and had a treat waiting for us (including a handwritten card) when we'd been out for the day.  They totally understand what makes a good customer experience!

We didn't have breakfast but would make sure we included it when we book again - which we will.  This isn't the cheapest hotel available in the area but when you include the gym (with pool) and the location ie no taxis needed, it adds up to being a really good choice.

The facilities are all excellent, the room was lovely (very comfortable bed), fantastic bathroom and the only negative thing we could say was the tea and coffee making facilities weren't great but we know the hotel management value honest feedback.  It gets so much right - including offering you water for your journey home and other thoughtful touches - it really was a minor, minor point.

What definitely made it for us was the staff - they were fantastic.  Thank you, Marylebone Hotel for making our stay so lovely.",5,2012,10,07
123,Perfect for a relaxed afternoon tea,"Very convenient for a relaxing break after shopping on Oxford Street!

Superb afternoon tea, attentive service and comfortable sofas to lounge on. Tea was replenished as often as we wished and the supply of fresh sandwiches (five types of bread!), scones and cakes was more than adequate.

Highly recommended and outstanding value for money.",5,2012,10,06
123,A london gem...,"I was a very suprised that the Hotel has any negative feedback as I stay here on a weekly basis and the service, facilities and quality of the hotel is superb.  Food is excelelnt, rooms luxurious, staff incredibly attentive and has possibly the best gym I have ever used (and i dont mean ""hotel gym"".  Thoroghly recommended...great location for all London has to offer.",5,2012,10,04
123,Perfect!,"What can I say but PERFECT!

Fast, friendly and efficient check-in?......Check! Complete with hot towels!

Going above and beyond to satisfy additional requests/demands?......Check! I had called ahead and requested an early check-in, conditions permitting. Done! We were able to check in as soon as we arrived....3 1/2 hours early. I'd also requested a room with a bathtub. Done! See below.

Need tickets to a sold out performance of Phantom of the Opera?.....Check! The Concierge is beyond friendly and helpful, getting us 3 seats just like that! Wow! The seats were fabulous as was the performance.

Outstanding room?.......Check! A great room and bathroom by European standards. Awesome 'Nespresso' coffee machine for making espressos/americanos in room. Robes, slippers and a nice, deep bathtub to soak in. And the bed......ah yes the bed.....the bed was a little slice of heaven, making for a great nights sleep after a looooong day, taking in the sights and sounds of London.

Phenomenal customer service?.......Check! Every member of the staff always willing and ready. A helping hand, a bottle of water, getting a cab, opening and closing the lobby door, always asking if there was anything we needed or what more they could do or us....awesome!

Did I mention how great the concierge is?

5 star service at what is apparently a 4 star hotel. I highly recommend this hotel!

Keep up the great work and we'll see you again soon!",5,2012,10,03
123,Didn't stay but had afternoon tea,"Four friends and me had afternoon tea in the lounge. It was a first class experience and an unbelievable price Many hotels charge much more than their normal price and do not produce such an experience but when it was on offer at half price it is unbeatable The setting and ambiance was relaxing and welcoming the staff we dealt with were all helpful, friendly and professional. the food was great and competes with afternoon teas much more expensive. It was everything we were looking for form afternoon tea. Our only criticism was the seating and table were on the low side but other than that it was faultless.",5,2012,10,01
123,Great location,"I always stay at The Marylebone when I go to London on business trip. The location is great ( close to Hyde Park and Bond street tube station ). You are on the Central Line, which give you access to all major areas in London. I find the hotel well decorated with modern furniture and clean. The service is not great. You get the minimal that a hotel offers in terms of service, but that's it. ",4,2012,09,30
123,Not cheap but worth it.,"We stayed 3 nights at the Marylebone Hotel in London August 25-28, 2012.  We arrived early in London and I have advised them in hopes of being able to check in early.  We arrived shortly after 8AM and we were checked in in no time.  The hotel is in a lovely part of town - mostly residential and quiet which is exactly what we like.  The room was small but very comfortable and clean.  Washroom was large enough, updated and clean.  The foyer and areas around the reception were quite nice and inviting.  We saw that tea was served there but opted for drinks in the bar - not cheap but nice.  We found lovely pubs around for supper - Prince Regent was lovely - fish and chips were very tasty.  The rates are not cheap but the comfort of the hotel was worth it and we like being away from all the hustle and bustle without being too far either - walking distance from Oxford and Bond Street.  I would go back.",4,2012,09,28
123,Always Good,"Have stayed at The Marylebone on a number of occassions and always find it very good. It's location near Bond St Tube and Oxford St for shopping make everything nearby walkable-never more then 5 mins.If affordable try book the suites which give you that extra space.The gym and spa facilities are very good.Concierge will always make your restaurant ,West End show as well as sports event bookings etc.Really good 8,5/10 experience.",4,2012,09,27
123,Perfect Experience,"I booked this hotel on the strength of Tripadvisor reviews and was certainly not disappointed!! I spent the week-end with my daughter and 4 of her teenage friends here to celebrate her 18th birthday. The whole experience was perfect, the service was without fault and I was particularly impressed that the ""teenagers"" were treated respectfully, which is not always the case nowadays. The general ambience of the whole hotel is calm and relaxing which is exactly what is required after hectic shopping and sightseeing!!",5,2012,09,26
123,Few minutes from Oxford Street (Bond Street Station),"Perfect location to stay next to Oxford and Bond Streets. The breakfast was good  the prices fair (for London in Sept 2012), clean rooms, personal very friendly, spacious lobby. I was there for 4 days, but never got time to use the SPA. Next time i'll stay here again.",5,2012,09,24
123,Great hotel and staff,"I have recently stayed in the Marylebone and cannot praise the staff, the ambience and the accomodation enough. I was warmly welcomed upon arrival and made to feel a valued customer throughout my stay. The service was excellent the breakfasts were the best start to the day and the pool is simply wonderful. Even at capacity the Hotel staff coped admirably and the accomodation had everything one could possibly require.",5,2012,09,24
123,Central and nicest plac,"The Marylebone Hotel offers central location but you feel like staying in a village. I am always happy about smart and nice staff there. And by the way, the Hotel itself is luxury and offers charming lifestyle.",5,2012,09,24
123,Fantastic Hotel,"This hotel is central and also perfect for Harley Street/ London Clinic.
This is a boutique style hotel and the interior design is comfortable as well as stylish. The food is excellent and the prices fair. Our evening meal was served quickly and beautifully prepared. Breakfast offered choices from an ""express breakfast"" at £8.00, perfect for the light eater to the usual ""full monty"" and breakfast buffet.
The rooms are extremely comfortable and clean. The bed was heavenly.The room was exceptionally quiet. The bathroom was excellent and boasted toiletries from the spa.
A real treasure at this hotel is the attitude of the staff.  The doorman was always smiling, smart and attentive. Reception staff were efficient, and charming whilst the restaurant staff were quick and friendly. Rooms were spotless. Late check-out is possible.
I will stay here again.",5,2012,09,23
123,PBANZ,"We chose this hotel for its location without knowing that the Marylebone village had been voted the best in London recently.  Very close to Oxford Street, New Bond Street and the restaurants in St Christopher's Place.
We had a superior room, which we would reccomend because it is a little bigger than a standard room.  The shower was awkwardly set up in that you ended up getting a cold jet of water on your arm when you turned it on, and there is no bath.  This did not affect us, but our relative travelling with us missed her bath.
Very comfortable bed. We had stayed in 11 other hotels in the previous weeks, and this was one of the better beds.
The staff were friendly and seemed to really enjoy their work. We took afternoon tea one afternoon (highly recommended for the wonderful feeling of indulgence as well asfor the delicious sandwiches and cakes) and the presentation of the different teas available was delightful.
Breakfast was included in our rate and it was substantial and very fresh.",4,2012,09,23
123,Modern & Great Location,"Stayed here for a week on business.  Modern, chic hotel in a great location.  They offer a very good afternoon tea / snack service and the restaurant is also top-notch.  You get access to a very nice gym connected to the hotel.  Will stay here again when visiting London.",4,2012,09,21
123,very expensive for an average experience,"I stayed in the Marylebone for a change, instead of the Sanderson and I totally regretted it. The first room I was provided was on the road. Is it noisy I ask?  No replies the staff ... then some people walked by and I could actually hear their conversation - i.e. the words that they are saying. Finally I insisted a change of room. 

Next room better. However both had tiny bathrooms, the bed was so soft I had to visit a physio when I got back home (however that is personal preference).  The iron is tied to the ironing board so ironing is awkward and you cannot empty the iron (you are kidding I just paid 300GBP for a room and I am going to steal the iron !!). The safe is at knee level so you need to bend down to open it / empty it.

I'm going back to the Sanderson. The rooms are 50% larger, the bathrooms are awesome, the toiletries are nicer. Its everything the Marylebone is not and it is cheaper",2,2012,09,21
123,Good Hotel,"I have stayed here a few times,  customer service is great, staff are very helpful and the hotel is clean and tidy and quite stylish.    This is my favourite place to stay in London and the location is great.",5,2012,09,20
123,I can't think of a better place to stay in London,"This is such a great hotel to stay in , so many reasons ... great , clean rooms , great staff . Location is excellent for the usual sights and shopping and excelent connections via tube lines nearly . The bar in the hotel is really lovely unlike many hotel bars and the high street nearby has so many great little shops and cafe's . We had breakfast included and it was really good . A good hotel for a couple or shopping with friends or family . The hotal has a lovely old facade just off marylbone highstreet and a more modern extension that comes onto a little street thats only a hop skip to the nearest tube . London hotels can be expensive , you get your moneys worth here .",4,2012,09,20
123,Comfortable and friendly hotel,"hidden jewel in a right location. Good for business or getaway with friend over the busy days in London. Superb service from staff with helps to airport and also at bar/service center. If you decide not to leave the room, there are quite comfortable service and ammenity to spend time in the hotel.",5,2012,09,18
123,OUSTANDING,"My friend treated me to afternoon tea at this wonderful exquisite hotel.  The hotel itself had a luxurious interior, very welcoming.  We we greeted by a friendly receptionist who took our bags and stored them away even though we had not stayed at the hotel itself.  Then we were taken to a beautiful comfortable dining area.  The service was second to none and the afternoon tea itself was fantastic.  If you want to give someone special that special treat then I would recommend afternoon tea here.  So a special thanks to Kian and the rest of the staff for making our afternoon so special. We were so impressed by this hotel I am now looking for my next break to stay at the hotel itself as it is so central for all the sites of London.",5,2012,09,18
123,Expensive for average accommodations,"The Marylebone is located a good 4 blocks from the nearest tube station. The decor in the lobby and public areas is pleasant enough, but the guest floors are a little macabre.
The only outlet for the hair dryer was near the desk and, if you plugged it in, the fuses blew. The toilet never worked properly. Other guests seemed to be able to borrow voltage converters, but we were told there were none.",3,2012,09,18
123,Brilliant hotel in a fab location!,"We stayed in this Hotel in August 2012 and the staff were so friendly and polite. The room was spacious and quiet, with good airconditioning. It is in a great location close for getting it around London.",5,2012,09,18
123,Wonderful staff and service,"We have just returned from our 2nd anniversary trip to London and stayed, once again, at the Marylebone.

It's hard in this day and age to appreciate just how high they set their own standards for guest enjoyment.  From the initial greeting of the concierge and reception staff through to the absolute professionalism of the restaurant and bar staff - you could not find better service anywhere in London.

The rooms are lovely and cleaned each day to a very high standard.  

We only ate breakfast in the hotel but the food we saw looked wonderful!!

So looking forward to next September for our 3rd anniversary

123,"Quiet, modern and friendly hotel in great location","My Husband and I stayed 2 nights at The Marylebone for his birthday recently.  From the moment we arrived we were made to feel very welcome. The reception staff were courteous and efficient and we were offered refreshing towels.  There was a wonderful smell in reception coming from a large candle on a console table near the lounge.  One of the reception staff gave me the details as I was keen to know where I could purchase it. The spa/gym looked modern and well equiped. We had a superior room on the 5th floor at the end of a corridoor.  The room was modern and light with a good sized bed. There was a good size flat screen tv but I was a little surprised by the lack of movies. It was very quiet so we had a good first night sleep (very important on a unusually child free weekend). The bathroom however was where the experience was let down a little.  The bath panel looked  tatty, there was a very 70s looking shaving mirror and telephone, most of the pipework was pitted and the toilet roll holder kept falling off.  Also the  hooks holding the bath robes hung over the toilet roll holder.  When we went down for breakfast the staff addressed us by name.  The continental breakfast was very comprehensive and the staff couldn't do enough to help.  The toast wasn't the basic cheap brown/white dry thin stuff which  can often be disappointing.  Preserves by Tiptree, pots of marmite (we are in the love it camp), shot glasses of  smoothies and plenty of fresh fruit and a nice selection of cold meat/cheese/fish amongst other things.  There was also a selection of complimentary newspapers. The bar was quite buzzy and a good selection of drinks at typical London hotel prices plus a good range of light bites.  Upon checkout we were offered bottles of water for our journey home. Overall it was a great stay and we would consider booking this hotel next time we are in London. I wanted to rate it as four and a half out of five but couldn't work out how to do it!",4,2012,09,17
123,Great Location and wonderful staff,"All the staff at the Marylebone Hotel from our arrival to departure were the most friendly, welcoming and efficient of any hotel I have stayed at. The location makes a perfect base for exploring and shopping in London and a welcome retreat to return to after a busy day out and about. Our rooms were spacious and very comfortable and clean, there is a lovely pool, spa and an amazing gym, if you have time to try them. There is a huge selection for breakfast are it was delicious, we didn't eat dinner at the hotel but it looked excellent.",5,2012,09,12
123,Shopping trip.,"We stayed in this fabulous hotel for 2 nights. My daughters shared a beautiful delux room and myself and my mother were spoilt with a beautiful suite. 
The staff were so friendly and nothing was to much trouble. I had booked 2 delux rooms but found I would prefer a suite as it gave us more space. When I went to reception and asked about a bigger room it was all sorted out for me with out an drama. 
The resturant in the hotel serves fabulous food and has a very relaxed atmosphere. Again very friendly staff. 
The location of this hotel is perfect. It is a 5 minute walk to Oxford street and yet 5 minute walk from Marylebone high street,which is a hidden gem. Lots of beautiful shops,coffee shops and resturants. 
The hotel has a lovely comfortable atmosphere. It has lots of lounge areas where you can sit and take a coffee,read the papers or just relax and let the world go by. 
We are about to book are next stay for my partners birthday. He has not stayed here before but I know he will enjoy it! 
O",5,2012,09,10
123,"Lovely hotel, central, great service and food","I have stayed at the Marylebone Hotel 3 times now, and each time I have not been disappointed. The staff are very pleasant and attentive, check in is relatively quick, they offer to take your bags to your room.  I can't find fault with the staff whatsoever.
The rooms are very comfortable and nicely decorated.  I have seen a standard room, it's a good size but nothing amazing.  The suites on the hand, are amazing! They are spotless, spacious and very comfortable.  There is a large flat screen TV in the room, a big bed and sofa.  If you drink coffee they also have a coffee machine.  Water is put beside your bedside table before bedtime, unless you have the 'do not disturb' sign on the door.
The restaurant is great, the food is delicious, I had the lamb.  The breakfast is also great, make sure you go hungry as it's a buffet! 
Location is very central, there are some fabulous restaurants around the corner - try Levant for a meze or Le Relaise de Venise L'Entrecote.

One more thing... you can also use the Third Space gym - best to go with someone as it lacks any vibe, but the pool and steam room are nice.  The changing rooms are 10*",5,2012,09,10
123,"Outstanding Hotel in Fantastic, Central London Location",We booked 8 rooms for my 50th birthday party and all of our guests just loved this hotel.  The hotel staff are amazing and made us feel really welcome.  Breakfast was excellent.  The location is great - just a few steps from Marylebone High Street and its many shops and restaurants plus Oxford Street is a five minute stroll away.  Rooms were freshly updated and have been decked out nicely.  The hotel had been told by our travel agent that it was my birthday and had upgraded us to a suite and also presented us with a bottle of bubbly in our room.  The recently refurbished spa and pool are amazing.  We have decided that we will always stay at The Marylebone when we visit London in the future.,5,2012,09,09
123,A great hotel in a lovely part of London.,"This is a boutique style hotel. The rooms are spotless and the only slight criticism is that the bathroom was slight small and if there are two people trying to shower and get ready to go out it's bit tight.
Apart from that it's brilliant, the staff are very friendly and helpful and the breakfast is the best I've seen in any hotel. It was a shame that I had to choose one particular breakfast as there were so many choices that looked mouthwatering.
You are very close to Oxford street at the Hyde Park end but not so close that you get all the noise. This part of London is lovely with some very interesting little streets and quirky shops. The hotel is just a few minutes walk from Bond Street tube station.",4,2012,09,07
123,Great staff and location,"Stayed at Marylebone Hotel due to it's great location.  Staff was very friendly and the food was great.  Unfortunately carpet outside our room was being laid following a night out.  Needless to say it was little loud for 0730 on a Saturday morning.  Overall great stay, what we endured was something that happens one in a million stays.",5,2012,08,28
123,Rooms Not Ready,"We booked two rooms for Friday night as we had a Wedding to attend in Knightsbridge.  I rang ahead to request that one room be available a little earlier than check-in if possible as we had to be at the Church by 2.30 p.m.
Check-in is normally from 2 p.m.  On arriving at 2 p.m. on the dot we were told no deluxe double rooms were available and we would have to wait at least twenty minutes.  I explained our dilemma and the Manager was called but still no room was ready.  After many conversations to housekeeping on the phone we were eventually (at 2.20 p.m) upgraded to a studio suite.  On entering this we found the air-conditioning not to be working and a large old type machine left to plug-in.
The next morning, outside my daughter's room at 8.30 a.m. they pulled all the carpet up in the corridor and commenced drilling!!  On telling reception this we were given two complimentary cards for cocktails on our next visit.  Surely there should have been a card put through the door of the affected rooms with an apology prior to the work commencing?
Not a great experience and a great shame because the location is very good.",3,2012,08,28
123,Beautiful,"Good location, staff very accommodating and couldn't do enough for you. Room very clean and had tea/coffee facilities. On checking out, one of the staff gave me a bottle of water,which was a small touch by nevertheless a nice one. I would certainly stay here again.",5,2012,08,27
123,"Nice hotel, amazing staff, but could work on a few things","First off, I'd like to say that the staff and service was truly 5 star. They were extremely professional, friendly and helpful. 

I was staying for work and I found the price point offered reasonable. The location is just about perfect.

The lobby had a nice modern decor and felt hip and fun. 

The access to the health club in the basement was amazing. Best hotel gym ever!

Here's where I would detract from my experience staying here. I guess you'd call them design flaws. I stayed in a suite.

If I may pick a nit: why such low ceilings in the rooms and in the rest of the hotel?

The bathroom was huge, but the shower/tub was tiny. I'm a pretty small person and had a hard enough time showering in this narrow tub with the shower head at an awkward angle. I can't imagine how some of my larger American brethren would fare. 

I had two TVs in my suite. One faced the bed and one faced the sectional sofa. Turning them off and on was like playing musical chairs. I'd turn one side on or off and the other side would come on. They seemed to have a mind of their own.

The part of the room with sofa/sectional had this enormous coffee table that was really out of place (stubbed my toe a few times.)

There was no chest of drawers.

There was no stand for packing and unpacking suitcase. 

Perhaps personal preference, but I found the bed too hard and lumpy.",3,2012,08,27
123,"I love this hotel, love it's location, love it's staff","Very friendly staff, extremely quite hotel. I had very pleasant stay. The gym is 1st class, but the swimming pool is not. It is very cold & has lots of limitations for kids, only 1 1/2 hrs per day, which is very restricted & handicapping",5,2012,08,26
123,Great hotel,"Stayed at the marylebone hotel for the night while in London to watch a show, the hotel was in a great location and the service was fantastic, the rooms are nice clean and with a warm home feeling, on returning to the room after the show the bed was turned down and mints was left on the pillows which I think was a great idea, my self and wife both enjoyed out stay and will be returning the hotel again soon ",5,2012,08,26
123,Absolutely perfect!,"My husband and I stayed here for our 10th wedding anniversary as we were going to see the wizard of oz at the palladium. The hotel is situated so well, being less than a 5 minute walk from Oxford street.

As soon as we walked in we were impressed by the decor and politeness of the staff but we were even more delighted and overwhelmed when we were immediately offered congratulations for our anniversary and advised that we had been double upgraded to a suite - what a perfect start! We had arrived a little before check in so we decided to go for lunch and the receptionist was very helpful in telling us some of the best places we could go (try the coach makers - especially their burgers which are out of this world!) 

When we went back to the hotel we tried out the pool and spa which was very relaxing and upon returning to our room we were met by yet another fantastic surprise of a bottle of champagne, some fruit and an anniversary card!

The room was huge and very luxurious and breakfast the next morning was sublime! There was an enormous array as part of the continental and a delicious menu for the hot portion! 

Upon checkout we were asked about our stay in a genuinely caring way and the lady even remembered our name from when we had checked in and again offered us congratulations - these are the kind of touches that ensure return visits. Please understand that this is a beautiful, clean, well situated and well run hotel but the hotel's greatest assets by far are it's staff! These people make you feel as if you are the only guests in the hotel - that is quite an achievement in an establishment as large as this!",5,2012,08,25
123,Very satisfied Customer,"My husband and I stayed at this hotel 18Th - 21St August.The staff were all delightful. We were given a nice welcome at the desk by Nora. We then proceeded to our lovely studio suite to a beautiful surprise,  their waiting for us was a bottle of sparkling wine and a scrumptious chocolate birthday cake to celebrate my 65TH Birthday.
All the staff at this hotel I would say are hand picked, they are are all polite efficient and very friendly.The location of the hotel is perfect, a short walk from Debenhams in Oxford Street and round the corner to the lovely Marylebone High Street with all sorts of beautiful shops restaurants etc.An interesting  walk up Marylebone High Street you come to the Beautiful Regents Park.
After a day seeing the sites it is a perfect treat to come back and enjoy the fantastic leisure facilities situated in the basement of the hotel.
We were celebrating with family and could not have asked for a better hotel and perfect location.",5,2012,08,24
123,Marylebone - great choice,"Stayed in the hotel for 3 weeks workrelated. The hotel is nicely located near the London center and there are many great and affordable restaurants around it. Wellbeck street - where the hotel is located - is a quiet street, not surrounded by the buzz that's going on in Central London. Hard to immagine as the center is within walking distance! Breakfast in the hotel is very good, and the hotel has a fantastic gym which I would recommend to anyone.",5,2012,08,24
123,Laidback charm,"We just stayed here at the start of our honeymoon and couldn't be more pleased. The modern aesthetic was great and matched by the friendly, helpful and charming staff who all seemed happy to help - but not in that overbearing way that some more 'uptight' hotels have. Nothing seemed too much trouble and the room was perfect. Great breakfast selection, and we used the pool and great gym to work it off.  Cocktails in the lounge were great quality and the hotel location is ideal for Oxford Street, Bond Street, Marylebone High Street. Now just need another excuse to stay here!",5,2012,08,22
123,"Quiet Street, Great Location, Attentive and Knowledgable Staff","This is a very nice hotel on an extremely quiet street in Westminster. The smallest rooms are pretty tight for two but are more than adequate for one person if you want a great hotel without paying outrageous central London rates. The hotel has a beautiful lobby with beverage service and lots of comfortable seating to have a quiet discussion or to read a book. They also have a business center and nice meeting rooms. Marylebone High Street is just around the corner with lots of fantastic restaurant and cafe choices. Closest tube station is about 10 minute walk. The staff was available 24 hours a day and responded immediately and appropriately each time I contacted them, better yet, this wasn't just one person, but every member of the staff that I had reason to speak to. Bottom line: this is a great hotel that just may be my new go-to in London from here on out.",5,2012,08,18
123,Brilliant hotel in a great location!,"The hotel was brilliant from all perspectives. The location, the reception, the staff, the afternoon tea, the hotel facilities, all were exceptional. The rooms are very well presented and spacious by any standard (especially for what you usually get in London!). There is an amazing health center which is more impressive that most major fitness center chains, complete with a swimming pool. I highly recommend this hotel.",5,2012,08,16
123,Great location for a comfortable hotel,"Hotel is situated behind Maryelebone High street and walking distance from a few other London highlights. Rooms are nicely decorated with a very comfortable bed. As in most of the London hotels the bathroom is really small... Very extensive breakfest, free wifi. Different rooms in the lounge/reception desk area. Great spa area.",4,2012,08,13
123,Excellent hotel in the centre of London,"Stayed at The Marylebone Hotel for three nights and it was better than expected.
We wanted a indoor pool and this hotel has a pretty good one.
Had a really nice, quiet suite, bigger than expected. 
Location is perfect, walking distance from Oxford Street and Bond Street and there are some good restaurants around.
Tried the room service and was very happy with both the food and the service.
I have to say that what makes The Marylebone Hotel a great one is the staff, very friendly and helpful.
Nothing to complain about, just one suggestion, there's no drinking water in the pool area.  One has to go all the way up.
I would definitely book it again.",5,2012,08,06
123,"Lovel hotel in a quiet ""village"" not far from Oxford Street","Lovel hotel, good service, discreet and in a great location just off Marylebone High Street. Fantastic gym and pool, nice bar, welcoming lounge. I would recommend is to anyone visiting London and looking for a well organised, smaller hotel.",4,2012,08,05
123,Excellent City Hotel,"Me and my wife stayed at the marylebone hotel for a week. We opted for a deluxe room for the handicap as it was much bigger in size. The staff the reception was very courteous and they helped us with the luggage as well.

The only negative was the bed. As it was toooo soft and it actually gave me a nechache the next morning. We called the housekeeping to fix the problem and they were super efficient with it. They placed a plyboard under the mattress and it solved the problem.

The breakfast is fantastic. There is a buffet for the cold items but all the hot items and are made to order and served on the table. In my opinion that is really great as you get everything fresh and served to you the way you like it. The food quality was very good and so was the service. Overall we were very happy with the breakfast.

Location Location Location - the best. The marylebone is located on welbeck which is right behind     debenhams on oxford street where all the big shops are located and just a turn away from marylebone high street which has some cute boutiques and cafes. On the sunday we were there was a street market on marylebone high. There is also a tesco express here and pret a manger which we visited frequently to buy our daily nick nacks like fruits, juices, milk, beer etc.

On rainy days the hotel also provided us with an umbrella which came in very handy.",5,2012,08,05
123,Lovely Staff & Great Room!,"I would highly recommend this hotel! I was taken here for my birthday and our stay was faultless! Upon arrival the staff were really friendly, especially our receptionist who upgraded us to a deluxe room for no reason! The room was immaculate, modern and very spacious and the decor of hotel was nice too. Took me a while to work the shower as there were so many knobs but that's probably just me haha. Location is also brilliant. It was just a shame we couldn't stay longer!",5,2012,08,04
123,O dear o dear,"We booked an Executive Suite. We were shown to our ""Executive Suite"" . But what we were taken to was a  tiny room with two single beds. On complaining, we were told, o sorry, but the hotel is full. After some time we were shown two rooms we could choose from ( we had been Travelling for more than 24 hours yet no offer of water or tea etc was made).
Neither room was great but we settled for the better of the two, a narrow passage of a room with a bathroom  that I constantly had to prevent bumping into the basin or the bath. And I'm not overly large.
In our opinion housekeeping needs serious training, products are below standard, newspaper ordered did not ever arrive, a £4 tray charge was asked for a delivery of ice to our room (????) 

the location is fabulous, and the staff are friendly.
However I doubt we would return. Pity as we love the area.",3,2012,08,01
123,Already booked our next stay,"I would highly recommend this hotel and have already booked to stay here again for my next trip to London.
Positives - 
Excellent staff, very friendly and helpful.
Quality of decor and furnishings of a high standard and very modern.
Bed was very comfortable.
Bathroom ok sized although not a separate bath and shower (lovely toiletries).
Excellent location, situated in a lovely residential area next to many cafe's, restaurants, pubs and shops. Just a short stroll to Regents Park, Oxford Street and underground stations. We only used the underground once as it was so easy to walk to most tourist places.
Very quiet
Room service quick.
Didn't try the restaurant as there were so many choices nearby but may do so on our next stay.

No negatives just a few observations -
TV not in a good location and couldn't be rotated as it was fixed to the wall.
Air conditioning was very noisy.
Junior suite not big compared to most we've stayed in but this was not a problem.
Wifi could be a little faster.",5,2012,08,01
123,Exquisite afternoon tea,"Was tempted to go for afternoon tea with a 2 for 1 offer- what a perfect decision! I was taking the parents so wanted it to be a bit special; I emailed the hotel in advance to ask where we would be accommodated, and on arrival they had set up two tables for us to choose from. We chose the cosier lounge, and were shown a selection of teas to choose from by a charming waitress. Nothing was too much trouble and we were informed that if we were not happy with our decision the another tea could be brought. Teas were served graciously and the the afternoon tea tiers were brought to the tebale. Have a look at the photograph! Overlall this experience worked ou a 1/4 of the cost of tea at Fortnums, and to be perfectly honest, the service and quality were far superior!  Would wholeheartedly recommend.",5,2012,07,31
123,Excellent,"Very good hotel with friendly helpful staff. Clean rooms, good location right in the heart of London, all at a reasonable price. Good restaurant a plus too. Will be back to this one, that is for sure.",5,2012,07,30
123,The Marlyebone,"Great location off Marylebone High Street, close to public transport. Attentive, knowledgable staff, all the amenities needed for work and pleasure. A great bolthole in the heart of London. Recommended.",4,2012,07,27
123,A perfect hotel to visit again,"During our short visit to London we were lucky enough to stay at this excellent hotel.
The staff, service and location of the hotel makes it a must for us to return. We are returning to London in the next couple of weeks for a longer stay and we will definitely stay at this hotel.",5,2012,07,25
123,An anniversary treat to remember,"My wife and I enjoyed a wonderful 33rd anniversary treat at this splendid hotel. Our daughters gave us a wonderful stay- Antje and her staff were superb -professional and friendly-the upgrade to a suite and the chilled prosecco ""on the house"" were wonderful bonus gifts! For luxury, location ,comfort,elegance, style and service -this hotel was faultless. London 2012 at its very best and with staff as good and thoughtful as Antje and her team, this fine hotel can only prosper. We recommend this establishment wholeheartedly and have already done so to family and friends and hope to return one day",5,2012,07,25
123,out of the ordinary London boutique hotel,"Location-wise this hotel is one of the best I've been to in London. Shopping and restaurants nearby are plenty and upbeat. Museums, too. Hardly ever need to take a taxi. Hyde Park is a short walk away.
After reviewing dozens of hotel in London, my impression is that almost all of them look the same, classic English furniture with overwhelming details (wallpaper, carpet etc). So, this is the exception: good taste modern furniture, clean and light colors, comfortable room but not lavish, all the necessary facilities (including a large underground swimming pool and gym) and wi-fi everywhere. Not to miss the excellent restaurant, open to the public through a separate entrance to it.
I have read that rooms are rather small, so I decided for a suite, which was very neat, with a separate seating area. 
Service is very attentive and efficient.
Good money for a nice place to stay.",5,2012,07,22
123,"Good hotel, convenient location","This hotel has lots to offer, good location, helpful and friendly staff and good breakfasts.
The standard rooms and bathrooms are a little small but very clean.",4,2012,07,22
123,Nice hotel,"I liked this hotel. Friendly people at front desk. Good location, glose to bond street. Very nice room.",5,2012,07,19
123,Amazing Hotel In Great Location- Wonderful,"Had a great stay in this hotel recently, it really is deserved of its stars. The staff were excellent, every detail was take care of, We had a super room. The atmosphere in the hotel greets you when come in from the busy streets of london with the aroma of designer candels in the lobby. They really go out of their way to make your stay a wonderful experience. The gym and health club attached to the hotel is superb! A real treat for such a central london  hotel. This is one of the best hotels I've stayed in when you take in the price difference between this and say five star properties. You get the same service in my opinion. The mini bar was amazing, they even had mini hendricks! The overall room size and decor was great and the whole hotel interior was up to date and luxurious. The breakfast was AMAZING. No scrimping here, super continental buffet and choice of warm breakfast all included if you got for b and b.Tiny gripe: the coffee at breakfast was really bad-but hey lots of coffee shops in Marleybone! Staff were brilliant. Will be back.",5,2012,07,19
123,It was a pleasure!,"We stayed a week with the hotel and found it very comfortable. The staff was amazingly friendly and helpful, including front desk, clerks and room service. The design has an elegant taste, in particular, in the common areas of the hotel. The superior room is a bit small and has a small closet for 2 people, but one of us was coming from a long trip, with a lot of luggage, and did require unusual space. The room is functional and has several amenities, including an espresso machine. Wifi internet is available and is included in the rate. It's not very fast but works well for emails and GPS downloads. I particularly liked the restaurant, which has a cozy modern design, friendly staff and, off course, good food. I strongly recommend the sticky toffee pudding for desert.  I visited the gym, and looked very modern. Unfortunately time did not allow enjoying it. The location is perfect for shopping as it is walking distance from major streets. Public transportation is also nearby and includes the public bicycles docking stations a few blocs away. A couple of minor problems we have been appropriately dealt with by the management, and I left with the feeling I will not need to look for another hotel next time I go lo London. I do recommend it!",5,2012,07,18
123,best choice for a central london hotel,"stayed for 28 nights , could not have said for more , this is rated a 4.5 star on trip advisor , but i feel it should be rated as a 5 star . 
We have always stayed at the radisson berkshire , and this time wanted to change as the rooms there are small for such long stay. 
After searching around the nearest option to  the radisson berkshire (350 oxford street ) we found the marylebone hotel a 5 min walk .
after getting a prompt and positive reply from the deputy general manager mr . frits potgieter, and front office manager ms. diana rebrik , we went ahead with our booking .

after staying here it will be difficult to change your mind for another property , because for a 4 star rated 200 pounds central london hotel this is too much value for money hotel , i have stayed at cumberland , thristle marble arch , berkshire , compared to all of them this is far superior in terms of service,rooms and breakfast

we made our other family cancell there booking at thristle marble arch to  stay here told them its worth that extra pound .",5,2012,07,16
123,Wonderful stay at conveniently situated well staffed hotel,"This is certainly the best stay I have enjoyed at this Hotel ,which I have continuously returned to because of its very convenient position.This time I actually have been so impressed that Ihave even thought it couldbe a model training Hotel for staff .They so eager to please at every station ,from the front desk through to the Concierge as well as the dining room,one almost feels you are their personal guests,nothing being too much.
The rooms are varying in size and shape but the hotel has recently been very stylishly refurbished to include conveniences like kettles coffee machine iron and docking station for iPad (offering free wifi).
The breakfasts are very good and the choice of free newspaper is what my husband particularly enjoyed.
The team leaders especially the Rooms Manager sets an excellent example by being so approachable in every sense even beyond his responsibility in assisting me when I was technically challenged with using my IPad!This is unusual and especially not being part of a big group and just an individual traveller I was even more taken.
The hotelis super conveniently situated and the lounges downstairs are actually used by their guests as they are stylish ,inviting and allow one areas of privacy.The gym too is fantastic according to my children ,an additional extra.
I have returned to this hotel continuously since before it was owned by this Group but can truely say the turnaround has been remarkable and the quality of staff chosen has been very much the contributing factor .Though I am somewhat technically challenged Thisis the only way I could saythankyou to everyone sohencemyreview!",5,2012,07,16
123,The perfect honeymoon!,"We didn't book the hotel directly, but mentioned to the receptionist that we were on our honeymoon. Even though service this far was impeccable, they now really showed what ""service"" is (service for me is getting more than you expect). We were upgraded to a significantly nicer room. They didn't have anything available for the first night, so we got to see what we really had booked. The upgraded room was three times as big, with a living room and a separate bedroom with a bathroom en suite.

The only complaint is that we were charged for breakfast the first morning, and thought it wasn't included the rest of the stay. When we checked out, they hadn't charged us for the first breakfast so we assumed it was a mistake. Bit of a bumme that we had to go out for breakfast the four following mornings, because we didn't want to pay £18 per person for breakfast.

Walking distance to Oxford Street and the subway is definitely a plus!",5,2012,07,15
123,Fingers crossed!!!!!,"Following weeks of research and after reading the high praise for the marylebone hotel we have selected this for our special night in London (anniversary and 1st night away from our new born twins)....... I hope the reviews are true!!!!!!!!! 

Full review to follow after visit!

Any suggestions on a nice room or room number to select?",5,2012,07,14
123,London trip just 2012,"Well positioned hotel, clean rooms ,great staff, travelled with my family (4) very friendly service",5,2012,07,13
123,Excellent short stay,"Excellent place to stay. It was a business trip and booking was done by office. I just loved the place, marvelous location, great decor and ambience and above all an extremely courteous, helpful, friendly and hospitable staff.
The room, though small was well equipped with all comforts. I could charge my iPhone 4S on a dock while enjoying my music. The Wi-Fi was complimentary which was the biggest plus for me as at other hotels it is outrageously expensive. The location of the hotel is so central and walking distance from Baker Street/Regent Park tube stations.
Though I stayed overnight only but was mighty impressed. Choose Marylebone without any concerns.
The only little discomfort I felt was for the too soft mattresses.",5,2012,07,11
123,A Fine Mayfair Hotel,"Spent a five day mini-break in London and greatly enjoyed staying in the Marylebone Hotel.  The hotel itself is beautiful, well located and has excellent service.  The rooms are comfortable, clean, stylist and large enough.  The hotel is beautifully located, a couple of blocks off Oxford St - quiet enough, but close to the West End action in London. Loved it, we'll be back.",5,2012,07,09
123,Great location,The key to this hotel is its location.Marylebone Village is a well kept secret and well worth experiencing.Very close to Oxford Street but in a world of its own.Hotel is ok but small rooms and a slight business feel to it.Little competition so prices high.,3,2012,07,09
123,"Great hotel, great location",The staff are friendly and helpful and the rooms comfortable and well appointed.  Stayed for two nights on a recent trip to London and found the location excellent. Near plenty of shops and great restaurants of all price ranges and types.  The beds were incredibly comfortable and the hotel was quiet.  I would definitely stay again.,4,2012,07,09
123,"One night stay, we'll be back!","The reviews that I had read of this hotel had been so positive, our expectations were very high, we were not to be disappointed! From the moment we arrived, the attention to detail from the staff was exemplary. From the hot towels on arrival, to the courtesy call 30 mins after we entered our room, the reason for the positive reviews was becoming more obvious. The staff we encountered were all a credit to the hotel group. I didnt want this review to be too fawning, and so I asked my wife whether there was one 'improvement opportunity' that we could highlight, but alas we couldnt think of one. So in summary, a fantastic stay at a fantastic hotel, and we are already planning our next visit!",5,2012,07,09
123,Best travel experience of my life! Simpson,"My nephew and I recently stayed at the Marylebone Hotel for 2 weeks in June 2012, and it was an absolutely amazing experience. The hotel staff and head concierge Rahim Ismail were extremely helpful, giving us guidance and advice on exploring the Marylebone area around the hotel.  I also want to acknowledge Fiona who checked us into the hotel; she greeted us with a warm and friendly smile. After a long flight from America we were given a “warm towel” that at that point of our arrival was such a welcome surprise; it was just so refreshing and such a treat.  This was our first trip to London and, thanks to the excellent care we received and the wonderful experience of staying at the Marylebone Hotel, we are already planning another trip to London and plan on staying at the Marylebone Hotel again.  I would absolutely recommend this hotel to my family and friends.  The location of the Marylebone Hotel is convenient for shopping and has a wide assortment of restaurants to choose from that are within walking distance of the hotel.
We enjoyed eating at the Marylebone Hotel’s restaurant One08; the food was delicious and the service was exceptional.  I would like to recognize the young lady Magdalena that took such wonderful care of us each time we ate at the restaurant; she was so pleasant and always greeted us with a warm smile and was very knowledgeable about recommendations from the restaurant menu.  One of the reasons we ate so many meals at the restaurant was not only because of the wonderful food but was due to the excellent service we received from Magdalena. She took such good care of us during our stay at the Marylebone Hotel. We also ended most of our evenings in the hotel’s bar enjoying munchies and a glass of wine. I was so impressed that everyone in the restaurant and bar knew my name, and that act of kindness made me feel like I was home. I think it is hard to find a hotel that is so welcoming that you feel like you are going home at the end of a day.  That to me is beyond belief, and the Marylebone Hotel makes you feel like you are at home and are a part of their family.
I stayed in a Deluxe Room at the Marylebone, and I will say it was a very warm and comfortable room to come back to at the end of a busy day spent shopping and wandering around the city of London.  Surprisingly, the bed was so comfortable that I slept better there than in my own bed at home.  I truly enjoyed being at the Marylebone Hotel and can hardly wait to go back to London and stay there again.  My thanks to Rahim and the staff at the Marylebone Hotel for making my stay one of the best experiences of my life. I look forward to seeing all of you again.",5,2012,07,06
123,Excellent,"Only stayed one night but thought hotel represented excellent value for money.  The hotel was a 5 minute walk from Bond street tube station but in a quiet and peaceful location.  3 mintues in the other direction is Marylebone High Street with a great selection of shops, bars and cafes. The room we had was fairly small but had everything we needed. All in all a great option for an affordable short stay",5,2012,07,02
123,Thank you for looking after us.,"I have just returned home after taking my 6 year old Grandson Noah on a sightseeing trip tp London. We both enjoyed staying at this hotel. It is very central with all the amenities we could have wished for. All of the staff were extremely friendly without being ""over the top"". The room 260 was comfortable. We did have breakfast each day in the restaurant which we both highly recommend as the choice of food was excellent. As I have already said all the staff were wonderful and Noah thinks that the ""men at the doors"" are really cool especially the one with the hat!!!",4,2012,06,30
123,Excellent,"I have stayed at many hotels in London over the years but my recent stay at the Marylebone was about as good as it gets. Great location, friendly helpful staff and nice rooms.",5,2012,06,29
123,All the vacation necessities in a perfect location,"I randomly selected the Marylebone based on price and location; though I was a bit nervous to stray from my precious Marriott chains. For price and location, this seemed to be a better fit. Just under 2 miles from the St. Pancras station, I thought it was excellent. I wandered around the neighborhood, feeling safe, and fortunate to be staying near St. Christopher Place; which was definitely a place to be! There was always plenty to do. In addition, Buckingham Palace was less than a mile and a half away and Big Ben was less than two. I'm a big walker on vacations, to this was definitely ideal. The rooms included everything you needed and I’ve never seen a nicer group of bellhops. 

If you go, stop in at the hotel bar and hopefully you get a chance to interact with Thomas at the bar. He's an amazing customer service person. Have some wasabi peas for me!",5,2012,06,28
123,A big 'thank you!',"We booked a stay for my mom's 50th birthday and had an amazing experience from the moment we stepped through the doors! Not only were all the staff friendly and incredibly helpful,the facilities were stylish, spacious and catered for all your needs, with a special birthday surprise in the room for my mom too! What was most impressive and note worthy however was the hospitality we received from the head concierge, Rahim Ismail. He went above and beyond what was expected on several occasions - from finding last minute theatre tickets to general advice on where to go and how to get there!! His insight, professionalism and manner was a real asset. The stay was made even more memorable and I would highly recommend it to others as a result; we will definitely return when the next occasion arises! So thank you to you all.",5,2012,06,25
123,Best all round hotel in London,"We have been going to this hotel regularly for 6 years.  You cannot beat the location of this hotel for proximity to restaurants and shops.  It is down a quiet side street in a very central location.  The staff are all exceptional and the standard of service, quality of food has improved beyond belief with the new management.
Breakfast is relaxed with a fantastic selection of food.  The food at ""One 08"", their downstairs restaurant is excellent value and top quality.  We ate the best scallops and sole the other day that we have ever eaten.
The complimentary gym, pool and steam room are very welcome after a long day in London.
Above all, we love the ambience and personal attention given to us, without exception, by all the staff.",5,2012,06,25
123,"Nice hotel, good and quiet location.","This hotel is in Marylebone and three blocks from Oxford Street, but it is quiet. Lots of nearby restaurants (5-6 minutes walk). Good gym. Restaurant is fine, but lots of choices nearby.",4,2012,06,25
123,Would definitely recommend,"We stayed at the Marylebone hotel for my husbands 50th birthday weekend in May. The hotel had arranged a bottle of prosecco as a birthday treat and had given us a room upgrade to a Deluxe room which was a lovely surprise.
The check in staff were very polite and friendly, giving a warm welcome and hot towels on arrival.
I had requested a room and in a quiet location (as we are light sleepers) and we were given a lovely room which overlooked a small side street, which was ideal.
The room was in our opinion very spacious for a London hotel, with a Nespresso machine, a large comfortable bed and the bathroom was very roomy with a good shower. 
A suggestion for improvement to the bathroom would be that I guess at some point the bathroom door opened inwards (it now opens outwards into the room) as there is a doorstop in front of the toilet which I managed to stub my toe on in the middle of the night in the dark. As the door opens outwards now there is no real need for the doorstop to remain in the bathroom and this could be removed.
We didn’t eat at the hotel as there are so many cafes in the area so I can’t comment on the food.
We used the leisure centre which I must say is extremely well equipped, next time I will definitely bring my gym kit! The steam room is by the pool, but the saunas are in the changing rooms so there is no unisex sauna. 
Another suggestion would be to put a water fountain in the pool/steam room area as I found it rather odd that the only water supply I could find was outside the changing room, which is not ideal when you’ve come from the steam room and want a drink. If there is one closer then perhaps it could be signposted?
The leisure set up is very good and they do a range of treatments though we did not have any.
We had a super stay here and would definitely stay again as the hotel has great facilities, is in a superb location and I think is good value for money.",5,2012,06,24
123,London's finest,"I stayed for one night and after an exhausting journey, it was such a nice end to a night to get to the hotel.  The hotel staff is incredibly friendly, helpful, and the hotel itself is modern but quaint, stylish yet comfortable.  The rooms were spacious and clean.  The breakfast had a large selection and the service was impeccable.  I would definite stay here again.",5,2012,06,21
123,Great Stay,"We stayed at the Marylebone Hotel from the 8th to 16th June on a holiday to London.  Its position just off Oxford Street was a real plus for access to shopping, restaurants, the tube and tourist attractions.  At the same time it was extremely quiet in an upmarket residential district.  The staff were all fantastic and bent over backwards to help.  Raphael and Rahim organised tickets for us, transportation, and help with directions, and Avin helped with the TV.  The breakfast buffet was delicious and the wait staff very attentive.  Our bed was super comfy, the amenities great and the bottled water and chocolate each night a nice touch.  (Would have been good to be able to put fruit and snacks in the fridge though without causing problems with the mini bar items!!) The gym was unbelievably good and only sorry we only got to use it twice!",5,2012,06,21
123,Faultless!!!,"Stayed here for 4 nights over New Years and 2 nights in March.  This has been my 4/5 visit to the hotel now, they have all been fantastic stays. From the food to the leisure facilities, everything has been first class. 

Mark Heyburn and the rest of the staff have made are stay that much more welcoming. Thank you guys, keep up the good work. 

Excellent location, 5 minutes from Oxford st. Plenty of places to eat within minutes. Not far from the tube stations or mainline station. Cabs are always available outside. Car park at the end of the road, although abit pricey they do provide you with a subsidised ticket (better than nothing)

I will be going back for a few more nights in August, will not stay at another hotel in London now that I have found The Marylebone Hotel.",5,2012,06,17
123,Hidden Gem,"We discovered this hotel last year and are absolutely in love with this property.  This year it was even better than the last.  Rooms are spacious, huge lobby is warm and welcoming. House keeping is fast and efficient. The staff and management will always greet with a smile. Conceirge was able to get bookings to all top resturants in an instant. 

Location is perfect, hardly a 5 min walk to Oxford street yet very quietly hidden in an upscale residential area.",5,2012,06,16
123,Good and bad rolled into one,"First, let me own up. I didn't pay for this visit. My company did, or I wouldn't have stayed there. It's not cheap. The location is good, there are a lot of staff, and the restaurant staff in particular are keen to please. The food was good, reasonably priced, quickly presented and hot. I particularly commend the breakfast at £23 which set me up for the day. The drinks were not cheap; in fact a glass of wine cost me more than my starter. I (and all our party) were invited to pay for an upgrade, declined (because the company doesn't let us) and then found we were upgraded anyway. The superior rooms were all good and quiet, well equipped and laid out. 

The downside - alarm call came at the wrong time (twice), the newspaper I'd ordered didn't show, and the turndown staff arrived just after I checked in as if they were waiting in ambush. There's a lack of info in the rooms about how things work, so I had to experiment with the heating until I didn't have a howling gale blowing through. I can only assume the previous guest in this room was a homesick Inuit.",4,2012,06,16
123,Nice location and well priced,Excellent hotel in the heart of London and with pretty good rates. Everything worked well and the staff were SUPERB !,5,2012,06,15
123,Good choice for central London,"Stayed at the Marylebone for the jubilee weekend on a room only basis. Reception was welcoming, plenty of staff eager to assist, very efficient and smart-looking. My room was booked through an agent so I got what I paid for.  Good use of space (although I had to ask for additional hangers, which is not a problem, but if 2 guests are staying 4 nights it makes sense to provide at least 5/6 hangers each).  The shower was excellent, easy to use and a massive shower head. The hotel scored high with its public areas, a selection of lounge spaces in which to sit, relax, read, take coffee etc, a separate TV lounge with daily papers, and a business-type area to use PC's. Didn't use the restaurant but I did have a drink in the bar area which was very nice. The location of the hotel is great, a few minutes from the shopping mecca of Oxford/Regent St and the charming Marylebone Village. I would very much recommend this hotel when staying in London, it's immaculately clean, discreet (saw 2 celebs in the lobby area) friendly, and very good value for money.  Am considering a sister hotel for Christmas.",5,2012,06,11
123,Left stress free - amazing hotel!,"Me and my sister stayed at the Marylebone hotel for four nights last weekend (over the queen´s jubilée), and we absolutely loved it. We were looking for a much needed break from everyday life, and we felt very well taken care of.

 We chose this hotel after carefully looking over many many options from Tripadvisor, and one thing we really liked with the Marylebone is not only the lack of bad reviews, but also that they personally replied to the reviews. It just speaks for itself. 

Upon arrival we were handed warm towels, we asked to change our double room to a twin room (superior), that was not a problem,we were seated in the lobby for a bit to wait for the room to be ready for us and they served us coffee of our choice together with biscuits, as we sat there we saw staff polishing lift buttons and fluffing cushions in the chairs. 

They really couldn´t do enough for you. Entering the room, we noticed the room was not at all small as some people claims, not that it would have mattered to us. We didn´t come to London to swing cats in there anyway.

Beds - heavenly.. we slept like princesses. If you ever saw the snake in the cradle in the cartoon of Robin Hood you´ll know what I mean.

We are women, we like to shop, and living a 7 minutes walk from Oxford street that was not a problem. Around the corner from the hotel there is also a mini Tescos, Starbucks and other little eating places/shops. This place is also very close to Madame Tussauds and Baker Street (Sherlock Holmes). The area felt very safe to walk around in.

We would definately go here again, we fell in love with it and London in general. 

Thank you Marylebone hotel for making our stay so amazing, and thank you for all the little special things you did to make us feel special.

Ps. Can´t rate breakfast as we never had it at the hotel.",5,2012,06,09
123,"Nicest staff, great location",This hotel is in a great location. It is one block away from Oxford Street and around the corner from Marylebone High Street. The rooms are clean and the bed very comfortable. There is a trendy bar on the ground floor. What really made this hotel great for me was the unbelievably friendly staff. The lady who checked us in rang our room to wish me a happy birthday and shortly after sent a bottle of complimentary wine to our room. All the staff we encountered were just so lovely and couldn't do enough for you. I travel quite a bit and stay in London alot. I will not think to stay anywhere else on my next visit.,4,2012,06,09
123,Value for money,"Over the past number of years, I have been a guest of the Marylebone hotel on many pleasure and business trips. I know and have experienced that the Marylebone hotel's management and staff care about their guests. On the very rare occasion I made a complaint that something was not quite to my satisfaction, my complaint was acted upon without delay and always to my complete satisfaction.
Each time I return to the hotel, which is superbly located for business or pleasure, I am greeted warmly by the Hotel's staff and welcomed back with great sincereity. 
I would recommend this hotel to any would be guest. The staff, location and facilities are excellent.",5,2012,06,07
123,"Great Hotel, plan to stay there on next visit!!",In a great neighborhood and easy to get to most places in London from the hotel's location.  The service and staff were excellent and extremely helpful.  I would definitely go back there and recommend it to my friends.,4,2012,06,06
123,excellent!,"Nothing bad to mention about this at all. Friendly and helpful staff. Clean, well equipped and quiet rooms. Amazing swimmingpool! 
Only about 5 minute walk to Oxford street so even location is very good. Will definitely go back!",5,2012,06,06
123,Very good - for London!,"This hotel is very nice. It has a lovely entrance, relaxing lounges and a spa and pool if you want it. The rooms are modern and well done although the bathrooms need updating (the shower over the bath wasn't great).  Noise levels are a problem as the walls are remarkably thin, even for a London hotel - you can hear next door in the bathroom!!
The quality of beds and linen are a very good quality though.
The breakfast is very impressive with great service although rather frustratingly they charge extra for a cooked breakfast or anything hot!",4,2012,06,05
123,OUTSTANDING,"What can I say; Alone in London, staying at the Marylebone Hotel for 5 days on business with a bit of pleasure mixed in.  WHAT A TREAT. On arrival after a long flight from South Africa I was greeted with much cheerfulness and incomparable service. I felt like I was the only guest. Received by the most responsive Reception in specific “Fiona” and the most proactive concierge “Raffele”, I felt like a star.  The accommodation was above average for London in size and in décor. It was very clean and the staffs on a whole were exceptional. I will go back without a hesitation. Thank you Marylebone, for such a wonderful experience. Mrs Dos Santos",5,2012,06,04
123,Quality Price Rapport is Very Good,"London is a very expensive city, and if you are used to four/five star hotel accommodations around the world, London room rates will seriously set you back. This is where the Marylebone becomes interesting, at reasonable prices, the hotel offers a great location in central London, at a five minute walking distance from the busy Oxford street and Bond Tube Station. On the downside, the rooms and bathroom are a bit small, and the hallways leading to the rooms have a low sealing. On the upside, the hotel in generally very clean, and the staff is willing to help and assist.",4,2012,06,04
123,Good hotel but expensive compared to quality  level,"Fantastic position in the center of London, walking distance or few minutes by taxi  to most of interesting places.

Very appreciated gym facility in the basement (included in the room fare).

Food quality pretty good: nice and unexpected surprise to who thinks cooking in UK is always bad!!!!

Bad facts:
Room small, bathroom even smaller (why fit two armchair and a small table in a room like that??!)
Ugly view on the back of the hotel
I didn't find shampoo in the bathroom and I had to ask for it
Huge price also compared to other European Capital Cities",3,2012,06,02
123,"It's a good hotel, but if your room is on the wrong side...","The Marylebone Hotel has a nice location, not far from Bond metro station and Oxford Street, in a quiet and pleasant residential area. 
It's a modern and stylish hotel, with a nice lobby and different places where you can sit and have a drink.
My superior room was also nice, modern with a comfortable bed and good quality linens.
However, my room was on the back of the hotel, with one of the worst views I have ever experimented, and some noise from the machines outside (see photo). As a result it was difficult to have a good night's sleep. I didn't asked for another room as I only stayed one night.

Continental breakfast was good with decent choice.

There is also a spa and a swimming pool, something really nice.

Overall it might be a very good hotel, but if your room is not on the wrong side.",3,2012,05,31
123,Quite a treat,"Loved this hotel.  We (parents and 2 adult children) booked this hotel after researching options for over two weeks. Our criterion was one room (like most USA hotels), A/C and wifi in a neighborhood close to the Underground.  After a couple nights Googling, we gave up on one room.  And then we narrowed down our selection to The Marylebone Hotel, with no confidence that we had made a good decision, but at least we had a place.  Turned out it was quite a treat.

The lobby is nice, but its collection of many comfortable sitting rooms was really appealing.  There we found coffee, tea, and fruit ready in the morning. We believe there were other setups in the day, but we arrived back so late that all we saw was the clean-up. The restaurant's continental breakfast buffet was delicious with a good selection of fruits, breads, cheeses, cereals, juices and coffee (tea too).  And the Bar (separate from the restaurant) seemed very posh.  Nearby, their public toilets were elegant and plentiful (3 females).  We had no time to swim or spa, but the gym had the latest equipment.

Our two 4th floor rooms were across the hall from each other, and we liked both rooms' views (rooftop and building across the street); lots of light and quiet. The queen beds were heavenly, lots of electrical outlets (tho 2 in one room did not work), and the room temperature was easy to regulate.  We needed to refrigerate a bottle of wine, and just had to tell the front desk that we were displacing some minibar items.  Our shower door didn't quite close due to a slightly twisted rubber seal, but we straightened it out.  Maid service was twice a day (tho one of our rooms was forgotten at night), with water and chocolates at night.  

The front desk help was terrific, especially Gunther.  We arrived early by tube and dropped off our bags. Went to collect one child and dropped off her bags.  Then went to collect second child and dropped off her bags.  When we got into our rooms around 3:00, the assorted bags quickly followed.  The concierge was very helpful with reservations and directions.  And every time we left the hotel, there were 2-3 cabs at the ready.  We stayed 4 nights, and enjoyed every minute.",4,2012,05,31
123,A great place to stay,"Any time I visit London I seem to drift back to Marylebone and to the Marlylebone Hotel.  I have stayed here since it was the Clifton Ford and most recently on the Heineken Cup weekend (18th May).  A great hotel in a supe location with really great staff who always seem to go the extra mile and, my goodness, they had a busy weekend when I was there.  Rooms are always clean, well appointed and although some can be on the smaller size it does not take a way from the stay.    Close to Oxford Street, Marylebone High Street, Hyde Park and all the cafes, bars, restaurants and all you need to enjoy your stay.  The West End is 20 minutes walk or a short taxi ride.  Great place, you wont be disappointed.",5,2012,05,30
123,"Great Location, below average cleanliness","The hotel location speaks for itself; if you're looking to be near shopping, parks, restaurants or art galleries this is the place.
The room size does not disappoint, we had booked a studio suite. The room cleanliness, however, was below par: dirty, smelly carpet and hair in the bathtub. I complained to the concierge who offered her apologies.
We did ask to change rooms however due to an extremely uncomfortable, sinking and uneven bed. Never mind the dirty room, to sleep (or not being able to sleep) would have definitely ruined our stay. The hotel staff was very comprehensive and offered us another room as well as a small bottle of wine and chocolates.
The purpose of this trip was to spend some quality time away from our kids with my wife and I would not book this hotel again for the reasons stated above. I'd rather shell out another 100$ and get a better room elsewhere.",3,2012,05,30
123,Good location but not value for money,"Travelling with my wife we wanted to stay in the Marylebone area and choose Marylonebone Hotel because of very close location to Bond and Oxford streets. The hotel is pleasant but you feel that you are more in an American business hotel than a London boutique hotel as it was told to be. The lobby is very elegant but the room did not live up to the same standard, rather disappointing. It was small - still we got a superiour room. The bathroom was also small and everytime you turned on the water a terrible noice appeared! As breakfast was expensive in a rather ordinary restaurant we went out to some of the very cosy restaurants along Marylebone High street to have our morning meal. It is also an excellent shopping street. Access to the pool was unfortunately not included in the price.",3,2012,05,30
123,Couldn't have been better!,"We recently had our wedding reception at the One08 restaurant at the Marylebone hotel on the 18th May. We decided to stay the night before and the night of the wedding, the customer service was absolutley excellent. All the staff that I had the pleasure of dealing with were very helpful and polite and went out of their way to make our stay extra special. We were given a room upgrade along with lovely gifts left in the room. The meal and service at the 108 restaurant was really excellent also, I would recommended this hotel/restaurant for a function without a second hesitation. A special mention to Nathasha who has been a great support throughout all the planning and on the day. Also Angela in the restaurant did a fabulous job. We will be visiting again for, perhaps our first anniversary ;0) ",5,2012,05,30
123,Third stay in four years and...,"we generally enjoy The Marylebone Hotel.  The location is perfect with the hotel being just about equidistant from Bond Street Underground and Baker Street Underground stations.  And the variety of restaurants, shops and services on Marylebone High Street make it a so convenient.

The lobby is beautiful with five or six ""lounge"" areas in which to sit and relax, have a drink, enjoy the fireplace on a chilly London day and just enjoy the quiet atmosphere.  The front desk staff is fantastic.  Friendly, helpful and they get the idea of customer service.

But, there are problems with housekeeping and maintenance.  We arrived at 3:00 p.m. and had to wait over an hour for our room to be ready.  Louise, at the front desk, was very helpful and made several calls to the housekeeping supervisor to find out the status of our room.  It appears that the supervisor was not following through on his promises to make the room ready in a timely fashion.  She was very apologetic, tried to find us another room of the same type that was ready and arranged for tea and cookies in the lobby for us.  So, kudos to Louise for her attentiveness and proactive management of the situation.  No kudos for the housekeeping supervisor who did not follow through on his promises and failed to ready the room by a standard 3:00 check-in time.

Doyle Collection has spent a lot of money on its lobby and other facilities, but the rooms definitely are seeing wear and tear.  Stained grout in the shower, a rusty and dirty-looking shower head, a bathroom sink that made an awful racket after use, a bathtub drain plug that had to be pried up with a nail file after use (the maintenance supervisor fixed that problem quite creatively, but the loud sink could not be fixed), a foul smell in the hallway that was present the entire week we were there, a bed that sagged in the middle and just a kind of overall downhill trend we've noticed since first staying there in 2009.

I hope the company devotes some attention to this property in the near future.",3,2012,05,28
123,Fantastic stay,"Stayed at this hotel for three nights, all I ca say is a fantastic hotel. the rooms were modern, clean and rooms and corridors very quiet with a nice cam lighting.

The hotel staff were very fast in dealing with your requests check-in and check-out was easy. room service again was around 20mins from time you ordered to the tme it got to your room.

I could not really find anything wrong with this hotel. I did have a drink and sandwich at the ounce bar, which again service was what you expect from such an hotel. I can't give a review of the restaurant as I never actually ate in there.

Would recommend this hotel no problems.",5,2012,05,27
123,"Amazing service, small rooms","Loved this hotel, especially for its decor, location and service.

Decor is modern and very trendy, wonderful to come back to after a long day of shopping. Sitting in the hotel's stunning lobby as I write this. 

Location was amazing - 300m from the bond Street tube station and Oxford street so was perfect for shopping and tourist activities.

Service is exceptional, warm towels on check in and very helpful concierge team. I must make special mention of Rahim who helped us so much with everything from luggage to tickets.

Rooms were small but we took the entry level room, maybe will upgrade on my next visit to this trendy and very special hotel.",4,2012,05,26
123,The ultimate city hotel,"Sic, cool, cozy, stylish and well served at the same time. If you don't mind smaller rooms and long winding (albeit stylish) corridors, but you like central location, friendly staff, a great bar and a perfect lounge for informal business meetings then go for it. This hotel offers the best of original design, optimal service, friendly staff and great location. The proof of how smaller brands can do great.",5,2012,05,23
123,Would definitely come back and stay again,"My husband booked hotel for my 50th birthday and I wasn't disappointed. The staff at reception on arrival were very friendly and had noted it was my birthday from when my husband had called. Bubbly and a lovely cake were awaiting in our room care of the hotel and both delicious! The deluxe room was spacious, very comfortable and location of hotel perfect for all central London attractions. All the staff had a genuine keenness and enthusiasm to look after us including little touches like giving us a bottle of water for venturing out each day. The artwork displayed around the hotel was varied and an interesting and welcome difference to the normal boring hotel decor at comparative 4star hotels. A great experience and great value for money.",4,2012,05,21
123,"lovely, friendly and relaxing","In haste now but I recommend this hotel.  Its a great location, facilities are great, it was fantastically clean and very naturally friendly.  I will stay again when Im in london.",5,2012,05,15
123,What a great hotel,"I stayed at The Marylebone last weekend(12th May) and had a superb experience. The levels of customer service are truly 5***** and tjis is primarily driven by hotel staff who really care about the customer.
The location is close to all the great London landmarks. I stayed in a suite which had lovely contemporary decor and it was big enough to accomodate my two kids(4 & 6yrs) as well. I will definitely be back !!",5,2012,05,14
123,Wonderful staff!,"As I started to pull my suitcase out of a taxi, the doorman of The Marylebone Hotel jogged up - from the hotel's entrance several car lengths from where the taxi had stopped - welcomed me to the hotel and told me he would handle my suitcase.  That's probably one of the best welcomes I've experienced in all my recent travels.  At reception, I got an equally warm welcome, a lovely explanation of the amenities of the hotel and a surprise room category upgrade.  And once in my room, the receptionist called to check that I was happy with my room or if I had any questions.  

The room itself was a nice size and very comfortable.  The bathroom was a bit small, but nicely appointed.  I appreciated having reasonably sized toiletries provided in the shower rather than the usual teeny tiny bottles of shampoo and shower gel that most hotels provide.  

I didn't have any view to speak of, but I didn't mind that the room was located at the back side of the hotel, as I imagine there might otherwise have been some street noise coming from Welbeck Street.  And like most have mentioned, the central location makes this a great spot from which to explore London or to get to Paddington Station if you need easy access to the Heathrow Express train (as I did).  

I would stay again!",5,2012,05,09
123,Brilliant location,"We chose this hotel for its location and were not disapointed, this hotel is a stones throw from Oxford Street and Bond Street.
We stayed in a standard room and it was great, they arent massive, but definitely provide everything you need for a one night stay. The bed is super comfortable and the decor is modern and simple. Nice touch that our room had bathrobes and slippers, i didnt expect this in a standard room.
We had room only as i knew there were lots of cafe's nearby for brunch.
The staff in the hotel were all very friendly and attentive and offered to help us with theatre and restaurants if we required.
I would stay here again, very nice. : )",4,2012,05,07
123,Wonderful Service; Lovely Location,"The Marylebone Hotel is a medium-sized property on Welbeck Street in Marylebone (nice and quiet), just a block from Marylebone High Street and a short walk from Oxford Street (south) or the Marylebone Road/Euston Road to the north.  So the location is very good for getting around London as well as taking in the sights, shopping and restaurants in  Marylebone and Mayfair.  

The lobby and public areas are attractive.  The front-of-hotel sitting areas are comfy and quiet.  The staff were helpful and solicitous to a fault - always ready to answer a question or help out in some way.  (I had to wait for my room to be ready due to a slightly early arrival - everyone made me feel at home while I waited.)

My room was well appointed with nice linens and a modern bathroom.  Some may find the rooms/bathrooms small, but this is pretty typical in the UK and Europe.  Wifi was free/included in the room rate - a nice touch.  The health club attached to the hotel is modern and full-featured - and also included in the room rate.

I did not use the hotel restaurant this trip save for one breakfast (which was fine) but it is a beautiful facility.

My only issue would be that at this price point (it is a fairly expensive hotel) some details of housekeeping could be a bit more consistent.  Nothing major.

I will be returning to the Marylebone quite soon.  For business travelers and tourists you will find The Marylebone a terrific homebase in London",4,2012,05,05
123,A nice hotel to go (back),"The nice hotel staff was very friendly (check in, when leaving & entering the hotel,...) and helpful with luggage, umbrella, taxi,... We got a nice present too!

Marylebone is such a nice place to be and very close to Oxford, ideal for dropping those shopping bags!

The room was just perfect: London has small rooms but this one was quite good. Bathroom & bed were excellent. Nice evening chocolates & water,... All those things together made it a wonderful stay!!

A lot of nice breakfast places in the neighborhood (Patisserie Valerie, Paul, Starbucks,...).
Every time we go back to our favorite place: St-Christopher's Place! We just love the atmosphere, restaurants,...",5,2012,05,03
123,Central understated yet stylish,"Excellent service, well located for shopping ,good resteraunts and tourist activities.

Room size is a touch tight , as are most in London but we were thankfully upgraded to a loft apartment 25m which was workable especially when you and cath go on a massive 2 day shopping spree.

A relaxed bar to have a nightcap in before heading to bed. Ample size tvs in room with iPod docking station. The standard room we used to freshen up on our arrival only had a shower in the bathroom which was is a contradiction of sorts and may be a bit of a let down after having walked London and wanting to soak in the tub to sooth the feet and back.

Other negative is that the cupboard and shelf space was a touch limited but in saying that we we in a 3 week holiday so had more lugggage than the average traveller.

Generally an excellent stay, great service and lovely environs as a base for your trip.",4,2012,05,01
123,Not nearly as special as we were hoping it would be,"We stayed here this weekend and had booked a superior queen room on the website after reading the reviews on here and looking on the site. When we checked in, we found to our disappointment that the room(549) was tiny, the bed looked like it had been squeezed into the corner and the room and corridor stank of stale cigarette smoke.

To the hotel's credit when we complained, we were moved to a room which was much more deserving of the title ""superior"". I can't remember the name of the lady behind reception that resolved the problem for us but she was really nice and couldn't have been more helpful.

We decided to eat in the bar on Saturday night and were again disappointed, the staff really couldn't have been bothered with our presence. The really annoying thing was that service charge was added onto the card machine before I had a chance to change it.

Overall, we'll be thinking twice before booking at a Doyle collection hotel again.",3,2012,04,30
123,Perfect stay,"I really cannot praise this hotel highly enough.

We had a wedding nearby on saturday afternoon so just needed to stay nearby for one night, and this hotel was absolutely wonderful. I dropped my luggage off on the thursday night to be stored until I checked in on friday night, and from that moment every one of their staff could not do enough for us. gunther especially was very helpful, but so were all his colleagues behind the reception desk, and the concierge and porters. We have specific religious requirements and they all could not do enough to help us.

The room itself is modern, clean and all we really needed. The breakfast was very well presented, and the hotel gives off an ambiance of relaxation and tranquility. 
ee would definitely stay here again, and high;y recommend it.",5,2012,04,30
123,My London hotel of choice,"I stay at The Marylebone around 40 nights a year and it's my London hotel of choice. The location is excellent near to Oxford Street, Bond Street and Marylebone High Street. The reception area and lounge is lovely particularly in the evening. Whilst the standard rooms are small, the superior and deluxe rooms and particularly the junior suites are spacious and comfortable. But what makes this hotel special are the staff - the reception and room service staff are always prepared to go the extra mile. Thoroughly recommended",5,2012,04,29
123,Great Location,"Less than 5 minutes walking to oxford st., The Marylebone Hotel is in a great location! It's on a quite street, which is great after shopping, to get a some quiet time.",4,2012,04,28
123,Marylebone Hotel-- OK,"This boutique hotel is okay.  Rooms are on the small side (as they tend to be in London) overall.  The bathroom is especially tiny.  As an old hotel, it may be starting to show it's age a little-- still it is kept fairly clean.  Location is pretty good.  Service is adequate.  Overall, it's okay.",3,2012,04,24
123,Super stay,"I stayed overnight the Marylebone and am pleased to report another excellent stay. There are a number of hotels in this price range but this one is great for location to bond street tube station, shops, theatre and the hotel itself is great service. Breakfast staff are fist class team.",5,2012,04,23
123,Perfect in Every Way,"1st time in London where we celebrated our 40th wedding anniversary. Spent a number of months in Australia looking at which hotel to stay at and I am more than happy that Hotel Maryleybone was selected.

Upon arriving we were met by Raphael the concierge who somehow knew our names without being told. We were upgraded to a Deluxe room and on entering the room there was a welcome card for our anniversary, chocolates and a bottle of wine. The room had everything that was ever needed and 5 star quality.

Location was perfect as we were only 2 minutes walk from Oxford Street much to the delight of my wife. It also was central to everything that we wanted to visit during our 3 day stay. 

We ate in many places but the hotel restaurant where we had dinner on our last night was excellent and the service provided was also first class.

Hope to go back in 2013 and the Maryleybone will be the immediate hotel of choice.",5,2012,04,23
123,Great Location,"Stayed at The Marylebone Hotel weekend of 20-22nd April 2012.  This hotel is in a briliant location very close to Oxford Street near to John Lewis.  The hotel itself is tastefully decorated and the staff were helpful and friendly.  The superior double room was a comfortable size, clean and nicely decorated with a really nice bathroom.  A nice touch were the robes and slippers and nice smellies.  the room also had tea making facilities and a lovely fresh coffee machine (although I needed someone to come and give me instructions on how to use it).  The staff were helpful and tentative.  All in all a great hotel to stop at which I will definately use again.",4,2012,04,23
123,A Hotel That Really Cares!,"I stayed in the Marylebone on a recent business trip to London. on average I stay in London 3 to 4 times a month and this is one of the best hotels I've had the pleasure of staying in at this price range. the staff were extremely helpful, attentive and charming. I did get a room upgrade that I didn't request  and the room was comfortable, quiet and immaculately clean. Its a pleasure to stay away in a hotel as good as this. Excellent and this will be my hotel of choice from now on!",5,2012,04,21
123,Wonderful hotel!!,"Came here for a 2 night stay at the beginning of April. It was just amazing! The hotel staff from the word go we're ace and extremely helpful, it made the whole experience very worth while. The room was wonderful- even came and turned the sheets back at night and left some water and chocolate. Perfect location, great little boutique shops and pubs on the doorstep. Oxford street was a 5minute walk. Will be visiting again!",5,2012,04,21
123,Excellent hotel!,"My husband and I stayed at this hotel during 11/4/12-16/4/12. We were given a top floor (7th) room which we enjoyed very much. It was very quiet, spacious and nicely decorated (chic). The hotel offers many luxurious areas to relax, have a drink or eat. The location was superb, a quiet residential street about 5-10 minute walk to Oxford street (New Bond Street tube station).

All the staff was very helpful and friendly. We were greeted by Martin at the reception when checking in, he made us feel very welcomed and was willing to satisfy any request we had. We were also offered great support by Rahim (Concierge group) who proved to be the highlight of our stay at the hotel as he provided us with directions, theatre bookings, information, all which made our trip unforgetable. He also arranged for our transport to Heathrow in a luxurious and non-expensive way. 

Having stayed in many hotels in London in the past, we can easily say that the Marylebone Hotel was the best, thus we will definately book there again in our next trip.",5,2012,04,20
123,Stylish hotel with great gym,"Located in my favorite part of London, very helpful, thoughtful staff. First room smelt of smoke. The got me another one an hour or two later, and sent me a bottle of wine to apologise for the inconvenience. Room is spacious and pleasant, good for working and relaxing and much bigger than is common in London. The Fitness Center with pool and steam bath is wonderful.",5,2012,04,19
123,Amazing experience,"I have recently stayed at the Marylebone Hotel and for the first time I am finding myself writing a review.

Firstly - I only have a wet floor at home - no bath and not through choice - and so when I go away a bath is a must - however, on checking into the Marylebone - my designated room did not have such a simple item - my room had been booked by a third party. I was met by happy and very helpful staff and when they found out there was not a bath in the booked room - they managed to upgrade me to a de-luxe room with a bath and shower - at no extra charge.

You know the usual thing - away on business - nowhere as good as being in your own home - well, I have to say this was getting close. Large cast iron deep bath - Hansgrohe/Grohe showers - feather soft pillows and duvets - and a bed which was so comfortable - for a change. I took room service as I was travelling on my own and do not like to sit in restaurants on my own - cuisine - excellent - a real treat.

Overall, this hotel is one of the nicest I have stayed in - in London centre - and I have had to stay in many over the years - clean, comfortable and jeans accepted without the ""look"".",5,2012,04,19
123,My choice for business and pleasure in London,"This is a great hotel in a wonderful area of London.
You have Marylebone high Street on your doorstep as well as the Bond Streets. 
The rooms themselves can be a little on the small side if you book a single but everything works and it is quiet and central.
the Bar has great life after dark.
The staff are great to deal with and very friendly, a rare thing in London hotels these days.
The steaming hot face cloth upon arrival and the bottle of water as you check out are great touches.",5,2012,04,17
123,Just okay,"Be aware that ""superior"" rooms are not superior to anything;  they are the standard and are very small.  That is very misleading. I also thought the breakfast (not included in my rate) was too expensive to order and I was thus very disappointed that I didn't have a coffee machine.  There was a lot of noise that woke me in the morning.  Positive things were the fantastic gym (hotel can't really take credit for that), good location, and many surrounding restaurants.  I had little interaction with the staff even though I stayed 8 days.",3,2012,04,16
123,4 days to rest in the heart of london,"brilliant location, wonderful staff, always at your disposal. very interesting decoration, really inspirational. we, couple mid-forties, scholar and actor, could rest and work within the lobbies, enjoyed every moment. even if we asked for a smoker's room we expected a little more cleaning. but, all in all it was a beautiful experience. we'll come back for sure next time.",4,2012,04,15
123,"Fabulous! Impressed indeed. Great Hotel. Fabulous, friendly staff a big massive tick!","Stayed for a romantic birthday night.  Hotel kindly upgraded us and even left a birthday card, cake and champagne.  Such a truly special gesture.  Loved the location of the hotel. Staff were super friendly and helpful. Stylishly appointed.  Fabulous bar. Would recommend to everyone. A well priced indulgence. One of the best hotel experiences I have ever had xoxo ",5,2012,04,13
123,"Great Hotel, Great location.","The Marylebone hotel is located ideally for business people and for vacationers who would love to shop. It is close to Oxford street and the bylanes around Welbeck street have a some cute botique shops which is truly English. Also, it has quiet a spread of restaurants around the area. I do recommend the one opposite to the hotels bar enternace -  'Verru' - lovely food for a small cute place. They do great lunch deals and it is an ideal place to meet people over as well - both official and personal. 

I must give a special appreciation to the hotel's concierge - especially 'Rafealle', who goes out of his way to help all the guests and sorts out their problem. 

Rooms are small, but appropriately done up for a cosy stay. Well appointed as well. 

The restaurant and bar are pretty decent, but one would get bored of their menu's if the stay is long enough.",5,2012,04,10
123,"Fantastic location, beautiful hotel","Hotel is really great with excellent stuff. There is free wi-fi and computer with printer where we were printing boarding pass. Breakfast is good, only thing I didn't like was that nothing warm wasn't in continental breakfast, we have to upgrade it to english one. This we payed 5£. In english breakfast are different type of eggs and american pancakes. I think that in this kind of hotel something warm should be for the mornings. Rooms are small even at the upper floors but nice, tidy. Bathroom is too small, and there is not toillet brush in it. When you need it, it's very uncomfortable to leave it dirty. 
Hotel is 5min walk to Oxford street so we walked through whole city by foot. Definitely to recomend!",4,2012,04,09
123,An excellent choice,"Simply put, the best hotel I've ever stayed at. Great location, even better staff. The continental breakfast was good. I definitely recommend this hotel.",5,2012,04,05
123,Excellent hotel!,"I loved the hotel! We have been to multiple trips to London and every time we were booking a different hotel hoping we will find the one we like. And finally we did. The hotel is in great location, very clean and cosy. Stuff is so helpful and kind that it even makes you feel uncomfortable.The Spa is lovely too. The pool is big and clean and I like it is open till late.
The only issue I found is that the standard room was small. Knowing it is London I expected the size to be less than average so not a big surprise there. Though I will try next time the deluxe or the suite simply for the extra space and Nespresso machine.

Will definitely return I highly recommend it.",5,2012,04,04
123,not sure?,"I have stayed in standard room which is really tiny not to say cramped, about 3,5m by 3m. The bathroom also is very tiny and cramped with little ventilation.  Also my colleagues complained about the same issue. The shower needs thorough cleaning to remove mold of the joints. I really can not say is was comfortable. As my wife joined me for the weekend I called reservation for extended stay. As a standard room is totally inappropriate for 2, I was offered a superior room.  I booked the extended stay calling the reservation dept. A friendly lady gave me a quote of 155£ for per night. They send me a confirmation quoting 155£ for 2 nights and 245£ for the Sunday night. That was outrages as it was NOT mentioned over the phone. An increase of 90£ looks to me more a rip-off. The air-co was broken and the reception staff reacted immediately and appropriately to give us another room. I As I stay in many hotels around the world, I can hardly agree with the word superior. Again the bathroom is claustrophobic small. Not possible to be with 2 people at the same time. Also here, very little ventilation and also mold in shower and on the joints. In the bathroom you have a 60cm by 60cm ""working space"". Another disturbing factor was cigaret  smoke coming from other rooms next door - and this were non-smoking rooms? Also the amenities in the bathroom were not tampered-proof or sealed. It was clear that the body lotion and shower gel were already used by previous guests due to the limited content . 
The staff was professional and well trained-friendly and helpful.  But based on the experience and especially the 90£ rip-off, I will choose another hotel next time and have asked my company not to use the Marylebone anymore.",3,2012,04,03
123,Excellent!!,"I have stayed in many hotels on business, both in and outside of London. It is rare to see a team of people who genuinely enjoy their jobs and genuinely care about guests' experience during their stay. I could find nothing negative to say about anyone who worked there - in my experience they went over and above their duties to make the stay an extremely pleasant one. Thank you to all the lovely people at the hotel who made it feel like a proper holiday. I came away feeling pampered and felt like my money was well spent. I would definitely stay here again and have already been raving about the hotel to friends and family.",5,2012,03,26
123,Would definately return,"Chose this hotel for a last minute surprise visit for 3 nights in London for my birthday. My daughter phoned ahead to request a room upgrade which they said they would do.  Due to flight delay we arrived an hour after check in and was told our superior double room wasn't ready, but after searching their system and intervention by the asst. manageress we were allocated one of the ""best"" room.  Was a tiny bit disappointed in the room, it was rather plain, in comparison to the reception/lounge/seating areas in the rest of the hotel.  The room was very clean, with a comfy bed, two chairs and a desk with chair.  More than adequate for us. Bathroom was quite small, but plenty soft fluffy towels and lots of hot water.
Was delighted on our return from seeing ""Wicked"" later that evening to find a bottle of wine, fruit bowl, a flask of hot raspberry tea and two small chocolate cakes, compliments of the hotel for my birthday.  There were also 2 bottles of water left for us each day.
The hotel is ideally located for shopping, restaurants bars etc.  Marylebone High Street is a street away, Oxford Street 5 mins walk and not much further to Bond Street Tube Station.
Unfortunately my daughter took ill on our last day.  The Manager, Nadia was extremely understanding and helpful, allowing us to stay on in our room beyond the noon check out time, until late evening at no extra charge, before we had to leave for our flight back to Edinburgh.  We did not get the opportunity to go to the pool/spa area, there is just to much to see and do.  The only meal we ate at the hotel was one breakfast time which was rather pricey at £23 each, but there was a vast selection of hot and cold food to choose from.  I would definately return to this hotel for its location alone.",4,2012,03,21
123,"Class, Style, Elegance and Friendliness...","Absolutely loved this hotel, beautiful decor, a very tasty breakfast, offering everything on the menu from freshly made smoothies, figs and watermelon to pancakes, sausages and eggs with soliders!  From the moment you walk into it, you feel the atmosphere of cosmopolitan London.  (The aroma of Neom candles burning in the backround was so divine, that I could not resist purchasing one to bring home!) The staff are fabulous, are ever so helpful without being too imposing as they genuinely want to help you.  You can also tell that they are well trained and it shows that they all love working within the Marylebone, they enjoy their roles, they are empowered to work their best efforts within this hotel. The hotels location is deal, just a 10 minute strole from Oxford St, the nearest Tube Station being Bond St.  It is also located with a beautiful, stylish village called Marylebone which has very nice restaurants situated throughout.  Am definitely returning to this hotel on my next visit to London - couldn't resist it!

123,DEFINITELY MY CHOICE AGAIN!,"I stayed for 5 nights and I'm glad I chose that hotel! The location is perfect! You can walk to all the major streets in London for shopping, food and drinks. You have access to all transportation (metro, bus, taxi etc). The Marylebone High street is a wonderful street to walk providing everything you may need. The hotel is clean, quiet, comfortable rooms and with free access to wi-fi which was very useful to me (and everyone I beleive). The staff was very polite and helpful and the concierge responded perfectly to everything we wanted. Breakfast was pretty good and the smile of the staff there was the best way to start your day. I also enjoyed the bar - it is located in a different level of the hotel and because it has a street view away from the rest of the hotel, it gives you the impression that you are in a bar apart from the hotel (practically it makes want to stay in the hotel longer). 
If I had to say something negative about my experience at the Marylebone that would be : 1) a smell of fryed food (on my floor at least - 4th) which was coming from the kitchen of the hotel and was there all day long and 2) I would deeply appreciate a little better cleaning of the toilet in my room (of course it was acceptable and I was ok in general).
In conclusion, I will definitely suggest this hotel to anyone and the next time that I will visit London I will stay there again!
Thank you Marylebone for making my vacations even better!
Food tip : if you want to eat fish&chips, one of the best places is just across the bar of the hotel (sorry, i can't remember the name).",5,2012,03,09
123,Great Hotel and Surprisingly Good Value,"Was booked here by client. so had no expectations. About 10 mins from Paddington Heathrow Express by taxi. Check in was efficient and friendly. All public areas seemed to be soaked in aromatherapy, so watch out for your senses.

Room was good (not large but well planned). Bathrooms were very modern but a trite small (what we call a 1/2 tub). Staff were all foreigners but very helpful. Nice little touch was a GBP 5 upgrade from standard to full English breakfast.",4,2012,03,05
123,"Comfortable sleep, modern hotel design and amazing spa","A pearl in the heart of Marylebone, London, excellent location and proximity to Oxford and Regent streets. Even the standard rooms are cozy and very decent size, comfortable beds, good size bathrooms and fantastic room service. The hotel now has a luxurious, modern spa in the basement, including a good swimming size pool, hammam and sauna. The lobby is a very comfortable design lounge including a nice fireplace. On the lobby floor, the TV room is as cozy as a home living room and the large screen is perfect for watching Sunday sports events. I have now gone back several times, never disappointed. Totally recommend the stay!",5,2012,03,05
123,F A B U L O U S,"Where do we begin. Well let us start with the efficiency of the booking.  Upon our arrival we were welcomed by the front of house staff who made us feel as if we were personally known to them.  We were told that we had an upgraded room and advised if it's location.  The room was superb, spacious and well appointed.  If one could find fault (and this is personal), it would be the opaque glass door to the bathroom which if one had to  get up in the night could possibly disturb the partner as the light was very bright and shone through.  Also the safe was almost at floor level which made it difficult to access and see inside.   However, the sumptuous comfort of the bed made up for any minor inconvenience.   I used the spa and pool and the staff could not have been more pleasant and helpful.  The dining room was delightful and the food superb.   If one had to pick a member of staff, it would be an extremely difficult task;however Rahim the Senior Concierge was outstanding.  He was friendly, full of advice, courteous beyond his remit and helpful and all times.  One should also mention the  young waiter at breakfast, Mark from Connemara in Ireland.  He made our day begin on a high, with his smile and cheery attitude.
Would we recommend this hotel,? -  most definitely.  Would we return? - .  Absolutely.  If you want an exceptional experience then the Marylebone is definitely for you.",5,2012,03,01
123,Great Hotel!,"Stayed here with my fiancee whilst attending a convention. Was upgraded to this hotel when we were told that a pipe had burst at the hotel we had originally booked. Gotta say, The Marylebone is perfect. The room was great, the shower, the service, all top notch. No complaints!!",5,2012,02,29
123,Outstanding help from the concierge,"We are due to fly to London in a weeks time from new Zealand. I rang and asked for help to book shows that I was having difficulty in booking online. Rahim, the concierge has provided outstanding help with booking the tickets we require and has telephoned each night this week to update me on how the progress for tickets was going. He has secured excellent tickets at very good prices and will make our stay in London memorable. This is the second time we have stayed at the Marylebone hotel and I would highly recommend it as the staff are excellent.",5,2012,02,29
123,Very nice hotel,My wife and I stayed for 2 nights and we found the whole experience fantastic. Because our room was not yet ready when we checked in we were offered a coffee to wait for a few minutes. The room was quite small but very comfortable and nicely decorated. The bathroom is small but very practical. The hotel was very quiet and we could not hear any noise from other rooms or from the street. We had dinner at the hotel restaurant which was an enjoyable experience. The bar is very nice too and the waiters very friendly. The quality of food and drinks served for breakfast was very high. We experienced the swimming pool after a day of shopping and needless to say we enjoyed it. We found the staff whatever their job in the hotel very friendly and helpful. Next time we come to London we will definitely stay at the Marylebone Hotel.,5,2012,02,29
123,"Good Location, very helpful staff, standard rooms are very standard!","enjoyed a brief stay, the reception and waiters were very accomodating. the seelp quality was very good; great beds. a constant stream of taxis at the door......if you can afford a superior room go for it you wont regret it if you are planning an attack on Oxford street.",4,2012,02,27
123,Great bar and room,Room was very clean ..not too spacious but we are talking about London here!cocktail bar was very nice and had good bar food ..great hotel!,5,2012,02,26
123,Nice Hotel -shady concierge/misleading ads on web,"After looking up this hotel on the web, but not booking, every time we we were then on the web, we were ""pushed"" ads for The Marlybone Hotel all offering the discounted rate of 130 pounds.  However this rate was never available when I tried to book a room on line.  I tried several times. 

I did end up booking a room by walking into the hotel, but never at the lower rate.  The first room I was offered was small and had a poor view. When I said I wasn't going to stay there for that price, I was offered a better view but I was charged an additional 60 pounds, even tho it was the same class of room.  (after being told none were available). 

In addition, I didn't have my computer in London and needed one extra ticket to a concert the following night so I asked for help.  After about 10 hours and two different concierge,  I was told that  ""there aren't any on the web I'll have to go thru my friend"".  I was then told ""great news"" my friend  found a ticket for 100 pounds.  Curious,  I then went into the business center of the hotel which had computers (it didn't occur to me until then to see if there was a business center), looked up the site I had originally told them to book thru, found a ticket for 40 pounds - which is what I told them I thought it would be.    

I had already tipped the concierge 10 pounds....so a 70 pound service charge for one ticket??",3,2012,02,26
123,Very Pleasant,"I have stayed at this hotel before and I can recommend it to anyone.  The service is very good, the hotel is in a great location for central London.  The bar is relaxing and they have a good choice.  The rooms are perfectly adequate.",5,2012,02,24
123,Marylebone upgraded and now an excellent choice,"Marylebone has been renovated both in the lobby and the rooms with the move to
Doyle Collectioin from being ""Jurys Ford"" -the lobby is brighter, brighter and more welcoming from decor to comfortable seating. The rooms are clean and efficient. The rooms and bath are not large but twe enjoyed the cleanliness and the comfortable bed. Internet and TV worked fine. The rooms are not spacy and the halls on the floors are still a little dreary but being worked on, apparently. The pool was very nice with good hours.The front desk and restaruant staff are helpful and attentive. We found the breakfast very satisfying, nice fruits, granola- and looks like good meats, cheese and bread.
One meal also very tasty.
The Concierge was very very knowledgable and helpful.  The location is nice, good food, shopping and tube/bus access nearby. I would recommend the Marylebone as a good, comfortable and well located choice for a London stay. I will pick it again.",5,2012,02,23
123,Disappointing room this time,"Stayed here in 2010 and had a fabulous stay in a studio suite, Stayed here last Thursday and booked a superior room. Whilst this was £35 cheaper than the suite and also just after Valentines day, the two rooms didn't compare.
The first room didn't have a bath so we moved to another that did, these superior rooms are disappointingly small and the bathrooms are tiny!
I don't think we could have stayed here any longer than 1 night, due to the space.
On a more positive note, we had dinner in the Restaurant that was lovely and breakfast in bed that was also fabulous and you cannot fault the location and service of this hotel",3,2012,02,20
123,Nice Hotel in Central London,We stayed on a number of occasions last year as i was having medical treatment nearby. We found the hotel to be first class. The rooms were all of a good size with a nice size bathrooms. The location is very good for the Marylebone and Oxford Street areas. The breakfast choice was very good with a large choice of hot and cold foods available. We also tried the restaurant on a couple of occasions which again was very good and reasonably priced for Central London. There public areas are very welcoming and large and the staff were all first class. The only slight problem we found was the corridors to the rooms were very dark. I would have no hesitation in staying here again.,5,2012,02,20
123,"Great Stay, Excellent Staff - Will definitely be back","I booked this hotel back in November for me and my girlfreind. I contacted Mark Heyburn at the hotel directly to assist with the booking (after reading about how helpful he was to other guests on tripadvisor). As soon as we arrived at the hotel, everything seemed to have been catered to our needs. We were greeted by name at check out, brought a drink and a hot towel - a small touch, but was really appreciated from a city hotel, amongst the hustle and bustle.

Our room was upgraded, and was really very nice. There was a fruit basket with fresh fruit. We went out but upon arrival that night found a little cake and cocoa in a flash which was again a very thoughtful touch. Breakfast the next morning was also fantastic, with smooth service.

The location is one of the additional selling points for this hotel. Literally a few minutes walk from Oxford street, its perfect for shopping, or heading to the theatre (as we did). Will defintiely be back.",5,2012,02,19
123,Very good hotel in outstanding location,"I spent two nights at The Marylebone:
- Great location in a small village-like area of London just next to Oxford Street, but much classier, calmer and nicer! I strongly recommend giving the small pastry stores, cafes and restaurants on Marylebone High (behind the hotel) a try before venturing out to Oxford for food. I am happy to have listened to the bell-boy who also acts as pre-receptionist of some sort... 
- services and hotel: I stayed on the first floor and some of my friends stayed on the 7th: while I was happy with my room despite the small bathroom, you may pay more and stay at the higher floors that have bigger rooms and some have a very nice view of the London roof-tops. Wifi is free and works great, the rooms are very clean and comfortable, with nice furniture. Room service was very good and there is not much really I can say about the rooms because I was happy; actually may be one small detail, which most people may not care about: the lack of shoe-shining sponges- tiny detail. 
 Gym and pool area: Do not leave your work out clothes and swimming suit behind! I was really impressed with the sports facilities as I had expected the usual tiny corner of big city hotel gym space- there is also a steam room and a sauna. Highly recommended!
- Professional staff: Although I spent very little time at the hotel, I can attest to a very professional staff- upon arrival the bell-boy discreetly asked my name so he can already head to the receptionist and have them prepare the key- and that was fabulous! 
I recommend this hotel!",4,2012,02,13
123,"Superb, warm welcome, comfortable room","Stayed here for just one night last Saturday 4th Feb with my partner and we were immediately impressed from the first impression from the friendly, efficient conciege who directed us to an equally friendly and helpful check in girl at the front desk. The service from the first impression was efficient and friendly without being over bearing. The superior room was a good size for central London and very well appointed in keeping with the sumptious, cool and comtemporary feel of the whole hotel. It's not cheap but it's not expensive either for the location and standard of room and service. Good value overall.
Sunday morning and we were late for check out at 11 am but reception were very helpful and gave us an extension which meant we could use the lovely pool. Had trouble finding it in the basement gym complex but a girl in the bar couldn't have been more helpful in showing us the lift and even the guy in the lower level who was sweeping the floor showed us to our respective changing rooms! That's the mark of a great Hotel.. good service from the front desk to the cleaner. Can't recommend this hotel highly enough.",5,2012,02,06
123,Good but not great,"I just spent 5 nights at The Maryleborne Hotel with my daughter.  I had to move to a superior room which was a little roomier and very comfortable.  Overall it was good but there were some little annoyances that were not really responded to by the staff. 

These were:
On arrival I had to struggle with all my luggage to enter the hotel.  There was nobody to open tj
He door and offer help.  

The phone in our room never worked properly.  I tried ordering room service several times and ended up having to go down to reception on more than one occasion to place the order.   There was never an explaination or an apology.  

On the positive side:
Most of the staff were very friendly and helpful.
The breakfast is very good.  
The location is perfect.  
The rooms are clean and comfortable, although very small 
Room service food is good",4,2012,02,04
123,Excellent friendly customer service,"My wife and I spent two nights in the hotel recently. I have to say the quality of the customer service from all of the staff we encountered was top class, friendly, professional, efficient and  interested in the needs of the client. We had one particular incident where the concierge went the extra mile to assist us. A lovely relaxing hotel in a lovely central location near St christophers place. I will certainly return. 
Owen,
Dublin. Ireland",4,2012,02,04
123,Very pleasant stay,"Very nice hotel and within walking distance to Oxford and Regent Streets, great restaurants, and the jump on/jump off tourist attractions bus stops.  CHECK IN: staff were pleasant, helpful  and check in was a breeze.  ROOMS:  Very nice clean updated room with lots of light, good outlets at bedsides, and free internet connection. Bathrooms were modern and plenty of counter space for toiletries.  WORKOUT FACILITIES:  Very expansive, lots of equipment and staff available to help in any way needed. Pool was warm and always empty.  FOOD:  We had breakfast and lunch in the hotel restaurant, which was quite expensive with good food but nothing to write home about.  CONCIERGE:  They were wonderful!!  They were able to help us find a restaurant that we had passed along the way and wanted to return to with hints that made it more like a charades game.  Always a friendly hello and ""can we help"" as we passed thru the lobby. BUSINESS CENTER:  I had problems with my internet connection and Diane stayed with me as I chatted with the IT dept on the phone to make sure that it was resolved.  Very helpful!  CHECK OUT:  Again, a breeze as our bill was ready at 6 am, a taxi was waiting and an offer of a cup of coffee for the road.",5,2012,02,03
123,Great hotel - shame about the room,"Visited the hotel for the third time for a work event. Once again staff, food, ambience and leisure facilities were excellent however I now understand some of the complaints that have been made about the rooms. Of the three visits this (Rm 230) was by far the smallest and inevitably (knowing what other rooms are available) disappointing. The bathroom was absolutely tiny and I had to squeeze alongside the toilet in order to shut the door. Probably fine for 1 night, but after 4 nights it began to irritate! Yes I know it is central London but it is frustrating when hotels try to increase capacity at the expense of basic space. It's a cliche to say that there are bigger rooms in a Premier Inn, but it is also true!",3,2012,02,03
123,Great design cosy London hotel,"Marylebone hotel is well located close to Oxford street, great for shopping.

Modern design, lot of of contemporary arts. Attentive staff, warm service.

Great public areas, many intimate space, fireplace.

Deluxe rooms are spacious, well equiped, very confortable beds.

Free wifi.

Good point, the hotel give miles on many airline loyalty programmes.",5,2012,02,02
123,Pleasant Friendly Hotel,"Stayed at the Marylebone Hotel Welbeck st  Lonon for a weekend with my Husband on Jan 27th 2012. Hotel was lovely i must say. The location was perfect - a few minutes walk from Oxford Street. Staff were extremely friendly and helpful. Breakfast was excelllent.too. The only criticisms I would have is that our room was quite small even though we had booked a superior room. There was only enough room for a double bed, wardrobe space was limited and the bathroom was best described as compact. Alcohol in the bar was also a bit expensive. Would I stay there again - Yes definitely.",4,2012,02,02
123,Excellent hotel,"Such a nice hotel, staff were amazing, it's the little touchs that count. The pool and gym were very well run. We didn't get a chance to eat at the restaurant but it looked very nice. I will be back",5,2012,01,31
123,Super boutique hotel in central London,"Booked the Marylebone because of it's location and good reviews. On arrival at the hotel we were checked in straight away, reception staff extremely friendly. Lobby of the hotel is lovely, lots of nice couches and corners to sit in and watch the world go by.  We were upgraded to a suite, the room was fantastic, lovely high ceilings, lots of natural daylight, massive comfy bed. Great shower and bath in the bathroow. Buffet continental breakfast was great, loads of choice or could upgrade to a full English for £4 extra but the continental choice was sufficient.  Location wise this hotel is perfect, less than 10 min walk to Oxford Street and Bond St Station. Lovely bar in the hotel and also a number of nice places to eat / drink within easy access of the hotel. The concierge in the hotel recommeded the French steak restaurant directly behind the hotel which was fantastic, if you are staying in the hotel I would definately recommend a trip here.  There is also a lovely leisure centre and spa in the hotel which unfortunately we didn't get to use.",5,2012,01,30
123,"Chic, welcoming, great location, a super boutique hotel in a central location","we booked the Marylebone because of it's location, 5 minutes stroll through trendy St Christophers Place to Oxford St., location couldn't have been better. The hotel is really tasteful and chic, nice art, lovely spotless room.  Immediately the staff made us feel at home, very friendly, smiling, attentive. The hotel is on Marylebone High St, with loads of restaurants and trendy boutiques. the hotel bar is fantastic, great for cocktails and people watching.

From our reservation and an initial request, we had immediate and very helpful service. loved this hotel, will definitely be back and recommend highly.",5,2012,01,25
123,perfect luxury hotel in central London,"I recently stayed at the Maryelbone when travellling for business in London, and I really loved it.  Very clean, very friendly and helpful staff, and an all around nice hotel.  The location was perfect.  Most people will like the proximity to Oxford and Regent Street shopping, but I really liked being close to the Marylebone High Street, one of London's really great neighborhoods.  I highly recommend the hotel.",5,2012,01,24
123,Great Location for Shopping,"The location of the hotel was the best point, since it was only 5 mins walk to Oxford Street for shopping.  Hotel staff were professional and helpful.  I asked for a room with a tub and the request was granted right away.  They were also able to give me the room when I arrived at 11, and I was grateful for that as I needed to get into a teleconference right away.  My room was a bit small, but I guess it's to be expected for a London hotel.  It was very clean, quiet, and comfortable and was stocked with a good bundle of magazines for short diversions. The continental breakfast offered a good range of choices and service impeccable.  I wished I had time to go to the pool, as the photo looks great.  Maybe next time!",4,2012,01,22
123,Excellent,"From the time we arrived the staff looked after us really well.   Love the decor and design, and its in a great location.  Hope I can make it back at some time soon",5,2012,01,17
123,"Lovely location, well maintained, good sized rooms","i stayed here 3 nights for work. The location is lovely. You're located a pleasant two minute walk away from Marylebone high street and five minutes away from Oxford Circus. The rooms are clean, traditional, well maintained and good-sized - if anything, just a little worn around the edges. 

The service is fantastic, staff were helpful and attentive at all times. I loved the nice little touches, like having phone messages hand written and delivered to my room. The food is fantastic - I had the oven roasted chicken breast (which sounds really boring I know!) for dinner on the first night, and it was AMAZING. I'm going to remember that meal for awhile. That being said, breakfast is good but nothing spectacular. 

I'd definitely recommend this hotel.",4,2012,01,17
123,"Style, confort and service in the heart of London! At last...","I booked this hotel with booking.com and to be honest was thinking it would be just another London hotel however it turned out to be a breath of fresh air.I travel to London very often and tried many hotels but this is now my favorite, they have it all, great location 5mn walk from my favorite Marylobone High Street ,beautifully decorated, super confortable, friendly and professional staff, good food , very original breakfast and reasonable price (for London). I love the stationary mint and coper which gives a touch of sophisticated elegance. Great for business and pleasure.",5,2012,01,13
123,Feels like home,"I have been using this hotel for the last three years for lots of different events, including incentives and meetings and it has become on my favorite 4 stars property in town. The Marylebone is a lovely cosy and funky hotel in the heart of Marylebone but only 5 minutes away from Oxford Street and Bond Street tube station. The rooms are nice and clean, a bit small but very funky and comfortable. The service is great, from the doorman to the barman, always helpful and smiley. The service for groups is absolutely fantastic, as an organiser I've always felt suported by all the staff there and I always feel comfortable when organising events there as I know that everything is on the best hands!",5,2012,01,10
123,Gem of a hotel,Our second time to this hotel and we have decided to use it as our company hotel.  The service is excellent and the location perfect for getting around London.  Fabulous restaurants  within walking distance and great shopping streets too.  The staff are probably the most friendly ever encountered in a hotel.  Their bar and restaurant on site are good too.,5,2012,01,09
123,"Great location, nice rooms, good stay.","Stayed just one night here, lovely rooms and hotel although lighting in rooms is ambient so difficult for any ladies wanting to get dolled up for a night out. Friendly staff, good breakfasts though felt the lunch menu in the hotel bar was slightly disappointing. Great location. It is within walking distance of Oxford Street, Regent Street and Bond Street etc. There are also a lot of bars, restaurants and cafés in the vicinity.",4,2012,01,06
123,"Great location, great staff, very nice hotel","My wife and I just recently returned from our vacation to London where we stayed at the Marylebone Hotel.  Initially, we did not know what to expect in terms of location however we could not have asked for a better one. Its a short 5 minute walk to Oxford Street where a tube station is located.  You can easily walk most places in the city from the Marylebone.  For example, my wife and I walked from Charing Cross to the London Big Eye over to Parliament and from there to Buckingham Palace and back to our hotel.  There are a number of great, non-touristy places to eat around the hotel as well as a great bar/restuarant located within the hotel.  

Breakfast came included with our stay however it is a little pricey.  The breakfast is very good and the service is great.

Although we did not spend much time in the hotel (why would you) the rooms are nice and the staff was very helpful.",5,2012,01,04
123,Excellent hotel,"Stayed for four nights over new years weekend, hotel and staff couldn't have been better. Will be staying again ",5,2012,01,03
123,Great hotel and location,"I enjoyed my stay at The Marylebone, the hotel was loverly and the staff very friendly. I stayed in a deluxe room and couldn't fault it. The bar was nice, had dinner and a few drinks alone and didn't feel out of place. The gym was also great.  
The hotel is a short walk to Oxford Street and Bond Street station.",4,2011,12,28
123,A Happy Christmas hide-away and Birthday celebration,"2011 has been an exhausting year, plenty of ups but inevitably some downs and the thought of shopping and then cooking the Christmas dinner haunted me until a dear friend came up with the idea and it wasn't a holiday abroad. I booked into the exclusive Marylebone Hotel right in the heart of London's trendiest district W1. Five minutes from Oxford Street and in every direction gorgeous shops and restaurants. This boutique hotel ticked all the boxes, style and yet no haughtiness, very important to me as some hotels seem to grade their clients on appearances and available cash, but not The Marylebone. We were treated with the upmost respect, birthday cake bought to our room and staff sung on queue. Our Christmas dinner was in initmate environment of the 108 Bar Restaurant and breakfast was given in grand style in the large restaurant area of the hotel. We were left alone and yet felt served at our every whim and smiles were gifted to us whenever we entered the reception. I especially liked the variety of lounges, funky zebra skin arm chairs decked the television lounge, a glowing fire another with arty books at our disposal, and around every corned cosy chairs hidden for those that really don't want to be found. As a Christmas hideaway it was amazing. I will definitely return to experience the spa as it was closed over Christmas and I could have done with a really good massage to take the years stress away. Oh well next time I want a stress free city break The Marylebone Hotel will be my first choice, after all they all know my name now.",5,2011,12,27
123,a Disgrace,"Tiny and noisy rooms.
I was staying on a single room, which is literally for just one person as there is no was 2 people would fit in there. Initially I was given an horrible room which had a lot of noise from the AirCon, after complaining I was moved to a similar room. The hotel was half empty and I was staying for just 1 night, I was expecting to get something better. Overall an extremely dissapointing experience.
the breakfast is quite good, but eggs are not included.",2,2011,12,25
123,Nice visit in London,We recently stayed at the Marylebone Hotel and found it to be a nice comfortable spot to stay. The location near the Oxford St. and Bond St. tube stations was great. The room was on the small side but very well equipped and nicely appointed. The bathroom was small and the shower/tub subpar by American standards but similar to what we have come to expect in Europe.The restaurant and bar attached was relaxed and friendly. The lobby has several nice rooms for visiting with guests. The staff was very helpful and pleasant. I would definitely consider staying there again.,4,2011,12,22
123,couldn't have picked a better hotel,"our overall experience of the hotel accommodation and their staff was brilliant, perfect location for shopping on oxford street and Marylebone village behind the hotel. rooms were very spacious and clean, we left the room for dinner and came back with it been cleaned for the second time:) staff were very friendly and booked us dinner reservations, london eye, taxis etc great value for money in a very relaxed chilled environment, will be back for more!",5,2011,12,19
123,A bit disappointed...,"We booked two nights in early Dec. and while we very much enjoyed the location of the hotel (proximity to shopping, restaurants - but also the Wallace collection, etc.) we were a bit disppointed by our room, and especially by the bathroom. 
The room was small, but well appointed - however there was hardly any space for clothing. When we arrived it reeked of cigarette smoke and first I thought I got a smoking room, but later I found out that it has to do with the internal ventilation. I called the reception and they sent somebody to air-refresh very quickly. 
The bathroom was tiny and crammed, looked rather older and the bath tub was chipped and/or mouldy.  We definitely expected something much better.
Unfortunately we had no time to try the spa.",4,2011,12,19
123,Great location great hotel very helpful and friendly staff!,"Husband and i having a romantic dinner/shopping break -Very welcoming, hotel has a relaxed and intimate ambiance, excellent relaxed bar, good breakfast, everything is clean with a nice modern design. Had a superior room which had the tiniest bathroom but a double sized shower, nice granite and was modern. One person at a time in bathroom, but for central London absolutely acceptable. Didn't bother to upgrade as only using the room to get ready for dinner and to sleep in. First review I've written but thought it was a great find as superbly located for shopping and dinner and no traffic noise or any noise for that matter - will be back!!",5,2011,12,18
123,Very pleasant experience,"The accommodation in hotel The Marylebone Hotel was very nice. The staff was very personable. Mr. Rastislav Grezo showed me and my girlfriend in and help us with our baggage. He was very profesional. Mrs. Jasmin checked us in. She was very nice.
Mr. Rahim Ismail help us with selection of restaurant. It was wonderful experience to be in this hotel. I recommend this hotel!! I like to come back again! David",5,2011,12,13
123,London Shopping and tourism,"I stayed at Marylebone hotel from 2nd Dec till the 8th. I searched tripadvisor reviews for where it is but couldn't find a good direction. The best way to get there is to get down at Bond Street tube station on the central line and go behind the Debenhams department store on the opposite footpath. You will see Welbeck street walk down it in the opposite direction  of the Bond street. First you will see Holiday Inn after it on the same footpath is Marylebone hotel. The total walk from Bond street should be 10 to 15 minutes.
If you are visiting London for general tourism or shoppiing this is a great area for you to be in. As Bond Street is nereby, Oxford street,Regent street, New Bond street,Picadilly and all touristy areas are quite nearby and some are just a walk away. 
There are many small eateries and cafes around the hotel.
There is a very nice Italian restraunt on the Marylebone High street. It is called Getty's or something similar. Take a left out of the hotel and take a left again. You will come to a T intersection this is the Marylebone High street. On the left you have a nice Nicolas wine shop ( if you are into wines ) on the right there is one small Pret e Manger, on the opposite footpath is Tesco which is a good grocery shop. You walk on the right for 5 minutes and you will find the Italian restraunt I was talking about. On the way on the opposite footpath is a nice fresh fish restraunt. And there are various small shops and businesses around many of which are specilists like some shop dealing with chairs for back pain and another dealing with foot pain. There is one shop called Avertiments or something similar on the high street where you will find various knickknacks that you need around the house and don't know where to find. The Marylebone High Street has a small town feel to it in the heart of London which I found nice.
The room was tiny. Fortunately I was alone otherwise it would really be tight. Bathroom was ok size. The only point where I have ranked this hotel 3 otherwise everything else is 5. And if I could give service and behaviour of the staff more than 5, I would give them somethig like 7 - 8. I haven't seen such great service in many of the so called 5 star hotels.",4,2011,12,13
123,Impressive,"I've stayed at the Marylebone for business twice in recent months - and thoroughly enjoyed it. I don't often write reviews, but this hotel truly deserves positive comments. Great service, very good rooms, excellent breakfast, free wifi and fantastic location - what more could you wish for? One caveat: first time I stayed here I had a single room which was right next to the elevator. The room was fine, but there was some noise from the elevator. Second time I checked in I asked not to be put next to the elevator, and they immediately arranged this. 
The hotel isn't cheap, but at least you can see where the money went (and you are in central London after all). Highly recommended.",4,2011,12,12
123,Superb service!,"We spent 2 nights from Friday to Sunday. Tourist trip. Personnel outstanding and really nice. Very quite hotel. Room service excellent. Top situation for visiting the main points of interest in London. Only minor note for the bathroom: VERY small... and I mean it, but then again, we didn't spend the time at the hotel for having baths or showers. I fully recommend this establishment. We will be back...",5,2011,12,11
123,A nice hotel to stay,"In a very central and nice area of London. Close to many good restaurants and shopping area.  The hotel is very pleasant, the staff very  helpful. Asked for a quiet room when reserving and we did get it.
The decor is very pleasant and the area quiet even though very central. The only criticism i about the bathroom; clean but I needed an update- not exactly commensurate with a 5 star hotel.

Having said that I would stay there again..",4,2011,12,11
123,"Amazing Hotel, great staff and a Lovely stay","My first ever review after years off travelling and staying in many hotels and what a hotel to review for your first time - outstanding!!!

We stayed here for 2 nights over summer bank holiday ( A good review is better late than never) and I must say I was extremely impressed not only by the hotel decor but also by the staff. From the house keepers, bar staff, front desk and the door man I interacted with all and all were extremely pleasant professional and gave it the extra touch in their own unique way to make our stay comfortable. 

The location is fanatastic, a stones throw from oxford st, many good restuanrants and bars within walking distance. Its surrounded by a quite residential area so there is no concern of traffic noise keeping you awake. 

We had a slight issue with the room, I don’t need to get into detail but the detail you should be concerned with is one call to the front desk and all was rectified. 

Many people mention the size of the rooms, these rooms are average London hotel room sizes. The rooms are decorated to a high standard, they are warm and cosy. The hotel corridor walls have a unique nice touch which I thought was a great feature...I will leave it for you to discover what I am talking about. 

I’ve got another 3 night stay on 30th December, really looking forward to it and I hope soon after I will be writing another flawless review.  This time I hope to try the restaurant, sauna and pool. 

Well done Marylebone Hotel staff you should be proud of the service you offer, I’m looking forward to my stay at the end of the month.",5,2011,12,10
123,I'VE Just Booked For Jan 2012,"I was wondering if anyone can give me feedback on the  Superior Double Room that av just booked???? 

Cheers John Crozier",5,2011,12,02
123,Elegant hotel in the central shopping area,"The hotel is nice, recently remodeled. Lobby with non stop music and modern furniture. The rooms (at least mine, on the inner side of the stree) are very small, nethertheless clean, quiet with nice furniture. Wi-fi free everywhere, complimentary sauna and gym can be important features for many travellers. The restaurant is on the average (and doesn't match the level of the other services of the hotel). The hotel is located at a walking distance from Oxford and Regent streets, very convenient for shopping and sightseeing. The price is adequate to the standard of the premises.",4,2011,11,28
123,Lovely hotel,This hotel was recommended by a colleague and I am so glad I listened to her.  The location is quite good although a few short blocks from the shopping.  The staff are very professional and friendly.  Our rooms are small by U.S. standard but very modern.  It would be a nice touch to include a bottle of water in the room.  The bed is very comfortable.,4,2011,11,27
123,Pleasantly Surprised!,"I had a great stay at the Marylebone Hotel from Nov. 17- 21. Since this was my first time in London, I found the hotel's location PERFECT in terms of getting on the tube, walking practically everywhere (Oxford St , Picadilly Circus, SOHO, etc.). The staff was extremely friendly and the concierge service was great as well. On top of that, it has an amazing gym and a quaint sauna and indoor pool ! My only complaint is that our room didn't have curtains, only blinds, so light would seep into the room as soon as the sun rose.",5,2011,11,24
123,Friendly staff and an excellent breakfast,"We decided to stay at The Marylebone for a birthday treat weekend after a recommendation from a friend. It was busy in the reception when we arrived, but the staff were friendly and took time to explain everything.
We had coffee in the lounge/bar before going on to a lunch booked in a Covent Garden restaurant. The Hotel was ideally situated close to Oxford Street and the tube so we had time to pop back and change before taking a stroll along the South Bank. We returned again before taking time wandering around the local area which is full of trendy shops and cafes.
The room, on 7th floor, was plush and spacious. The bathroom was modern with lots of lovely smelling toiletries and plenty of large towels.
The staff in the restaurant at breakfast were also very friendly and helpful. We went for the Full English option which had plenty of choice and the coffee was good. My only disappointment was that I didn't have room to fit in any of the cold buffet selection which included a rather delicious looking banana, honey and yoghurt smoothie.
We also liked the complementary bottle of water at check out, a nice little touch.
Thank you to all the staff at The Marylebone Hotel. We hope to see you again soon.",4,2011,11,20
123,Excellent find: great quality/price,"We spent a little over 48 hours in the beautiful and glamorous city of London.  This hotel was a true find.  Located in a perfect area, close to shopping and sites yet not right in the heart, it was perfect.  The staff was very courteous and helpful and friendly.  The rooms though not huge by American standards were very clean and well-appointed.  I must mention we did upgrade to a deluxe type room and the washroom was much larger than the standard category-so I do recommend the higher category.  Breakfast was include and delicious.  Best of all was the staff-always smiling and present.",5,2011,11,19
123,"Great service, great rooms, so so location.","Everything here was excellent with the exception of the location. 
It's a good walk from the Bond street location which is where the stores and underground stop is.
The staff is exceptional and very helpful but the location is not as good as expected.",4,2011,11,16
123,Great stay,"I stayed for 5 nights, nice hotel near Oxford Street. It is located in a quiet neighbourhood, but only 5mn walk to the busy shopping area and tube station. 

Free wifi, the hotel has a big gym and spa. Friendly staff, very helpful. The rooms are OK, not too big, not too small. Bathroom was a bit dated, the amenities aren't very good. Comfortable bed.

Asked for room service breakfast and it was very good.

I strongly recommend this hotel for a stay in London.",4,2011,11,12
123,Wonderful breakfast,"We stayed at Marylebone Hotel 3 nights at the end of October 2011.
The room was pretty small as well as the bathroom. But everything was very clean.
The hotel has a very nice swimming pool with sauna. 
The public areas are beautiful, often decorated with candles even during the day, just so beautiful... 
The highlight is the fantastic breakfast. The room, separated on two floors, is huge. The service was perfect and friendly with our little girl of 2 years.
Thank you so much...",4,2011,11,11
123,Redefining Service Excellence,"My daughter in-law from Dubai always stays at the Marylebone Hotel. And when she flew us to London over the weekend for her birthday, I realised why.

Despite being a frequent business traveller myself, I have to admit that I have never experienced such exquisite treatment and remarkable efforts by a hotel team to ensure the utmost comfort of their guests. Their attention to the finer details and personal preferences of their guests makes you feel so welcomed and taken care of and so very sad to leave. 

They have redefined my expectations of service excellence from my own network of frequently visited business hotels in London. 

A particular mention of Mr.Mark Heyburn, their Rooms Manager, who arranged and managed this very wonderful family celebration / business stay.

123,best location nice room,"2 min from oxford st. ,little in a good way, modern and clean.very friendly stuff.
the perfect place to stay",5,2011,11,08
123,Service with lots of smiles !,"I have stayed a few times now due to having corporate events in London so this is an ideal location.  The hotel staff on arrival are very helpful and seem very happy in thier work, they are very switched on when it comes to customer requests. Check in is very quick with minimal fuss, porters are always on hand to take luggage to your room.  I have had various sized rooms but every one has been very clean, only negative comment would be that there should be bottled water in the room, I have mentioned this to the hotel.  Beds are big with lovely bedding and fluffy pillows !!!
The bar is nice but a little on the dark side, again the staff are very efficient.
I have not eaten in the restaurant so cannot comment, however breakfast is very good with the normal continental or cooked, again service is good.
I have only once had an issue and made a complaint but it was dealt with immediately by both the assistant manager, I then had a telephone call from the manager once I was home, so excellent customer care.
I would recommend this hotel to any visitors to London as you would not be dissapointed !  I always look forward to going back !!!",4,2011,11,08
123,very good,"The hotel is nice, even though my room was very small. The staff is very polite and always eager to help. The area is lovely,the hotel is situated in the center of London, just 3-5 minutes walk from Oxford street and the Bond street tube station, 15 minutes walk to Hyde park. There is a couple of computers available for work and wifi in the whole hotel.",4,2011,11,07
123,Excellent hotel.. Highly reccomended!,"Superb hotel, luxurious .. and the staff were extremely helpful. we stayed for 3 nights and had a great time. The hotel was classy, clean and ... overall thd best hotel I have ever stayed at... I am looking forward to going back there. ",5,2011,11,05
123,Beautiful Hotel - but the service element is lacking.,"First and foremost I must say that the hotel is beautiful and the style and decor makes it a perfect 'boutique' hotel. The location is also fantastic being about 5 minutes walk from Oxford Street and Bond Street station.

The rooms are nicely done and well equipped and we did have two great nights sleep here over a weekend.

Unfortunately, my compliments cannot extend to the service we received. On arrival I found the staff disinterested and not particularly welcoming instead the focus was on securing my £50 deposit despite the fact we had settled the hotel bill in full in advance online. 

Next within ten minutes of being in our room there was knocking on the door. After shouting 'hello' to no avail we thought no more of it until a member of staff began to open the door ""to check how we liked our room"" - give us a minute!!!!

Next we booked a meal for 8.15pm in the hotel restaraunt (108). Admittedly we were 10 minutes late but had called from out hotel room to advise of this. We then arrived to the restaraunt to be told that our table had been taken. We were therefore encouraged to take a seat in the bar whilst a new table was sorted. 1h 15m later after endless requests and dismissive remarks from the waitress we were seated and enjoyed an average meal.

Next on the Sunday morning we decided to order room service and assumed this to be fine considering the menu stated that certain items were available ""24 hours a day"". On ordering we were told that we couldnt have a sandwich as the chef wasn't in yet! Hardly 24 hours a day!

As I say I have no complaints of the hotel itself I was just dissapointed with the service we received. If the service matched the style I would not hesitate to give it 5 stars.",3,2011,11,04
123,Style over substance,"The hotel is of course in a very good location. The Ground Floor looks impressive...almost as though it were being prepared for a photo shoot. The reception staff were friendly though unable to help with opening times for the Spa. Odd though the staff in the Spa veered to the rude and very unhelpful; if you go there as a resident you really want to check out the system as it is clearly geared up for those coming from outside. Maybe this is why there is no information on the pool in the rooms nor at Reception. The staff generally gave the impression that they were all in Training School which was marginally comical unless you were tired in a hurry. The place is dominated by those from abroad who perhaps feel as though this is standard English service. It is not and it is poor. Their booking system is deceptive in what you are being charged for up front and whilst there everything is an add-on charge. There is nothing on working to a Green Friendly purpose. The room was/is very small for two people and bizarrely had only one robe...please note if going for a swim. The fixtures and fittings were well, loose. The curtains need to be closed because you are overlooked and the room is so small. Also note that if going for a swim then the pool fills up quite literally with three people. You will also need an industrial padlock on your person and be prepared to sign a waiver...or is it a declaration on your health to be viewed by qualified er, Spa staff?
If your company or another is paying then I could imagine this could be satisfactory.
The Concierge was excellent.",2,2011,10,31
123,Not as good as i had hoped,"We stayed here on business last week, and whilst the Hotel was really well placed for our visit, and our room was large and well appointed. the heater or air conditioning make a bang all night, and there was no water available in the room to drink. This had to be purchased via the mini bar, (which incidentally wouldn't open). Really for a hotel of this standard, water should be readily available in the room, without additional charge.  

the room was lovely, and well appointed and beautifully decorated. The shower was difficult to turn on without getting drenched.

I wasnt overly impressed with the bar area, where we met for pre dinner drinks with colleagues, the Champagne wasn't chilled enough, the bar area wasnt properly cleaned and wiped down, and lacking in atmosphere and comfort.

The concierge were very helpful and polite, as to were the staff on the reception desk.

The hotel is modern, contemporary and beautifully decorated, but lacking something for me.",3,2011,10,31
123,Class in the heart of London,"This is a great 5* boutique hotel in the centre of London. Quality service, great contemporary interiors. The quality of the food in the restaurants is of a very high standard with an eclectic menu that ensures there is something for all tastes. This is a good place to stay!",4,2011,10,26
123,Good choice,"The hotel is positioned in a quiet street just 5 minutes walking from Oxford Street and Selfridges. 
A plus for the Hotel staff and in particular the concierge whom recomended us very good restaurants in line with out expectations.
We booked the suite and found it very clean and comfortable, the only issue was the bed which we found too small, definitel not a king size bed.",4,2011,10,26
123,very modern,"when we first arrived at the hotel its looks like an office block from the outside,but when you get inside its been refrurbished to the highest standerd. we went to check in the staff were very friendly,they offerr you a warm flannell,when we got to a our room it was lovely to,the bed was massive and very comftable the only minor thing i would say was teh room was small but it was big enough for me and my partner,there was a massive tv and a mini bar and tea and cofffee. the shower was huge. any way i would recomend that any one should stay at this hote. the other positve is that is a couple of mins walk to oxford street,so lots of shopping to be done...:) there was also a massive gym and spa which was lovely",5,2011,10,25
123,Great hotel in a posh neighborhood.,"Very nice hotel in a great neighborhood in London. It's a quick walk to the shopping district and several tube stations, but a little tucked away on a quiet street. Lots of good restaurants and cafes nearby for your breakfast & lunch needs. Breakfast at the hotel is rather expensive and not that great, so I would skip it if it's not included in your rate. The room itself was spacious (I had a junior suite) and very comfortable. The spa/gym in the basement is a great perk -- it offers cardio, nautilus, weight room, and classes. My only complaints were that 1) the lighting in the bathroom was very poor, which made putting on makeup in the morning difficult. They need to install those lighted, extendable mirrors; and 2) the water in the shower never got quite hot enough.  But these were minor issues. Overall it was a great stay.",4,2011,10,20
123,"no clock, bad wake up calls and they can't use rewards program immediately","I am here now and staying for I think 15 days in total.  It's in a great area and I would stay here again.  There are three things that irk me to no end though and it is just a matter of personal preference.
1.  There is no clock in the room.  In order to find out the time you must dial the telephone and listen to a set of voice prompts then hit #3 and you will be told the time.  Many times this system just rings and rings and rings.  
2.  The wake up call is the same way as #1 and when you call every other time it just rings and rings and rings.   This wake up call system is very frustrating especially because when you try it late at night and it doesnt work you call the front desk you often get a message   saying ""reception is closed"".  So you are tired and just wanting a simple wake up call because there is no clock or alarm in your room and end up pressing up every button on the phone to try to get SOMEONE to answer.  
2.  As I said I am staying over 2 weeks here which most likely will be extended.  They do not let your first visit count for their loyalty program.  So someone could check in one day and then one day next month and get rewards, but someone who stays here for quite a while at one fell swoop does not.  It seems a bit unfair.  

When picking a hotel these 3 things would never bother me and besides this and the fact that the bathroom is a little bit scummy, I would absolutely stay here again as it is a wonderful location close to shops and the tube and busses and the like.  The staff is kind and say hello and there is an excellent fish and chips shop within a 1 minute walk.  

You never know how much you need a clock until you don't have one.  Or a loyalty program.",3,2011,10,17
123,Consistently good,I have stayed at this hotel regularly for the past 2 years. The staff actually stay and remember their guests. What a pleasant change!,4,2011,10,10
123,Great location,"My husband and I stayed here at the beginning of our honeymoon. We had just flown in from Boston, MA and our room was ready at 10 AM, which was a relief. Our room was very spacious and clean. The concierge helped us out a lot. We both used the gym one morning. The changing rooms were very clean. My one complaint was the price of the breakfast. You could get the same English breakfast for £8 or less. The neighborhood is very posh, but we had a great time treating ourselves on our honeymoon.",5,2011,10,04
123,Poor service from start to finish....rip off at £270 per night,"As part of a company event approximately 20 of my business colleagues (including myself) and had been blocked into the Marylebone (29 Oct)   On arrival one of my colleagues ( from Dutch office) and I tried to check in at 4pm. Only to be told that most of the rooms (including mine) were not ready yet. No real apology only that my colleagues room was ready.  

We filled in the check in forms only to realise that both rooms ( despite being the same class room) had a difference in room rate of £45. On enquiry the person on reception shrugged her shoulder and could not explain why. Instead of attempting to enquire within the hotel reservations... she proposed that we chase up with our corporate PA to find out why there was a difference in price.  

She suggested that I wait in the main reception until room was prepared.  She then changed and said that apparently my room was indeed ready, and at my Dutch female colleagues room was not prepared...being a gentleman I offered to exchange rooms with her allowing her to go to room and shower prepare for formal event in 1.5 hours time. 

I waited a further 1/2 hour before I was presented with a room card with the surname name of my colleague presented as mr and mrs?..as if we had checked in as a couple!!?

As I was now late , I rushed up to room to send a number of business email and shower....during shower my room phone rang 5X ...eventually I Jumped out of shower ...dripping I answered phone I thout it might be an urgent call from a colleague or home...only for reception to ask if ""everything was alright'.....not really

On returning home to Scotland this evening, I called as I had left an item in room ...after reception number ringing for over 10 minutes the phone was answered abruptly by what sounded like 14 yesrs old.  When I asked to please be put through to someone with regards to lost property....I got a confused reaction as if this was a strange request. After another 5 minutes I was put through to someone who clearly hadn't a grasp of basic English 

I was asked in 'pidgin' English to call back tomorrow as their was no management in Hotel (on a Friday night) to help me. 

Not sure what star rating is for this joint...but light years away from their description on their website as"" The Marylebone Hotel is now one of the finest hotels in London - a haven of understated and contemporary luxury that turns even the briefest of stays into a genuine pleasure""

NOT EVEN CLOSE Doyle Collection  hotel group... you need another major refurbishment of professional staff.

Ps won't even waste more time on rooms not being that clean

How I look forward to my business trip to New York ...where hotels in Manhattan know what good service is in return for premium rates",1,2011,09,30
123,"OK, but not very clean","I have stayed here before and it was fine,  the rooms are a bit small but perfect for a weekend in London,  near everything.  Biggest complaint was the bathroom had not been cleaned properly for what looked like a long time,  the cleaners do a quick wipe and tidy and that is it.  The shower hose halfway down was completely coated in mould and I am guessing it is still coated in mould,  the corners and the overflow in the sink again have mould.  The bath robes had dried blood on one and we left it on the floor to be cleaned and for a replacement, it was hung back up,  the underside of the taps are filthy.  Does not fill you with confidence that anything has been cleaned properly.  I stayed in room 143.",3,2011,09,27
123,"Comfortable Room, Excellent Service","I've stayed at a few hotels in my time, but being offered a hot towel when I'm checking in, getting my room key was a first.  Maybe I looked a bit shabby and they thought I needed a wipe down! There was somebody to open all the doors and call a lift. All very efficient and uber-polite.  The corridors were dark brown with limited spot lights making the room numbers (on dark brown doors) a bit tricky to spot, but this was offset by bouncy carpets and spongy walls which made the walk through the corridors a bit more fun.  The room was compact, but clean and fresh with robes and slippers.  If you forget to take a book or there is nothing on the TV, don't worry as you can kill some time playing with the fancy coffee maker.  Breakfast next morning was enjoyable - again very attentive service.  I only opted for the continental which gave plenty of choice. You'll probably know already that the hotel is in a good location.",4,2011,09,27
123,"Lovely hotel, great location","Got off to a good start when I phoned the hotel to ask if I could drop my bags off before the 2pm check-in time....not only did they say Yes, when I arrived at 10am, they let me check in to my room!  I was very impressed by this level of customer service.

Lovely lobby and reception area.  Polite and helpful staff.  Check-in was fast and efficient.

The room was lovely.  Spotlessly clean.  Very comfortable bed. Nice and quiet.  

Bathroom was also very clean and modern.

The location for me was great, just over 5 minutes walk from Oxford Street (Welbeck St is to the rear of Debenhams).  Nearest tube is New Bond Street (also very close).  Taxi rank outside, so I never had to hunt for a taxi.

I thought this was an excellent hotel and it was very good value compared to some other central London hotels that I have stayed in.  Would definitely go back.",5,2011,09,24
123,"Great hotel ,excellent stay- see   the room befor you take it","We stayed 6 days. booked a suite and  one  standard double room . the studio suite  no.740 was no suite just a big room  it had a bed and 2chaires the was very small. we changed to room  145 which was great , a real suite with sofa and table , a desk , large batheomm . Tha standard room was fine for 1 persone , it was  not very big, but very nice. i would have the double  delux for 2 people. the main problem is No Place for Cothings , the cupboards are tiny ! also in the suit no room for more then on person's clothes!! there is a big veriety of rooms so i advice you to go up to see the room before you take it.The lobby is great to meet people , many nice  corners well designed. the elevator in the back near the 108 bar , goes to the gym and pool. it needs ventilations , the smell is horibble all the time.  the main elevator is fine. the staff is friendly and helpful. NOTE- the minibar- if you take out things in order to put you own , it is electronicly noted as if you have used their  items. and you get a big bill the next day. we went down to explain , and it was fixed.The hotel location is the best , neat Oxford st and the Marylbonehigh st is great dor shopping and food. we did not have brakfast at the hotel( very expensive) we went to Bonne Bouche in Marylbone higt st which is great( we know the place from other visites in London-recommended to us by somone  on Tripadvisor- great Tip !!)) and not expensive. very recommanded!!the 108 bar of the hotel is pleasent to sit in . no food after 2230 .it is a lovley place to stay in London , not cheap but very nice, check the room befoor you take it!! it is important.

123,Beautiful.  Will be back!,"From the lovely welcome, to the plush bed and fabulous gym facilities, both my husband and I cannot speak highly enough about our stay.  They accomodated earlier arrivals (we stayed twice during our trip), helped with all our needs and it was all done with perfect grace, especially the gorgeous Rafeal at conceirge.  Very refreshing to get such lovely service.  The location is great; close to Bond St tube and Oxford st and surrounded by lots of places for breakfast and dinner if you don't want to stray too far after tiring yourself out sightseeing during the day (or shopping!).  Despite being close to lots of restaurants and shops it was very also quiet so ensured a great night sleep every night.",5,2011,09,23
123,Wonderful Experience,This has to be one of my all time favourite spots to stay in London. Our upgraded room was awesome. The staff was super attentive and awesome. The food and drinks were a great experience. I would give this hotel an 11 out of 10. It met and exceeded all of our expectations. We had celebrities staying on the same floor! The centre of the hotel is spectacular and lounging there is great. We took some great walks in the neighbourhood too. I would highly recommend a stay here. It is a royal treat!,5,2011,09,20
123,Excellent,"We had booked a long weekend for our first anniversary.  On arriving early at the hotel we were told our room wasnt ready - no problem.  We wandered off for lunch and returned around 3pm.  Very apologetic staff explained that a clerical hitch meant our room still wasnt ready but offered us a complimentary glass of wine and nibbles in the bar whilst they sorted it.  Less than 10 minutes later Robert, the Guest relations manager came and told us the room was ready.

We got into the room to discover that not only had we been upgraded from a Superior room, but that a bottle of champagne was waiting for us with a hand written note from Robert wishing us a happy anniversary.

That was the start of absolutely top notch service we received throughout the weekend.  The room as modern, spacious and immaculate.  The small issue of the leaking shower head was fixed as soon as we mentioned it.

The staff in the hotel are superb - willing to go the extra mile to help.  Can't praise the reception, concierge or bar staff enough.

If we don't get back before then we most certainly will be spending our second anniversay there.",5,2011,09,19
123,Posh Business Hotel In A Great Location,"I've just returned from spending 9 days at the Marylebone, courtesy of my company. 

I was pleased to be in an upgraded, larger room, as the standard ones seem extremely small.

The front desk has charming staff, millions of pounds reportedly have been spent upgrading the building, which is on a fairly quiet (for Central London) street and great neighbourhood. 

The hallways are particularly fetching, with deep carpet and dark walls, and lovely wood doors. 

There were some errors at the start, as I was considered a VIP, the manager, Mr. Alexander, had left a nice note with a plate of fruit, which was inexplicably taken away when I stepped out of the room for a short while. That was corrected, as was the bathroom sink stopper which didn't work. The other initial problem I had was that the mini-bar refridgerator needed to be emptied so I could fill it with my own stuff, and after it was emptied, it remained locked, as it's all done electronically. I had to go down to the desk to get them to change it which took a second, but the communication from house staff to front desk was nil.

The biggest quibble with the room is their designer doesn't believe in dressers for clothes - as they take up too much room, and not chic enough, apparently, and it took every bit of ingenuity to store my 9 days worth of clothes and business materials out of view. The two ultra-modern chairs were not particularly comfortable either. Another point is that the lovely marble bathroom was designed with the lowest wattage of built-in lighting I've ever come across.

One other point was that upon returning one night, I found that the cleaner apparently had left a 1/4 full bottle of diet lemonade on the desk. 

So there are some problems that this management has, travelers should note, especially at these prices- I think my rate was around $400 US a day. 

When I received my bill for incidentals, there was a £2 charge for a telephone call during the day that I couldn't have made, or would have, since I have a mobile. This was obviously made by the cleaner, hoping that I would miss it. I was put out by this, and complained at checkout.

On a nicer note, the one day I had breakfast at the hotel, it was excellent, and their bar serves superb drinks, and I assume, good food. 

My last favourable point is that when their business centre computer couldn't print my next day's boarding pass, one of the front desk men, promised and delivered it under my door as it was very late at night. 

Bed, bedding and pillows all superior.",4,2011,09,13
123,Super Convenient,"I stayed at the Marylebone in August 2011. The location is perfect being just a 5 minute walk from Oxford Street (behind Debenhams) and a 5 minute walk to High Marylebone Street.

The staff were very pleasant and the concierge was always at hand to arrange transport or theatre tickets.

The room was a good size for a London hotel (which are typically very small) equiped with a nice LCD screen with a variety of channels. The bathroom was a good size and had a nice big shower.

All in all, a great conveniently located hotel. It is highly recommended.",4,2011,09,13
123,Flawless!,"Great location, about 5-10 minutes walk from oxford street/bond street tube station. Very friendly check-in and front desk employees. Room size was good, with a lot of storage space, mini-bar etc. Overall a very clean and comfortable room. Hotel lobby was nice, didn't look at the new spa area. We would definitely book this hotel again!",4,2011,09,12
123,Wow!,"The Marylebone ticked all the boxes for me.
The location near Marylebone High Street is superbly central and quiet.
I am used to small rooms in London but my superior was far from small.
Great bedding, wonderful bath, tea and coffee (and biscuits!) refreshed daily.
Free in-room wifi worked perfectly.
The only noise I encountered was from neighbours closing their doors. 
if your window is open the door tends to close with a bang.
Note to Management: why not have automatic closers on all doors so they close gently and quietly?
The staff were all lovely.
The pool and gym facilities are stellar! 
Huge pool for doing laps with lots of room for paddlers. 2 floors of new, quality workout equipment.
The general decor is quite modern and not the least bit chintzy.
I have every intention to return as quickly as I can!",5,2011,09,08
123,"Great location, room was very pokey!","The hotel is very well located a few mins stroll from Oxford Street.  The hotel looks like it's been revamped and they've done a very nice job on it. Service is professional and courteous on entering the foyer and  check-in. 

However, the room we got was very very small, not worth €220 per night, room only.  It was very nicely decorated, the bed was comfortable, flat screen tv, aircon and large shower (no bath, which was a disappointment).  We were falling over each other getting dressed. Perhaps all of the rooms are the same, however I would avoid room 553.  This room overlooks the yards out the back of the hotel and you'll be woken early with garbage trucks.",3,2011,09,06
123,Good for business; great for pleasure!,"Tucked neatly into the West End between Regent¹s Park and Hyde Park, The Marylebone was nicely suited for us — my wife is a regular international business traveler who stayed here before, so when we showed up by train from York on a Tuesday morning, our room wasn't quite ready, so they upgraded us to a corner suite at no charge.  It has the feel of an efficient business hotel, yet would be perfectly suited for families wanting to be in the thick of London¹s tourist spots.  Service is professional and efficient, as should be expected from a nice business hotel, yet our room was spacious, unlike typical city hotels where everything is cramped.",5,2011,09,05
123,"Great stay, very central","Stayed here for two nights for my husbands 30th birthday, had a great stay, the hotel is beautifully decorated, immacuately clean and the food was delicious, the reception and concierge staff are to be commended they do a fantastic job, one of the best welcomes I have received to a hotel, and I am from a hotel reception background, so friendly and professional.
THANK YOU!!!!",5,2011,09,05
123,"Excellent, Will definately be back","Just back from a 3 night break in the Marylebone Hotel with my wife. We both have nothing but good words to say about this hotel. Firstly I emailed them in advance to say that we were celebrating our first year wedding anniversary and on arrival our room had been upgraded complimentary. We then headed out for the day and when we arrived back the hotel had left a complimentary bottle of prosecco in our room. The location of the hotel is excellent, only a few minutes walk to Oxford Street and the many cafe's etc on Marylebone High Street. The hotel staff were very helpful throughout our stay and also the gym/pool was immaculate. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay in the Marylebone hotel and we will definately be back.",5,2011,08,30
123,"good location, but hotel was just ok","I stayed for two nights for mid august. I usually stay at the canvendish when I am in London, so I thought I would give this hotel a try after reading positive reviews. I booked deluxe room, but after I got to my room and saw out the window, and there was no view out the window, but overlooking some sort of weird fan thing outside. I asked for a different room and they recommended that I take disabled room, so I did. I must say that I found this room much bigger than the deluxe room, but it was WEIRD. There were strings hanging next to the bed and in the bathroom, and the bathroom was not so clean, like in the corners of the bathroom looked as if it was not scrubbed for ages. I saw weird things on the toilet seat so I needed to clean it before I used it. That sight was pretty letdown for me and some interior and refrigerator was so old in the room. I think they try to make it nice, but don't try hard enough because they only try to cover up and fix things you can really see. There was paint smell on the floor I was at because they are painting the room near the elevator and it was pretty unpleasant to be near that. The people were nice at the hotel and the bar area is very ambient and people are nice there as well. I found everyone who worked there really nice. The wifi is free here and the location of the hotel is close to oxford street. I don't think I will stay here again because you can probably get a better deal down the street at holiday inn. Not sure if I recommend this hotel to anybody, definitely not anybody I know if they are looking for a NICE hotel. This hotel isn't super cheap for the deal you get, so I will probably get a cheaper hotel if you are trying to save money or spend more and get nicer hotel.",3,2011,08,26
123,Fantastic Location but watch out if they try to swindle you!,"The Marlyebone Hotel was very well located and we loved it because of that one reason.  5 minutes in one direction and you have this fantastic row of restaurants and a supermarket.  5 minutes the other direction and you're right in the middle of all the shopping your heart could desire (and also the subway system).  Room was comfortable and clean (and modern!) and there were big windows which let in the light.  Wifi was free (great!).  Breakfast was included and was very good - but had it not been included we would not have eaten there was it was very expensive.  PAUL was down the street and we were happy to go there instead.  The hallways were quite dark though.  Swimming pool and health club were under renovation so we were not able to see it. 

They also had a private car that could take you to the airport for a reasonable price (same as a taxi) - which was a nice perk.

The one very big complaint we have is while we were trying to check out, we asked to pay in pounds.  They claimed that was not possible and we had to pay in USD (which btw they chose their own conversion rate).  After some time (and seeing that we would not relent), miraculously they were able to charge the room in pounds as originally agreed upon.  A very sly way to make a few extra dollars but something we definitely do NOT appreciate.  Someone not paying attention would've been swindled - its just not an honest way to do business.",3,2011,08,25
123,Excellent in every way,"I almost hesitate to write a review for fear of the hotel becoming too popular.  The hotel is a gem.  It's beautifully decorated, the rooms are pristine, comfortable, and most importantly, the bathroom is modern and spotless.  The staff were all warm and friendly, and very helpful.  The location is excellent, with lovely shops and restaurants within walking distance.  I was traveling on business, but will come back to stay for a holiday.  It really was a beautiful surprise.",5,2011,08,22
123,"Nice Hotel, pity about the customer service","We stayed here as part of our honeymoon trip and e mailed the hotel before travelling to let them know.  We were assured they would do something a little bit special for us as this was an occassion.
On arrival the receptionist was very professional and friendly and promoted the loyalty scheme the hotel group has, which was fine.
We then got to our room, which was also fine.  The facilities are nice, clean and newly refurbished.  Our room was the furthest from the lift so it was a bit of a trek to get to the lift etc but could be worse.
The gym is excellent and probably one of the best I have seen in a hotel.
On the down side-if you are just looking to chill out and be pampered a little this may not be the hotel for you.  For some reason housekeeping decide to come around every morning at around 8am-even if you have your 'do not disturb' sign on you will be disturbed as they feel the need to bang as loud as they can on every other door in the corridor, shouting through the door.  this woke us both up every single morning.  The two house keeping ladies then seemed to carry on their conversations with each other by shouting them between rooms, by the fourth morning this was wearing very thin!!
Unfortunately on the third evening my partner was unwell and I had to ring reception to ask for a doctor to be sent.  the doctor rang back to say there would be no one available until 11 am the next morning.  The staff member I had spoken to on the phone was aware of this, however offered no alternative! Given the fact that most people staying in a hotel are travellers, not local to the area it would be helpful for them to impart their local knowledge and possibly assist in some way.
No member of staff even contacted us the next day or at any point throughout our stay to check on the health of my partner (basic stuff of customer service I would suggest).
We were disappointed that at no point was the fact that it was our honeymoon even mentioned.  No congratulations or acknowledgement-granted we were not expecting anything for free but perhaps a welcome card or an effort of some sort would have been nice!
In conclusion I would say the area of the hotel in nice, the decor is also nice.  To stay for business etc it would be fine but if you are wanting to be treated that little bit special or even to be considered throughout your stay then try elsewhere!!",3,2011,08,20
123,Great value by London standards,Clean and tastefully decorated hotel in a prime location only a stone's throw from Oxford Street. The breakfast is excellent. The hotel also currently offers access to the state of the art 3rd Space health club on the ground floor. As someone who likes to stay in shape while travelling I found this exceptional value - particularly in London where hotel gyms are an afterthought if they exist at all - even in high end hotels - due to the premium on space in the city. Altogether a great stay.,4,2011,08,19
123,well...not bad...,"great neighbourhood, but...not quite there for what they pretend to be.
£4. for a bucket of ice?....
asking constantly for the turn-down and they never do it...
one great thing... the gym!",3,2011,08,18
123,Great Hotel - highly recommend,"My wife and I stayed at The Marylebone Hotel for 5 nights in early August 2011. I would highly recommend this place to anyone considering staying in central London.  Firstly the staff are first class, helpful, friendly and nothing is too much bother. The concierage desk is another service I can't rate high enough, we got last minute show tickets to The Lion King and recommendations on good restarants in the area, these guys were fantatsic.  The rooms are a little small but very clean, modern and comfortable, and also nice and quiet from street noise. We will definately stay here again on our next trip back. Thank you Marylebone Hotel for a wonderful stay!!",5,2011,08,18
123,Great place to stay for business or holiday!,"This hotel was a good ""find""!  While a bit on the pricey side (continental breakfast was 22 pounds - about $30 US!!!!), overall will probably stay there again, albeit getting breakfast down the street instead.  The hotel rooms were spacious (for London), well appointed and relatively new.  The bathrooms were a tad on the ""compact"" side, but fully functional.  One of the most COMFORTABLE beds I've slept in in Europe.  The hotel front desk staff and bellmen couldn't have been more professional and welcoming.  

The only reason I couldn't give a 5 star was because of housekeeping.  Had to talk with front desk 3 times about linen issues and bath gel/shampoo.  After the desk agent called housekeeping for the 3rd time (and had a ""serious"" discussion-you know the British, they are able to remain composed while getting their point across in a direct way so to speak), we had an abundance of linen and gels/shampoos.

I look forward to returning my next trip to London!",4,2011,08,16
123,great find; will be back!,"Lovely central hotel around the corner from Marylebone High Street, the non-touristy shopping alternative for great shopping and little cafe's.

Very friendly staf who go the extra mile for you. Nice cosy lounge with little seatings for a private chat. Fab cool gym with great trainers, and a pool! 

We stayed in a deluxe room, which is worth the extra pounds for it gives some space. Bathroom still tiny though. 

Breakfast provides a good and healthy choice, with fresh smoothy's and also a coocked breakfast on request. 

This hotel still has smoking rooms - if you don't want a smoking room I advise to call reservations directly so they can take down your request. This can not be done through internet booking at the hotel site directly.
Will definetely be back!",4,2011,08,12
123,Superior Room = Like Sleeping in a Cupboard,"Stayed here for two nights in August this year. First the positives:
- great location a few minutes from bond street tube
- really friendly and helpful staff
- modern, fresh decor
- lovely sitting areas 
And now the negatives:
- the size of the superior rooms is literally the size of a cupboard. there was barely room round the sides of the bed to walk - the walls either side were scuffed and dirty where people had tried to squeeze round. Am 5ft and fairly slim and still found it a struggle to fit round the room. My boyfriend and I had to take it in turns to unpack as we couldn't both fit in the corridor space where the the wardrobe was at once. Room would just about be ok for a single person but really not for two. The bed is a double rather than a king which seems small if you're used to a king at home
- £25 for two drinks at the bar (inc service charge) but i guess this is london

I would stay here again but definitely not in a superior room",4,2011,08,08

123,"Excellent hotel, super location with great service","Have stayed here a couple of times and will definitely return for the great location and facilities.  Service is really excellent - friendly, professional and attentive.  Really like the rooms, not overly spacious and bathrooms are quite tight - but have everything you need, spotlessly clean and well serviced daily.  Carpets are a bit on the jaded side.  Super leisure facilities in gym and fab pool. Definitely would recommend it.",5,2011,08,04
123,good hotel where you feel warmly welcome,"This hotel is located in the heart of the Marylebone, a central and very nice area.
Unlike the large hotel chains, you feel a little more home in this one. The design and furnitures in the rooms and at the reception are very nice and well maintained.
The 3rd space gym on the underground floor is just brilliant.
Breakfast buffet is nice but not really at an affordable price. Finally, rooms can differ very significantly from one to another, depending on their size, orientation, but also as they are inequally isolated from external noises.
I liked the room 647 particularly, nice view, big and very quiet.
Overall, the service is excellent and the staff particularly helpful and friendly.",4,2011,08,04
123,Fantastic Hotel for all ages,"We just stayed at the Marylebone, 3 generations ranging from 70 to 5 and had a wonderful time. The room was lovely, quiet and spacious and we enjoyed the pool and health club. It is a fantastic location near to parks with lots of restuarants within walking distance. Will be back as it is now my favorite hotel in London.",5,2011,08,04
123,Absolutely Fantastic Hotel,"My new Husband and I were suprised by a night away at the Marylebone Hotel, and what can i say but WOW!!  The Hotel  very kindly gave us a free upgrade as we were on Honeymoon and we were spoilt rotton.  The room we had was totally amazing, and champagne and fruit delivered to our room.  After an evening out in London we returned to find another bottle of champagne, strawberries and shortcake followed by camomile tea.

The room was spotless and the staff were all lovely.  I cant thank you enough for making our stay so memorable

Sarah and Stephen",5,2011,08,03
123,Lovely hotel and staff,"Just got back today from two nights at this hotel. Great location, and brilliant staff. We were celebrating our 2 year wedding anniversary and got a studio suite upgrade. Room was spacious, clean and everything good working order. Everything was nicely decorated. Beds SO comfortable! Very quiet also-hardly heard any noise outside!

Wifi service is brilliant, fast and efficient. Nice that its free too.
Bar was nice, although a little on the expensive side-but it is London after all. 
The spa area pool were brilliant-if you're a health nut, you'll love the gym-very well equipped. Pool was lovely, slightly spoiled by young children but we were there Sunday which is the one time children are allowed in. Did not use spa treatments so cant say if it was good or not.

We'd like to say a special thank you to Niamh on reception who was so lovely and welcoming, going as far to send some champagne up to our room. Thanks for a great stay, hopefully we'll be back soon!",5,2011,08,01
123,Surprisingly dirty and run-down,"My husband and I are staying at this hotel now, and we are both extremely disappointed. 

We were first placed in a ""superior"" room which was the smallest hotel room I've ever seen. We decided to upgrade (at an extra cost of 100 pounds) to a ""suite"". It's a larger room, but it is definitely NOT a suite. It's simply a larger room with two armchairs.

The worst part is the lack of maintenance/cleanliness. When we got to our ""suite,"" there was a broken zipper in the toilet bowl. We flushed it down, but shouldn't housekeeping have caught it first? We opened the mini-bar to find it completely empty and dirty (with spilled liquids that had gelled onto the shelves). The bed sheets were stained and had stray hairs on them. The furniture is grubby, the carpet is stained, and the paint on the walls is chipped in several places. We mentioned this to housekeeping, but she seemed confused and we don't think she fully understood what we were saying. 

My husband is attending a conference in this hotel with a company that brings them a lot of business. We are looking up alternative hotels in the area because we are so uncomfortable here.",1,2011,07,31
123,Excellent!,"We had a great 3 night stay here! The staff is very friendly and helpful. The rooms are clean, and decorated nicely. We were on the first floor and the bathroom and room were very nice, a bit dark, but very nice. We ate at the restaurant in the hotel twice because it was so good. The breakfast buffet is wonderful, please dont change it! This hotel is in a good location, quiet street, with lots of restaurants near by. The tube station is about 300 meters away, very close and easy to get to. The hotel seemed to be used a lot for business people but they reception was very good about helping tourists.",5,2011,07,28
123,Great Hotel And Location,"The staff amd amenities at the hotel were wonderful.  The best part is the neighborhod.  It's quiet and busy at the same time. . . more oriented to locals than tourists.  Good choices of restaurants, cafes, etc. , within walking distance to Oxford Street  shopping, Wigmore Hall, the Wallace Collection and numerous other places.  Equidistant between the Bond Street and Baker Street tube stops while walkable also to Oxford Circus and Marble Arch stations.  Best part:  not a touisty neighborhood!",4,2011,07,26
123,It smelled like smoke! Is that still allowed?,"Great location, interesting shops in the area. Enjoyed the gym in the basement, brand new and funky. But the room and the entire floor smelled like smoke and was very unpleasant all around. Also the concierge found it difficult to recommend to me what time I should catch a cab to the airport - isn't that what they do?

Wouldn't stay here again.",3,2011,07,25
123,Excellent stay in the hotel & great location,"Just spent a few days in the hotel and was very enjoyable.  What a great choice and excellent location.  Rooms are fairly spacious, reception staff very friendly and helpful plus some excellent facilities in the hotel itself.  Very quiet and well soundproofed room and slept without any disturbance.  Also has free wifi access in the room

Some great restaurants and pubs close by in the area.  I will use the hotel again on my next visit to London!",5,2011,07,18

Very nice.",4,2011,07,17
123,"Classy, convenient and perfect for gym junkies","Its hard to find a decent hotel in central London that has a great fitness centre, let alone a swimming pool. This hotel incorporates a full service members only fitness centre called the Third Space which has a pool and sauna and as a guest of the hotel you can have free access. The hotel is friendly and classy – cool hand towel arrives when you check in on a hot summer afternoon – nice touch. The rooms are adequate and bathrooms are modern. Breakfast is continental style with an excellent selection of cereals, fruits, yoghurts, pastries,  etc. The croissants are particularly good. Hot food is not served in warmers but rather made fresh to order. Coffees made to order are also top-class.

The Marylebone Hotel is very conveniently located less than 10 mins walk from Oxford Street and Bond Street Tube station (located behind Debenhams). Marylebone High Street is 3 mins away and has everything you need including post office, supermarkets, bakeries, cafes and restaurants. This hotel is certainly not in the budget category but compared to similarly priced hotels that I have stayed in – Cumberland, Radisson Edwardian, Montague on the Gardens – it was definitely the best London hotel I’ve stayed in recently. This hotel also attracts the stars - Joe Jonas from Jonas Broithers was staying here. Hotel handled it well with fans patiently waiting outside not too disruptive to guests.",5,2011,07,17

123,Lovely and hospitable,"I haven't even checked out yet but felt compelled to write my review! The first thing this charming and friendly spot did right was allowing us entry to our room even though we arrived several hours before check-in. I truly appreciated that. The rooms are very comfortable, the bed just right and the bathroom clean and modern.

The included breakfast is stellar. Every single staff member I've encountered (especially the hard working servers at breakfast) has been pleasant and eager to help. The Marylebone Hotel was an oasis after a bit of a harried European vacation, and I'll be sure to keep this location in mind the next time I travel to London.",5,2011,07,07
123,Very nice stay; thanks!,"This was our first trip to London but had seen a Doyle Hotels sister property in Wasington DC so we thought it could be nice.  The property did not disappoint.  Room was very nice (we had a junior suite), clean, and quiet.  The 1/2 shower doors seemed a little odd and made a bit of a mess each evening but everything was very comfortable.  Staff is a bit reserved but it turned out just about everybody in London is!",4,2011,07,06
123,very very disappointing,"I feel really let down by my experience at this hotel. I shouted myself and partner a trip to London for my birthday and thought I had chosen somewhere very special to stay, especially at ₤920 for four nights, At first we were given a room next to the lift and I was worried that the noise would keep us awake so asked for an alternative. The staff were very accommodating and cheerful and offered us a  room on another floor. This room was smaller and it was disappointing to feel more cramped but we soon noticed a worse problem - the room stank! It was as if the furnishings and suede wallpaper were embedded with stale cigarette smoke - very overpowering. We tried to ignore the stench for several hours but realised we wouldn't sleep so reluctantly approached the staff again. Again they were extremely helpful (even at 11 pm) and offered us the room next door. We accepted as it had no smell but sadly, this room (in which I write) is smaller still! The original room had a lovely desk at which to write and the TV on the wall but this room has the TV on the desk which takes up most of the space. There is barely room for two suitcases on the floor and rather than having a table and two chairs at which to sit, there is just a single chair. It really is a tiny room with a tiny bathroom to match.
I had read reviews about room size at this hotel (with some saying it's fine and others saying  it's cramped) and now realise that the size varies considerably. I would strongly suggest that you ask for a larger sized room when you book.
On a more positive note, the leisure centre with swimming pool at this hotel is absolutely brilliant. The pool is a very good size and there are saunas as well as a full-sized gym. If you like to keep fit, you won't be disappointed in this aspect of the hotel.",3,2011,06,25
123,Our luxury home in London !,"Its not just the perfect location on the elegant Marylebone High Street close to Regents Park and Harley Street, but rather the way we are always welcomed and every single detail and personal preference taken care of even before we have boarded the flight.

123,Excellent!,"Exceeded my expectations. 

Easy access to tube via bond street. Incredible gym. Staff was amazingly pleasant and helpful. Breakfast was great and well worth it. Close enough to see all the sites but also in a real neighborhood with locals. For London, solid value for the money. 

Wifi was fast and free. It went out for a few hours but was fixed quickly.

Service has left much to be desired; simple queries in relation to the amenities and the menu have resulted in what seems like a forum on the other side of the phone - which, in any case, results in an unsure  (and admittedly speculated) response! Doesn't help that this is done in a particularly unfriendly manner!

p.s. the room isn't particularly large, and the bathroom is the most miniscule I've ever seen! 

Don't bother - seriously!",2,2011,06,08
123,the most ridiculoous excuse ever !!,"this is my first day at the marylebone hotel  ,, and my first impression is that i loved it ,, most of the staff are really nice and helpful, we are in the delux room which is nice and comfortable , but what really irratated me is i arrived to the hotel after a long 7 hours night flight ,we booked two rooms, and by the time we arrived which was around 8 am only one room was available which was fine i guess , so we tried to stay all of us in one room ,, and left and came back after 2pm , given that we were promised to have access to our second room by max 2 pm ,, we were tired exausted and really drained , and we were asked to wait for 15 minutes which turned into 40 minutes and when we went to the reception one of the staff said your room is ready but we didnt tell you because we are busy !! i mean what kind of excuse is this >>?? if your busy with another client you shouldnt forget that i am a customer as will ,, and i demand to enjoy a quick service rather than to be pushed down the To-Do list !!there was no consedration from her side that we came from a long night flight that we are realllly tired and in despreate need of a shower , what this staff said really unacceptable ,, i really hope that the coming two weeks wouldnt be as unpleasent as our first day was ! simply because they are busy with other customers and they have no time to service  me !!!!",3,2011,06,05
123,What a hotel should be,"What makes this place stand out above the rest is the service, great inclusive breakfast - but above all the relaxed atmosphere. Good bar too!",5,2011,06,04
123,Perfect from start to finish,"Location great , staff attentive, nice atmosphere... couldn't fault it, a really perfect stay. Was revived and refreshed for the busy day ahead!",5,2011,05,30
123,One of our best,"My wife and I stay 5 nights here and enjoyed the cleanliness, location and the friendly staff. Great valued continental breakfast. Only negative is the small bathroom - 1 person only.
If you enjoy a good walk I recommend the Regents Park. Free wifi thrown in is a great inclusion.",4,2011,05,24
123,Excellent location for business event,"Stayed at The Marylebone Hotel as part of a 4 day training event. Room was smaller than previous visit but perfectly good, with an excellent bed. Free WiFi in rooms is very simple to access (some more expensive hotels could take note!) and enabled work to continue around the edges. Decor around the hotel is dark ""chic"" which is nicely understated. Food is really very good, even the notorious ""working lunch buffet"" was a delight (included seared squid on one day!) Service from all the staff is superb, genuinely warm and helpful - particularly the staff around the lounge and business centre. The new gym (Third Space) in the basement is a classy new addition with 3 floors of state of the art equipment and an excellent pool. All in all a great business hotel.",4,2011,05,24
123,Good value in great location,"Good value, centrally located, mid-range hotel. Our room was small, especially the bathroom which could only be used by one person at a time. In addition to a small, rather hard double bed, another downside was the inefficient, noisy aircon. Otherwise the room facilities were adequate for the price paid. We didn't use many of the hotel facilities as we were in London for the Cup Final, but the bar facility was fine! Breakfast was included with our package and was really excellent, with great service from the staff.",3,2011,05,23
123,A lovely little Gem in Marylebone!,"Love London and love this location! Hotel isn't much by the outside but rather nice and boutique-like on the inside. Check in was quick and easy, as was check out!  We were on the top floor affording a nice view of the West towards Edgware Road in the distance. View of rooftops and a nice Cathedral in the distance.

Very walkable to Bond St. Tube station and the shops of Oxford Street. The local high street also had a small Tesco and a Waitrose and a nice Paul coffee shop although the rooms have a nice Nespresso machine (be careful to watch your cup as the platform vibrated and an espresso fell onto the floor and into an open drawer underneath the machine)!

The concierge was OK although one of the staff's first response when asked a question always seemed to be ""No, that can't be done"" or at least negative in some way or another! Easy to work around his attitude though.

The business centre was used mainly for internet on our part! It worked fine! No complaints!

My biggest pet peeve was that there were no ice machines in the hotel and the hotel charged something like 4 pounds sterling for ice to be delivered to the room as the standard room service charge! We worked around this by calling room service and arranging for us to pick the ice up just outside the business centre! Definately was not thrilled having to do this but I wasn't going to waste money on ice!

Rooms were clean, black cabs always available outside the hotel and very centrally located! Don't use Marylebone Station on the Bakerloo line as your main tube stop as it is much further than the Bond St. station!

Also being on the top floor we had no noise from above! Actually found the rooms rather sound proof, at least from neighbouring rooms!",4,2011,05,20
123,Fantastic in every way!,"My husband and I stayed at the hotel for his 40th birthday and I had notified them ahead of time that it was his birthday.  One of the reception leaders, Milena, went out of her way to make our stay extra special. We were offered a complimentary upgrade (the room was beautifully decorated and very spacious) and my husband was given a bottle of wine, some chocolates and a signed card form the staff. We were very impressed with the attention that we were given from start to finish (Milena even went out of her way to meet us when we checked in) and we would definitely stay at the hotel again. The location is great ( a few minutes from Oxford Street), the attention to detail to every part of the hotel's decor is impressive (all the cushions similarly 'plumped' in the  evening!) and the  food is plentiful (breakfast was great!) - we can't wait to come back.",5,2011,05,18
123,Thrilled with this one!,"Awesome hotel, extremely friendly staff, only a few hundred metres from Oxford St and 2 tube stations. We loved our stay here, the staff bent over backwards to help us, it was 5 star service! Very comfortable lounge areas and bar. Highly recommend!!!",5,2011,04,27
123,Very Good Choice,"I, my husband and some friends stayed at this hotel in November 2010 and recommend seriously who goes to London, has an excellent location, in fact it was impossible to better, the rooms very clean and the staff was very professional and courteous. Expectacular have a service that will get to the airport in an executive car and the price is very much in mind in addition to having regard osx schedules of flights. We like a lot and whenever we will get back to London Marylebone in hotel.Parabéns management and staff of the hotel.",5,2011,04,07
123,gorgeous boutique hotel,"I stayed here with my partner for a night out in London -we arrived to a really warm reception by the staff and checked in swiftly.  The foyer was lovely with a colour scheme echoing the subdued yet cool theme which is synonymous of this brand (we also enjoyed a great weekend in The Bristol Hotel).

Parking was free as we went on a saturday evening and just parked in a free bay on the street - be warned of the one way system surrounding the hotel as it is a little confusing:)

The room was average size but larger than expected (after Bristol which was quite snug) with the usual flat screen TV and gorgeous bathroom with a power shower.  The bed was a double rather than king size but incredibly comfortable and we had a great night's sleep; eventually!

All in all a lovely stay at a cosy boutique hotel that I would recommend to anyone.  Only downside was the long queue to check out but that could have been avoided with less of  a lie in!!",5,2011,04,07
123,Worst hotel visit i have ever had!!,"My friends and i decided to book Marylebone Hotel after noticing the great Leisurley London offer which was £155 (vat not inc) for late check out and breakfast. There was a group of 12 of us with 4 rooms between us, 2 suites and 2 normal doubles. Of the 4 rooms only 1 didnt have to be changed! 
 
 The first suite had to be changed because they tried to offer a normal double with a put up bed, the second group were told they could only check in at 6pm so were given 2 rooms instead, the third room was changed due to a leak!!
 
 We then decided to relax and have lunch in the hotel bar, the food arrived without cutlery and we sat watching while our food turned cold for 10 minutes. In the end we thankfully weer not charged for this lunch as we had complained so much about the awful service. 
 
 One of the girls from our group noticed that quite a large amount of our laugage was left on the 5th floor unattended. When this finally arrived in the room there was a pair of (very expensive) shoes missing. One of our group also came back to her room after being out to find one dress missing and her bag emptied on the bed.  
 
 Some of the staff tried to help but generally we were made to feel like we were in the wrong for complaining. The staff were overall rude and in some cases quite aggressive. 
 
 On check out i asked if i needed to clear my card of the £30 they charged in case of using the mini bar and 3 people behind reception didn't know the answer.  
 
  I feel robbed of the money we spent to stay here and have never used Trip advisor but felt so strongly i had to warn people not to ever book this hotel!!",1,2011,04,05
123,"Great hotel, one quibble.","I had a very good experience with this hotel. It's location is great, it looks nice and is great value for money. The staff were also very good with one exception. I called to book the hotel to check that the Internet access advertised on the website was wi-fi and was quoted £200 per night as their best rate. I said their website had rooms for £165 and was told in a very off-handed manner that those rooms must be sold out. After the call I went online and booked the room at £165. Normally I wouldn't have bothered and would have gone elsewhere but I was keen to find somewhere in Marylebone.  Other than the reservations clerk, the staff were very pleasant and helpful.",4,2011,04,01
123,Very Impressed.....Highly Recommended,"Our stay at this hotel was nothing short of fantastic...The staff are so attentive without being overbearing.. The decor was absolutely stunning and the hotel was immaculate.The Marylebone certainly do not cut corners when it comes to comfort and service, and is ideally located a mere 5 minutes walk from Oxford St. We arrived later in the evening on the Friday having driven from Glasgow as our daughter was relocating to London. As you can imagine we were pretty exhausted by the time we got there.We stayed in a suite which was beautifully appointed and so comfortable boasting a king size bed and large bathroom..The bed was a little soft for my liking but in no way detracted from a very restful night .We had just arrived in our room when the waiter arrived with a pot of camomile tea which was very welcome after the stresses of the day. The next morning we went for breakfast which gave us a choice of Continental or full English. We opted for the full English...A breakfast fit for a King indeed..! The only downside was that we were seated in the semi-private dining room which was actually quite dark. After expressing our concerns regarding this it was resolved with a reserved table at the window in the main dining room on Sunday morning...Excellent and thoughtful service! ..All in all an absolutely wonderful hotel which is highly recommended for the discerning traveller wether it be for sightseeing or business.",5,2011,03,30
123,Great location in the quiet heart of the City,"Nice hotel only spoiled by the relatively small superior room and the bed which was just a double. Many more positives with friendly and attentive staff, nice public rooms. The bar was great for cocktails if a little pricey but I guess pretty much expected in such an exclusive locale. Marylebone village is a gem with lots of nice place to eat out and drink just around the corner and yet just 2 minutes from Oxford Street.",4,2011,03,26
123,"Perfectly situated, fantastic staff, and rooms not too tiny!","We travel regularly to London for business/pleasure and often stay in the Bloomsbury Hotel (sister hotel to this), which we love, but as the prices have been going up and a spotted a great online price for Marylebone, we decided to give the sibling a go.

It was a fantastic experience from start to finish. A friendly greeting from the doorman (sorry, didn't catch your name) who ushered me to the front desk. I was seen to within 3 minutes by the very friendly and efficient Elisa, and I was up in my room within 10 minutes. 

The room wasn't tiny - enough room for large bedside tables either side of the big, very comfortable bed, plus a desk, chair, easy chair and footstool, and a great LCD TV on the wall. I still don't understand the glass door concept into the bathroom (no matter how much I love my husband, I don't really want him seeing a silhouette of me on the loo!!), but nice compact room with rainfall style shower, posh toiletries (that actually smell nice!), one of the biggest hotel bath towels I've ever seen, and all the bits and bobs you could need (soap, tissues, cotton wool, ear buds, flannels, etc).

The decor is very subtle and contemporary but without being unfriendly. Although I would say bits of the room were looking a bit tired - bits of dust around the edge of the carpet/skirting board, scale building up around taps and shower head.

Tea & coffee facilities were average - only 2 of each tea bag and 4 UHT pots, so realistically only one cup of tea each... not great for my avid tea-drinker of a husband.

We were on an internally facing room, so the view isn't spectacular (unless you like looking at other people's windows) but at night you get absolute silence, so we had a perfect sleep on the very comfortable bed. Breakfast in the morning was absolutely fantastic. All the staff we dealt with (from the entry desk to the guy who got our tea & coffee) were absolutely fantastic, polite, efficient and quick, with a friendly smile that looked absolutely genuine. Could it be that these people actually enjoy their jobs? That's difficult to find in London!

Choice of food was absolutely immense - from smoked salmon, trout and mackerel to ham, salami and chutneys; cereal, muesli and porridge to pastries, bread rolls and jams; and that's before we even got to the fresh fruit section! There was an optional cooked food breakfast which you could order at a special counter and have eggs and the like cooked while you waited - the amazing thing was that it didn't spread the smell of fried eggs and bacon around the rest of the dining area. (I hate heading off from a hotel to a morning business meeting smelling of other people's cooked breakfasts!)

Oh, and free wi-fi everywhere! Perfect!!

All in all a great stay, and we'll definitely be back. Didn't quite get 5 stars in a couple of categories because of the ever-rising costs of all London hotels and the ever-so-slightly tired edges to a couple of bits of the room.",5,2011,03,17
123,Pleasant experience,"We stayed at the Marylebone Hotel as part of a Theatre break and were very satisfied withour stay included dinner in the hotel restaurant.We haven't given full marks for sleep quality because the bed was if anything too comfortable.At home we have a hard mattress and the mattress was soft,also the duvet,whilst looking thin was very warm.Luxury we are not used to!Everybody was very friendly and efficient.we shall stay again if we can",4,2011,03,14
123,Excellent deal in a nice location,"A real boutique hotel, in the spirit and in the setting. Very calm, comfortable rooms, free wifi, and a good service. The plac is modern and quite design, for a very reasonable price. Includes a bar and a restaurAnt and even a swimming pool unfortunately being redone right now. Definitely better, even for business than the big hotel networks.",5,2011,03,13
123,"Great location, elegant, pleasant staff, variable rooms, good value","We made another return visit to the Marylebone, for just two nights, and were generally quite pleased. 

The location is excellent, within a few minutes’ walk of seven Underground lines, countless bus routes and some of London’s most elegant shopping.

The public spaces are elegant, with an understated contemporary décor, which is continued into the (generally) well designed rooms. 

All the staff we met were pleasant, competent and anxious to help.

 There is free in-room wired and WiFi internet access and a small business centre – in which only one pc is connected to the printer (and it’s not apparent which one it is!).  

There is also a fitness centre and a swimming pool, although the latter is temporarily closed for refurbishment and replaced by access to a nearby facility.

We didn’t use the hotel restaurant, succumbing as usual to the temptations of nearby Marylebone High Street and its excellent range of eating places - try Paul for a genuine continental breakfast.

Room size and design can vary a lot even within price categories. On this occasion, we stayed in a ‘superior’ room (the lowest category) and while it and its bathroom were small this was compensated by thoughtful design, including good storage and lighting.  

Overall, this is a good four star hotel  but some of the rooms - while acceptable for short stay - fall short of this standard.  The discounted rates  - less than £200 per night - are quite good value by London standards",4,2011,03,10
123,Perfect!,"Just arrived from a 4-night stay at the Marylebone Hotel. Perfect hotel, excellent breakfast and above all, impeccable staff. On the first night we were on the 5th floor where there are some smoking rooms. Anna, at the reception desk, promptly found another room for the rest of our stay. Concierge, reception desk, waiters, room service, doormen....always very, very kind and attentive. Will definitely stay at the Marylebone next time and would strongly recommend it to anyone.",5,2011,02,28
123,"Initially very good, got better but ended in slightly less than perfect","From the moment we arrived we were impressed with the layout of the hotel lounges, bar, restaurant and the genuine eagerness of all the staff we met to help make our stay as happy as possible. In all honesty I have rarely come across hotel staff who really seem to be enjoying their job. This was a welcome exception.
The room allocated was perhaps a little smaller than I expected and although we had to maneouvre carefully around the bed when getting ready in the room it proved no great inconvenience. I may well have found it frustrating if we were staying for more than a couple of nights though. Anyone with kids may have some reservations for this reason, as might anyone with a mobility disablity.
It was refreshing to find a shower that was exactly that, ie not a bath with a shower built over it. I did have a minor calamity when the shower water didn't drain away down the floor level drain but built up against the door and of course through it onto the bathroom floor.
The bed was comfortable and the room was just right for temperature and Welbeck St isn't very busy so there was no excessively intrusive noise.
Breakfast was well presented and the staff were once again cheerful and helpful.
The evening meal was really a disappointment though. I had fillet steak at a pretty hefty price. It was absolutely gorgeous. It would be difficult not to cook one to perfection.That's what fillet steak is all about. The disappointment was due to the fact that everything that accompanied it was charged extra. Extra for a bowl of chips, sauce etc. The Lemon Tart was also over the top at (from what I remember) around £8.
A simple tart from M & S would have been just as good at a fraction of the cost.
I know that meals are a way of upping the profits from a decent room price but at these prices I would recommend a trip over to Charlotte Street, around 3/4 of a mile away to the east where there are a wealth of really good restaurants.
At around 5.15 am on our final morning the fire alarm went off.
There didn't seem to be anyone taking control of the situation in the lobby. A smell of smoke hung in the air and people were coming down but it took some time for anyone to explain that there had been a small fire in the kitchen and that everything was under control. I didn't notice any fire engine either. I always thought there was some sort of immediate response to hotel fire alarms.
We had asked for an early call for 6.30 so didn't get back to bed. Our day was filled with appointments visiting fashion agents and the Pure Exhibition in Olympia after which I then had to drive the 250 miles home, absolutely knackered with matchsticks propping my eyelids to keep me awake.
Personally I think we ought to be entiteld to a discount for the last night's stay which was so badly interrupted with the fire alarm.
Conclusion.
We generally stay in the Holiday Inn in Carburton St. 
Holiday Inn's are to hotels what Little Chef's are to Egon Ronay restaurants. 
This hotel gave a good impression and if they could get the prices right in the restaurant would do themselves no harm at all.
I would stay in the future as first choice, unless there's anything nearby that I find which offers the complete package at a decent price, ie room and meals.",4,2011,02,16
123,Fantastic,Stayed overnight this hotel is lovely great location great food and fantastic friendly staff we stayed in a studio suite cannot think of anything negative at all,5,2011,02,14
123,friendliest hotel,"The staff at this hotel are the friendliest I have ever come across. The staff in the dining room are great.
The front desk people were very friendly. The concierges are knowledgeable and the head concierge found me something very very difficult, and all with a smile and no fuss.He made my day ! Sorry, no more details available.
Next time in London, which is often, I am definetely coming back.
The location viz tube stops is not bad. Bond Street is the closest, taking a 5 minute walk.
The room is comfortable. The gym is good and there is free wifi. The ambience is set in in the lobby with a nice smell of incense.",5,2011,02,04
123,Wonderful hotel. Hope to be back soon.,"Had an excellent experience in an other Doyle Collection Hotel (The Bloomsbury) a year before. And was not disappointed by the Marylebone Hotel.
My partner and I stayed there for a long weekend and from the very first moment we felt welcomed and enjoyed every single moment.
The hotel is very good located for sightseeing and shopping activities. Just a short walk away from Oxford Street.
Rooms are rather small, but very nice and absolutely quiet. If you need to work, Wi-Fi is available with highspeed.
The breakfast is awesome! Large choice for all tastes.
But the most important - the staff: ALL of them are VERY friendly and always try to help wherever it is possible, which makes the stay in the hotel so enjoyable and relaxing.",5,2011,01,30
123,Simply the best!,"The experience of staying in this hotel was absolutely wonderful! It was made especially welcoming by the wonderful staff. I would like to specifically thank Ms. Michelle Alleyne from the Reservations Department, who is a perfect example of an utter professionalism, hospitality, and impeccable attitude.",5,2011,01,27
123,expensive average hotel,"great location, good bar and good room service. The rooms are expensive and dissapointing. Good for one person.  The shape of the rooms is a little awkward and general layout means alot of space is wasted. Cheaply decorated and you can tell",3,2011,01,26
123,Nicest hotel I've stayed in in London,"Staff charming and helpful, Room modern, comfortable, and well adapted (Ihave some disability) Restaurant food not haute quisine but good for hotel food and the service in the restaurant was impeccable. Front of house staff interested and caring.",5,2011,01,23
123,Very good but...NO CLOCKS!,"Let's start with the pro's.The Marylebone Hotel does a lot of things right. The overall look and feel of the hotel is very modern and comfortable. My queen-bed deluxe room was decently sized by London standards (albeit small by U.S. standards, and I imagine the regular rooms might be rather tight). All of the materials and furniture choices seemed high-quality and well thought out, especially the very comfortable bed. And it was so nice being in a London hotel with more than just 6 or 7 basic TV channels to choose from! I had around 30. I've found that to be a rarity, even in 2010. 

The bar and restaurant are very inviting, and many of the cocktails and wines were quite reasonably priced for a hotel in Central London. 

Staff were very friendly and courteous at all times, and although it's on a quiet side street, there always seemed to be a taxi or two out in front should you need one.

On the other hand: When I first got to my room, the first thing I noticed was that there was absolutely NO clock anywhere, not even on the TV! I presumed this to be a mistake, so I called the front desk to have a clock sent up. Imagine my surprise when the front desk manager sheepishly admitted that there were no clocks in any rooms, and none on hand for special requests!  She seemed to think this was made OK by the fact that they could give you a wake-up call. Well, I don't just use clocks for wake-up alarms - sometimes it's just nice to know what time it is when you wake up in the middle of the night in a new time zone! Fortunately I was able to get my mobile phone into a sort of clock mode to make up for it. But really guys - I've stayed in hotels from Hong Kong to Prague and never seen this in my life. Hopefully they'll rectify it soon! 

Apart from that, there was a slight water leakage problem in my shower - I notified the front desk on the first morning but they didn't repair it until my third day. 

Lastly, the location is equal parts good and bad. The area is lovely, with some great restaurants and pubs within easy reach. But there is no late-opening market nearby should you need something, and it's a solid 10-12 minute walk to the Bond Street tube, which can get a bit tiresome after a few days in cold weather! 

On balance though, I would recommend the Marylebone. Just make sure you bring a time-telling device with you!",4,2011,01,19
123,Heart of London,"The hotel was so central it was fantastic for dining out in the evening and when we wanted to go to a show.Free wi-fi in London is remarkable compared to other hotels I have stayed.
The staff were courteous and polite and seemed genuinly interested in my visit and how my stay was going each time I spoke to them.It was great to see a fellow Irish man working behind the desk and he always gave fantastic restaurant advice and was very professional each time I dealt with him.It seems like a very oiled and professional set up.

Looking forward to my next visit already.",3,2011,01,14
123,Still As Good,"We were back in the Marylebone before Christmas for a weekend and found that everything is just as good as before. It is so nice to be remembered by the front of house staff and you feel that the hotel genuinely welcome your patronage and appreciate your custom. We found a bottle of prosecco in our room on returning fron the shops and a note from the manager welcoming us back and wishing us a nice weekend.

If you are looking for a reasonable high class central hotel in London look no further.

Again this hotel amazes me with the way we have been treated on each occasion we have stayed there.

Go check it out for yourself. You will not be disappointed.",5,2011,01,12
123,Beautiful Hotel with Wonderful Employees,"We stayed at The Marylebone Hotel over the New Year and had a wonderful time.

The hotel, bedroom and bathroom were beautifully designed with lots of little seating areas behind the lobby. Our room was perfect and we were able to take advantage of the free WIFI which is so nice to find in a hotel of this calibre.

The location of the hotel is excellent, close enough to walk to Oxford Street and Regent Street in 10 minutes whilst still being on a nice quiet so no problems with noise.

All of the employees we met were incredibly helpful especially Niall at the reception and the concierge (I can't remember his name but he was French). 

Overall a wonderful stay and I will definitely be going back the next time I'm in London.",5,2011,01,05
123,The perfect London bolthole - I love it!,"I am staying here at the moment and love it!  The staff are amazing - they greet you and chat with you everytime you come in and out of the foyer, how often does that happen at a hotel in a large city?  They have also handled guests who have been stranded with the flight delays at Heathrow with great speed and found people rooms.

The place is always immaculate, and the Christmas tree and festive touches make it a perfect place to stay at this time of year.  

While the rooms are a little small, it is easily the best equipped room I have stayed at in London and they have lovely large windows with a great outlook over the streets around Marylebone.  The wifi works great and the breakfast included in my rate is lovely.

The gym is small but it is a temporary one while they refurbish the main one - still adequate and great equipment.

I will always stay here in London from now on, you should too!",5,2010,12,21
123,"fantastic service,friendly staff and great location","My husband and i stayed here for the first time and whilst i agree that the rooms are small they are tastefully decorated, well laid out and comfortable. The staff were so helpful and friendly - we got a call just after we checked in to see fo the room was to our liking. The concierge and doorman did their utmost to get us a cab to the ballet despite adverse weather conditions - they couldnt have done more for us. We ate in 108 and the food/service was tip-top. Everyone made our trip so personal and special. A BIG thanks to you all",5,2010,12,19
123,"Very disappointing service, mediocre room. Terrible dining experience.","I'm sorry to report that I've been particularly disappointed with the service I've received from this hotel. Last night I approached the concierge for a dinner recommendation. He clearly was unfamiliar with any restaurants in the area. After reading his computer for several moments, he finally approached another colleague to make a recommendation for me. Quite the opposite, this concierge simply told me to walk to the Marylebone village where I will find any restaurant of my choosing. Even when I asked him to recommend a specific restaurant, he just circled 10-12 restaurants on the map. Not very helpful.

I had a wake up call for 7am this morning. When I received my call, I asked the woman to give me another call at 7:45. But the phone kept ringing every 5 minutes. I finally had to call down to ask them to make it stop. And, last night around midnight I left my breakfast order on the door. When I woke this morning I checked to make sure the order card was retrieved - but it had not been.  The card clearly states to hang it on the door nob before 3am. I hung my at midnight, and it was still there this morning at 7:30. Happily, they were still able to get my breakfast to me before 8 so I was happy with that.

This is all very disappointing because otherwise the hotel is lovely. The room is very small even for london standards, but I enjoy the design. I especially enjoy all of the sitting areas in the lobby. I just wish the staff was more service-oriented. They are pleasant enough, but very unpolished for a hotel of this rate.

The gym is abysmal. Horrendous even. The carpets are dirty, the equipment is not in good repair. You feel like you are working out in a closet And - they have a relationship with the 3rd space. They say it is only a 15 minute walk - but its at least a 25 minutes walk. 30 minutes with holiday shopped on Regent Street. 

As for the restaurant: my dinner was also very disappointmenting. The restaurant was highly recommended to me, and I was looking forward to the fresh, local ingredients used by the kitchen.

As I was seated the, woman who seated me offered water but it never arrived. After reviewing the menu for approximately 15 minutes, no one arrived to take my order, nor to offer water or bread. Several waiters pasted my table and just looked at me oddly while they were clearing other tables. When I finally got a waiters attention, I told him I was interested in the 3 course meal and asked for some recommendations. He clearly was unfamiliar with the menu. He took the menu from me, proceeded to read the menu, and then said if I like fish I should get the pickled fish, as well as another fish entree. I made up my own mind (pork terrine and risotto). Again I requested water. The pork terrine arrived promptly, but still without bread. I sat there waiting to get someone's attention for at least 10 minutes. Waiters walked past and avoided eye contact with me even though they saw I had been severed but I was not eating. Its extremely unusual to server terrine without bread.

The food was quite good. I dont think it was particularly imaginative or creative, but it was traditional, expected, and well prepared. After finishing my meal, without exaggeration 25 minutes passed with dirty dishes in front of me until anyone approached me for more wine or water. I would have ordered pudding, but was thoroughly angry at this point. Even then, the waiter brought me my cheque and did not even bother clearing my plates until after I left.

It's very unfortunate that the food was quite good, yet the entire experience was thoroughly ruined by surprisingly poor service. I will not recommend this restaurant to my colleagues or friends",2,2010,12,14
123,Great location - such a shame about the room!,"This hotel is in a fantastic location close to both Oxford Street and Marylebone High Road and has all of the trappings of a really good hotel. My only beef - and it is of elephantine proportions - is the size of both the room and bathroom. We stayed in a 'superior' double (I discovered on day 2 that this is really their standard room). 

The room itself was nicely appointed but there wasn't enough room to swing the proverbial cat! The bathroom - or should I say water closet because it was the size of a closet with a toilet, basin and shower - was the smallest I have ever seen in over 40 years of travel!

The answer is simple - don't book a superior double if you really must stay in this hotel, but you would be much better off staying somewhere a little less central and getting much better value for your money.",3,2010,12,06
123,"The perfect central London hotel, discreetly stylish, luxurious without being ostentatious.","This was our second visit to the Marylebone hotel and everything that impressed us last year did so even more. The rooms may not bet large but are nevertheless nicely appointed with all that is needed and supremely comfortable beds. Our Suite was perfect,  chocolates, ‘bubbles’ and a hand written card that accompanied them really made my wife feel pampered – a ‘birthday treat’ to remember.

The Marylebone is that rare delight - a perfect  central London hotel, well situated, discreetly stylish, luxurious without being unnecessarily lavish let alone ostentatious, comfortable and welcoming with designer touches at every turn, from the numerous reception areas to the well-appointed bedrooms.  

The staff were all utterly charming, attentive without being intrusive and nothing seemed too much trouble, indeed the desire to ensure everything was just right was apparent from the moment we arrived to our departure after an excellent breakfast. 

Even booking it was a pleasure, it was quite clear this was an hotel where staff with personality and enthusiasm wanted your visit to be memorable.

The pool was being refurbished this time but in November it was of little consequence and an alternative was available 'locally' if required. Contrary to a recent review, the internet access worked perfectly all the time - not wireless (yet?) but with an ethernet ?! cable and various international plug sockets provided for ease of use with a stylish desk.

Marylebone itself has a very real 'village' feel to it yet is only a short walk to the West End and of course a huge array of dining establishments.",5,2010,11,29
123,Over-rated and not business friendly,"Was booked for a 21-day stay but was put into a shoe-box!  This is supposedly a corporate preferred hotel.  Like the other reviewer, will suggest that this hotel be removed from the preferred list.  Hotel managers are variable and very defensive.  Had an incident at the hotel where I dropped my wallet in the lounge (lobby internet worked but room internet was patchy at best).  Manager claimed that nothing appeared on the tape.  After the hassle of cancelling credit cards and making a police report, the wallet magically appeared in the room the next day.  I checked out of the hotel immediately.  My colleague who travelled with me concurred that this was one of the worst business hotels - ever.",1,2010,11,26
123,SUPER!! Loved everything about this hotel! 5 Stars!!,"Stayed at this hotel with my mother for two nights on the 5th of Nov.
We were greated by many staff members, who were just so helpful and friendly.
Elise, I think was the ladies name that checked us in and out, she is so polished at her job, like a diamond!! She upgraded us to a deluxe room, it was beautiful and so comfortable.
Breakfast was amazing, as was lunch in the bar, followed by a few glasses of champers!
One of the best things about this hotel, and there are a lot of great things, is the location, when you walk out of the hotel and turn right, walk straight for about 2 minutes, and you will see Debenhams, turn left at Debenhams, and you are right in the centre of things, OXFORD Street, Heaven!! Though the hotel is so so near the best shopping areas, the location of the hotel is in like a small little village setting, and I promise you will sleep soundly at night!! The bed was so comfy and we didnt hear a peek from the street!
I would like to thank all the staff who were on hand for us that weekend, each and everyone was as helpful and kind as the next.
We hope to return to The Marylebone Hotel soon.",5,2010,11,10
123,"Great hotel, superb location","Fab hotel, had stayed here before and wasn't hugely impressed so was offered complimentary stay in a suite. Suite was really just a bigger room and had a coffee maker, but was nice. Leisure facilities had closed since I was last there which was disappointing. Staff didn't seem interested - same as last time, but room service was good and not overly expensive. Really handy for Bond Street tube and Hyde Park.",4,2010,10,27
123,Sorry I don't rate this hotel.....,"I really do not agree with most of the reviews.  We just had one night here at the end of a 3 week european holiday.  It was our most expensive hotel as we just wanted somewhere to really rest before our flight back to oz.  We were upgraded to a 'studio suite'.....what qualifies this to be a suite i have no idea.  I thought a suite should have a separate living area even as a studio, it was quite frankly a normal room, slightly larger than a London standard type room.  If I had paid full price for this i would have been fuming.   It was most definitely in no shape or form a suite, studio or not.  We had to sit on the bed to watch tv.
Other problems....
- we had a baby cot booked which was not in the room upon arrival.  We called and when we got back from shopping it had been put in the room not even fully put together and a big double sheet for me to put in, no blanket, nothing.   All other hotels in Europe made the cot up with baby sheets, blanket, pillow and in 1 case even a toy.
-  NOISY NOISY.....my pet hate.  We could hear sniffing through the walls so basically we paid a lot for a bad night sleep and the next day we had paid for a late check out but couldn't get any sleep as there was so much noise of doors slamming and workmen on the roof.  A hotel this price should have soundproofed walls.
- the room was just so badly designed, typical minimalist chic hotel that seems to think they can get away with no extra comforts, no light in the hallway which may seem a small problem but considering that is where the bags are kept it was so annoying, we had to put our bags at the end of our bed on the floor with stuff everywhere so we could see in the bag.  So dumb and so easily fixed.
- 2 towels for 3 people.  It is the small touches like this that make a good hotel.  I mean logic tells you that for 250pound a night you don't want to share towels....note to management, if 3 people are booked in a room, then supply 3 towels, not exactly rocket science.

On the up side, amazing location, I wouldn't hesitate to stay in marlyebone again, just at a different hotel.
Also really nice concierge guys, really friendly and helpful.",2,2010,10,26
123,Brilliant Stay,"The staff were very friendly and always willing to help, the hotel was clean and presented well, the room was also very clean and had a great television the beds were very comfy, it was my birthday so they upgraded us and left some treats for us.
I would recommend this hotel to friends and defiantly stay here again when we come back down to London.",5,2010,10,25
123,"This hotel provides the best of all worlds for the leisure traveler with location, service, cleanliness and value.","The service provided by Guest Services Manager/Head Concierge, Rahim Ismail, was outstanding and very informative with regard to sightseeing and theatre tickets.  He was very patient with us and answered all of our questions.   His advice on where to go for restaurants and shopping was very good and true.  We found all the staff at the hotel, whether wait staff, desk staff, room staff, or bell staff, were very friendly and accommodating.  We would recommend this hotel to anyone.  Although our room was a bit tight with space, it was very nice and clean.",5,2010,10,21
123,Conveniently located - Service Excellent - Breakfast marvellous,"We stayed here with extended family, our room on book in was okay as far as a standard room goes but our other family member's room was too small for them but the staff moved them to a larger room immediately and they were happy.  We enjoyed the courteousness of the staff and the close proximity to everything was great.  One thing however I had my Apple Mac computer with me and their connection was not compatible for apple mac computers a bit disappointing though the Business Center provided free access to internet, it would have been better in my circumstances to be able to do my internet access from the room. I read an answer from the manager to another review where he said they will have free wifi at the end of this year - my experience is with a lot of hotels in Europe was that free access was fine but if you wanted to send or receive something then the internet would ""go down"". very dissatisfying.  hopefully this will not be the case at the Marylebone as I would recommend it to anyone who wants to go to London and stay in a lovely hotel in a great location.",4,2010,10,09
123,The Marylebone - close to perfection,"The Marylebone is a real gem: perfect location (at walking distance from Oxford Street, in the nice Marylebone neighbourhood), superb and very helpful staff , excellent food (with fingerlicking breakfast buffet)...., 
This is the second time in 3 months that I've been to the hotel and I will definately go back. Need I say more?",4,2010,10,08
123,"Fabulous, lovely, great!","We stayed here at the end of September whilst we were in London for a party, it was a last minute thing and we found the best deal on the hotels website. 
We booked a leisurely London package for one night in a studio suite. It cost us £235 plus vat, this included full english breakfast, 2 free cocktails in the bar, a London guidebook and a late checkout of 3pm. 
We had such a lovely stay, the room was just perfect, the bathroom nice and big with good sized toiletries and robes and slippers. The TV was good and the bed was so comfy I have not slept so well in ages.
The ground floor is like a rabbit warren with lots of lounging areas and little nooks and crannies for some relaxation and a lovely bar at the back next to the restaurant, which we didn't eat in so can't comment on the food.
The cocktails were great and we got 2 little trays of nibbles which was a nice touch.
The staff were all so lovely and we even had breakfast in bed, the sunday papers we ordered never materialised but that was the only hitch I can mention.
I would definitely recommend this hotel, top notch.",5,2010,10,07
123,Stylish Comfortable and Convenient,Loved the hotel. Chose superior room but bathroom was disappointing. Make certain you explore all facilities and eat in the hotel Their restaurant is amazing. It is the third time we have eaten there and it gets better. Plus it is reasonably priced. The head waiter who i believe is french really knows his onions! I wanted a low alcohol wine and he delivered. Very pleasant evening in front of fire with gin and tonic and yes we will return but will upgrade to better room with larger bathroom. Also try Cafe Luc in Marylebone High Rd. Only a 5 min walk. The Champagne Chicken is to die for.,4,2010,10,05
123,A wonderful stay,"We stayed here for one night early September and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. The hotel is about a 10 minute walk from Oxford Circus tube, less from Bond Street tube, and is therefore only a few minutes walk from Oxford Street shopping, Selfridges etc if that's the sort of thing you are after. But also, and this is its real bonus, if you leave the hotel by the bar door at the rear of the hotel, you are in a different London and in the 'village' of Marylebone, much quieter, obviously still touristy but a different vibe, lots of cafes and bars and a very pleasant, relaxing area to explore. Regents Park is also only a few minutes walk away for a bit of open space, but is also a good walking route to Primrose Hill, Camden etc
The Hotel itself was great, and above all the staff were wonderful, very friendly but not over the top, in particular the bar staff were lovely. Room, breakfast etc very good, but the staff and location made it for us. We left feeling completely refreshed and will most certainly stay there again.",5,2010,10,05
123,Somewhat Disappointing,"The people are friendly and helpful and the public spaces are lovely....but during our stay at the Marylebone- the air conditioner leaked profusely leaving water puddles on the carpet, the housekeeping did not  automatically ""restock"" boxes of tissue, shampoos, soaps when we had none (calls to housekeeping  either were not answered, or were ""lost"" ), the carpet could use a good cleaning and sheets were changed every three days. Also the pool was not in operation which is one of the reasons we booked this hotel. When we booked, Marylebone listed 155 BP for Superior Rooms, I think the problems in service and quality reflects the low price. They could not provide a ""four star"" experience as represented.",3,2010,10,03
123,"Best location, Clean & nice","We stayed @ the Marylebone Hotel for 6 nights with our 2 years old son.
Everything was perfect: service, location, room service, very clean.
But the room was too small for the 3 of us, perfect for couples or people travel alone.
Very unique design and atmosphere in the lobby, and also some beautiful business lounge.",5,2010,09,23
123,Fantastic location,"Terrific location in a nice neighborhood. Nice ambience in lobby area for sitting or having a drink/snack. Sevice at check in was very efficient. Room was nice, spacious enough with a nice bathroom. Concierge was not very helpful when asking for dinner suggesttions.
No wifi in room which is a negative too me,but they did have in lobby.",3,2010,09,20
123,"Very good location, quiet, clean and good service","A friend and I stayed at the hotel for 3 nights. We got a 2 beds doubleroom, with view towards the backyard. No complaints there, we hardly heard a sound from anyone else during our stay. Slept like a baby in the wonderful bed.

The service was excellent, everybody was friendly and serviceminded. 

The breakfast room was a littlebit crowded, but we were satiesfied with the breakfast buffet and got our coffee served at the table.  

2 mornings I tested out the gym, it's not so big, but larger than a lot of the gyms at other hotels. For jogging, stretching and lifting some free weights, it's enough. You can get a good work out. Clean towels and water supply gave. 

Location is excellent. Close to shopping, and amusement, but at the same time it's in a very quiet area. 

I will definately stay here again if Im going back to London. We got a good offer through Octopus Travel.",5,2010,09,19
123,A peaceful retreat in the West End,"I stayed at The Marylebone for 2 nights, a Friday and Saturday, this September.  I asked for a quite room and was given one facing internally, a good way from the lifts.  It was indeed very quiet so I appreciate the staff helping me out.  The rooms are quite small but this is central London.  The bed and pillows I found to be very comfortable indeed and there was a large, modern flat screen TV.  I asked for some laundry to be done with a one day turnaround and this was achieved perfectly with no fuss.  The room and hotel decor is fairly contemporary without being uber trendy.  The bathroom was very small, I would imagine with two people this would be a real squeeze.  But, it was spotless and new with a giant rain shower, so no complaints.  The building itself is fairly old, in Welbeck Street just north of Oxford Street, near Bond Street tube.  The location is handy for shopping and nightlife but Marylebone itself has a quiet, village feel to it compared to the rest of central London.  I did not eat at the hotel so can't comment in this regard.  All in all, I had two very restful nights here and wouldn't hesitate to stay again.",4,2010,09,17
123,Simply the best!,"This was an amazing hotel for service,location,room comfort in fact everything!
My daughter was attending a two day training at Harley Street and in the hotel business suite.
I was able to enjoy the great location a few minutes from Oxford Street and Bond Street tube and packed so much into the time I had on my own.It was a treat to return to such wonderful service from all the staff, comfy seating areas and a fantastic meal in the restaurant.The cocktails were pretty good to! Can't wait to return.",5,2010,09,15
123,I think i must have been unlucky!,"Having booked a hotel room in London at the beginning of August for a stay in September i thought i was well organised, unfortunately we received a phone call the afternoon before our stay saying that due to a computer error the hotel had been over booked. We were transferred to Marylebone Hotel as a replacement.
When we arrived the staff were very friendly and welcoming, our room wasn't ready and we left our luggage with them and went shopping. It is a very short walk to Oxford St, and you couldn't ask for a better location for a hotel. Upon our return our room still wasn't ready, however we were upgraded to a deluxe room, given a key immediately and our luggage sent up. 
I'm not usually one for complaining, but the bathroom was not the cleanest i have seen, everything looked old and tired, which surprised me as the website says it is a newly refurbished hotel. 
The guests in the room before us decided to remove the tv aerial from the tv and the wall, once we called reception to say the tv didn't work they sent someone up straight away who established the issue and they fixed it (much to my husbands delight!). 
The walls were very thin and we could clearly hear our neighbours arrive back at 1am and who then ordered room service at around 2am which also woke us up (not usually a light sleeper).
The staff were definitely some of the nicest i have come across but i just felt a little bit let down with the cleanliness of the bathroom and the noise.",3,2010,09,13
123,Wow! Amazing,"My husband and I spent 5 nights at the Marylebone Hotel at the end of August 2010.  It was spectacular!  The decor, the staff, the service, the food, the room - everything was first class.  The location is incredible - you do not get any more central, we could walk everywhere.  The staff were very friendly and helpful and we were made to feel very welcome.  The breakfast is amazing!  I don't think we will ever be able to stay anywhere else when we visit London again, we were well and truly spoilt!",5,2010,09,13
123,"Fab hotel, brilliant location, fantastic friendly service","Stayed here for a couple of nights and can most definitely recommend it.  The hotel itself is stylish and the staff are some of the most friendly & helpful we have come across.  We had one of the standard double rooms which according to other reviews are on the small side but it was perfectly fine for us, the bed was really comfortable and the room quiet.  The bathroom was clean & stocked with gorgeous Temple Spa toiletries, however I would say the bath is a little on the 'compact size'.  The only thing we missed from previous stays in Doyle Collection hotels was the Nespresso machine which didn't come with our room category.    The continental breakfast has a fantastic selection of cereals, cheese, meat, fish and pastries, the coffee was great and most importantly piping hot and the dining room staff are pleasant and attentive.   One other little thing, the hotel smells fabulous unlike others we have stayed in, inn the public areas they burn gorgeous fragranced candles, (so gorgeous in fact that I bought one to take home!)  We have decided that whenever we come up to London from now on we will be staying at The Marylebone.",5,2010,09,12
123,"Lovely hotel, lovely staff","We stayed at the The Marylebone Hotel back in May to be tourist in London after spending  many years working in London and not experiencing enough of the tourist attractions!  Booking was very straightforward and upon arrival we were met by very friendly welcoming staff.  We had a Suite which was fantastic. The room was well decorated and modern, spacious and quiet! The hotel is luxurious and has lots of lounge space and cubby holes to relax in, with a relaxing atmosphere.   All the facilities of a 4 star were available and because we were feeling lazy we ordered food in and the kitchen were able to facilitate for my wife’s gluten intolerance.  The hotel is in a great location for the west end, its only 5 or so minutes’ walk from Oxford Street and is right next to Marylebone high-street which is like a mini town in Central London with its own shops and eateries to explore.  All in all a great stay and would def return.",5,2010,09,06
123,"Good value, location and nice staff","Stayed for the first time in the Marylebone Hotel. Compared to most other hotels I've used when in London this is by far the best - great location just behind Oxford Street, nice staff (very focused on your well being) and very nice interior. Breakfast was also really good. All in all very recommendable.",5,2010,09,03
123,Been staying here for years - consistently good,"I´ve been staying at the Marylebone Hotel for several years during long weekend breaks and business stays in London. I love it.

Firstly the location is amazing. London is really just a series of villages, and this hotel is right in the midst of London´s very best village, Marylebone, with its fabulous array of restaurants, bars and independent boutiques. Yet within 5-10 minutes walk, you can be in Selfridges on Oxford Street (the world´s best department store) and the designer boutiques of Bond Street, while a 15 minute walk will take you into the heart of Mayfair or Soho or even the green spaces of Regents Park to the north or Hyde Park to the south.

The hotel had a major re-fit a few years ago, but has managed to retain its fairly intimate charm. The staff have always been very friendly and attentive (little touches like hand towels on arrival and free water bottles at check-out are great), the business centre provides free internet access all day, the bar is a great place to unwind after a hard day´s shopping or sightseeing and the restaurant provides a great breakfast (never tried it for dinner as there is so much choice locally, but it always seems busy in the evenings). There is also a gym and indoor pool onsite. Although these were closed for refurb during my stay , the hotel had provided complimentary facilities in a nearby health club.

Like most central London hotels, some of the standard rooms can be on the small side, but some of the larger deluxe rooms are excellent. I recently stayed for 10 nights and I was nervous about spending so much time in a hotel instead of an apartment, but our room was quiet, spacious and comfortable, with a king size bed, iron and ironing board, and full SKY tv package - it felt like home after a few days!!

What I particularly like is the fact that the hotel seems genuinely pleased to welcome you back when you return for subsequent stays. If you tell the staff that you particularly like your room, they try to accommodate you in the same room during your next visit. This really helps guests to feel comfortable. I´ve stayed in several London hotels over the last 5 years priced between £120 - £200 per night, and in my opinion, this is the best.",5,2010,09,02
123,"Nice hotel, excellent location","We had 5 rooms ( 10 adults and an infant ) The upgraded junior suite for one pair made it possible to have a meeting place for our entire party.  one of the rooms was quite small and would have been suitable for a single rather than a couple.  All of the other rooms were adequate.  There was a shortage of closet space as we stayed for a week.
We especially liked the lobby which has many corners, and as such, we did not feel we were intruding on others.
Concierge and desk personnel were pleasant and helpful.  Small touches such as bowls of apples on tables in the lobby added to a homey and elegant feeling.
Location is fabulous!!  Heart of London and yet you feel as though you are in a village.",5,2010,08,26
123,Absolutely amazing!,"Beautiful hotel, gorgeous decor, sumptuous surroundings, amazing location. It doesn't feel like you're in central London, and it doesn't get any better than this. There are cute cafes on your doorstep, but the food in their restaurant is delicious, so no need to go out. It is a bit expensive though.",5,2010,08,17
123,Great Hotel let down by in house service and chaotic breakfast,"On arrival we had a good welcome from  a friendly doorman who rushed out to the taxi with an umbrella as it was raining heavily.  Reception staff very helpful and stored our luggage until rooms were ready. 

Rooms were very clean, a good size although they were deluxe rooms and very well stocked.  However repeated requests for Tea Bags and extra milk were not forthcoming. One room was not ready at 4.30p.m. and did not have enough towels which despite requests never arrived. 

Breakfast was continental extra £4 for English, very unorganised too many guests for facilities, lengthy wait for clean dishes and croissants, tea and coffee luke warm toast very limp.
Good location close to Oxford Street with good quality restaurants nearby.",4,2010,08,09
123,The greatest hotel possible for our wedding night,"My wife and I stayed the Marylebone Hotel for our wedding night right after the wedding party had ended. The room was superb as so was the service, attention and cordiality of the staff. I definitely recommend this hotel. 
A special thank you to Anna who was our point of contact, organised the stay for us and at all times showed us great hospitality, customer service, professionalism and friendliness.",5,2010,08,08
123,Wonderful stay in the heart of  London,"I have stayed in many hotels in London but the Marylebone has surpassed them all.

Overall experience was fantastic and the staff were extremley helpful and friendly.
I would recommend this hotel as everything is on your doorstep.

A special thank you to Frederic for his hospitality and friendliness and restaurant tips.",5,2010,08,04
123,"Great hotel, great location, great staff: my new favourite place in London!","The Marylebone Hotel is perfectly located in the heart of London, just above Oxford street (3 minutes walking distance) and close to Portland Place and Oxford Circus (5 minutes by foot). And the vibrant James street is right behind. Close-by as well is one of the best sushi restaurant in London (Cocoro). The hotel yet is on the quiet Welbeck street in a nice and modern building.

Welcome and check in were pretty good and included a cold towel (quite seldom in London, but sooo good when it is hot outside). The lobby is very nice with a lot of cozy areas where to relax or have a discussion. On the other side of a corridor is the hotel's bar and restaurant. Nice atmosphere, good staff and very good food (I had there breakfast and dinner).

The room was nice and large (I heard the regular rooms are a bit small as often in London, but the immediate above category is just perfect), with a large and good bed, a flat screen TV, free wired Internet connection (wifi would be better though) and a couple of sofas. The large bathrooms had all the expected amenities (very nice products) one could expect. And in the small dressing room was ... a Nespresso coffee machine (quite a treat for the coffee addict I am), a minibar and the safe.

Wifi is accessible from the public areas although the connection is not as reliable as it should be... I heard they are refurbishing the swimming pool and gym area and look forward to see the result.

Staff was at all time helpful and attentive. And upon checkout, you are given a little bottle of water for the road...

All together a great hotel in the heart of London, definitively going the extra mile to satisfy its client! My new place in London!",5,2010,08,03
123,Good but......,"One night for wedding anniversary. Great location. Upgraded to junior suite which was nice. Hotel very trendy and smart but somewhat gloomy. ..... Well this is central London.  The room was great but the bath plug would not close so the long soak after a day on my feet was not possible, let alone the romantic bath for two!! Shower good but screen failed to keep the water off the floor. Reported plug problem 8pm but either not looked at or repair failed. Also given ONE bathrobe (to share??) with no belt on it! Mentioned both problems on booking out and girl very sympathetic and promised a call from the Manager.............we'll see??",4,2010,08,03
123,Lovely hotel with potential for greatness but not quite yet..,"I stayed for 6 nights in June on business.  Overall it was a pleasant stay and the facilities were very nice.  Great lobby and lounge areas – plenty of space and nicely decorated.

Room:
-  Was rather small.  I had the superior king on the 4th floor.
-  Closet space was very minimal – no dresser
-  Mimi bar was well stocked, pricey and it’s one of those automated ones so if you move it, you’ll pay for it
-  In-room safe was convenient and easy to use
-  Bed was comfortable but it was a twin pushed together to make a King. Separate sheets for each side of the bed. 
-  Real hair dryer in the room, not those cheap wall mounted ones. But weird.. the bathroom didn't have the right wall plug for the dryer so I had to dry my hair by the desk.
-  Robes, slippers, plenty of towels.
-  No coffee maker in room.  It has a water heating pot but was moldy inside.  Didn’t use it.
- No WiFi in rooms but has free hi speed connection in room. There is WiFi in the lobby area but the connection was very inconsistent.
	
Food:
-  Only tried the breakfast bar at 108 and it was great.  Lots of variety and tasty.

Service:
-  GREAT doormen.. all of them.  Friendly, courteous and just lovely.
-  Front desk – mixed.  Some were friendly and some seemed indifferent to customers.
-  Room service – was prompt and friendly service.
-  Cleaning staff – inconsistent.  My room slippers were removed few nights into my stay and never replaced. Toilet paper never replenished during entire stay luckily I didn’t run out. LOL.  Empty cans/bottles next to the garbage bin wasn’t taken away. Some nights towels weren’t replenished.

Gym/Pool:
-  They were closing the pool and the gym when I was there so didn’t get to use it.  Not sure how long it will be closed. May want to check with hotel if you were looking to use it.

Area: 
-  Lovely residential are with lots of dining options and shops nearby.  There is a Tesco right on Marylebone High Street behind the hotel so you can stock up on water, food, wine, etc.

It was a pleasant enough stay but for me if missed the wow factor.  I would stay again though.",4,2010,07,23
123,Great stay - definitely not the last one,"We had first booked a b&b, but the lady had a mixup with the days so we were having trouble to find somewhere nice to stay as it was in full Wimbledon period. Finally our credit card company booked us for 5 days in a room at the Marylebone Hotel. What a nice surprise. We couldn't be more thankful to the b&b lady for her mixup because we would never have been so spoiled there than at the Marylebone Hotel.

Friendly staff, nice quiet room - we were on the fifth floor looking over the roofs -, the food was nice, breakfast nothing to complain about. The best was the bar in the evening. The bartender mixed us cocktails which weren't even on the card, just on request when we wanted to try something different. Useless to underline that we visited the bar every night. 

The location is perfect, a nice walk to Oxford Street. The surrounding streets are nice, too, lots of shops and cafés and restaurants.

One evening we wanted to have dinner before going to the concert at the Royal Albert Hall. The staff did everything for us, even warned the kitchen staff ahead to be ready right at the opening so that we could leave on time.

All in all, we were very happy with this hotel and we will definitely come back here. I have already been in a few other hotels, even boutique hotels, in London, but none was so clean and comfortable as the Marylebone.

We can warmly recommend this hotel.",5,2010,07,23
123,excellent hotel,"I frequently stay at this hotel whilst on business in london, and can be there for up to 21 nights, the staff are always friendly helpful and welcoming. This is important when away from home for such long periods of time, quite happy to go to the bar and sit for a drink chatting with the staff, which is good when stuck in a hotel in winter. great for being city centre, can walk most places, and the staff great at telling you how to get around. Always happy to see the friendly face of Martin on arrival, and always find the reception staff so helpful. Never been disapointed with the rooms and even been upgrarded on several ocassions. Restaurant great, but great eating places within walking distance, would recommend St Christophers Lane. Had friends joining me on several occasions, and staff always make it even more special and push the boat out to impress. In general I would not recommend any other hotel in central london. ps the manager is superb.",5,2010,07,18
123,Marylebone Hotel is not as good as it was in 2009,"My wife and I stayed at the Marylebone Hotel in Nov 2009 and had such a good time that we thought we'd try it again. We stayed for 3 nights in July 2010 and were really disappointed this time ... One of the pair of elevators was out of order, which just made getting in and out of the hotel troublesome. The corridor had the stench of cigarettes. Once we were up in the room, we were disappointed about how small the room and especially the bathroom was. The carpet was stained. The whole experience was topped out by the fact that at check out the whole hotel computer system was down. This was once a great hotel. Shame about how much it has fallen ...",3,2010,07,12
123,"Great hotel, great location, great staff!","We really enjoyed staying at this hotel.  We chose it based on location, reviews and the fact it was a Doyle Collection hotel as we are familiar with them, being from Ireland.  The location of the hotel is excellent, just behind Oxford Street via James Street (this area has lots of nice restaurants).  The staff at reception were very polite, professional and were very knowledgeable and helpful when we asked for directions, recommendations for places to eat, tube stations etc.  We liked getting the warm cloths on arrival to freshen up.  The hotel itself is very nice.  Our room, while small, was very nicely decorated in a contemporary style.  We liked the decor of the hotel in general. Loved the low-lighting everywhere.  When we came back to our room after the first day, a voucher to have 2 cocktails in the bar was waiting for us, which was a nice touch and the cocktails were excellent.  We had drinks in the bar also but found them more expensive than bars in the area.  The restaurant in the hotel seemed busy but we did not avail of it.  We liked that we had access to free internet in the business centre.  We availed of the pool and gym (although the lift was not working to bring us there), the facilities weren't great but it is closing down so we guessed that's why, perhaps they will redevelop that space. Breakfast was very good.  All in all, I would recommend this hotel.  While it is not the cheapest, we would return again when treating ourselves!",5,2010,07,06
123,"Comfortable, Modern Central Hotel","A comfortable, modern hotel with larger than standard rooms ( for London) and easy access to Oxford Street, restaurants, attractions and business areas in central london.  Good Breakfasts and Bar.",4,2010,07,05
123,Terrible conference facilities spoil a high quality London venue,"I used the conference facilities at the Marylebone hotel for 3 days in June 2010.  Quite simply, nothing went right.  Early on the air conditioning failed and staff struggled to provide even cold water in what rapidly became 30 degree heat in the meeting room.  The hotel then provided noisy and ineffective air conditioning units which reduced the heat to about 29 degrees adding the noise of two washing machines into the conference room.  By the third day, the room's video projector started to shut down every five minutes during my presentation.  This, combined with the heat and noise, rendered the conditions insufferable.  The hotel's WiFi network was inoperable for all three days of the meeting forcing colleagues out to Starbucks to check email.  Staff were pleasant and apologetic but provided non functional room keys, forgot requests and did not rise above the situation.  The air conditioning failure may have been simple misfortune but the hotel's half hearted attempt to fix it rather than relocate our meeting was an error.  It is a high quality venue and a trendy, modern central London meeting place but the technical issues have to be addressed for a hotel of this standing.",1,2010,07,04
123,The Best Hotel We Have Stayed In In London,"We travelled to london to celebrate my brothers 50th birthday.My wife and i had stayed in the hotel before, but this was the first time for my brother and his wife. The hotel knew of the occasiont and the staff were all wishing him birthday greetings, much to his embarrasssment. The hotel upgraded their room to a magnificent suite with a bottle of chilled prosecco waiting for them. Needless to say we all shared this! The following night hotel also stood a round of drinks in the bar for all 4 of us.

We have stayed in many 5 star hotels through out the world but would not have been treated so generously in any of them, even the ones where we have stayed many times.

I have no hesitation in recommending this hotel in the strongest terms.

We will be back again and again.",5,2010,07,02
123,Fantastic Hotel.,"We are repeat customers of this hotel. Staying here a few times a year since 2001. It used to be Jurys Clifton Ford Hotel but has undergone extensive refurbishment and upgrading in the last year or so and is now one of the best hotels in London. Were stayed at other 4 & 5* hotels in London but always compare them to the Marylebone and always end up returning there on the next trip. Location - just of Oxford street and near Marylebone High Street is fantastic. Walking distance to lot and close to Tube station (Bond St). The hotel front is somewhat like an office block but the interior is so modern, spacious, clean and welcoming. Staff always very efficient and friendly. Breakfast is very good. Plenty to choose from and the breakfast room is spacious and airy. Access to Holmes Place fitness, spa and pool is a unique selling point of this hotel. Its not many central London hotels who have such a wonderful pool, spa, fitness facility. Returning again to London in mid August for a weekend and will stay at the Marylebone Hotel - as top class always.",5,2010,06,23
123,A good expirience,"Checking in to this Hotel was fast and easy, the ladies at the front desk where nice and happy to help. I originally booked a Queen Superior Room unfortunately the room was small and i upgraded to a Deluxe Room.
 
 THE GOOD:
1) Nice staff and willing to help
2) Rooms where clean and good bed
3) Internet comes with the room

THE BAD: 
1) The Location is far for some activities
2) The bathtub is small and the shower does not have a full glass cover so the floor gets wet. 
3) The rooms are small even with an upgrade
4) The rooms look alright but nothing fancy",3,2010,06,15
123,Excellent hotel!!,"We stayed at the Marylebone Hotel 4 - 6 June.  All the staff could not have been more helpful.  We were greeted with towels to freshen up and extremely friendly and helpful reception staff.  As we arrived at 9.30am we did not expect our room to be ready but reception said they would call us on our mobile as soon as it was available.  We went for breakfast in the restaurant, again the staff could not have done more for you.  The choice for breakfast is good and the food could not be faulted.  Our room was ready before we had finished breakfast!!!  Although our room was small it was adequate for us as we were only in it to sleep and change.  Cleanliness could not be faulted.

The hotel has a warm and friendly atmosphere and it is very serene with candles everywhere.

We shall certainly use this hotel again.",5,2010,06,14
123,Great stay in a fantastic four star deluxe Hotel in  central London,"The Marylebone Hotel is an amazing Hotel, I had the perfect stay! Hotel location is central, staff friendly and very helpful, the design and decor of both the communal areas and guest rooms are modern yet very elegant!!!! The hotel services are really nice including the restaurant, lounge bar and gym - swimming pool - spa facilities!!! At check in we have been upgraded to a studio suite complementary. The room was unbelievably spacious and so was the bathroom. I really would like to leave an extremely positive comment for Gunilla, the Guest Relations Manager, who has done so much for us during our stay even if we did not ask her to, she was great! This Hotel has exceeded by far our expectations and we will definitely go back!",5,2010,06,13
123,Excellent Hotel will always be our first choice when in London,"5 star service with a rooms and amenities to match. Ideal location within the West End.
Friendly professional staff who were only to happy to deal with our requests. We would highly recommend this hotel for anyone wishing to stay in the heart of London.",5,2010,06,07
123,Our best London weekend hotel stay ever!,"Although not the most attractive hotel externally once you have walked through the doors your into a different world! Check in was very smooth, efficent and friendly. Staff actually engaged in conversation and seemed to care. The deluxe queen we were given was lovely although it was two beds pushed together and not a true queen. However the beds were extremely comfortable! There is no wifi in the room and I couldn't get my laptop to connect to the broadband not for the lack of the hotel trying. Sebastian spent a lot of time trying to get it to work and even tried another room but it appeared to be my laptop at fault!

The room offered all the usual amenities but I was most impressed by the espresso coffee maker and also the decent size of the ironing board instead of the usual pop out of the wall job. The minibar was well stocked and excellent amenites in the bathroom although we found water pressure in the shower to be lacking much power.

The hotel also offers excellent gym, pool and fitness facilities which we made good use of. Room service was prompt and efficent. Breakfast in bed was lovely! Breakfast in the resturant was also excellent.

On the whole it was hard to fault but the friendliness of the staff and quality of the hotel and rooms was excellent.

Location wise it is also very good especially if you are familiar with London like I am.",5,2010,06,02
123,Nice Stay in London,"We spent 3 nights in The MaryLe Bone Hotel in London.
It's very Quite and confortably, with a nice staff. It looks modern and trendy, with large room with all conforts. Everything is clean. You can use a swimming pool and a fitness centre
The hotel is 5 minutes by feet from Oxford Street, and 3 from the nearest Tube station.",5,2010,06,02
123,Functional Austerity of exterior belies absolute sophistication of interior,"We chose the Marylebone based on several personal and written reviews. We had but 2 days in London so a central location was a must for us. Notwithstanding this hotel's excellent proximity in the central London tube and overground network, what a marvellous luxury it was to navigate the many local cultural and social hotspots on foot. 
With regard the hotel itself, the somewhat austere simplicity of the exterior was turned on its head upon entering the structure. We were greeted by an impeccably attired porter and staff, which all seemed to synch with the opulant boutique interior; A very clever design machine has been at work here!
Check in was seamless and a generous upgrade was gratefully received!
Our bedroom and Bathroom followed through on the design rigour; We had no fault to pick here.

On the morning of our return fight home we were alerted to volcanic ash activity in air space. This was an obvious concern to us in the context of getting back to young children at home. 
At this time I wish to note a sincere thanks to Gunilla and Marcus for their attentive and competent response. Despite our earlier check out time, they facilitated luggage retention and internet access throughout the day. When our flight was ultimately cancelled they were immediately proactive in booking alternative transport back to Ireland. We are thus extremely grateful to this Hotel for delivering in our hour of need.
I have no hesitation in recommending this hotel to all.",5,2010,06,01
123,Best in London,"I stay in London several times a month, and have tried several other apprently 5* hotels, and the Marylebone is far and away the best.

My pregnant wife came down at the last minute to stay with me, and the staff couldn't do enough for us. The rooms are elegant, stylish and extremely clean, the communal areas friendly and inviting.

If there is a better hotel in London for the price bracket, I have yet to find it!!

A big thumbs up.",5,2010,05,30
123,Amazing Hotel - Hit every single mark,"I really can't fault this hotel. Besides having a fantastic location, the rooms were really terrific and the service from the hotel staff was fantastic. It's the little things that really impressed me, from the attention given by the hotel staff upon arrival to the fresh fruit, water and complimentary bottle of wine in the room, free wi-fi, large tumblers for juice glasses in the restaurant for breakfast, etc...ok I digress but you get the point. 

The room itself was fantastic and the hotel has really has benefited from the stylish refurbishment the hotel underwent about two years ago. I also had a drink and some food in the Marylebone bar, which seemed to attract a really interesting crowd as did the restaurant.

Anyway, it's unusual for me to write a review....I've stayed in lots of nice places and haven't bothered, but I really felt compelled to recommend this hotel. It made my stay in London as stress-free and enjoyable as possible and I'll definitely be going back next time I'm back in London.",5,2010,05,25
123,I'd say this is one of London's best hotels,"I went to this hotel for my 1st wedding anniversary. We wanted somewhere central but not in a busy location where we could enjoy a romantic weekend and go out for shopping and dinner.  The Marylebone Hotel was perfectly located for us as it's in the heart of Marylebone and yet a very short walk to Oxford Street and the West End.  My first impression was the soft ambiance of the lobby.  The imposing design is contemporary and warm.  The staff were courteous and welcoming with genuine smiles.  The check-in process was fast and efficient.  
Our room was a luxury suite on the 6th floor, overlooking Marylebone Lane.    The room was presented beautifully with champagne on ice and the present I sent over previously as a suprise for my wife.  I was impressed with the fresh and modern design as well as the spacious layout.  The white leather sofa and large flat screen TV invited my wife and I to simply enjoy our room; so we ordered room service for dinner.  The food was delicious and fresh; the service suprisingly quick.  I ordered a burger, served with an avocado type salsa.  The chips were hot on delivery (one of my worries put to rest).  
Our sleep was uninterupted and pleasant and everything I'd expect from a quality hotel.
My wife ordered breakfast to the room but I decided to visit the buffet in the restaurant.  With breakfast made to order I enjoyed truly well-cooked hash browns and very good cumberland sausages.  The variety was excellent and I'd highly recommend it.  My wife, I feel, missed out on breakfast by not going to the restaurant.
Overall it was a fantastic experience.  We felt nicely hidden away but close enough to the west end to explore on foot.  The gently lit corridors and modern decor allowed for our perfect anniversary and we are really looking forward to coming back for many London city breaks.  There is no doubt that we will return to the Marylebone Hotel.  Strongly reccommend!",5,2010,05,24
123,Excellent Hotel in a great location,"Staff extremely friendly and helpful, hotel was clean and only a very short walk to Oxford Street, Madam Tussauds, etc, with a NCP Car Park just a few yards down the road and they offer a discount too,  will stay there again next month when we have to visit London.",5,2010,05,15
123,My place in London...,"Perfect location, small but comfortable rooms, fantastic breakfast and a very nice and professional staff...I think I've finally found MY place to stay when I'm travelling to London!",4,2010,05,14
123,"Excellent hotel, central location, will definitely return","We booked the Marylebone through Superbreak. Having not stayed there before we were certainly not disappointed. 

The hotel is a short walk from Oxofrd streed so in a great location. Its a modern boutique type hotel , which looks to be fairly recently refurbished. There are several relaxing lounge areas off the lobby, with lovely comfy armchairs and sofas, and lots of burining scented candles. The hotel staff  were genuinely helpful and friendly, and nothing was too much trouble for them.

Our bedroom was clean with flat screen tv, tea and coffee, and  toiletries in  the bathroom, with clean crisp cotton bed sheets. We also used the hotel's 'Virgin Active' leisure facilites with pool, jacuzzi, gym, sauna and steam room.A superb way to relax at the end of the day.

We dined in the hotel restaurant in the evening, and had the continental breakfast, again we were not disappointed by both the quality of the food, presentation, and helpful, friendly staff. 

We will definitely stay here again and will be recommending it to family and friends.",5,2010,05,02
123,Excellent Hotel in Fabulous Location,"Upon arrival we were greeted by friendly staff, checked in no fuss.  Room was smaller than our last visit but the refurbishment more than made up for it.  The location of this hotel and the surrounding area of Marylebone, we cannot recommend highly enough. Bonne Bouche (Italian) behind the hotel is worth a visit. We were on a Continental Breakfast package & the selection was fantastic, all tastes catered for & complimented by very friendly staff. It's a pleasure to stay in a hotel in which staff want to cater to your needs & show genuine interest in their guests. The ambiance throughout is relaxing & the lighting perfect! The offer of hot towels @ reception on arrival to freshen up & bottled water on departure was welcomed & a nice touch. Hats off to management. We'll definitely return for a third visit soon. Have recommended to friends & family.",5,2010,04,27
123,An absolute gem!,"My husband and I stayed here for three nights - 9-12 April as part of my 30th birthday celebrations. The whole experience from start to finish was superb. Every member of staff we encountered was friendly and polite and couldn't do enough for you. We were upgraded to a delux room which was big enough and had all the amenities we could possibly need. The location was excellent and we enjoyed the village feel of Marylebone, sampling various restaurants and bars in the area. We really liked the candles and lighting in the hotel - if you wanted more light there was a lounge and business area. The leisure facilities were ok but the pool was freezing!
The continental breakfast was one of the best we have had and set us up for the day. We got an excellent rate through Octopus travel so would definately stay here again if it was the same price. This is a fantastic hotel which, anyone who wants the personal touch should definately chose over some of the larger chain hotels.",5,2010,04,20
123,Pros & cons,"We booked a standard twin room for 2 nights in April and although there are lots of good points and a great location we wouldn't return to this hotel
Pros:
Beautiful, modern, good quality refurbishment but everywhere dark to the point of feeling oppresive.  The staff were polite and helpful with one exception.  The rooms were very clean with good quality bedding and towels.  Bathrobe and slippers were nice although far too big for us.  The power shower was good. Breakfast was excellent - a wide range of fresh food and good service.
Cons:
Our room was very small so that the twin beds were pushed together and felt more like one double bed.  If you book a twin room the chances are you don't want to sleep together! The bathroom was so small you couldn't reach the shower without shutting the door.  There was no bath.  Our room was so dark and overlooked by 3 walls of other rooms so closely that it was as if the man in the opposite room was in our room with us.  You couldn't undress without drawing the curtains even during the day with the lights off.  Most areas of the hotel, although beautiful, were very dimly lit and we were unable to read the newspapers offered, although neither of us need reading glasses. There was very little natural light to be found anywhere in the hotel.  Although the low lights might offer the right atmosphere for a romantic break they are not useful for anyone  wanting to read or see what their make up or clothes look like!

If the rooms were bigger and lighter I would definately return but as there aren't I wouldn't",3,2010,04,18
123,Good location,"Stayed at Marylebone hotel for a long weekend, it was in a good location in a back street but not far from oxford circus and Bond Street for shopping etc. We found the hotels decor nice and modern but will say the lighting was a bit low and with not many windows along the corridors, made the hotel seem a little bit dark. Needs to be brightened up a little as corridors leading to the rooms are decorated with chocolate suede walls and dark striped carpet. The corridors all look exactly the same and with it being dark you can lose your sense of direction. 
We did look at the pool area but didn't use it as we were so busy sightseeing. From what we saw it looked lovely but found it odd to have the changing room facilities on the floor above, therefore having to get changed then walk a flight of stairs to the pool, not a good idea with wet feet. Not the best pool and facilities we have experienced but wouldn't disregard it for this reason. You have to remember its a city hotel and not many have a pool anyway unles you pay the earth. We chose to have a junior suite but unfortunately the view was of 3 other walls where other rooms were situated. This didn't really faze us as not much time was spent in the room, just would have been nice if the room was lighter. Staff on the whole were ok but the concierge not as good as we have experienced before. On the whole a good location, reasonably priced for what you get with happy friendly staff.",3,2010,04,14
123,Very good hotel if you get a good price,"This is a first class hotel and the doormen at this hotel are amazingly nice and we were very impressed with them. You could ask them anything and they would smile and have the answer. Booked this hotel through Last Minute secret hotels and got a very good deal. The rooms are very good, nice and very modern and it´s only a 10 minute walk to Oxford street. The only problem was the noise issue because there were some drunk people passing by our door on Saturday evening and it kept us awake for a while, but this happens in every hotel unless you stay at The Ritz I guess. Breakfast was not included and we had to pay for it but it was good, although a little expensive for what we wanted to eat. Mini bar prices were a bit expensive too for our budget so we did not use it. Just remember when you check in to make sure that you get a room far away from the lift!  Also on the way to Oxford street, you´ll come a across a very big Steak House and the food is excellent and very reasonably priced for London and also a Lebanese fast food which was excellent value. Try their home made macaroons. Melt in your mouth magic!",5,2010,03,31
123,Great hotel in perfect location,"I stayed here at the weekend with my mum and 2 sisters we had 2 twin rooms, 1 on 4th and 1 on 6th floor. We were upgraded to junior suites and they included full English breakfast rather than the continental we were expecting. The rooms were spacious and modern with usual facilities, one slight disappointment was that there was no 'normal' tea in the room just herbal ones but there was a posh coffee machine which made up for this.
The hotel is ideally placed, we got off the tube at Bond St into the madness of Oxford St on a Saturday but just a few minutes walk and we were on Welbeck Street which was really quiet, in the other direction is Marylebone High Street with its great shopping and eating.
There are planty of places around the hotel to sit down and meet people and even a TV lounge which you rarely see. There is also a gym and pool but unfortunately we didn't get chance to try this.
We had pre-dinner drinks in the bar and the service was friendly and efficient, we were given olives and nibbles with our drinks which was a nice touch.
The staff at the hotel were all really helpful and freindly and printed off a map of local markets for us on Sunday morning
Beds were comfortable and rooms quiet just one little moan and that  was the noise from the showers in nearby rooms but apart from that was very quiet .
All in all it was perfect for our weekend break",5,2010,03,22
123,Nice but request a room away from the street!,"This hotel is ovely. Lots of little alcoves and lounge areas. The decor is lovely with a boutique feel in a large hotel.
The room was nice although the bed was not very comfortable.
The room we had was at the very back of the hotle o the 1st floor. We were woken very early with noise from dustbin men and people outside the hotel. The room was not very wel sound proofed either with alot of noise from the floor above and other rooms being heard easily.
The Breakfast was nice with a large fresh choice of food.
The Staff were friendly and helpfull and it is ust a 7-8 min walk from Bond street.",4,2010,03,14
123,Great place to stay,"Spent a week-end in this lovely hotel in Feb 2010 , reception staff were very friendly and gave us a great welcome. Hotel room was lovely , Locaation was excellent. eat in the bar food was good. 10 out of 10 to all the staff they exceeded our expectations. Would return in a heart beat.",5,2010,03,12
123,We will definately be returning....,"we always make at least one visit to London per year. I always use Trip Advisor prior to booking.This time we were on a budget and when I secured a double room here with brekky for under £120 I grabbed it. I normally stay at one of the hotels in the top 15 ratings so i was nervous regarding the standard. I needn't have been !! It was in a fab location, love this area. The room was more spacious then other  expensive hotels. It was clean, warm and a beautiful quality. Yes , the bathrooms are small, but have a great shower, fluffy towels. robes and slippers. Everything you need is provided.
We had the included continental brekky which was ample and fresh. My only criticism was though offered varied coffees , there was quite a wait for them , but we weren't in a desperate hurry but a nice gesture and great value as included.The staff were friendly and efficient and on departure given water to see us through our day. We left our cases and had a fantastic day , really helped by a quality hotel. Next time will stay longer and use the leisure centre provided. Should be higher on the ratings !",5,2010,03,08
123,"Location, Location, Location","I got the room with breakfast for £150 per night and although I was a solo traveller the price would have been the same for two.
The location is very convenient being only minutes from the centre of Oxford street, yet Welbeck street is very quiet at night and a good sleep is guaranteed.
Nearest tube (Bond Street) is just under a ten minute walk away and the hotel is easy to find once you have 'googled' it beforehand.  Door to door cost from me from Heathrow by tube was £4.50.

The bedroom, while small had everything required and was very well appointed and clean.
The hotel was well refurbished about a year ago and it shows in every detail.
The lounge beyond reception is a very nice comfortable place with lots of chairs and couches to choose from.

Breakfast served in the very comfortable restaurant was cold buffet (hot food costs extra)and was excellent and plentiful with a superb and friendly service.  Front of house staff are genuinely willing to assist.  Reception staff were lovely, doormen, very friendly.
The business centre has two internet terminals.  The Leisure centre in the basement is a revelation and a great place to chill out in the evening. Staff there also very friendly.

There is a good hotel restaurant there with a varied menu but I did not have time to eat there.",5,2010,02,27
123,Remarkable location,"We had an extremely enjoyable stay in this hotel over mid term break. The only two complaints I have are that the times when children are permitted in the swimming pool are very inconvenient and don't suit a family who are out sight seeing all day. We were informed that we could use the pool between 15 h and 18h on Saturday and Sunday during which time we were at a show and on the London Eye ! 

The other complaint I have is that the restaurant web site ( 108 bistro)  contains a children's menu which did not materialise and  neither the restaurant manager nor the hotel manager seemed to have heard of. As a result we had to eat in the bar one of the nights. I never got a reply to my query about the children's menu.  In addition when we asked for restaurant recommendations locally, we specifically asked if there was a branch of GIraffe and were told no. On a walk about the next day down Marylebone High Street, we came across the branch of GIraffe we were looking for and several other restaurants. The only recommendation that the concierge on duty could make was the chipper across the road. I am told it is an excellent chipper but surely they could have come up with better recommendations !!

The location was faultless for walking to Hamleys and Oxford Circus. The hotel appeared spotlessly clean and the staff were charming  - particularly the door keepers.  The continental breakfast was pleasant but the full English wasnt great and bearing in mind the location, if you are on a room only basis I would save the money and have breakfast/brunch in one of the many pleasant eateries on Marylebone High Street.",4,2010,02,25
123,WOULD RECOMMEND THIS HOTEL.,"Just back from spending a night in this hotel with my daughter.   The staff are very friendly and helpful and overall there was nothing to fault.   The room was a little small but fairly typical size for London- it was nicely decorated though and the shower was excellent.    It is nicely located and the street has a nice atmosphere , it is about a 5 minute walk to Bond Street tube station and just around the corner from Marylebone Hight Street which has lots of shops and cafes.",5,2010,02,19
123,What a great hotel WOW!,"Have just come back after spending the Week-end in the Marylebone Hotel and from the moment we arrived it was amazing... We were greeted by the doorman who was very friendly. The reception staff were very professional and extremely friendly (there were 2 young ladies and i am sorry i didnt get their names) they could'nt have been more helpful, they pointed out on map where we were and how to get  to different places. We were taken to our room by one of the young ladies , and i was really impressed with the room. the bar food was great, as was the breakfast. We came back to the hotel on the first night to find hot chocolate in a flask, with biscuits, in the room , WHAT A GREAT TOUCH!! 
I would Recommend this hotel and will def, stay here again.",5,2010,02,07
123,Brilliant Hotel,"We booked the Marylebone for a long weekend in London after an exhaustive search. When we arrived we were welcomed by the doorman and from that moment the service we received was exceptional, we booked the cheapest room through a booking agent and the room was excellent, we were on the front of the hotel but there was almost no noise from the road and the hotel is in a quiet residential area, but only 5 mins walk from Bond Street tube and Oxford St. The food was very good too. The staff are always aware of you and you only have to blink and someone will appear asking if you need anything. I had forgotten to pack my ipod charger and asked at reception if they could help, expecting a no sorry, but they did indeed have a charger although i had to leave my ipod with them. Fantastic. All in all a fantastic Hotel and we will return.",5,2010,02,01
123,I'll Stay There Again,"A great place to stay in London, just 5 mins walk from Oxford Street and Bond Street tube, which meant no taxis for us!  :-)  As has been stated in previous reviews, the rooms are not the biggest but they are clean and well decorated.  We stayed for 3 nights to do some shopping and to see a show and when we arrived we were upgraded from a superior room to a delux room.  A big thank you for Sarah on the front desk for the warm welcome, including warm towels!  Again, as has been stated previously, the breakfasts were a little chaotic which did result in us waiting 15 minutes each morning to order tea and coffee, however there was a great selection of food on display to keep us occupied.  We did also eat one night in the restaurant (make sure you print a voucher from their website though!) which was very tasty and the restuarant was quite busy, but there are plenty of other places nearby so it is worth having a wander around.  The gym is a Virgin Active gym located in the basement and is a great option to have should the weather be miserable or to relax after a heavy days shopping!  

Finally, upon checkout we were offered 2 bottles of water for our journey home, I shall definately come again.  My final tip though would be to shop around to make sure that you get the best possible price!",5,2010,01,20
123,Another enjoyable stay atthe Marylebone,"Stayed at the Marylebone Hotel in January 2010 for my 5th visit in 2 years - found the hotel to be first rate again. The hotel is a 5-minute walk from Oxford Street (& Bond Street Tube Station) in an attractive looking street. 

Bedrooms are decorated to a high standard and very clean, my room on this visit was larger than usual with plenty of space, a small but well-finished bathrooom, flat screen TV with a reasonable selection of channels.

The hotel reception area has nice reception and lounge areas. The bar there is good with quality bar food available. There is a taxi rank outside the hotel.

We did not make use of the pool facilities. 

Housekeeping staff were very helpful as were the porters and bar staff.

Will stay here again",5,2010,01,15
123,"Lovely, well positioned hotel with excellent, friendly service","Travelled to London to take in the sales and a show.  This hotel is very well positioned for both Oxford Street/Marylebone and not far from the West End.

Reception/Door staff were very friendly and helpful, providing fast and efficient service.

The room was clean, tidy and well-appointed, and a standard size for a double room in London.

Breakfast was a bit chaotic as the restaurant staff were very busy, but the continental breakfast was delicous with a wide choice of options which kept us occupied until the coffee/tea arrived.",4,2010,01,15
123,"Location, Staff, Rooms....All fantastic","i recently travelled to London with my mother and my sister on our annual shopping trip and stayed in this hotel. It is very well located, just behind Oxford Street and within walking distance of many fine restaurants etc.  The rooms are not huge but they are very beautifully decorated, modern and have the most comfortable bed that I have slept in for a long time!  The main thing I have to say about the hotel is that the staff were extraordinary, very helpful and very polite. I would particularly like to thank the lady on the front desk whose name was Anje (Excuse the spelling if it is wrong!), she has to have been one of the nicest hotel employees that I have come accross and made our trip very special by her warm welcome and sad farewell. I will say that I will be back and I can't wait!",5,2010,01,14
123,"Friendly, Cozy and Centrally Located","The Marylebone Hotel is warm and inviting--from the doorman, to the candles lit in the lobby, to the down comforters in the rooms.  Rooms are small, but that's London.  Rooms are very clean and made up daily.  I appreciated the in-room safe, bathrobes and fantastic fitness facilities.  The walk to Oxford St. and Bond Street tube station is about 5 minutes.",5,2010,01,12
123,"Great location, rooms variable, service variable","We stay in London 5+ times a year.  We go here as often as anywhere because of its location.  Marylebone High St is nearby - a village in the centre of London.  One of my favorite places.  .Oxford St and all of the West End is on your door step.  Despite the central situation, it is still relatively quiet.  It is this location, that generates the 4 stars.  Rooms can be variable, it is hard to differentiate between the different room classes, and the hotel staff don't seem to be very clear on this.  Some rooms have showers, others baths.  If this is important to you, specify.  Some rooms are larger than others, but all are adequate.  Some rooms are on main corridors, with much passing traffic, others are quieter.  If a good sleep is important, you may want to be quite specific, if you are able,  Some staff are absolutely fantastic, others say the right words, but have no sense of actually meaning to friendly.  Not a complaint - just an observation.",4,2010,01,11
123,"Perfect hotel, great location","We traveled to London for a short 2 days shopping break and since time was scarce, location was of highest importance when searching for accommodation. The Marelybone was a perfect place for us, located 2 minutes walk from Oxford Street and thus in the centre of the shopping district. We also had walking distance to very nice restaurants in the neighbourhood. If I were to pick on anything it must be the size of the room, which was not too bad London style, but still not exactly spacious.
Highly recommended!",4,2009,12,22
123,"Excellent location, good price, great Staff. Room clean and compact.",Do Not book with Travco or Hoteldoorman.com as our flight was cancelled and I tried to contact them and they would not reply to me.  Obviously will never use them again.  They booked us in as 1 adult and 1 kid and we only got a double bed and had to trouble the hotelstaff for a small bed.  Our stay here was very pleasant except for the fact that a pool was advertised and our child couldnt avail of it before 3 o clock which isnt much good when you have to vacate the room at 12 am.  Excellent location for Bond & Regent & Oxford St and the sightseeing.  Very good breakfast and service.  On checkout the concierge offered to take our bags until we left for the airport.  Great service.,4,2009,12,21
123,disappointing,"Travelled with my husband for my birthday, had to organise babysitting for four kids so was really looking forward to a break away.  I was lucky enough to have had been given hotel vouchers for my birthday.  I had booked a superior room so was really looking forward to space and luxury!  The room was not ready in time so we were told that were being upgraded.  We were told she couldn't describe how to get to room but follow the corridor until we could go no further and then go upstairs. The room was an attic room and felt cramped and totally removed from everything, couldn't sleep with rain belting off skylight in bathroom . They could not find vouchers we had given at check-in, eventually found them but took 15 mins to check out and no apology for delay. Won't return",3,2009,12,08
123,"Great Hotel, Good Location","The hotel is lovely and has a feel of luxury all around, from the reception staff offering you a wet face cloth to freshen up on arrival to the corridors lined with velvet wallpaper. We were up graded to suite from a standard room and were suitably impressed, the rooms were spotlessly clean and included, hair dryer, iron and ironing board, expresso machine plus a kettle, large flat screen TV and good quality miniature shampoo, conditioner, bath/shower gel and moisturiser. The hotel is in a good location, less than 10 minute walk to Regent's Park or Baker Street tube station. There were problems with the tube service while we were there so we also took taxis'. To the London Eye a taxi cost between £10 - £14, getting a taxi home from Leister Square was also difficult with all the crowds of people, but ended up only taking 20 minutes to walk. The hotel bar has a nice relaxed atmosphere and serves good wine and whisky. The pool is quite small, but has lanes if you would like to swim and there is also a gym, sauna, steam room and Jacuzzi. I would defiantly stay at this hotel again.",5,2009,12,07
123,"Great location, good service, comfortable, variable rooms","We returned to the four star Marylebone in November, for six nights in two trips, and were generally quite pleased.  The property has an excellent location and the recent refurbishment provides elegant public spaces and (generally) well designed rooms in an understated contemporary décor.  The weekend rates are really good value.

All the staff we met were pleasant and anxious to help and the overall impression is that the team is trying hard to please.  There is free internet access, WiFi in public areas and a small business centre.  There is also a fitness centre and - unusually for London -  a swimming pool.  

We didn’t use the hotel restaurant, succumbing to the temptations of nearby Marylebone High Street and its excellent range of eating possibilities and breakfast offerings.

Room size and design can vary a lot even within price categories.  On one occasion, we stayed in a ‘superior’ room (the lowest category) and while it and its bathless bathroom were small this was compensated by excellent design, including good storage and lighting.  On the other visit, our larger and more expensive ‘de luxe’ room had practically no storage (but it did have a bath and a Nespresso machine).  We turned down an upgrade to a mini suite because of its small bed and poor lighting.

Recommended but check your room meets your needs before accepting it.",4,2009,11,27
123,"A lovely hotel, friendly staff and a great location!","My husband and I were fortunate enough to stay here after winning a competition and the staff treated us like royalty!  We checked in about mid-afternoon after exploring London and braving Regent Street, and the check-in staff and concierge were some of the friendliest hotel staff that we have run into in ages.  Nothing was too much trouble for them and when we saw our room, we were amazed at the size!  To be fair, we wound up in a suite, but it is definitely worth staying in one if you have the chance and the money.  The bathroom was huge for a London hotel, with a separate bath & shower.  The bed was enormous and very comfortable, with the room topped off by a very nice tv. 

We also had cocktails and dinner at the hotel, which we would definitely recommend.  The cocktails were lovely, though pricey - expected in London though!  We had the 3 course meal, and definitely felt like we got our money's worth for it, with the lobster bisque and the steak, not to mention a lovely cheese board.  The wine list had a good variety as well, with a range of price points to suit most budgets.

The only downside we could find to the hotel was the fact that they don't have wifi, but I imagine that's down to the building materials in the building; we were more then happy with the internet connection using the ethernet cable.

We would definitely stay at this hotel again due to the great service and great location.",5,2009,11,25
123,Great location but tiny rooms,"This hotel is in a great location for shopping and theatre land. The public areas and breakfast are excellent and the staff were very polite and helpful.
I have to say though that the rooms are the tiniest I have stayed in in London. It literally was not possible for two people to move around the bed or bathroom without having to pin one'self against the wall. I would say  our ""superior"" room  was a single room with a double bed in it . All very clean and nicely furbished though",3,2009,11,23
123,"Clean,efficient and well located.","We were booked elsewhere but were let down at the last moment. I have no complaints as we thoroughly enjoyed our time here. The staff were polite,efficient. the breakfast was excellent as was the decor.",4,2009,11,23
123,Need a better concierge,"This newly renovated property has a lot to recommend: great location, clean rooms, delicious breakfast, modern decor.  The concierge services however were lacking.  I called in advance to ask about restaurants for dinner - the recommendations were a restaurant that was CLOSED DOWN, the hotel restaurant (we went - it was deserted).  Our taxi for the airport was incorrectly ordered.  They don't have local maps handy at the front desk, and so the directions are pointed out on a big city map that doesn't show the small details.

So - I still say ""yes, go"", just beware of any advice or reservations made by the concierge.",4,2009,11,15
123,Strongly Recommend,"We just spent two terrific weeks at the Marylebone.  Given our lengthy stay we were upgraded to a suite.  (I had read about the small rooms and bathrooms.)  We had a great deal of space and a large bathroom with shower and tub.  The included ""continental"" breakfast was generous.  And the staff was very helpful and gave us excellent restaurant suggestions.  The only problem we had was the fire alarm, which went off twice in the middle of the night!  They are having trouble with the system but were apologetic.  The hotel has an excellent restaurant and lively bar.  It also has several common rooms for reading, etc..  All are attractively furnished.  We did not use the fitness center but looked at it.  The pool was very nice.  Use of the business center's computers and internet was free as were local phone calls.

The Marylebone neighborhood has everything in the way of shops from Selfridges Department Store to fine boutiques and over 200 restaurants.  It also is close to the Bond Street Underground station.",5,2009,11,13
123,A Happy Greeting,"I don't know if you are the same manager that used to be around in the mid '90s, but when I was in the hotel there was a very nice door man that would extend the largest smile you have ever seen to customers on their way in.  It reminds me of how the little things can cover other issues.  No place is perfect, but I used to enjoy just sitting and relaxing with tea or a drink in the lounge downstairs and the staff would usually have the tele on and I would catch a late movie or whatever.  OF course Welbeck Street is full of history and if you dig hard you will find out that Paul McCartney would hang out with Jane Asher just around the corner on Wimple Street at her parents house and wrote a song or two there.  Back to the Clifton Ford: that is how it used to be, and I have to be honest and say that I am not in to modern decor, so if you decide to go back to old ""English"" style you will not disappoint me as so many hotels that looked so great many years ago, (a few department stores as well; Harrods for example) look no better than a cored out shopping mall or Disco in Essex--The Cumberland Hotel is another example, so things are not what they used to be, the refurb does not suit me but that said, the staff were and are ever friendly.",5,2009,11,11
123,Great Location,"Perfect location in London. The lobby & bar area are very nice. The rooms are nice, but the bathroom was tiny.  The carpet on the corridor we stayed on was dirty.  The pool area which is open to the public was ok, the dressing area could have been cleaner. My husband had checked in the day before and he had informed the receptionist the morning of my arrival that I would want access to the room and gave them my details as we dont have same surname. Upon arrival i was told i could not enter the room as i had no id with my husbands surname.  They did offer me use of a different room to freshen up but as my husband had brought some of my luggage with him this was of no real benefit. It was fairly annoying as I had to wait for 6 hours for my husband to get back from work.  I would stay again as long as i got a good rate but would request a room with a larger bathroom.",3,2009,11,09
123,give it a miss,"Can't say anything good about this place. My husband contacted the hotel twice in advance of our arrival to confirm that we would be assigned adjoining rooms as they had no inter-connecting rooms and we were travelling with our children. When we arrived after a long day of airports etc. we were told as rooms were assigned on a day by day basis they could not accommodate our request as they had nothing available that fulfilled our requirements. Our annoyance was compounded when we were asked by the manager who we had spoken to as they were not in a position to have offered us such assurances!  It was only when it became apparent that this was unacceptable that they finally conceded they would work something out. The room we were assured would be ready when we returned that evening from a West End show. 
On our return, our children's room was not ready and housekeeping was not available. Again, only after repeated phone calls and the threat of a scene in the lobby was the doorman sent up to do a job that clearly he was unprepared for and ill equipped to do.  In addition the hotel was overheated to such a degree that several of the guests remarked on it and the air conditioner in the children's room did not work, but made plenty of noise.
The dining room staff were charming and the breakfast was good, even so we decided to  leave two days early and find a different hotel.",1,2009,11,08
123,My Fav Hotel,"I stayed here a lot both before & after the refurb..
Since the refurb I love this hotel. Great location, Great decor & London is a great place to go.  What more could you want??!! 
The Marylebone or Clifton Ford as I still call it, is my favourite place to stay in London.. 
Alot Quiter than other London Central Hotels which is a plus..",4,2009,10,30
123,Fantastic!!!,"This hotel really got a style, located in central london oxford area, got swimming pool , spo and fitness centre, free Broadband, excellent breakfast. its surely a 5 Star atmosphere. next trip to London we will definetely stay again at this hotel!",5,2009,10,21
123,"Would never recommend this hotel, bad value for money","My stay at the Marylebone Hotel was extremely disappointing. In am a frequent business traveler and in London I am familiar with the Andaz, the Pelham, St Martin's, the Mandeville and many more hotels. I can tell you the Marylebone doesn't deserve a 4 star rating. It was not at all what I expected. 
I booked my stay through London Bookings/Olympia Tours and requested the Mandeville Hotel. Because the Mandeville was full they transferred me to the Marylebone with the assurance that it would be of similar quality and I would receive a similar or better room than at the Mandeville.
So much for Olympia Tours. The location is fine and the public spaces like the lobby and bar ok but my room was poorly . Very small and no atmosphere at all. The shower and bath weren't working properly, I couldn't get the room  temperature up or down, the TV displayed only 5 English channels, which is extremely limited for a four star hotel. I tried to call the concierge twice but my call wasn't picked up. And last but not least the routing within the hotel is terrible. I got lost several times. Nothing compared to the Mandeville Hotel and I don't understand why the Frieze (which I was visiting) organization is recommending this. Bad value for money.",2,2009,10,17
123,No-nonsense place in prime location,"The Marylebone Hotel does pretty much exactly what it says on the can. Situated less than 5 minutes from Bond Street tube station and Selfridges in a quiet little road near the village-like Marylebone High Street, the hotel caters to both business and leisure travelers. The somewhat under-staffed reception was mostly friendly and offers a modern aura without going over the top. The concierge will happily take your luggage to and from your room, but don't expect any great local knowledge beyond that. We stayed in a junior suite, which at an average of GBP 200 a night offered good space. From what I hear of the standard rooms, these are very small and really just suitable for the guest who intends to spend as little time there as possible. The hotel's restaurant, 108 Marylebone, serves excellent fresh food from a small but varied menu, with very friendly and attentive staff. Breakfast can get a little crowded during peak hours, but again staff manage to overcome this through fairly efficient service.

So, all in all, this is a good, contemporary 4+ star hotel to stay in when in London that does not disappoint and does what it does well. You won't leave raving about it, but you'll probably be happy to come back.",4,2009,10,16
123,A real gem,"I recently stayed at the Marylebone and can say it was very pleasurable!  I had stayed at the Jurys Clifton Ford before and that was pretty good, however, the new decor and service were excellent!  Breakfast was very nice and the Gym really was exceptional!  Hotel gyms are usually poor at the best of times but this one really does have everything you need...

Look forward to staying there again.  Have tried many 4&5* London hotels and this one really hits the spot",5,2009,10,14
123,No Attention to Minor Detail,"I found myself in a position of having to stay in this hotel even though I have a 'pied de terre' just around the corner.
The reservation and reception staff were delightful and very helpful.  My first room was so small as was the bathroom that I had to go up two levels to get anything that was remotely acceptable.  However to be fair the staff were really accommodating and the decor and furnishings were fine.
The hotel was let down by 'bad housekeeping'.  There was no robe in my room but this was delivered when I called.  I didn't want to be a pain and when I saw there was no hand soap in the bathroom I just used the shower gel.  The instant coffee was just decaffinated, there was no sugar or sugar substitute and the much acclaimed Nespresso Machine did not work even though I have used one before and I followed the instructions.
In the morning I discovered that there was no shower cap (a basic requirement) and the water was just warm - so a tepid bath it was!  One of the floor lamps in the room did not work - again a simple thing like a replacement light bulb
I have been fortunate at having stayed in some of the best hotels in the world - we could learn a lot from hotels in Asia!  
The room lacked other basics such as a clock, radio, Ipod dock, slippers  - all now standard stuff - and as I had upgraded to a Studio Suite, it was most disappointing.",3,2009,10,13
123,complete luxury,"the hotel is ultra modern and should be 5 star! i had queen bed  big plasma t.v a bathroom fit for a king everthing feels new i stayed on 4th floor and seperate lift takes you down to spa in basement, i have stayed in some fantastic hotels and marlylebone is top class it has all mod cons and great buisness  centre free 24hr internet  also available in room,staff are polite and prorefessional and make you feel very welcome,i would stay here again as first choice when in london for buisness or pleasure as great location just few mins walk to oxford st.",5,2009,10,11
123,BEWARE BAIT AND SWITCH!!,"I booked and fully prepaid an eight night stay at the Marylebone for October through the Michelin Rewards Travel Club.  My confirmed reservation was at a most attractive rate, as mentioned by others here. Then last week I was contacted by Michelin that my reservation had been switched to the Jurys Inn way out in Fulham, a sister hotel of the Jurys Doyle Hotel Group in no way comparable to the Marylebone.  I checked and there were still rooms available at the Marylebone at much higher rates!  This happened to me once before at another Doyle hotel, the Dupont in Washington, D.C. The correct thing to do by a reputable hotel would be an upgrade at check-in if they were over booked for the less expensive rooms.  Not here!!  Fortunately I still had time to cancel this joint , get a refund, and book a decent property near Russell Square.  I will not be booking another Jurys Doyle hotel ever again!!   While I await yet another less than sincere response from Mr. B, I think I will put on a little soft vioin music...
CAVEAT EMPTOR!!!",1,2009,10,04
123,Nice choice for London - unbeatable offering,"We decided to read between the lines and trust the recently renovated boutique hotel. We booked 2 doubles for 3 days and took a deep breath. Well, It may be not the hotel to fall in love with (cold service, ok though) but its a beautiful boutique hotel and one of the Smartest choices in London:
Nice location, near Oxford for shopping and outings. Nice and modern decoration, still smells new.  Public areas very modern and nice, bar ok. Elevators efficient. Rooms a little bit small but very nice and ideal for 3-4 days. Price superb (79bp per day).  Try to beat the offering, I am afraid its almost impossible.",4,2009,09,25
123,Ok if you stay in one of their premium rooms,"It looks like my last review didn't save, which is probably for the best for this hotel as it was pretty damning.  After a few days of reflection and an upgrade to a better room, I'm not quite as het up about this place.  The staff are friendly and they do try their best but they don't have heaps to work with.  Some of the rooms are appallingly small (I have seen a few) and very poorly laid out.  They have started with a bad floor plan and tried to build a hotel around it.  Not ideal.  The common areas are pleasant and the location of the hotel is very good but I'd definitely make sure you go for one of their better rooms.",3,2009,09,12
123,Unimpressed,"I was shockingly surprised at what an unpleasant three-night stay we had at this hotel, based on all of the other great reviews here.  I kept wanting to give it another chance as it really could have potential, but it just doesn’t.  And while there are a few good things about it (free high-speed, great location), there’s just not enough to outweigh the bad.

Biggest issue – a whopping four false fire alarms over the course of our stay.  Two of them were early morning so that ruined any chance of sleeping in on Fri. or Sat.  We contacted reception after the second one and were basically told, “sorry there’s a problem with the fire alarm but we’re not sure how to fix it.”  The comical thing was when a letter was slipped under our door shortly after one of the false alarms, informing us that it was in fact just a false alarm and not an actual fire so there was nothing to be concerned about.  I think if it had been a fire we’d have figured it out by that point…

We had a superior room which was disappointingly small; I can’t imagine how much smaller a deluxe room is.  Not only was it small, but it suffered from a poor layout and bad lighting.  The bed was oddly short; I’m only 5’3” and my feet dangled off the end.  The hotel must be concerned about people stealing irons, because they are bolted onto the ironing board making it nearly impossible to use.  The bathroom was decent sized but also had poor lighting and was just very dingy and looked as if it needed a good proper scrubbing.  There was build-up in the crevices of the shower, which took forever to drain.  

There were just so many little misses during our stay…  For example, one day after housekeeping came, they neglected to leave any toilet paper.  We had to call reception not once, but twice to get them to bring some.  There was no bathrobe, no room service menu, no pen and paper – pretty common things for a hotel room to have.  I called for a room service menu and was told they would slip one under the door “if” they could find one (and they did).  

While they neglected the obvious, hotel staff would come around at odd times to check things.  The second day we were there a woman knocked on our door to see how everything was, which I suppose is fine, but the day that we called for toilet paper, someone came to our door to restock our mini bar – which didn’t need to be restocked.  Just very odd and it seemed as if they didn’t really have it together.  The queue at checkout on a Sunday morning was long; there was only one person working at reception.

The hotel really lacks any character and the staff doesn’t seem to go out of their way to go above and beyond.  There are loads of other hotels in London that I’d be hard-pressed to ever recommend staying here.",2,2009,09,09
123,Great Hotel,"Nice Hotel only a short walk to Oxford street. The decor is very good with a modern feel, corridoors to the rooms are quite dark. The rooms are quite small with the bathroom even smaller, very warm but air con works well.

You get use of the virgin gym/pool next door which is nice.

All in all an excellent hotel for a short stay in a good London location.",4,2009,09,07
123,Very good value for money and great location,"Stayed here for 3 nights, paid £115pn b&b through travelzoo and thought this represented excellent value for money for central London hotel.  Although small (tiniest bathrooms I have ever seen), the decor and ambience was lovely and i've stayed in a lot of london hotels.  The location was brilliant, 5-10 minute walk from oxford st (by selfridges and bond st tube stn) and just a couple of minutes from Marylebone High St which has lovely shops and  cafe's/restaurants.  Rooms do vary in size - the first one we were given was so small it felt cramped and the toilet leaked so we asked for a move.   The second room (same standard, not an upgrade) was much bigger so it would be worth asking for a larger one maybe?  Breakfast was very nice, plenty of choice and fresh.  Used the Virgin fitness club downstairs which was also very nice and clean (good pool, jacuzzi, sauna, steam room plus usual fitness facilities).  If I was going back to London again for sightseeing/shopping, I would definately stay here again over some of the other hotels I have reviewed (if I could get equally as good a rate).",4,2009,09,04
123,Bargain,"Was looking for a central London hotel for under £100. After reading some reviews on Tripadvisor i booked up.

What a pleasant surprise. The hotel is superb value for money. Excellent location, decent rooms, helpful and friendly staff.

Only down side is the price of the drinks in the hotel bar. I am used to paying over the odds when in a London hotel but the cost of drinks was incredibly high.

However if you need a good value hotel then you cant go far wrong with this one.",5,2009,09,03
123,We are going back again!!,"We stayed here when it was a 'Jurys', and it stuck in our mind as we had a free upgrade, not so lucky this time but a great experience all the same.
The best yet for anywhere in London, where there is a fantastic choice of 'eating out' on the door step.
We did three nights at a good rate, and ate out within 3 minutes walk each time.
Try Carluccios in St Christopher Place, it was fantastic.

Hotel has a leisure centre with a pool, which was fine, although the staff there were a little off, when they realised that you were from upstairs, so we only went the once, but it was not crowded and very clean.

Generally the hotel the staff were wonderful and helpful, and also very considerate. We did bed and continental breakfast, which was enough, and even refused free upgrade to full english on the third morning as we could not eat any more.

Plenty of room to relax, and only three minutes walk from the tube.
Yes we are going back in the Autumn, as I do not see the need to go elsewhere now.",4,2009,08,25
123,"Central, clean, wonderful concierge","We had stayed here previously while named Clifton Jurys Ford and were pleasantly surprised with the remodeling that has been completed.  We like the central location and the fact that there are excellent restaurants close by.  Our room was very comfortable and the bathroom spotless., though maybe a bit cramped.  I would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants a central hotel, convenient to the underground, shopping and restaurants.",4,2009,08,25
123,good location,"stayed here one night and got a great deal with travelzoo the hotel is in a good location close to the main shopping streets and some good restaurants,all the rooms have been refurbished in a modern chick design and everything looks fresh and clean, hotel staff were very helpfull and pleasant, the breakfast was excellent and the bar was also good my only dissapointment was the size of the bathrooms they have to be the smallest i have ever had in a hotel but well equiped and clean , 
i would use this hotel again if you can get the discount rate but i wouldnt stay if i had to pay the rack rate",4,2009,08,23
123,"modern, clean, compact, 5 min from bond street station","Not large rooms but recently renovated, modern, clean, well located and so good value for London. I will return to stay here. It is also in a quiet street",4,2009,08,21
123,"Nice hotel, good location, YOUNG staff","We stayed at the Marylebone on the advice of our travel agent whom we've used for years.  She always puts us close to transportation so we can use the bus or subway systems, but still close to shopping and restaurants since we have kids with us.  Marylebone fit the bill pretty well.

Its a short walk to Bond Station which is on the Jubilee line, and that runs right to Westminster, London Bridge and the London Dungeon areas.  Saved a fortune on taxis.  However, while the young staff try hard, they are not quite there and are NOT good at directions.  Our first night we got in late, after 11 so most restaurants closed.  They directed us to a pizza place '10 min' walk away.  25 min later we found a different place, and it turned out we were a block short of where they told us to go.  NOT great at 11pm at night.  Look for the older morning staff instead of the much younger evening staff.  They know their stuff, pick great restaurants (and know where they are).  

Hotel is clean, but is showing its years.  We had two rooms and the rooms themselves were clean, but small.  One Ethernet connection in each room (no WIFI) so you better not have multiple devices.  The bathrooms both head peeling paint on the woodwork below the tub (half glass shower doors) and one room had no seal at the bottom of the glass so you had to be super careful not to flood the room on a shower.

Cold breakfast (and toast) was included in the room rate, but hot breakfast was an extra 7 pounds or so.  Seemed pricy for meat and eggs on a daily basis.  The  Cold breakfast of cereals, fruit, fresh juice, bread, etc was very filling.

Two problems to watch out for: we had to renew our room cards every day.  Don't know why, but they only worked for 1 day.  Kind of annoying.  More importantly to us, they only put a bottom sheet on the beds and I never saw the comforters being taken to the wash.  My wife had to remake our beds each day after asking for extra sheets.  Never saw a hotel that did not offer a second sheet with a plain comforter.  A sanitation issue.

Wifi in the lobby is spotty, but there are two PC's and a power station in the business center which are free to use.",3,2009,08,21
123,stylish room but....,"we stayed at the Marylebone hotel for 3 days.  it's a great location just 7 mins walk from the main shopping area of regent / bond / oxford street entrances.  it's an extremely stylish hotel, wonderful neighbourhood and very pleasant. the rates that we had were also great value for money for the area that we were in.  the only gripe we had was that the room (standard) was rather small and cramped.  and the bathroom was nearly impossible to manouvere in.  we are rather small built and we still found it so tiny that we could hardly move about in the bathroom.  so i am wondering how the medium size and larger size guests work their way in the bathroom?  a tip would be to opt for a deluxe or suite i gather.  at the checkout counter i provided the feedback to the reception abt the small bathroom.  then there was a guest checking in next to me and he insisted that he take a look at the various room options before he decided which one to stay in.  I guess that's a solution huh?",4,2009,08,07
123,"changed room twice...ok but overpriced, even for central London","This is overpriced for what you get. It's more of a business hotel and has recently been done up (the new fittings give off a bit of a 'new car smell'). Staff are helpful - and they need to be as we had to change rooms twice!!

First room - the bed had not been made or someone had been sitting on it watching TV (the remote control was lying in the middle of the bed and the pillows/covers weren't messed up). It was also tiny and really dark.

Second room was better - facing the street, light, compact. Then the card entry door stopped working so we had to get the staff to unlock it to get back in. They couldn't get it fixed so the next morning they moved us to another room.

Third room was lower down and dark but very spacious with extra frills (to make up for the inconvenience). Bathroom door didn't shut properly but we thought we'd moved enough!

In all cases, the staff were helpful but still...

Swimming pool in the basement is run by Virgin and gets very busy with hotel and non-hotel customers. Decent, functional but sporty (lane swimming) rather than for leisure/relaxing.

Great location. Go to Paul's bakery on the high street for breakfast.",3,2009,08,04
123,highly recommended,"When booking this hotel was told that it was a nice hotel, and it was true what was said about the outside looking plain, but inside was a different story.  Very high quality furnishings and the beautiful sweet smell of candles burning - very welcoming.  We had a basic double room but it was very clean and considerably quiet for the location 10 minutes from Oxford Street.  My partner decided wanted an early night so I was left to wander round the hotel and have a swim in the lovely pool, I was the only one swimming so it was heavenly - just what you need after looking round hectric Oxford Street all day.  I dressed and then relaxed in the comfy lounge - soft music was playing and candles had been lit at all the tables creating a wonderful ambience, I could have sat there all night!!!
In the morning we were greeted with lots of smiley happy faces waiting to serve us breakfast, nothing was too much trouble and the food was delicious.......on checking out we were given an apple and a bottle of water each for our day,  will definitely be using this hotel again as it was fantastic .",5,2009,07,30
123,"Beware: nice hotel, chaotic backoffice","Staying in this hotel can be very nice, but be carefull when you are checking in. Read our experience:

When we checked in, the lady at the frontoffice wouldn´t believe at first that our booking was prepaid and was trying to let us pay for the booked room a second time. Only after a discussion of a few minutes, she would let us go to our room and 'would get back to us about it´.
When we got in the room, we were astonished. It was beautifull, but we had never seen a DELUXE room that was as small as this one - a tiny bed, a miniscule shower. My boss, who weighes about 120 kg's, wouldn´t have fitted in there. Since we weigh 120 kg´s together, we were doiing fine. But still.. 

So we went down to the reception again and asked if this really was the Deluxe room. ""Oh, that allways happens with Expedia"", said the lady at the desk uninterested. Since it was not what we paid for, I asked if their was anything she could do about it. A deep sigh. ""I´ll go and get the manager.""

Thank God she understood a bit more about how you should treat guests. She was very friendly and found out that their backoffice made two mistakes; the prepayment and the room type. Unfortunately the hotel was fully booked, so she couldn´t fix it right away. But she offered us a suite for the next two days. And a complimentary meal at their restaurant - which was good.

Nevertheless, I got the impression that they just tried to put guests in smaller rooms, as I met another couple who had the same complaint about their room. So be carefull that you get what you paid for - it´s a nice hotel, but not if you don´t get what you want.

Oh, and don´t get frightened by the outdated outside of the hotel - the inside is beautifull.",4,2009,07,20
123,Great hotel,"We had a bargain deal from Travelzoo for  £115 per night per room inc full English breakfast and 20% off food and drink in the restaurant and bar.
Check in was efficient and our room overlooked a side street.  It was quiet and clean and the bed was comfy.  TV had plenty of chanels and there was a good selection of tea and coffee in room.  Toiletries in bathroom were from their spa and were really nice.
Bedroom was a little small and bathroom was tiny.  Shower worked well.
Breakfast was of good quality.  
What really makes this hotel special are the staff and the location.  All staff were extremely friendly and happy and the location is just off Oxford Street.  We usually stay in the City Inn in Westminster which is equal for service and quality of food.  The City Inn wins it on room size and in room facilities but the Marylebone wins it on its location.  Both are extremely good hotels.",5,2009,07,16
123,Nice staying,"Very nice hotel.Friendly staff.Good position.No noises.Nice room pretty well furnitured and a nice bathroom.The problem is that the ventilation system doesn't work there.But the AC is OK in the room.Also the fridge wasn't working or,at least, i could't manage to swich it on.Very clean.Pretty good working internet connection.Nice restaurant .I had only the breakfast there but you have possibility to choose between continental or english breakfast .No complaint about the food and its variety. Maybe pretty expensive prices for rooms but what to do..At walking distance to Oxford street for those going at shoppings.",4,2009,07,16
123,excellent,"I took my daughter for her 21st birthday,so glad i did.The staff were so friendly  and helpful,the rooms were very clean.The location for shopping was great and all other amenities.I would recommend the restaurant.Can't wait to go back again,recommend this hotel every time.",5,2009,07,03
123,"Out-dated, over-priced and over-rated","Planned surprise romantic weekend just for 2  in London for my 40th. The taxi pulled up outside a very outdated looking hotel in a nice part of town and made sure we were at our 4.5 star rated hotel. We were kept for at least 15 min at check-in as they had no room for us even though he had booked it three months in advance  and had a confirmation number. We were assured that room 730 on top floor was the studio king suite that had been booked. The 7th floor is top floor with the whole level having reduced ceiling height.. The room was very very disappointing. No imagination, no interior style. Grey carpet, white wall, cheap grey office furniture and smallest king bed i have ever seen. Very questionable. Was this a staff room? Looked nothing like any rooms on web-site.  It felt very much like a budget hotel but did not charge budget prices. Would not recommended to anyone at the prices we were charged. Worst value hotel we have ever stayed.",1,2009,07,03
123,Fantastic boutique hotel in the heart of London,"I found this hotel via one a travel guide book and after reading the reviews here, decided to take a chance and book with them directly (rather than using one of the big travel booking websites where you have to prepay). We were a bit worried as the price was a lot less than similar London 4 star boutique hotels. I am happy to say that our fears were goundless. 

The hotel gives off a hip, plus modern feel, with stylish quality furniture, dark wood and suede covered hallways. The rooms are just like you see them on the website, though they seem bigger in person, a big plus considering how often London hotels give you a mini room for a maxi price. The bathroom in particular was huge by London standards and very posh with surprisingly good water pressure in the shower and big bathtub. 

The queen sized bed was a true queen, and the high speed Internet access was free. The staff were very helpful, though I didn't like having to ask room service for a bucket of ice to chill our bottle of champagne brought from Italy (The room service fridge is elecronically monitored, so you can't take things out of it, use it for your own purposes, then put items back after without incurring a cost for each item). Ask for a room numbered from 60 to 95 (e.g. 490) to be away from the main elevators, as there is only one set of elevators for the whole hotel, so staying near to them might mean more ambient noise. 

One of the huge pluses of this hotel, other than how quiet it was, was that it was amazingly well situated. Close to the Bond underground station, it was a quick ride to Piccadilly Circus, Tower of London, Harrods, Westminster Abbey, etc. It was only one stop away from the PIccadilly line for those who want to take the tube to Heathrow. There are a ton of restaurants and pubs in the area, as well as sandwich shops and coffee shops (yes even a Starbucks for those that love that chain). Also a lot of mid to high end shopping to be had only  a 5 minute walk away. 

Only downside is no breakfast is included. but the free internet access, free printing in the business centre and free use of the pool and fitness facility at the adjacent Virgin fitness centre offset this nicely IMO. 

When we return to London next year, we're going to stay at Marylebone again.",5,2009,06,30
123,What you see is what you get,"I stayed at the hotel for one night whilst on a business trip and I was delighted with the hotel as what you see online is what you actually get when you arrive.  Staff are so pleasant and quick to help.  Room was great stayed in a Superior Double, the only downside to the room was the size of the bathroom, (but hey I could live with it), but it was clean modern and fresh.  Great location 5 mins walk from Bond Street Station, great for shopping on Oxford Street, would highly recommend this hotel for anyone looking to stay in London.",5,2009,06,23
123,gem in perfect setting,"At conference with colleague. Hotel was superb, so close to Oxford St, Harley St and Wimpole St. Yet quiet enough to seem removed from city. On arrival, was taken very quickly to room (twin, non-smoking had been reserved) and discovered room on smoking floor.Phoned reception to complain and immediately upgraded to junior suite. All of this happened within 10 minutes of initial check in. Very slick and efficient. Receptionist excellent, great people skills and on departure offered us complimentary bottled water. (nice little touch)
The decor in the hotel is absolutely stunning;ranging from tradional to modern. Would love some of the pieces I saw there! The junior suite was really lovely though not that big but still we thought it was great. Breakfast was one of the best we have had. The range of food on offer was superb staff lovely and the dining room though quite large was beautiful full of little nooks that made it feel quite intimate and private. Swimmimg pool sauna and gym also there but unfortunately we didn't get to use them. Will definitely return.",5,2009,06,19

- smell of swimming pool in the Bar area",4,2009,06,08
123,Trendy feel in a fantastic location,"After reading all the reviews on this hotel, I was still hesitant about staying here.  So I emailed the general manager who kindly let me know that the whole hotel indeed was finished an entire renovation (some people mentioned that some rooms were not renovated).  

The hotel has a trendy, minimalist feel but yet still cozy and the staff was extremely warm and friendly.  I received a complimentary upgrade which was great and found the room to be more than adequate.  Rooms are equiped with Villeroy Boch bathroom with granite countertops and a nice big bed with a big flat screen TV.  The room was also quite big especially for a big city and the bathroom was roomy as well.  My only issue with the bathroom is that the shower didn't have a curtain so the bathroom floor gets a bit flooded.  

The area where the hotel is located is outstanding.  Very quiet and safe but 5 min walk to Bond Street station and to Oxford Street.  Location cannot be beat.

The hotel also offer free WIFI (I didn't use it as I did not have my laptop) and free computers to use downstairs to check emails and local attractions.

I would definitely stay at this hotel again on my next visit to London!",5,2009,06,05
123,"Great Area, Great Price, Great Stay!","My boyfriend and I got a deal on this hotel through Travel Zoo and at first I was a little sketchy about the hotel from reviews I had read on here, so i really wasn't expecting anything Super or Over the top. The area the hotel is in, is pretty upscale, it is right near Oxford St. (a shoppers heaven), and there are a bunch of great restaurants on the little side streets in and around the hotel core. 
The hotel itself was wonderful, we were pleasantly surprised when we were walking up to it, because it definitely didn't match many of the descriptions I had read beforehand. The inside was very trendy and upscale and all the staff was very friendly. Check in took about 5 minutes and we were right up to our room. 
We stayed in a deluxe room which was great, big TV, nice soft bed and free WIFI. The bathroom was an alright size but the shower was a little odd, there was no shower curtain and only a small plank of glass that really didn't prevent the water from getting all over the floor. The only complaint we had was the air conditioning as it was a hot day when we arrived and the room was pretty warm. It took half a day for it to start to cool down.
The breakfast was good, only downfall was you had to be there before 10am or it was closed, so no sleeping in. Check out was fast with just having to sign off on a piece of paper with the charges and off we were.

Hope this helps.",4,2009,06,03
123,GREAT HOTEL!,"What a great Hotel.
Location is excellent and the rooms are to great standard!
Everything here for a realxing and quiet stay or hustle and bustle.",5,2009,06,02
123,Very nice hotel,"My wife prepared a trip to London a few weekends ago so she made the reservation to this hotel.
 I arrived there first, meeting her a fter a few hours as we were coming from different towns.
 The hotel is very well located, just a few minutes walk from Bond Street. Also, nearby you can find Oxford Street, Soho and the rest of London's city centre.
 The hotel itself is very clean, very elegant, the rooms not so big, but very nice. They are well equiped, with HD TV, minibar, iron, Internet. Everything is very clean and nice decorated.
 In the hotel you can find a nice pool, a fitness area, a restaurant, a bar, some computers with internet in the lobby.
 The staff is very polite and helpful.
 My wife found a special offer, for our 3 nights stay it was something around 380 pounds. The regular price is little higher than that I guess.
 In the end, I would recomend the hotel to a friend of mine.",4,2009,05,26
123,Our wallets was stolen from the hotel room!,"Me and my mother stayed at The Marylebone hotel for a shopping weekend in may. When we first arrived we got the smallest room I have ever seen with a rather small bed for 2 persons.We went down to the reception and asked for a bigger room with a bigger bed.The receptionist acted a little ""hard to get"" about the upgrading of the room, but at last gave us another.
When we came back from dinner the last night our wallets was gone. I left mine in the room before we went out that evening and my mother left her ""extra wallet"".There were no safety deposit box in our room either.
When we went down to the reception to report that our wallets was gone, we got the worst service ever! 
When we checked out the next day the front-desk manager said she was going to e-mail us the next day to give us some kind of compensation but I never heard from her (now its been 2 week since we came home).
The Marylebone hotel is a really nice hotel with really good location, but that doesnt help when the customer service is that bad.",3,2009,05,24
123,Highly recommended,"We stayed here for a long weekend (3 nights) and would highly recommend it.  The location is fabulous, walking distance from key areas and close to a number of tube lines.  Marylebone itself is a lovely neighbourhood and great for cafes, restaurants and boutique shops.  The hotel room was lovely and light and very spacious (we had a studio suite) very clean and stylishly decorated.  Staff are very helpful, the refreshing towels on check in is a nice touch.  And if you don't fancy walking there's a taxi rank right outside.",5,2009,05,23
123,Great Hotel - shame about the service,"Stayed here weekend of 16-18 May, having previously stayed at the Hotel a few years ago when it was the Clifton Ford.  
The Good:
The refurb has been done to a high standard with lovely big plasma TV's and comfortable beds in a really clean room.  Whilst we didnt eat in the restaurant or have breakfast, I'd reccomend the Girraffe and the Cafe Rouge both less than 5 minutes from the hotel.  The Pool in the Virgin Health Club is lovely, but be warned the changing rooms are on another level of the club so I would reccomend taking a robe and pair of flip-flops.  
The Bad:
I dont have seriously high standards of service but this seems to be the one area that the hotel consistently seems to be failing in from these reviews.  First Strike (sat) - we called to get a pair of scissors and sewing kit sent to our room after a small wardrobe disaster, the sewing kit arrived without the scissors we asked for a pair of scissors when the kit was brought to the room however after about half an hour we ended up just walking down to reception to get them.  Strike Two (Sat) - we are two women in our mid-twenties and asked reception for a number of a reliable taxi firm to use as we were taking part in a charity event which was expected to finish at about 4 in the morning, after a five minute discussion amongst the 3 men on reception we were given a mobile number and asked to phone 'steve or john' and they would come to collect us - surprisingly enough we took our chances hailing a cab - hardly the safest way to get round london.  Strike 3 (sunday) - Made the mistake of phoning room service for a steak sandwich.  Called at around 10 to 9 in the evening and was told that it would be with us in about 20 minutes, AN HOUR later I called back, the same person answered the phone and took my order again, when I pointed out that 'I called an hour ago and my sandwich hasn't arrived' - I was met with the response 'Sorry, you don't want chips?' - last I checked I hadnt mentioned chips....  
I would stay here again and would recommend to a friend but only because of the great location and pleasant rooms, however the service was awful.",3,2009,05,19
123,Great hotel in an excellent location,"Got a good deal for this hotel from Travelzoo and stayed 2 nights with my companion. The hotel is located close to Oxford Street - perfect for shopping! We were able to walk to Primark in 10 minutes, shop to our hearts content before the crowd descended and stroll back to our hotel to drop off our stuff before going for more shopping! After a night at the theatre, we enjoyed a 20-25 minute stroll back to the hotel and it felt perfectly safe.

Breakfast was included in our deal, and it was amazing! The cooked breakfast was delicious, as was the continental selection. The orange juice and coffee were also excellent!

The Marylebone hotel is a chic boutique hotel, very beautifully and tastefully decorated. We stayed in a superior room and though it was quite small, we found it to be adequate for our needs and very comfortable. The bathroom is slightly cramped and the water wouldn't drain properly in the bathtub after our shower. However, the modern decor, lux toiletries and large bathtowel more than made up for the lack of space. In any case, we didn't spend much time in the toilet, so we weren't too affected by the lack of space there.

Customer service was commendable. We got to the hotel early and were able to check in with no fuss at all. The staff showed very good attitude throughout our stay and was very helpful in pointing us to the right direction. Before we got to the hotel, I had written to the hotel with enquiries and special requests and these were all dealt with very professionally. 

All in all, I was very impressed with the hotel and would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone!",5,2009,05,19
123,Lovely hotel,"Stayed here for a weekend, had 3 rooms booked 2 standard and one superior. Would definately recommend the superior room lots of space, large bathroom expresso machine, the other rooms were adequate but a little small.
The reception very friendly and helpful, decor in the hotel nice, good position.
We did not eat at all in the hotel as we were out from morning till night, but went for breakfast in the next street and found two great places.
Used the pool early one morning which is a bit of a trek situated at the back of the hotel you go down in the lift, which you need your room card for access to the pool area.
The only negative would be the drinks fridge in the room, we had fresh milk and put it into the fridge so moved bottles around, when we went to checkout i told them first what we had done, as the original bill had 4 items we were going to be charged for.
Would not hesitate to use this hotel again",5,2009,05,18
123,Hotel par excellence have no hesitation in booking here.,"I booked an overnight stay at The Marylebone through an online booking agent based upon previous reviews of this hotel. This was my first experience of a Jury's Collection Hotel. The hotel is located a five minute walk from Oxford Street and a similar distance in the opposite direction from Marylebone High Street. The High Street is great. Full of patisseries and pavement cafes, you're able to sit outside and enjoy the best croissant you'll find outside of Paris!
The hotel itself is stylish and modern. Initital impressions based upon the greeting from staff, including refreshing towels, are very welcoming and professional. I had arranged an early check in by contacting the hotel directly and even though it was 9 am, this was not a problem and my room had been prepared. The room itself was of a very high standard with a chaise longue in the seating area, a selection of current magazines and a two plasma televisions. Tea and coffee making facilities, including the Nespresso machine were available. The bed was comfortable and the bathroom more than adequate. I used the Virgin Active health club facilities which I recommend to take advantage of even if just to sit and chill out by the pool with a book or in the whirlpool!
I had continental breakfast included as part of my deal and this was excellent. Lots of choice of pastries, cereals, hams and cheeses with as much tea, coffee and fruit juice as you'd like! There is an upgrade if wanted to the 'full english' option.
The staff in general at The Marylebone are pleasent and unlike other hotels go that extra mile to ensure your stay is a good one. I stayed at The Mayfair Hotel a fortnight before my stay at The Marylebone and although The Mayfair is rated as a 5 star hotel it loses out in many aspects compared to this hotel.
In summary, don't be put off by negative reviews of this hotel, I'm sure there are reasons but my stay was excellent and having taken time to assess most of the hotel's facilities and the interactions with staff a stay par excellence is guaranteed at The Marylebone Hotel!",5,2009,05,18
123,Forget your worries - be happy,"We stayed between April 23rd to 27th 2009 and had some worries based on some reviews we'd read. However we contacted the hotel in advance about our worries & were put at ease by having a bigger room allocated and having the staff look after us exceptionally well. Yes the bathroom is small, sink, WC & large shower, but hey your on holiday in london, why do you need a big loo?? The room although smaller than in other cities/countries was still big enough not to be claustrophobic and very comfortable with good amenities. Our safe didn't work as the last guests had locked it! The hotel offered us the use of the main safe, which was helpful, albeit a tad inconvenient! The engineers called out couldn't fix it during our stay. I'd have phoned the previous guests and asked the code number and saved a call out charge, seems logical to me!! Never got round to finding the leisure centre so can't comment, but the restaurant and bar were excellent with good food, large selection and also choice of beers and wines. The staff were extremely helpful and friendly! Complaints about the restaurant would be stop making it so cold and get new menu's, the lobster I wanted had been removed from the menu weeks before!! Still what we had was immense!",4,2009,05,16
123,Pretty good,"Since most reasonably-priced London hotels are pretty poor, this is one of the best value options I've been in. The room I was in was smallish - the bathroom even more so - but pleasnt but the service/people were great. I would probably return. Complimentary access to the SPA cool too.",4,2009,05,14
123,Perfect stay!,"We have booked a superior room for 6 nights using a travelzoo offer (105GBP including breakfast). We arrived at 2 o'clock in the morning and since we have read previous tripadvisor reviews we expected a pretty small room. We opened the door only to find a huge suite with a living room, two lcd TVs, workdesk and a big bathroom with both shower and bath. It was amazing! I do not know the reason for the upgrade and I did not even ask! The hotel is about 2-3 blocks behind Debenhams, about 5-7 min from Oxford street, perfect location for shopping. The english breakfast was great and the staff very helpful, even on Saturday when the restaurant was packed. The lobby and various sitting areas very cozy and beautifully decorated. The free internet is always a plus. The marylebone district is very refined, with pretty shops and cafes (we saw Paul McCartney at a bookshop there!). Oh and a tip: we had great fish and chips at a small zagat-rated restaurant across the street from the hotel bar! In conclusion, for the money we paid and the hotel class and amenities even the small room would have been great, so after the mystery upgrade our stay at the Marylebone hotel was exquisite!",5,2009,05,14
123,Good location,"Reception on our first day was disappointing.  Recommend staff take lessons from their sister hotel, Hotel Kensington.  They had difficulty finding my second room reservation.  We requested an early check in because of arrival at 0900.  It was a Saturday which was reasonable for delay in having a room made available. However, it was not until I spoke to the manager on duty that a room was provided at 1300.  The second room was not as expected. We were to have queen rooms and one was small with a double.  Rooms were acceptable, clean with comfortable beds and surprisingly quiet as an end room (453). Reasonable value at 105 GBP under a TRAVELZOO promotion. Hotel has been renovated but still has a ""tired"" look to it.  The cooked breakast  was excellent.  Corner of Welbeck and Bulstrode makes this hotel a little trickey to find but is well located for shopping (Marks & Spencer, Selfridges, Primark) and many local and ethnic restaurants closeby.  Would reconsider this hotel in the future after checking ahead and confirming rooms, etc.    I must commend the manager, Ahmed Youness, on his concern and desire to resolve my dissatisfaction.",3,2009,05,09
123,Great location for shopping.,"My wife and I stayed here overnight after booking it on secret hotels from Last Minute.We've always had excellent hotels and great value.The hotel was 5 mins from Bond Street station just behind Debenhams on Oxford Street.The location for shopping and sight seeing was excellent.You couldn't fault it.
 We arrived and the reception was very nice and modern.We were a little early and our rooms were'nt ready , so we handed our cases to the consierge who stored them for us while we waited for our rooms.Its was very handy so we went for a quick look round the shops.
The rooms were very nice although we had a few marks on the walls which could have been wiped off easily.Nothing to complain about but enough to catch your eye when you walk into the room.The room wasn,t very big but enogh room for an overnight stop.You would struggle for more then a couple of nights there as there wasn't much storage space for clothes. One thing i was a very disappointed with was the bathroom.You barely had enough room to open the door and get past the toilet so you could shut it again.The shower leaked and was very low pressured.We didn,t even have any soap to wash our hands after using the loo.We had to use our shower gel!And there was no extractor fan so the minute you turned the shower on you couldn't see a thing as it steamed up.It was very clean but just too small.
In the morning we went for breakfast which although was tasty was very poorly organised.We orderd a pot of coffee and a pot of tea as there was 6 of us.It took 30mins to arrive.We had to complain 3 times before it arrived.And when it did we had no cups.The waiters had to collect the old cups of other tables so we could have a drink.We then ate our breakfast as my friend went up for his full english,they had run out of most things.He was told to wait 5 mins and come back which he did.He rejoined the queue which took about 10 mins to get to the front of, but when he got to the front was told they still didn't have most things.He eventually got his breakfast 15mins later brought out to him still missing half the items.There was dirty dishes all over the place.The price for this fantastic breakfast?? £35 per couple!!!I'm no snob but for that price i was expecting a lot better then we got.And just another small thing,our cups in the room were filthy with old tea rings still in them.
I think i'd stay here again if i was shopping,just for the location.But otherwise i would go elsewhere.",3,2009,05,04
123,Wonderful experience,"My wife & I have just returned from celebrating our wedding anniversary with a 2 night stay in the Marylebone hotel. The hotel had been recommended to us by my sister who had stayed previously.  Am I glad we took her advise....... The location is perfect - just a short stroll to Oxford Street and Bond Street tube station. It is also close to Marylebone High Street which is quaint and has an almost village style feel to it. It is full of nice pubs, restaurants and cafes. It is a lovely area to brouse and enjoy at your leisure away from the hussle & bussle of Oxford Street. 

We could not find one reason to fault the hotel. It was busy with a nice buzz of activity, yet the staff were attentive and efficient at all times. We stayed in a suite for the occasion which was spacious and well decorated with a balcony with views over the city.  Breakfast was excellent and we had dinner one night in the restaurant which was very good. We will happily spend any future trips to London in the Marylebone.",5,2009,05,03
123,"Dont bother, not worth the money","My Husband and I stayed at this hotel on the 18th and 19th of April.We booked a deluxe room because of the extras stated on the website. We were extremely disappointed in the room, the bathroom was far from luxury, it was clearly a disabled bathroom not at all what we had thought we would find. The loo seat was painfully  raised , no bath, shower for a wheelchair and emergency pull cords, not exactly luxury 
There were no instructions for the coffee machine so making it a useless addition, there were no bathrobes provided nor when I asked for some did any arrive. The carpet was badly stained in front of the television. My husband was at a meeting on the Sunday and when I arrived back from shopping at 3.45 I had to ask at reception for the room to be cleaned and fresh towels to be brought, unfortunately it was then too late to shower before going out again as I had to meet my husband.
We both travel a lot and always look for good quality hotels, not what I would class 4 Star . Housekeeping is mediocre, would have asked for an iron but as the bathrobes hadn't arrived thought it would be a useless exercise, there should have been an ironing facilities in the room.  
All in all an extremely disappointing stay, certainly not somewhere I will recommend or use again.",3,2009,05,03
123,Nice central London location for a short break,"Our fifth floor room was small, but comfortable, the decor and fittings were good for a four star hotel. I think that the joy of The Marylebone is the location. You are not particularly close to any single Underground station - but reasonably close to several, which means you have a good choice of lines - and destinations. Marylebone Village, has many good (and varied) restaurants, and several excellent pubs - particularly if you enjoy quality beer.

The room was a little small for a long stay, but at £105 per night including English Breakfast for two (through TravelZoo.com), was good value. The breakfast was great, though I wouldn't have wanted to pay £17.50 a head for it. Better a short walk to Sofra in St. Christoper's Place where you can enjoy an al-fresco English brekfast fot £5.95.

The hotel has some good relaxation spaces downstairs and a good (and popular) bar. I shall definately return, though the hotel needs to be careful not ot out-price itself. I feel that up to £90 room only or £110 including breakfast is enough to pay for a double room.",4,2009,04,30
123,Stay Elsewhere!,"Room decor  was dull (Deluxe Room) with filthy carpet.  A repairman started banging
in the stairwell near my room at 8:30 AM.  The bathroom was beautiful and the staff
was excellent but the location and the cleanliness were lacking.  They advertise a luxury room that exceeds expectations but have not achieved this.  Breakfast was good and
once again the staff was terrific.",2,2009,04,28
123,Great London Hotel,"I have just returned from a 2 night stay in The Marylebone Hotel and I can only but recommend it to everyone. From the moment I checked in, the service I received was second to none. A very quick and friendly check in, including warm flannels which had been scented (with something I'm sure of but it was lovely) for me to freshen up! My room was clean and comfortable with a well stocked mini bar. My only little quibble was that the room (355) was on the small side (but I've seen smaller in London) but as I was alone, I had more than enough room. I also put the room down to the fact I had booked on a discount hotel website which doesn't usually get you the best room in the place! 

Breakfast was delicious, I was full for the day once I left the restaurant! Continental was included in my deal with cooked breakfast costing another £4 if I wanted.

The hotel is ideally located for oxford st - only a 5min walk. I had hoped to go for a look on Marylebone Hight St (seemed less than 5mins in the other direction) but time did not allow me.

A taxi from the hotel to either a west end show or to Victoria Station costs about £6-£10 depending on traffic etc. There always seemed to be taxis outside the hotel so there is no wait time.

Check out was fast and a complimentary bottle of water was given to me to take on my travels - another little touch of this fab hotel.

If you are looking for a luxury hotel at a good price - then stay here.",5,2009,04,27
123,Super-Duper!,"I stayed for 17 nights at The Marylebone in Apr 2009.   I was assigned a beautiful room, completely refurbished and spacious.  The soft furnishings are of a very high standard, the bathroom opulent and the amenities provided top-notch. I liked the workdesk and comfortable workchair and really appreciated the complimentary in-room high speed internet connection.  The flatscreen plasma TV was nifty too.

 I found the front desk staff to be particularly helpful, friendly and professional.  The young staff working the breakfast room were extremely courteous  and very eager to please.  Housekeeping kept my room spotless for the duration. No complaints at all about the room, the hotel and the services provided.

The location is very handy to Oxford St shopping and both Bond St and Oxford Circus tube stations and therefore all the attractions of Central London. However, because I was at the theatre on 15 of the 17 nights of my stay, Covent Garden or Bloomsbury are probably better locations for a visit heavily focussed on attending the theatre.  But that's a quibble. Forget trying to use buses on Oxford/Regent's Sts at 6:45pm to reach Theatreland.  They are mired in traffic.  However using the tube (Central LIne)and walking from Holborn ot Tottenham Court Road stations will get you to most theatres within 30 minutes.     

All in all, The Marylebone Hotel is a lovely contemporary hotel providing great customer service.",5,2009,04,24
123,Superb experience,"I stayed at the Malylebone hotel for 3 nights whilst in London on a business trip.  I had stayed 2 nights in the Melia Whitehouse nearby for 2 nights but they were full so my company booked me to the Marylebone.  Thank goodness.  I had a huge and stylish room (652) which was big by any hotel room standard, never mind London.  The corporate rate I paid was nearly half of what Melia were asking for and the room was more than twice as good.  The breakfast is really good with all the produce from nearby shops, and the best croissants I have had in the UK!  There are lots of nice touches (such as giving you a bottle of water when you check out to take with you)  from the hotel which shows there is good and thoughtful management.
My only slightly negative comment is that the service could be slightly improved during breakfast, sometimes it is difficult to get attention of the staff as they are very busy.  I think they are busy squeezing the delicious freshly squeezed orange juice which everyone wants more of.
Reception staff were good, check in and check out was a breeze and super efficient.  Also I forgot to mention FREE INTERNET, which is so damn rare in London.  Also for me to extend my stay was no problem at all.
I will defeinitely stay there again, and would happily return with my wife for a leisure break, and the rates are really very good.
One of the best London hotels I have stayed in.

123,Horrible experience. Will NEVER return.,"My husband and I come to London often on vacation, and decided to try something new and stay at The Marylebone Hotel. We booked a Deluxe Room (581) for our last three nights, and boy were we disappointed! Apparently, this hotel was renovated not too long ago however you couldn't tell by looking at our room. The bathroom was dingy and mildew stained and the door was held together with duct tape. We had no towels when we arrived and had to call down to housekeeping.  

The carpet was pulling up near the bed and I tripped on it when I went to sit down. All of the ""deluxe"" amenities that were supposed to come with the room were missing like the Espresso Machine, robes, and restaurant discount. If I would have known that I would have booked a Standard Room and saved money. The furniture was all chipped as well as the sink in the bathroom, which also had what looked like blood stains on the faucet. 

The worst part of our stay was when my husband and I when to grab some lunch at a nearby restaurant, and about 10 pounds in coins were taken from out of our room. After that we had to check all of our belongings to make sure that nothing else had been taken. We both travel a lot all over the world and have never had an experience like this at a so called 4 Star Hotel. Housekeeping is mediocre at best and didn’t service our room until at least 5:00PM. 

Please book elsewhere, like The Intercontinental Hotel: Park Lane or The Cumberland. We probably would have had better luck staying at The Holiday Inn down the street and saved a lot of money!",2,2009,04,16
123,What a deal and a great find!,"We got a special offer through travelzoo and decided to go with our son over spring break.  We were a little nervous because although the hotel had 4 stars, our rate of 120 pounds for a deluxe room including english breakfast, a 20% discount on food and beverages,  and taxes (no charge for our son) seemed too good to be true.
Well it delivered!.  Hotel is recently renovated (2008).  We had a modern room on the third floor, big enough to comfortably fit the extra twin for our son.  Expresso machine and tea service, nice new modern bathroom and a flat screen tv.
The extra bed didn't show up on the computer, but it wasn't a problem at check-in.  Also, they didn't give us the food and beverage discount voucher, but when we went to the front desk 2 days later they said it was no problem, they would take care of it on our bill (which they did).  We got a free drink letter, and when I went to get the (one) freebie, and buy one for my husband, the asst manager said no problem, both were on the house (very nice).  So when we had our afternoon glass of wine we went there instead of a pub.  Little nit - they asked if we wanted a paper delivered, but didn't tell us at check-in that there was a charge.
Great breakfast buffet with huge selection of food.
Health faciliites are great- just note there are limited hours that children can use the pool.
Location is great.  Tons of great restaurants right there.  We especially liked the Union Cafe and Cafe Caldesi.",5,2009,04,15
123,"Nice room, service unremarkable.","I stayed for one night at hotel in March 2009.  When in London I usually stay at the nearby Great Russell Hotel (part of the same group of hotels), but a low corporate rate pushed me towards the Marylebone for this trip.

First impressions weren’t great.  The building is plain ugly from the outside, 50/60s architecture at its worst.  Check in wasn’t much better, with a 10 minute wait and the sole receptionist failing to find my booking and not managing to raise a smile. 

In contrast to the tired exterior, the hotel has been thoroughly redecorated inside in conjunction with its rebranding from the Clifton Ford and is all the better for it.  Whilst the corridors have possibly gone a bit far down the funky Malmaison-dark colours route, the room I got was light, airy and whilst the usual London hotel room size, felt bigger. The bathroom was small but had a good powerful shower and reasonable toiletries. So all in all a good use of the (small) space.

I didn’t eat at the hotel or try the bar and checked out early in the morning, so I can’t comment on any of the other features.  Basically, the Marylebone does what it says on the tin.  Depending on the rate, I’ll probably stay there again at some stage, but I much prefer the other Doyle Group properties in London where I’ve got much better service and the location is slightly more convenient for the tube.",3,2009,04,15
123,Great hotel,"We stayed at this hotel for 1 night. It was everything the web site said and more, really helpful reception, good size room, very clean. The bar and lounges were very welcoming, We had a full breakfast which was included in price, and if your like us and do like a good breakfast you will not be disappointed, very fulfilling.",5,2009,04,12
123,small room,"Ye are just back from a 4 nite stay in marylebone. The room was a good treck from anywhere and as for the size of it..........
The 1st day we arrived we got into the room unpacked all just so we could put away our bagsto have a bit of extra room. We lay down and I was unfortunate to choose the side nearest to the bathroom , a means of basicaly rooling out of the bed into the bathroom .
The smell of sewage was just so strong it was bad, unable to open the windows I had to get out of the room ASAP.
We met with Ahamad at recption and he said he would go and look,and would we mind moving room if he couldnt do anything about it, we headed out and when we came back  we  were stillin the same room and a fresh smell in the bathroom was what greeted us.
We heard no more from anyone about the problem, Everyday around the same time the stinch smell would take over and by putting the bin over the gully hole in the floor which the daily cleaners did , does not get rid of the problem.
Once more we complained and still no further on, maybe a busy weekend hindered our chances of getting any help.
We paid a nice sum for the hotel and its our 3rd time to stay there and IM quite dissapointed that nothing was done to help us.
Other than that as all we done in the hotel after that was sleep , its so centrally located its perfect, as we travel and have used the doyle group in all parts of the world I will be thinking hard about my choice next trip......",3,2009,04,08
123,Beautiful hotel in excellent location,"Brought my mum on trip to london and booked here for 3 nights, was worried as the last hotel i stayed in london the room was soooo small. Anyways booked in here, got the best price on booking.com. Arrived and loved it straight away. Received hot towels on check in to refresh ourselves. The hotel has been renovated and looks great everywhere. 
Our room was lovely, small but fine for the 2 of us, the bed alright is a small double but other then that the room was perfect and lovely bathroom, great shower. 
We ate in the hotel bar and it was lovely and reasonably priced. Everyone we dealt with in the hotel were excellent.
The location of the hotel is brilliant, 2 minute walk to Oxforfd street but yet in a quiet street and the surrounding area is lovely with some lovely restaurants and bars right 
behind the hotel 
no complaints about this hotel, really enjoyed our stay in central london",5,2009,04,07
123,"Some good points but overall disappointed, won't stay again.","I booked this hotel on the basis of 3 things: 1) location - it is a great location. 2) leisure centre and 3)experience at sister hotel in Cork. I had emailed the hotel previously to say that this trip was part of a 35th birthday celebration and had requested a nice room. As a far I can tell the whole hotel has been refurbished and the decor is lovely however our room, 144, was tiny. I visit London an average of once every two months so am used to small rooms but for the price we paid I thought this room was tiny. We could hardly close the bathroom door and we are both small! If you are a larger individual this is something to think about before booking. There was nothing special about the room. The bed was very comfortable but also small, barely a double. There was also blood on the bed cover! Apart from that the decor and cleanliness were good. Staff in the hotel and bar were polite and helpful and cannot be faulted however we found the leisure centre staff less so. The girl at reception barely grunted at us when we asked for towels (which we had been told by hotel reception to ask for at the leisure centre). Once changed we had to wander around in swim suits looking for pool as there were no signs or directions given. We noticed other people with robes but we were not offered any and did not think to ask until it was too late. (The pool is not linked to the changing rooms, you have to go out and down a flight of stairs to get there - not a problem if given a robe but otherwise embarrassing!) The bar is lovely but you will get much better value and choice in local, lovely bars. Overall I wouldn't stay again.",3,2009,03,31
123,Lovely Hotel in Great Area except for Leisure Centre Problems,"Just back from three nights here.  I went with my girlfriend to celebrate her birthday.  What a lovely hotel.  The room, although small, was great and the shower fantastic.  The staff members were great and the bar was brilliant at night.  I would love to return here again except for one problem.  This problem was the leisure centre.  We went down and and looked for a towel.  The staff member mumbled something and gave us our towels.  We went to the changing areas and then wandered around in our swimwear looking for the swimming pools.  This was embarrassing.  I had to ask another fully clothed couple on the stairs where the pool was.  I actually booked into this hotel to use the leisure centre while we were in London (our third trip in four months).  I'm already looking to book a place in Marylebone soon but I would be slow in coming here again because of this.",4,2009,03,29
123,"Sumptuous Public Rooms, Unbeatable Location & Friendly Service","We stayed here for 3 nights in March to celebrate my birthday, catch up with ex-colleagues, shop and generally over-indulge, and the Marylebone Hotel was perfectly placed for everything!

Reception were very friendly and efficient - seemed genuinely interested in our plans for our stay - and we were up in our room, overlooking Marylebone Lane, on the 2nd floor in no time.  The room was a good size - very tasteful decor  - with flat screen TV, mini-bar, coffee maker, iron etc (no safe unfortunately - is that standard for UK hotels?), and what proved to be a very comfortable bed.  The bathroom was small but perfectly formed with nice toiletries.

Continental breakfast, which was included in our room rate, was fine, but I don't think I would have paid £13.50 a head for it.

The business centre was complimentary and we found it really useful because we forgot to bring a laptop - free broadband access was available throughout.

Public rooms were gorgeous - all beautifully furnished, some open, some tucked away - and we loved the bar (108 Marylebone Lane).  We installed ourselves there every afternoon with a pot of tea to enjoy the bustle of Marylebone Lane - and most evenings too with a glass of wine.  Didn't think bar prices were too bad - £4.50 for a glass of wine isn't unreasonable for such a smart hotel.

We didn't eat in the hotel only because there are soooo many fabulous restaurants nearby to choose from.  We invariably headed towards Oxford Street - James Street & St Christopher's Place are lined with chains and independent restaurants both - particularly as our favourite Thai restaurant (Chada Chada) is in the vicinity.  Next time we will head off to Marylebone High Street to see what culinary delights it has to offer.

Yes, dear Reader, we will definitely be going back.  We paid for this stay using Airmiles - but I enjoyed  this hotel so much, that it could become my hotel of choice for my London breaks - even if I have to pay cash!",5,2009,03,18
123,Good- apart from the stench of urine in the first room we were given!!,"We booked a room for two nights at the Jurys Clfiton Ford via a third party at a discount price so perhaps I can't complain too much. First of all, we checked in to our room which was on the small side although that didn't bother me too much as we were only staying for two days. The shower room was too, very cramped. If you are on the larger size you most probably wouldnt fit. On entering the room there was an overwhelming stench of urine which was due to the toilet leaking. How they could not have noticed that was beyond me but the fact that I got the room at a discount price made me think that they perhaps did not care that I had that room? I politely told the reception about the rpoblem but they told me that they could not move me to another room until the maintenance guy was in which was the next day. The following morning I followed up my call and asked for the maintenance guy to come along. He did and they did manage to move us to a much larger suite with a huge bathroom which was lovely. 
I cannot comment on the restaurant as I never ate there. The bar served very nice cocktails although part of the bar was out of bounds due to a ceiling leak. Overall, the hotel was nice and staff pleasant. it was just a shame that 50% of my time there was ruined.",3,2009,03,18
123,really nice hotel great location wonderful service,"really enjoyed my stay at the hotel
first of all, location is everything because you  are near bond street station, central line in london
besides that oxford street is a 5 minute walk from the hotel
the staff is extremely well trained, very friendly, helped me in my ways
concierge always ready to help you too with your stay around, giving you got tips about the tube and everything
the food is excellent, from the restaurant to the bar, just great
apart from that, what they call `continental breakfast` is more of a buffet
i felt really well treated
the room, however small, is very nice, lcd tv, air, iron, hair dryer, mini bar, coffe , everything you nedd
you can really sleep well there, I stayed for more than a week  - this is a busy hotel - and I had no problem at all to sleep
the internet in the room worked just fine
i can keep telling you good stuff but you have to come and see
ah, you have the spa downstairs with gym pool everything
definetely would come back again",4,2009,03,16
123,Very good value for money in stylish hotel,"I stayed here recently for one night, from a Saturday to a Sunday and I made my booking through booking.com which all went very well.  They gave me a rate of £113 including VAT but excluding breakfast which I thought was good, judging by the standard of the hotel.  

It has an excellent location, minutes from Oxford Street, yet in a relatively quiet street.  First impression was that the hotel looked very good and it was nicely decorated in a modern and stylish way.  The reception staff were quick and helpful and offered to store our bags as our room wasn't ready (we arrived early).  The other option was an upgrade to a better room for only £20, and that room was available immediately so we went for that.
Our room was a Junior Suite and it was great.  Not as big as you'd perhaps think with the word 'suite' but ample enough with a nice seating area, good wardrobes, an espresso machine, ironing board, good hairdryer, nice desk, massive flat screen tv and so on.  The bathroom was big and the bed was very good.  The room looked expensive and was nicely decorated in every way.

I can't really complain about anything in the room but if pushed I'd say that there wasn't really anywhere to hang wet towels in the bathroom, and, when standing in the bath to have a shower the ceiling is very low so a 6 footer plus might have problems!
My sister noticed the elevators a bit during the night so if you are sensitive to noise ask for a room away from them.

The staff were excellent!  Very helpful, friendly and accommodating with all our requests.  We had breakfast there (but not dinner) and that was also a very good experience.  Nice looking restaurant, plenty of choice, great quality food and service with a smile.

For my sister and I this was a lovely stay, in a boutique hotel that delivered on all levels.  All in all I would definitely come back, and recommed it highly to anyone!",5,2009,03,09
123,Marylebone ticks lots of boxes,"I liked this hotel - great location within Marylebone Village, near tourist attractions.

It has had a refurb and also has a Fitness Centre and pool.",4,2009,03,06
123,Unique and great location!,"I stayed at this hotel in December and had a wonderful experience. The hotel is beautiful with a large reception area and several small lounges through the main floor.

I would recommend this hotel for first time travelers to London because of the helpful staff and because it is close to the underground and walking distance from some great restaurants,",5,2009,03,03
123,Tony Top Man,"Just back from a 3 day stay at this hotel, really chuffed with our break. Hotel is ideally located with a large reception area which eases the booking in process.Staff are very attentive and polite.Room were fresh clean and airy and away from the hustle and bustle which allowed us to have a good nights sleep. The gym facilities are excellent again with impressive ,knowlegeable and polite staff who were on call during our sessions. Location can not be beaten and always glad to get back to the hotel after a hard day shopping and sightseeing.However Tony the concierge is really top man, he can hunt you down tickets for a show advise on shopping and transport and has a vast knowledge of the city.He always seems to be around of if not has just gone for a cuppa and will be back in 5 minutes to assist.This guy realyy makes the hotel work smoothly and added to our enjoyment.

123,Disaster from start to finish.,"My partner and I went on holiday to London at the end of January. We chose this hotel because it was super central and because it seemed that we would also be able to enjoy the city, the hotel and its amenities; In the end we just enjoyed the city. It started when at check-in they informed us that we had to make a deposit of £200 (being 4 nights, £50 for each one) which would be returned to us upon departure (it would take between 3 and 5 days). work), since it took two weeks to arrive to us, after contacting the hotel. I think they should be more formal, both when notifying the amount when making the reservation and when it is returned. The girl who checked us in did not explain anything to us about how we could use the pool, how the breakfast issue was going, which we had included, NOTHING, she just limited herself to charging and that's it. The first day we decided to go down to the pool and since no one had told us anything, we went down with our bathing suit and bathrobe (we have been to other hotels and that is how we have always done it), because in addition to being an odyssey finding the pool When we arrived, a girl ran out telling us that we couldn't get in that way and that we had to wear our clothes and there we were changing, something that no one had told us. We felt so uncomfortable that we didn't go to the pool any day. That same night we entered the hotel after going to smoke and we were in tracksuits, and one of the girls at the reception looked us up and down and asked us if we needed help, as if we weren't in the hotel. This already seemed like the culmination to me, where is the attention of a 5-star hotel? Conspicuous by its absence. In addition to all this, one day they opened the door to our room while we were inside, with the do not disturb sign to ask us if we wanted room service, and on the last night they called us by phone at 11:30 p.m., saying they had to go upstairs to the room to check if there was a leak. The truth is that we have been to many hotels and this one does not even have the category of a 2 star. Nothing like this has ever happened to us, we couldn't believe everything that was happening to us.
Regarding the room, a sloppy bathroom and an uncomfortable shower, the bed I have to say was very comfortable (less so), we tried to put on the chromecast and it didn't work, they tried to solve it but it was unsuccessful. Finally, the breakfast is not worth it since they have four things badly listed in a kind of buffet and if you want bacon, butter, sausages or an English breakfast, you order it by letter and they bring it to you as soon as you sit down.
It makes me sad to make these types of comments since every time I do it it is for the best, but I feel obliged to make people who are thinking about booking think twice, and above all to improve the service for the public and Don't let them see how you are dressed or not, you are paying the £350 per night. They have never made us feel so uncomfortable, after all you are on vacation and what you want is to be calm, enjoy and be comfortable as if you were at home, something that within this hotel we have not achieved even one day.",1,2024,02,17
123,"Great, tasteful and central hotel","I am a regular visitor to London and have stayed in a wide variety of hotels. This time (2 nights) I chose The Marylebone because of its proximity to the Elizabeth Line. The location in Central London is perfect for shopaholics. Selfrides, for example, is just around the corner.
I was greeted warmly upon arrival and was able to move into my room straight away despite the early arrival time. The room, like the entire hotel, is beautifully furnished and everything is in very good condition. The bed was the right balance between hardness and softness for me and I slept very well both nights. Since I only booked room only, I unfortunately cannot rate the breakfast offer.
A big compliment goes to all the staff. Everyone was always very friendly and extremely helpful. This made me feel very comfortable. My status in the hotel program was also recognized at check-in and I received the corresponding benefits.
The hotel has a partnership with the Third Space Gym in the same building. Unfortunately I didn't have time to visit this this time, but I have made a firm plan to do so for my next stay.

Wir bedanken uns für die tolle Zeit und hoffen Mrs Alba Martinez bei nächsten Besuch zu treffen.

123,Buen hotel en un barrio muy agradable,"Siempre que vamos a Londres nos quedamos en el Melia (The White House) y esta vez queríamos cambiar. El barrio donde se ubica el Marylebone es muy bonito, tranquilo y agradable. Por eso y porque nos lo habían aconsejado unos amigos, reservamos este hotel. 
Es más caro que el Melia, pero es otra experiencia. El restaurante es muy agradable (para tomar unos cocktails), aunque nos cenamos en él. 
Poder usar la piscina cubierta del gimnasio de al lado, con el que el hotel tiene acuerdo, es muy cómodo.",5,2022,09,11
123,Bellissima esperienza,"Abbiamo soggiornato due notti in questo splendido Hotel, con una posizione eccellente. Le camere confortevoli e pulite, soprattutto il letto e i cuscini comodissimi.

Mi  sono trovata veramente bene! Vorrei ringraziare a Tutto il personale (dal portiere alla reception, bar e ristorante) per la gentilezza, professionalità e disponibilità. 
Il ristorante è ottimo (dove la minestra del giorno e sempre ottima e cosa dire del pesce e della carne, ottima qualità e preparazioni dei piatti) grazie ad Andrea  per la sua gentilezza e ottimo consiglio del vino.",5,2020,02,19
123,Londra... prima della Brexit😉,"Bellissimo hotel.
Situato a qualche centinaio di metri da Oxford Street, ma vicinissimo alla metro, in una zona tranquilla e ricca di bei locali.
Vi abbiamo soggiornato per 4 notti.
Belle camere, letto comodissimo e un mega tv, 
solo il bagno un po’ piccolo.
La colazione, che consiglio di prenotarla full ( include oltre al buffet anche piatti caldi dalla cucina) offre di tutto, dal dolce al salato. Ottime le omelette e il bacon e perché no le salsicce.
Siete indecisi? 
 Chiedete a Francesco, sempre  attento e disponibile saprà consigliarvi su tutto quello che offre la cucina e ad esaudire ogni vostra richiesta culinaria o semplice capriccio.
Consigliatissimo 👍",5,2020,02,08

123,Ein sehr angenehmer Aufenthalt,"Ein ideal gelegenes Hotel (5 Gehminuten von Oxford Circus) mit recht kleinen, aber schönen Zimmern. Leckeres Frühstück und ausgesprochen freundliches Personal. Besonders erwähnen möchte ich Andrei und das restliche Concierge-Team. Er und seine Herren haben mir mehrfach mit ihrer freundlichen und schnellen Hilfe den Tag gerettet, wofür ich sehr dankbar bin.

123,"Posizione Top, bellissima palestra","Ottima posizione in una delle zone più belle di Londra!
La mia camera era nel complesso confortevole (ottimi materassi) seppur angusta e con un odore forte di qualche prodotto (forse una vernice da legno); il bagno era davvero troppo piccolo (con la vasca e una doccia ricavata al suo interno). 
Spazi comuni curati ma il punto debole sono i corridoi angusti, bui e tutti in moquette!
La palestra dell’hotel è davvero magnifica, con diverse zone super organizzare (dal Crossfit, allo spinning, ai treadmill, ecc...) ed addirittura dei corsi con personale qualificato!
La colazione standard un po’ povera e con molte cose alla carta da pagarsi a parte!
Nel complesso ottima scelta sia business che turistico!",4,2019,07,29
123,Posto perfetto per lavoro e vacanza ,Sono venuta a Londra per la seconda volta con mio marito qui per lavoro. Entrambi siamo stati davvero bene!

123,Sentirsi a Casa a Londra,"Se per voi un albergo non è solo un luogo dove dormire, ma dove trovare cordialità, gentilezza, insomma se per voi soggiornare in un albergo vuole essere come sentirsi a casa, THE MARYLEBONE HOTEL è quello che fa per voi.
Situato nel cuore del quartiere Marylebone, l'albergo è in una zona più che tranquilla e silenziosa, ma a pochi passi dalla centrale Oxford Street, dove troverete la fermata della metro Bond Street, o da luoghi dove rilassarsi come i bellissimi parchi Regents Street e Hyde Park, e comunque troverete sempre un taxi a vostra disposizione fuori dall'hotel pronto a portarvi dove volete.
Tutto lo staff del THE MARYLEBONE è a vostra disposizione per ogni esigenza o necessità: la cordialità e disponibilità di Mrs. Theano Karathanasopoulou, la Guest Relations Manager, renderà il vostro soggiorno al top di ogni possibilità, come la gentilezza e presenza per ogni esigenza di Mrs. Olga Nikoltsou, Director of Sales. Al loro fianco il fantastico team della Concierge, efficiente, sempre pronto ad ogni necessità, come il personale della reception, gentile che vi accoglierà sempre con un sorriso. Un elogio anche al team del Room Service, e a tutto lo staff dell'albergo.
Troverete un ampia scelte di camere, tutte confortevoli, pulite e con wi-fi. Il top, che consiglio vivamente, sono le Suite Luxury, le Suite Terrace o la bellissima Presidential Suite,con una bellissima terrazza e vista mozzafiato sulla città. 
All'interno dell'albergo troverete il ritstorante 108 Brasserie che offre un menù ottimo, 108 Pantry per le eccellenti colazioni e non solo e il fantastico Cocktail bar, dove non potete non assaggiare lo strepitoso Gin Tonic con il Marylebone Gin, e per finire una salutare  palestra con piscina.
Insomma, efficienza, gentilezza, qualità: tre aggettivi per definire l'albergo dove più mi sono sentito a casa tra quelli dove ho alloggiato viaggiando, grazie alla supervisione di Mrs. Theano Karathanasopoulou. 
L'ideale direi per visitare la bellissima Londra e i suoi dintorni!",5,2019,04,01

123,Sehr gutes Hotel mit besonders freundlichem Personal,"Das Hotel ist zentral aber dennoch ruhig gelegen.
Wir waren zu zweit im Marylebone und hatten zuvor ein ruhiges Zimmer angefragt. Der Empfang war sehr herzlich und wir bekamen in der Tat unser zuvor gewünschtes ruhiges Zimmer. Nachts hörte man die anderen Hotelgäste nicht. Auch sind die sonstigen ""Nebengeräusche"" kaum wahrnehmbar.
Die Zimmer sind mit Teppichboden ausgelegt und waren sehr sauber. Das Bett war sehr gut. Auch das Bad war sehr sauber; alles machte einen sehr ordentlichen Eindruck. Abends wurden die Betten noch einmal zum Schlafen zurecht gemacht. Ein kleines ""Betthupferl"" lag auf dem Nachttisch.
Eine individuell einstellbare Klimaanlage war in unserem Zimmer vorhanden.

Das Frühstücksbuffet ist sehr reichhaltig (Wurst, Käse, Müsli, Marmelade,gekochte Eier,frisches Obst u.a.); verschiedene Brotsorten werden vorgehalten. Toast wird auf Wunsch an den Tisch gebracht
Das gesamte Personal ist sehr bemüht, allen Gästen einen angenehmen Aufenthalt zu bereiten.

123,Un ottimo Hotel,"The Marylebone è un ottimo hotel che offre un ampia gamma di camere, molto confortevoli, e delle Suite con terrazza e viste su Londra molto belle. Ho soggiornato nella Suite con la terrazza più grande: fare colazione al mattino guardando Londra dal settimo piano è davvero suggestivo. La Suite è molto ampia con angolo cucina (intendo macchina Nespresso, lavandino, accessori vari), un ampio living room e una bella camera da letto. Il bagno con doccia e vasca. Molta luce naturale, bellissimo in questi giorni di sole, sia dalla terrazza sia da alcuni lucernai. Lo staff è cordiale, professionale e molto disponibile. Non ho mai avuto problemi, anzi i problemi sono stati risolti in anticipo dallo Staff stesso. Marylebone è un quartiere molto tranquillo, elegante (ma non snob) e dall'albergo in pochi minuti si può raggiungere Oxford Street, da dove passano diverse linee di bus, e sempre in pochi minuti (meno di 10) si raggiunge la stazione della metro Bond Street. 
Hotel più che consigliato.",5,2018,05,14
123,Chices boutique hotel ,"Gemütliches und sehr zentral gelegenes Hotel. Das Personal ist sehr freundlich und hilfsbereit. Die lobby sowie die Bar ist sehr einladend und trumpft mit wohlfühlfaktor. Die Zimmer sind leider etwas klein, deshalb 4 Punkte. ",4,2018,02,06
123,Magnífico hotel en Londres,"La situación del Marylebone es excelente, en un barrio muy agradable y cerca de Oxford Street. Buena comunicación con otras zonas por medio de metro y autobuses.
Lo que hace que este hotel sea realmente agradable y especial es el trato de su personal. Es muy gratificante que el recibimiento sea tan cordial y amistoso. Tengo que mencionar especialmente a Lukas, que fue extremadamente amable: aunque llegamos antes de la hora del check-in, nos ofreció invitaciones a alguna bebida en el bar del lobby mientras esperábamos.
También fue muy amable y amistosa María cuando hicimos el check-out. Se agradece mucho tanto la sonrisa como la profesionalidad exquisita.
La habitación, estupenda: amplia, tranquila respecto a ruidos (daba a la calle, pero sin que fuera molesto) y muy cómoda. Ya casi no se ve en otros hoteles, pero esa atención del agua de cortesía o los bombones por la noche hacen que todo sea más agradable y cálido.
El desayuno bastante bien. Nuevamente, el personal sonriente y eficaz a pesar de la gran afluencia de huéspedes.
Quiero destacar el gimnasio: nunca había estado en un hotel en el que hubiera unas instalaciones tan estupendas (piscina incluida). Merece mucho la pena. 
En resumen, hotel perfecto para alojarse en Londres.",5,2018,01,25
123,Trato Excelente,"Gran hotel en el centro de Londres pero en la zona menos bulliciosa, al lado de las mejores tiendas de Londres.
 El hotel tiene mucho encanto con exquisita decoración decó. La atención de Maria, del Front Desk, y del resto del staff excelente, te hacen sentir mejor que en casa.

123,Ottima esperienza,"Ho soggiornato per motivi di lavoro ben 10 giorni in questo albergo londinese. Considerato che Londra è una città assurdamente cara devo ammettere che il Marylebone ha un ottimo rapporto qualità/prezzo. Questo hotel è molto carino, pulito e le camere non sono shoe box, unico neo l'armadio davvero troppo piccolo. Letto comodo e pulizia impeccabile. Alla reception sono molto gentili e per gli ospiti c'è sempre a disposizione acqua, limone e menta.. buona e abbondante la prima colazione servita in un ristorante accogliente e carino. Last but not least L'hotel è anche dotato di palestra con piscina. Il quartiere di Marylebone è comodo e tranquillo e vicino all'albergo c'è un ristorante indiano carinissimo e buono. ",4,2017,10,27

Lo super recomiendo.",5,2017,10,17
123,"Lage, Atmosphäre, Betreuung - 1a - jederzeit wieder (und ggf. schon dies Jahr!)","Das Marylebone war aufgrund der Nähe zu Soho und der Oxford Street meine erste Wahl für einen Premiere-Trip für meine beste Freundin, ihr London vorzustellen. Das Hotel besticht durch einen europäischen (einrichtungstechnischem) Charme mit zugleich britischer Betreuung: Jede Abteilung, vom Concierge bis zur Brassiere, von der Rezeption bis zum Zimmermädchen war freundlich, intensiv bemüht, einem die angenehmste Zeit möglich zu machen. Die Tatsache, dass davon einige sogar Deutsche waren, sorgt für den ein oder anderen Leser (m/w) dieser Bewegung ggf. ja dazu, sich für dies Hotel auch aus solchen Gründen zu entscheiden. Zur Tube dauert es ca. 5min zu Fuß durch ein bereits von Gastronomie begleitetes Viertel, Soho selbst bietet immens viele Möglichkeiten, sich beim Shoppen oder mit Anbindung bis hinein ins Musical-Zentrum ""West End"" zu amüsieren. Ideal ist, dass das Spa wirklich top angenehm ist. Hier wäre alleine das Handicap zu nennen, dass es am Wochenende, speziell Sonntag, um 20:00 schließt, und man sich ggf. wünschen würde, nach der ganzen Lauferei noch mal zu entspannen. Frühstück und Bar late night waren top und abwechslungsreich, Zimmer unserer Kategorie dem Anlass entsprechend, die Bäder ggf. etwas kleiner, aber auch hier zählt: Top-Gesamterfahrung und die Vorfreude auf das nächste Mal zählt. Wer sich wohlfühlen will, und in einem gepflegten und zentrumsnahen Viertel Ruhe wie City-Flair zugleich erleben will, wählt das Marylebone. Und wer PERSÖNLICH behandelt werden möchte, der sowieso. Das Team war einfach spitze.",5,2017,10,12
123,Francesco il top ,"Sono stato quest oggi insieme ad un collega , abbiamo avuto il piacere di conoscere francesco ragazzo italiano dal buon gusto e bell aspetto! Ci ha consigliato un buon vino e un buonissimo dessert ! Servizio impeccabile tanta voglia di rendere la nostra esperienza unica e indimenticabile! Bravissimo francesco ",4,2017,10,09
123,Durchschnittlich,"Wir waren für ein längeres Weekend in London und wollten vor allem ein ruhiges Zimmer. Das haben wir beim Marylebone auch erhalten. und die Lage war auch sehr gut. Sonst ist es eher durchschnittlich. Die Zimmer sind schon etwas in die Jahre gekommen. Vor allem das Bad hatte einige Mängel (inkl. Flecken auf der Klobrille, was üüüberhaupt nicht geht!). 
Der Concierge am Freitagabend war überfordert, als wir ihn nach einem guten Restaurant fragten und meinte nur, es sei sowieso alles ausgebucht! Fail! 
Es war ok für diese 2 Nächte, weil man eh nur im Zimmer ist zum schlafen. Aber nochmals dorthin würde ich nicht.",3,2017,09,27
123,Gran opción en londres,"Si bien el hotel por si mismo es fantástico, la atención de su personal lo hace excepcional. Desde el momento que llegas el personal del hotel hace lo imposible para que realmente te sientas en casa. La habitación es amplia y muy limpia, la cama es extremadamente cómoda.
Los alimentos son de excelente calidad y las porciones son perfectas.
Tengo que mencionar en particular la atención del portero Rama!

123,Fantástica situación y atencion,"Aparte una situación muy cerca de todo, lo que más llama la atención es la cantidad y la calidad del personal que atiende en este hotel.

123,Super Service,"Wir sind notfallmässig nach dem Grounding der BA im ""The Marylebone Hotel"" gelandet. Das Personal hat sich sehr bemüht uns, familienfreundliche Zimmer zur Verfügung zu stellen.

Lo mejor la cercanía a Oxford st.",3,2017,06,11
123,La excelencia en hoteleria y calidad humana,"Fuimos recomendados sin conocerlo y la verdad es que desde la ubicación , la habitación muy confortable, sin ser de las más caras y pasando por la calidad de su gente , hizo una estadía espectacular..
Quiero destacar y agradecer especialmentea Ismail Rahim y a María Ramón que hicieron que nuestra estadía haya sido suprema , Gracias a todos igualmente",5,2017,06,10
123,Relación calidad precio muy mala,"Fuimos una familia de 10 personas (4 de ellas niños). En recepción tuvimos un problema con la reserva pero nos la solucionaron. Nos dieron un habitación en cada punta del hotel. Yo estaba con mis dos hijas en la 549 y mi marido con mis dos hijos en la 142. El hotel estaba completo y no nos pudieron dar habitaciones contiguas. Mis padres y mi hermano en otras. Las habitaciones tenían en mismo precio. La habitación de mi marido era espaciosa, exterior con un buen cuarto de baño y una buena ducha. La mía era un ""cuchitril"" interior, pequeña, con forma de L. El baño era pequeño, tenía una ducha con una mampara de unos 40 cm, cada vez que te duchabas se mojaba todo el baño. Mi hermano estaba en la 450 y todavía era más pequeña. Entiendo que haya estas habitaciones pero no pueden cobrarlas al precio de las normales.

En recepción fueron muy amables, regalaron unos ositos a los niños y un cuaderno para pintar, a pesar de esto no lo recomiendo para niños, es un hotel de adultos.

El desayuno deja mucho que desear, los platos calientes hay que pedirlos, yo el primer día pedí una tortilla y estaba súper seca, no volví a pedir, a parte que eran treméndamente lentos. Había algo de bollería industrial (nada casera) y de dulces unos mini muffins, ni galletas ni nada. De cereales sólo había Corn Flakes y Rice Crispies. Para los niños nada apetecible. Tenías un bol de fruta cortada que le iban reponiendo sobre la marcha. No había mas para elegir. También había fiambre y dos tipos de queso. Para mí muy justo para un hotel de 400 libras la noche.

Fuimos todos los días a cenar porque era el sitio más cómodo con los niños, un día nos tardaron en servir 1h y 15 minutos!!! y vino un camarero a disculparse diciendo que cómo eramos 10 tardaban mucho. Al día siguiente nos pidió disculpas La comida estaba buena pero muy lentos.

Lo más increíble del restaurante que el el sábado pedimos unas pintas y no tenían cerveza!!!! sólo Guiness!!! Un sábado por la noche!!! Pedimos unos botellines. Al rato nos dijeron que ya tenían (supongo que estaban cambiando el barril pero no nos habían dicho nada), nos trajeron las pintas y dos de las anteriores no nos las cobrar. 

Si este hotel costara 200 libras no tendría quejas pero por 400 libras creo que no pueden estar continuamente haciendo esas cosas. He de decir que el personal era bastante amable.",1,2017,05,16

Localización en un bario precioso y con mucha actividad, restaurantes y bares.",4,2017,04,24
123,Una experiencia muy recomendable,"Hotel situado en un barrio muy tranquilo y a la vez muy céntrico de la capital inglesa. Precio asequible para el tipo de hotel que es. En recepción hay una española, María Pardo, que nos atendió durante todo el fin de semana estupendamente, dándonos consejos sobre la ciudad muy útiles. ",5,2017,04,03
123,Mary lebone,"El Mary lebone es un hotel excelente, muy cómodo, bien equipado,  un ambiente cálido y con muy buena predisposición de parte del personal.
Siempre atentos al huesped.
Como ejemplo , pongo al sr fabrizio de la recepción, muy gentil y efeciente ante la menor inquietud.
Un hotel muy recomendable",5,2017,03,21
123,Esperienza stupenda,"Ci siamo trovati in un albergo fantastico, confortati in ogni ambiente. Dalla camera al ristorante, perfino in palestra. Fabrizio ci consigliato la cena del ristorante, veramente sublime. Servizio impeccabile. Stupefatto dall'attenzione ai dettagli! ",5,2017,03,09
123,Muy recomendable ,"Muy profesionales y encantadores. Gunther de Recepción nos lo puso todo tan fácil que incluso nos atendió en español. Volvería sin dudarlo, las camas comodísimas, limpio, elegante y funcional y el trato inmejorable",5,2017,02,08
123,Tolles Hotel an perfekter Lage,Wir haben das Hotel bereits zum dritten Mal für unseren Londontrip besucht. Das Hotel ist sehr zentral gelegen und liegt unweit der bekannten Shoppingmeile Oxfordstreet. Die Zimmer weisen für englische Verhältnisse eine gewisse Grösse auf. Das Personal an der Rezeption ist sehr freundlich und hilfsbereit. Das Frühstücksbuffet ist sehr gut.,5,2017,01,11
123,Schöne Lage und sehr freundliches Personal wie z.B. Aurore Civil oder Günther,"Bereits bei der Ankunft wurden wir sehr freundlich empfangen durch Den Mitarbeiter Gunther, der so nett war und meiner Tochter (5 Jahre alt) einen Teddybär in die Hand gedrückt hat.
Das Hotel liegt in einer wirklich schönen und sehr ruhigen Gegend.
Das Hotel ist neun und sehr geschmackvoll eingerichtet und alle Mitarbeiter bemühen sich sehr freundlich und hilfsbereit den Aufenthalt so angenehm zu machen wie möglich.

Mitarbeiter die uns sehr positiv aufgefallen sind, waren Günther, Aurore, Jean und ein italienischer Mitarbeiter vom Empfang.
Die Mitarbeiter vom Restaurant waren ebenfalls sehr freundlich und sehr nett.

Das Marylebone kann man wirklich empfehlen, es ist ein sehr schönes Hotel mit super Personal.",5,2017,01,08
123,ottimo servizio,"Ottimo hotel, ambienti curati, pulito, buona colazione. Molto cortesi alla reception in particolare Fabrizio sempre molto disponibile per ogni necessità. Situato in una trasversale di Oxford Street a circa  dieci minuti a piedi dalla stazione metropolitana Bond Street.",4,2017,01,06
123,3 dias increibles,"Ha sido la tercera vez que hemos estado en Londres mi mujer y yo y sin duda este es el mejor hotel en el que hemos estado con diferencia. Se dice que los hoteles de Londres no concuerdan con las estrellas en relación a hoteles del resto del mundo pero este tiene 4 estrellas y podríamos decir que se merecería 4 estrellas y media.

La atención desde el segundo uno de nuestra llegada ha sido extraordinaria, el personal es excepcional. 

La habitación, limpia, espaciosa, una cama increíblemente cómoda, nespresso, hervidor para el te...una maravilla. Con moqueta como todos eso si jeje.

El desayuno continental muy rico, no mucha variedad, pero no hace falta mas la verdad. 

La ubicación fantástica, es cierto que siempre nos alojamos por la zona de Marylebone/Regent's Park por su tranquilidad y cercanía a Oxford Street y a la estación de metro de Bond Street (5 minutos) 

El check-in muy rápido, y solo te bloquean 50£ en la tarjeta a diferencia de otros hoteles que prácticamente te bloquean la estancia entera. El check-out igual de rápido, aunque lo hicimos a las 4 de la mañana así que es lógico.

No tengo la mas mínima duda de que si volvemos a Londres, y hay la opción, de que volveremos a este hotel. Han sido unos días maravillosos y The Marylebone Hotel ha ayudado a ello.",5,2017,01,05
123,Hermoso hotel,"Pasé unos dias en este hotel con mi novio y todo fue perfecto! La ubicacion, las habitaciones, el desayuno, la atención del personal. Muy recomendable!!! Gunther en recepción un genio!! Hizo que nuestra estadia en el hotel sea aun mejor!! Siempre dispuesto a ayudarnos y super atento!! Gracias Gunther!!!",5,2017,01,03
123,"Unos días increíbles en el Marylebone, gracias Gunther!!","Hemos pasado unos días magníficos en este hermoso hote!!! Totalmente recomendable!! Las habitaciones son muy lindas y limpias, la ubicación es excelente y la atención también. Queremos destacar por sobre todas las cosas la excelente atención y predisposición de Gunther!!! Siempre atento y dispuesto a ayudar a los turistas en todo momento!!! Gracia Gunther!!!",5,2016,12,31
123,Magnifico  Hotel in Marylebone (Londdra),Ho soggiornato 3 notti in questo bellissimo Hotel nel centro di Londra (quartiere Marylebone a 200 metri da Bond Street). Eccellente 5 stelle in ogni servizio. Ovviamente il prezzo riflette sia la sua posizione startegica a Londra sia il fatto di essere un 5 stelle.,5,2016,12,16
123,Elegantes Hotel in perfekter Lage,"Für ein verlängertes Wochenende in London haben wir uns schon zum zweiten Mal für das THE MARYLEBONE entschieden. Das Hotel liegt etwas versteckt in einer ruhigen Seitenstraße, von der man schnell die quirlige Oxford Street und auch die U-Bahn-Station Bond Street erreichen kann. Wer gut zu Fuß ist, kann auch zu vielen Sehenswürdigkeiten zu Fuß gehen, wie z.B. Piccadilly Circus, Soho oder Hyde Park. Das Zimmer meiner Meinung nach nicht zu klein, gut ausgestattet und der Zimmerservice kommt sogar zweimal am Tag. Besonders hervorzuheben: der beheizte Bad-Boden und die Nespresso-Maschine für den Kaffee-Start am Morgen! Ganz toll auch der große Pool im Untergeschoß des Hotels. Wir kommen gerne wieder!",5,2016,12,06
123,"Ottima posizione, stanze minuscole","Ho soggiornato 4 anni fa per lavoro presso questo hotel, ho deciso di tornarci per 'una toccata e fuga' di una notte, data la qualità e l'ottima posizione della struttura.
Staff gentilissimo, tra l'altro sia al check in che check out ho trovato personale italiano.
Si trova a 5 minuti da Oxford Street, fermata della metro di Bond Street e 10 min dalla fermata di Oxford Circus. Unica pecca a mio avviso, la dimensione della camera... veramente piccola, una doppia che in realtà sarebbe accettabile ad uso singola! Per una notte direi che va bene. Riguardo il prezzo... visti i costi di Londra, direi che per un 4 stelle in questa zona sia abbastanza accettabile, ma non sicuramente economico!",4,2016,11,14
123,Buono,"Ci ero stato circa 4 anni fa.Lo ricordavo meglio.Ha un ottimo rapporto qualita'/prezzo.Do un punto in meno per la colazione,per avere il caffe' e il pane tostato abbiamo aspettato 20 min..
Comunque posizione ottima.",3,2016,10,31
123,Hotel muy recomendable,"Estuve en este hotel un fin de semana. La ubicación es perfecta, el hotel es muy bonito, las habitaciones acogedoras, y la cama comodísima. Todo el personal fue muy atento en todo momento y siempre dispuesto a ayudar, en especial Gunther en la recepción. Sin duda volveremos pronto.",5,2016,10,23
123,Sehr zentral gelegen....,"Das Hotel ist sehr zentral gelegen und ideal zum shoppen an der Oxford Street. Das Bett ist sehr bequem. Ebenfalls war das Personal hilfsbereit und freundlich. 
Das Zimmer war klein, aus Erfahrung jedoch in Ordnung für London. Das Badezimmer war am Limit von der Grösse und der Sauberkeit ....  die Toilette war verschmutzt bei Ankunft, Badewanne und Duschkopf müssten dringend entkalkt werden, am Bademantel hing eine tote Mücke. Duschgarnitur sollte auch mal wieder gerichtet oder ersetzt werden da schief. Mein Zimmer war direkt gegenüber dem Materialraum für die Mitarbeiterinnen welche sich um die Zimmer gekümmert haben, daher war es am Abend lärmig bis 23h und am Sonntag ab 08h. Dies fand ich sehr störend und mühsam. 

Zusammengefasst, für den Preis habe ich mehr erwartet und würde dieses Hotel wohl nicht mehr buchen.",2,2016,10,17
123,Moderno-habitaciones muy pequeñas,"El hotel tiene las habitaciones modernas. Los baños son minúsculos... solo entra una persona.
Muy cerca de Oxford St. El barrio Marylebone es un lugar lleno de encanto con muchos pubs con ambiente bueno y cafeterías para desayunar! 
A pesar de los baños... recomendable.
* Muy limipio",4,2016,09,25
123,Excelente ubicación y servicio,"El hotel esta súper bien ubicado, a unas cuadras de Oxford Street, del subte línea Bond Street y de todas las atracciones turísticas y artísticas de Londres. Las habitaciones son correctas para Europa, bien equipadas, las camas súper cómodas, el baño moderno y todo impecable y limpio. Destacó la amabilidad de John de la recepción y del personal del hotel en general que nos hicieron pasar unos días espectaculares. La relación calidad precio es correcta. ",5,2016,09,24
123,Hotel mono con camas incómodas,"Estuvimos alojados tres noches en este hotel y el personal es super amable, nos atendieron fenomenal y siempre con intención de agradar.
nos alojamos en una habitación superior y era espaciosa aunque la lámpara no funcionaba y no habia demasiada luz. El problema mayor fue la cama, super incómoda, parecia como si estuviera demasiado usada, se hundía demasiado y en el baño, el lavabo no tragaba nada bien y la bañera super estrecha. Es una pena porque las dos cosas mas importantes de un hotel, la cama y la ducha, dejaban mucho que desear. ",3,2016,09,21
123,Gutes Mittelklassehotel,"Die Zimmer sind solide ausgestattet, das Personal an der Rezeption freundlich. Im Restaurant mit dem guten, aber nicht überragenden Frühstück war das Personal nicht besonders aufmerksam, daher erreicht das Hotel hier meines Erachtens nach nur unteres Mittelmaß, was zur entsprechenden Gesamtbewertung führt. ",3,2016,09,19
123,Buon Hotel stanze piccole,"Viaggio di lavoro a Londra ma in assenza di stanze disponibili nel solito hotel mi viene prenotato questo albergo.
Personale molto gentile, reception piccola ma tutto curato.

Stessa cosa per le stanze molto curate con un comodo letto e cuscini magnifici ma davvero troppo piccola almeno la mia superior room. Stanze ""doppie"" ma dove a malapena ci si rigira una persona da sola

Insomma va bene per passarci una notte durante un biz trip ma certo impossibile pensare che una coppia in visita a Londra per un week end lungo possa soggiornare li 

Considerando il costo poi e lo status dell'hotel mi sarei aspettato ben altra soluzione logistica e metratura

Posizione ottima invece",3,2016,09,13
123,Una base en Londres,"Es un hotel excelente, con los lujos necesarios para la comodidad pero sin los superfluos. Resulta caro comparado con los hoteles en España, y con los hoteles londinenses de paquete turístico, que tienen un nivel MUY alejado de este. Pero vale la pena porque te permite sentirte cómodo en un sitio excelente, del que puedes entrar y salir por atrás, sin pasar por recepción, como si estuvieras en apartamento propio, al corazón de Marylebone, un auténtico pueblecito inglés en el centro de Londres. Hace años que solamente voy a este hotel, y no pienso cambiar. Si tienes la suerte de encontrar en recepción a Gunther (extraordinariamente amable), tendrás la seguridad de que hará que tu estancia sea lo mejor posible.",5,2016,09,11
123,Un soggiorno a Londra,L'hotel è situato in posizione strategica per raggiungere la maggior parte degli. hot  spot della città a piedi. Anche le fermate della metropolitana non sono lontane. L'hotel è molto confortevole e pulito. Corretto il rapporto qualità prezzo,5,2016,08,08
123,Excelente,Muy bueno el hotel y todo el personal a excepción de una responsable de habla hispana del desayuno vestida de rojo que fue muy desagradable sin embargo el resto del personal excelente sobre todo una chica de Estonia y otra de Toledo muy agradables educadas y amables,4,2016,08,07
123,Hotel muy tranquilo y bien situado pero muy caro,"Un buen hotel muy bien situado en la elegante y tranquila zona de Marylebone, aunque es muy caro y no está a la altura de un hotel de lujo. Hemos estado en este hotel muchas veces y la experiencia siempre ha sido buena pero esta última vez he encontrado algunos fallos. No había personal en la entrada para ayudarnos con las maletas, el recepcionista no era muy amable y la habitación, aunque cómoda e impecable no correspondía a la categoría de ""Deluxe room"", demasiado pequeña y poco iluminada lo mismo que el baño que era minúsculo. Se puede decir que la relación calidad precio no es buena para un hotel de esta categoría. El personal del servicio de habitaciones era amable y eficaz y el personal de recepción para el check out también. La situación del hotel es perfecta, un par de calles por detrás de Oxford Street por lo que la tranquilidad está asegurada. Seguramente volveré la próxima vez que visite Londres por la situación y la tranquilidad pero intentaré buscar alguna oferta.",4,2016,06,27
123,"Confort, efficienza e cordialità in un elegante albergo nel centro di Londra","Dopo aver soggiornato al The Bloomsbury, The Doyle Collection mi ha di nuovo sorpreso con questo elegante albergo nel quartiere di Marylebone, a due passi da Regent's Park. La cordialità di tutto lo staff è come sempre il punto di forza, a cui aggiungere la comodità delle camere, rifinite con un gusto molto raffinato ma che non mette a disagio, puntando tutto sulla comodità. Alla cordialità si aggiunga l'efficienza di tutto lo staff, dal front-desk alla congierge, sempre pronti a risolvere ogni eventuale problematica ( personalmente ho dovuto spostare un volo alle 5 del mattino e il personale mi ha assistito in ogni mia esigenza ). Si fa una buona colazione, oltre che pranzo e cena, nel ristorante situato nell'albergo, 108 Brasserie, dove troverete sempre personale competente e cordiale.
La zona è molto bella, piena di locali, ristoranti e negozi; un consiglio, non perdetevi la libreria Daunt Books su Marylebone High St, una libreria di origine edoardiana, un piccolo gioiello da visitare.",5,2016,06,26
123,Delizioso,"Posizione ottima.
Camera molto confortevole, silenziosa,e pulita. Bagno ben accessoriato. Letto comodissimo, qualità del sonno ottima. Staff eccezionale: alla reception ottima accoglienza e professionalità, così pure alla sala colazione.
Tutto perfetto e funzionale.
Superconsigliato!",5,2016,06,11
123,Realmente la atención - higiene - desayuno - Cerca de todo - ESPECTACULAR,"Realmente la atención de Gunther en la consejería fue EXCELENTE, siempre dispuesto a solucionar todo tipo de problema,  como así también al personal de habla Hispana que nos ha ayudado todas las veces que fue necesario, tanto en el lugar de desayuno y el restaurant - MUY BUENO TODO",5,2016,06,03
123,Hotel Perfetto,"Una soluzione perfetta che sa abbinare una posizione straordinaria (comoda sia per l'aeroporto, a un paio di fermate da Paddington quindi per l'express direzione Heathrow), in zona Baker Street per il museo di Sherlock Holmes e di Madame Tussauds, vicino al Royal Albert Hall e tanti altri importanti luoghi famosi di Londra) ad un Albergo comodo, confortevole e attento alle esigenze del cliente.
Personale molto gentile, camera forse un po' piccola, ma adeguata alla mia necessità, bella la piscina e l'ampia zona fitness.
Assolutamente Raccomandato.",5,2016,05,26
123,TOP-Hotel in London,"Waren mit 6 Mädels 2 Nächte im Marylebone und es war super. Ich habe für meine Freundin ihren Junggesellinenabschied organisiert und den Concierge und die Rezeption mit allen möglichen Anfragen bombardiert.
Der Service war super, unglaublich hilfbereit. Sogar die Putzfrau war zucker.
Die Boxspringbetten erstaunlich bequem, sehr saubere Zimmer.... Ein 4 Sterne Hotel mit einem Niveau von einem 5 Sterne Hotel. 
Für London Top Preis-Leistungsverhältnis. Ein Doppelzimmer für 2 Nächte ca 400 Pfund.
10 Minuten zu Fuß vom Oxford Circus. Super Lage!!!

Der nächste Besuch geht wieder ins Marylebone!

Großen Dank an Aurora, Elena, Andrea, Zan, Riaz, Emma für den tollen Service und die Unterstützung.",5,2016,05,18
123,Nel cuore pulsante di Marylebone,"Per motivi di lavoro ho trascorso un mese in questo hotel nel cuore pulsante del quartiere di Marylebone. L'albergo ha la hall al piano terra con meravigliose composizioni di fiori freschi che cambiano tutte le settimane.
Da qui si sviluppano 2 corridoi con numerosi salotti arredati con stili diversi a disposizione degli ospiti per sorseggiare una coppa di champagne o leggere un libro davanti al camino.
La mia camera era una superior molto accogliente e pulita, dotata di tutti i comfort e veniva rifatta 2 volte al giorno. In bagno ci sono tutti i prodotti per la cura del corpo e la cosa che più ho apprezzato è stata il pavimento riscaldato.
La colazione viene servita alla 108 Pantry. Bellissimo locale arredato con gusto, dai divanetti rossi in velluto e decorato con i piatti di Rory Dobner. Sempre molto frequentato sia dagli ospiti dell'hotel che da business man per colazioni di lavoro. Ampio e ricco buffet, dal dolce al salato, prodotti bio e brioches fresche. Personale attento e premuroso, professionale e dinamico.
Qualche sera mi è anche capitato di cenare al ristorante dell'hotel. Atmosfera dalla luce soffusa ed elegante, servizio eccellente, menù non molto vario ma cibo ottimo.
Nei miei giorni liberi mi sono dedicata allo shopping in Oxford street raggiungibile in 5 minuti a piedi.
Per questo periodo mi sono sentita coccolata e riempita di attenzioni nonostante lontano da casa. Hotel di ottimo standard che consiglio vivamente a chi si trova in città.",4,2016,05,17
123,Angenehmes Hotel an ruhiger Lage,"Wer eine Übernachtungsmöglichkeit etwas abseits vom Trubel sucht, ist beim Marylebone genau richtig. Dennoch ist man innert 5 Minuten mitten im Trubel der Oxford Street. Zum wunderschönen Regent's Park sind es zu Fuss 10-15 Minuten. 
Das Personal an der Reception ist sehr nett. Unser 'normales' Zimmer wurde zweimal täglich 'in Stand' gesetzt und war sehr sauber. Der Bestand an Nespresso-Kapseln und Teebeutel wurden bei diesen Gelegenheiten jeweils neu aufgefüllt. Bei der zweiten Runde gab es jeweils noch je eine Flasche stilles Wasser. Toller Service! Checkout ist regulär um 12 Uhr.
Das Ivy Cafe ist ein schöner für ein empfehlenswertes Frühstück. Es hat mehrere Pubs in der Nähe, sowie einige interessante Restaurants...
Wir würden sofort wieder hin!",5,2016,05,09
123,Zentral gelegenes Hotel,"Für einen Citytrip liegt das Hotel in Top Lage, sehr zentral und doch ruhig. Beim Check-in war unser Zimmer noch nicht bereit, wir konnten uns jedoch im Fitnesscenter duschen und umziehen. Das war wirklich ein tolles Angebot. 
Als Blackmember der GHA-Gruppe hätten wir ein double upgrade zur Verfügung. Leider war dies ziemlich umständlich, an der Reception wollten sie das irgendwie nicht verstehen. Als wir uns jedoch beim Hotelmanager beschwert hatten, klappte das Upgrade doch noch! 
Unser Zimmer war sehr gross und geräumig, mit Sitzecke, Scheibtisch, grossem Bett und Bad. Einzig die Badewanne war etwas eng.
Alles in allem können wir das Hotel empfehlen, werden aber bei einem nächsten London-Trip nicht mehr dort einchecken.",3,2016,04,09
123,un fantastico hotel,"Gracias a la hospitalidad de todos los recepcionistas del hotel, especialmente de Gunther, por sus recomendaciones de buenos restaurantes. El hotel es muy acogedor y tiene un servicio excelente. Las habitaciones son espaciosas y se encuentran muy bien decoradas, crean una atmosfera muy especial. Tambien, el restaurante es muy recomendable. El desayuno tiene un Gran alto nivel de variantes gastronomicas. ",5,2016,03,25
123,Perfect Location / Tolle Lage,"Ein wunderschönes, ruhiges Hotel mit einer wie ich finde erstklassigen Lage. Umgeben von schönen Restaurants und Boutiquen auf dem Weg zur Oxford Street, wo man von dort aus alles erreichen kann. Die Zimmer sind klein, aber wer London kennt, weiß das dies keine Ausnahme ist.  Das Hotel hat einen Spa Bereich und verfügt über ein Schwimmbad. Die Zimmer sind sehr sauber und der Service ist gut. Preis-Leistungsverhältnis stimmt!",5,2016,02,19
123,perfetto per un viaggio direlax,"ottimo bar e ristorante. posizione perfetta per shopping e relax. 
Staff alla reception ottimo, soprattutto Gunther e Andrea, gestiti da un manager (se non ricordo male Mr Wang) attento e capace. 
Anche al bar Antonio, Tania e Louis vi fanno sentire come a casa.
Qualche disguido con i trainee... forse troppo poco formati.
I letti king size sono due singoli accoppiati non molto comodi ed i queen size sono piccolini, come in quasi tutti gli hotel di Londra.",4,2016,01,11
123,Ottima soluzione.,"Hotel molto centrale,a 10 min. a piedi da Oxford str. - moderno,situato in una via molto tranquilla.
Reception disponibile e cordiale per ogni evenienza.Stanza abbastanza spaziosa (una superior),estrema pulizia e confort.Unico neo bagno Microscopico!!!
In zona multi pub e ristoranti.Può diventare un punto di riferimento.",4,2016,01,09
123,valutazione hotel,"valutazione generale molto buona, cortesia e professionalità. Segnalo unicamente l'esiguità del bagno, peraltro molto pulito e dotato di ottima doccia. Prima colazione eccellente. Consigliabile senza tema di smentite",5,2016,01,05
123,Un drink in ferie ,"Per un primo incontro il bar dell'hotel è molto elegante ma nella magica praivasi e tranquillità che serve in quei momenti.. Per quanto riguarda il servizio, ottimo, bere cibo ottimi. Lo staff davvero professionale, solo non per tutte le tasche.. Ma molto in ",4,2016,01,04
123,Bello ma costoso,"Nel lussuoso quartiere di Paddington, l'hotel, elegante e centrale, offre però camere piccole e costa molto. Il personale è gentilissimo e si può fare un'ottima prima colazione sia inglese che continentale. Con un rapporto qualità/prezzo migliore, sarebbe da cinque stelle.",4,2015,10,17
123,"Un hotel en el centro de Londres - emplazamientos, servicios y precio muy convenientes","Ya sabemos lo tremendamente caro que puede ser Londres y que a partir de cierto precio, el hotel puede ser una sorpresa desafortunada de emplazamiento, servicio, etc. 
No es éste el caso: yo no conocía este hotel y fuimos allí a pasar la noche porque era la London Fashion Week y estaba todo ocupado en Londres.
Está muy cerca de la estación de Paddington, si tienes que viajar por Inglaterra o si quieres moverte fácilmente por Londres.
Muy bonita decoración: una especie de reinterpretación de art-deco en la entrada. Servicio fantástico (si necesitas un taxi lo salen a buscar y sea la hora punta que sea lo tienes en pocos minutos), y las habitaciones estupendas. Pequeñas, pero no te hace falta más: colchones, ropa blanca, toallas... todo de primera. Baños pequeños pero muy funcionales (y bonitos). Los productos de baño de Aromatherapy (maravillosa la crema de cuerpo).
 Wifi perfecta; enchufes para el sistema continental; TV correcta.
Si tienes tiempo, aprovecha para disfrutar de la comodidad de la habitación: yo aproveché para darme un super baño....
No he probado restaurantes (nid esayuno), pero recomiendo mucho este hotel - de gama media (en cuanto a precio), pero de primer nivel de confort y emplazamiento.",4,2015,09,21
123,Excelente atención,"El hotel Marylebone es fantástico, no solo por su situación y agradable estilo, lo mas valioso que tiene el hotel es su personal realmente atento.

123,Interesante hotel en ubicacion privilegiada,"La ubicacion y la excelente atencion del personal del hotel, especialmente de Gunther, hicieron que nuestra estadia en Londres fuera de lo mejor.
Como para comentar dir'ia que quizas las habitaciones sean pequenas para dos personas y las dimensiones del bano tambien, pero el resto es muy bueno y lo recomendar'ia
Del SPA el comentario ser'ia que el agua de la piscina no se encontraba exactamente agradable ( un poco fria...) 
El Wi Fi excelente en las habitaciones.",4,2015,09,02
123,Ottima location e comforft,Stanze belle e pulite.ottima la posizione per un week end londinese e soprattutto per girare la città a piedi.bella la palestra e piscina gratuita per i clienti del albergo. Personale cordiale e gentile per dare consigli su come muoversi nel quartiere. Anche il bar propone pietanze semplici e buone. ci torneremo nella prossima visita a Londra!!,4,2015,08,23
123,Eccezionale. ,"L'aspetto che da sempre mi preme maggiormente quando si tratta di hotel, siano essi a cinque o tre stelle, è la pulizia, e al riguardo Marylebone Hotel è uno dei migliori alberghi in cui io abbia alloggiato. Sia il bagno che la camera venivano infatti puliti due volte al giorno. Ottima anche l'accoglienza e il personale, in modo particolare il portiere italiano di cui ora mi sfugge il nome. Tutti sono stati sempre a nostra disposizione, pronti a darci tutte le informazioni di cui avevamo bisogno. Ho apprezzato molto anche la colazione, davvero ricchissima sia quella americana che quella continentale. Il Wi-fi è gratuito e velocissimo. Consigliatissimo! P.S. La mia recensione risale all'anno scorso, purtroppo non era stata registrata da Tripadvisor. ",5,2015,08,03
123,Muy buen servicio y buena ubicación!,"Estuvimos en el hotel en abril del 2015. El hotel esta muy bien ubicado, cerca de Marylebone street y del subte. La habitación es muy cómoda, y ofrece un servicio de sauna y piscina muy bueno. El desayuno es excelente!. Sin dudas, volveremos al hotel en nuestra próxima visita a Londres.",4,2015,08,02
123,perfetto senza esagerare,"Hotel in posizione tranquilla pur essendo strategicamente vincente. A due passi da Bond Street e da Oxford Circus. Personale di altissimo livello, molto cordiale anche con i bambini, ha uan spa a 5 stelle da non trascurare. La piscina rende il soggiorno gradevolissimo. Unica pecca le stanze basiche sono piuttosto piccole. La qualità della biancheria e delle facilities è però molto alta. Da ritornarci.",5,2015,07,28
123,Muy buena ubicación,"Estuve en este hotel en dos ocasiones, la ubicación es excelente. La primera vez nos alojamos en una habitación correcta, pero de tamaño justo. la segunda vez reservamos una habitación superior y las dimensiones eran mucho mayores, muy cómoda. 
Está muy bien situado pudiendo acceder a zonas como Mayfair, Regents Park... caminando.",4,2015,07,28
123,Depende de la habitacion,"En lsa ultimas dos semanas estuve dos veces y tengo dos opiniones diferentes:

1. La primera vez, la habitacion estaba bastante bien al no estar cerca de los ascensores.
2. La segunda vez, la habitacion era terrible de pequenna y con todo el ruido que hacen los ascensores y sin ninguna insonorizacion.

El servicio del hotel es bastante bueno.",3,2015,07,22
123,Centrale e di buona qualita´,"Buon albergo, superiore alla media, situato in una bella zona, centrale e vicino a tutto. Avevamo una superior room, abbastanza grande, con un bel bagno e pulita. La vista non era niente di che, ma tanto eravamo sempre fuori quindi non ci e´mancata.
Ristorante dell´albergo ottimo, una palestra ben fornita, zona piscina ok.
Non avevamo la colazione, ma la mattina c´e´servizio di te e caffe´nella lobby, e macchina Nespresso in camera, molto pratico.
Personale cordiale e professionale.
Rispetto ad altri grandi citta´europee Londra e´cara, e lo standard degli hotel non rispecchia quello che si paga, non bisogna aspettarsi valuta completa altrimenti si rimane delusi.",4,2015,07,03
123,Perfecto para moverse en Londres,"Estuvimos en este hotel durante la pasada Semana Santa. Perfecta localización, muy cerca de Oxford St y Regent St, pero ubicado en calles muy tranquilas.

123,Ottimo hotel in posizione centrale,"Hotel a 4 stelle tutte ben meritate.
Camere pulite,confortevoli e dotate di ogni confort
Colazione continentale con la possibilità di scegliere alla carta
L'hotel dispone di una piccola piscina, sauna e bagno turco e di una palestra attrezzatissima.
Un'altra considerazione e' la posizione centrale: solo 400 metri dalla fermata di Bond Stree.
Consigliatissimo",5,2015,06,05

123,Ok,Tipico hotel Londinese lussuoso e ben organizzato. Unica pecca stanze piccole per quello che si paga; abbastanza comodo per Oxford Street (a piedi) anche se non facilmente raggiungibile con la metro soprattutto se piove forte....direi che in zona ci sono molte alternative altrettanto care...ma meglio posizionate per la metro che x me è il vero plus di Londra....,3,2015,05,18

123,excelente trato y ubicación,"Hace 5 años que vamos regularmente a este hotel y estamos encantados con la elección. 
Se encuentra en un barrio tranquilo y a la vez muy céntrico (a pocos minutos de oxford street y de la estación de metro bond street) en el que es agradable pasear y que ofrece muchas opciones gastronomicas. 
Las habitaciones son agradables, las hay de exteriores y de interiores, hemos estado en las dos y todas son confortables y silenciosas. Las camas son grandes y muy cómodas. 
Desde hace dos años que viajamos con nuestra hija pequeña y nos facilitan al máximo su estancia...a parte de colmarla de detallazos (muñecos, set de cosméticos, pack para dibujar...)
Cada año hemos coincidido con personal español o catalán, especialmente en recepción, aunque el idioma no es obstáculo ya que todos facilitan mucho la comunicación. Siempre estan dispuestos a ayudar al viajero y proponer visitas turísticas sobre el mapa, asimismo se encargan de realizar reservas, comprar o buscar entradas,etc con gran resolución.
Este año agradecemos especialmente a Minel su atención, su trato y todas las gestiones que realizo para nosotros des de consergería.
Sin duda, el trato próximo y la atención del personal es lo que hacen de este hotel un auténtico lujo.
Gracias a todos y hasta el año que viene!",5,2015,05,08
123,Una agradable sorpresa !!,"Reservé el hotel contemplando dos motivos, situación y precio. El viaje que hice con mi hijo de 18 años fue el regalo de cumpleaños para ver un concierto. Era solo una noche y no quería gastar mucho. La verdad que fué un descubrimiento maravilloso, estuvimos estupendamente. Tenia dudas ya que Londres tiene una fama de caro increible, y es cierto, pero estuvimos muy bien y la zona estupenda, cero que volveré a esta zona seguro.",4,2015,05,01
123,Erstklassiges zentrales Hotel,"Wunderschön und ruhig gelegenes Hotel mit ausgesprochen freundlichem und hilfsbereiten Personal. Bond Street mit zahlreichen Einkausmöglichkeiten und viele gute Restaurants und Cafes in Laufnähe. Gehobenes Preisniveau, aber dafür auch ein erstklassiges Hotel. Sehr komfortabel, riesige Lobby mit verschiedenen, abgetrennten bequemen Aufenthaltsbereichen. Ein heißes feuchtes Handtuch zur Erfrischung bei der Begrüßung ist sehr aufmerksam und nicht selbstverständlich. Das Frühstück haben wir nicht im Hotel, sondern in den zahlreichen Cafes der Umgebung genossen. Den Wellness- und Spabereich haben wir nicht genutzt.
Das Zimmer (Suite im 6. Stock) war sehr sauber und gross, Teekocher und kostenlos zu nutzende Nespressomaschine vorhanden, alles wurde stets nachgefüllt und das Zimmer abends für die Nacht vorbereitet und Mineralwasser ans Bett gestellt. Wider Erwarten hatten wir als Hausstauballergiker KEINE Probleme mit den flauschigen Teppichen in den Hotelgängen und im Zimmer. Dies spricht wohl für die hohe Qualität der Reinigung.",5,2015,04,26
123,"Perfect Location, Great Service","Zentral gelegenes Hotel, sehr freundliches und zuvorkommendes Hotelpersonal, Zimmer sehr geschmackvoll eingerichtet und sehr sauber, top Service! Für die nächste Reise nach London ist meine Wahl bereits getroffen! Reichhaltiges Frühstücksbüffet, hohes Niveau der Speisen und Drinks im hoteleigenen Restaurant, in dem sich auch zahlreiche lokale Besucher aufhalten. Fast alle Einkaufsmöglichkeiten in der Nähe, Spaziergang zu Oxford Street und nahegelegenen Parks, sogar etliche Bars gibt es in der Nähe. Einfach ein geniales Hotel!",5,2015,03,30
123,ottima posizione e buon servizio,"Ho soggiornato la scorsa settimana in questo hotel.
E' comodissimo per la location che permette di arrivare in Oxford street a piedi in 3 minuti.
La colazione a buffet è semplice ma si trova di tutto.
Se si prende una stanza al terzo piano sconsiglio la 322 perchè è tra le piu piccole di quel piano. 
Quelle accanto sono un po piu spaziose (se si è in 2 sono da preferire).
Non serve il trasformatore se si arriva dall'Italia perche le prese sono adattate.
Ma non scordate lo spazzolino perchè non è in dotazione.
Le stanze sono pulite, confortevoli e silenziose.
Il ristorante annesso che si trova sul retro è valido e offre anche piatti italiani.
Se poi avete dimenticato qualcosa c'è un Tesco all'angolo (dietro).
il personale è sempre sorridente e disponibile.
Per un soggiorno di lavoro lo consiglio.",4,2015,03,17
123,Mas que correcto,"La situación del hotel es fantastica muy cerca de la zona de Oxford Street pero en una zona tranquila. El hotel esta bastante correcto, tampoco para tirar cohetes. Las habitaciones normales son demasiado pequeñas, así que mejor pagar un extra y pedir las Studio Suites. Unas instalaciones deportivas de lujo y un buen desayuno. Volveremos",4,2015,02,26
123,"Un hotel superb, muy agrable el personal y muy buenos servicios","Ha sido una estancia maravillosa, las habitaciones y las camas muy comodas, el baño también. El spa tiene una piscina bastante grande para nadar y el gimnasio bien equipado. El trato del personal fue excelente. El desayuno es un continental con bastante variedad y todo el decor del hotel es muy bonito. Volvería sin duda.",4,2015,02,18

123,Eccellente hotel nel cuore di Londra,"Esperienza molto positiva, l'hotel posizionato in piena zona 1, vicino ad Oxford Street è strategicamente posizionato.

123,ottimo ma bagni da lilliput,"sistemazione centrale, moderno, pulito, personale gentile ed efficiente..camere un po' piccole ma i bagni decisamente imbarazzanti..prima di entrare bisogna decidere che fare per non trovarsi in difficolta'!..colazione molto buona , in ambiente classicheggiante e con varieta' notevoli dicibi, scarsi solo in frutta...prezzi un po' alti, si paga la zona, meno quello che alla fine offre l'hotel",4,2015,02,01
123,Excepcional,"Un hotel situación, servicio, trato, habitaciones, desayuno TODO, excepcional. 
Ahora si. ... el precio es el que es , pero si deseas darte un viaje a Londres y disfrutarlo  haz el esfuerzo... Londres es dificil respecto a Hotel , calida- precio... y dado que merece la pena tener una buena experiencia de la ciudad, gastalo.... vale la pena por que forma parte del ambiente Londinense y el trato es exquisito además del descanso.",5,2015,01,28
123,Tolles Hotel und super Service,"Mit sechs Frauen haben wir ein hervorragendes Wochenende im Marylebone Hotel verbracht. Da wir in einem Hotel, das um die Ecke liegt, versetzt wurden, mussten wir kurzfristig eine Alternative finden. Das Marylebone hatte genügend Zimmer innerhalb von zwei Stunden für uns bereit und begrüsste uns herzlich und professionell. Preis Leistung stimmen total, das Frühstück ist lecker und auch der Loungebereich ist für den Hight Tea zu empfehlen.",4,2015,01,25
123,Hotel correcto sin sorpresas,"Hotel agradable donde las habitaciones son suficientemente amplias con un buen mantenimiento e insonorización. Esta bastante bien situado, a unos 10 minutos andando de Oxford St., al mismo tiempo que la calle es lo suficientemente tranquila. El desayuno esta bastante bien, aunque el local donde lo sirven es demasiado pequeño para el numero de habitaciones lo que da lugar a esperas y mesas muy pequeñas. Wifi gratuita en las habitaciones, con buen funcionamiento. El servicio muy amable.",4,2014,12,06
123,Confort y lujo,"Es un hotel hermoso que queda en el centro del barrio más alucinante para ir de compras en Londres. A solo 10 minutos caminando desde Oxford Circus o a 10 minutos en taxi desde Paddington (Heathrow Express). Un barrio caminable lleno de restaurantes, pubs, malls, tiendas por departamentos, cafés y pubs. 
Me encantó la comida, muy buen servicio y el buffet del desayuno ofrece una variedad deliciosa.",5,2014,12,04
123,Il top a prezzi giusti,"Ho soggiornato in questo hotel 1annoi fa nel mese di dicembre con la mia compagna per 5 notti.
Soggiorno indimenticabile a londra, in posizione centralissima, nel cuore della shopping OXFORD STREET.
Tutti i servizi che si possono pretendere da un hotel di questo rango, ad un prezzo abbordabilissimo per essere a londra.
La spesa fu di circa 300€ a notte colazione inclusa.
Lo consiglio vivamente e ci ritornerò il prima possibile!",5,2014,11,20
123,Luxushotel in Bestlage,"Wir waren diesen Monat für 4 Nächte im Marylebone.Schon beim Check in kann man den hohen Standard dieses Hotels erkennen. Wir bekamen Tücher zur Handreinigung und Wasser angeboten. Das Team am
Frontdesk war äusserst freundlich und hilfsbereit!Dann die nächste Überraschung im Zimmer: ein mit Rosenblüten dekoriertes Bett. Wirklich wunderschön!Das Zimmer an sich extrem
sauber und ordentlich. Weiterer angenehmer Aspekt: Eins der Fenster lies sich zum lüften öffnen! Es gab jeden Tag Mineralwasser aufs Zimmer ,ebenso wurde ständig Tee und Kaffee(Capseln/Teebeutel) und Kekse aufgefüllt!!!
Das Personal beim Frühstück und beim Dinner einfach nur supernett!!!Das Essen ausgezeichnet. Ein weiterer ganz grosser Pluspunkt: der Wellness und Fitnessbereich,der von den Hotelgästen kostenfrei genutzt werden kann! Pool,Sauna und Steamroom.... unglaublich sauber und gut ausgestattet! Auch hier sehr sehr nettes Personal!!!Ein eigener Lift für diesen Bereich,so das man um Bademantel los kann....
Der Lobbybereich sehr geschmackvoll eingerichtet,mehrere Lounges zum entspannen....teilweise mit Kamin,wirklich wunderschön!
Das Marylebone liegt perfekt: ruhige Seitenstrasse und nur ca. 5 min. zur Oxfordstreet!
Wir planen unsere Londonaufenthalte nur noch in diesem phantastischem Hotel!

123,"Gutes, zentral gelegenes Hotel","Ich war beruflich in London und entschied mich für das Marylebone Hotel wegen seiner zentralen Lage und kurzen Distanz zum Meetingort. Ich hatte kein Frühstück gebucht, daher kann ich zum Angebot nichts aussagen. Das Personal ist sehr freundlich und zuvorkommend und ich erhielt ein Upgrade in die nächst höhere Zimmerkategorie zum halben Preis. Das Zimmer (316) war geräumig, ruhig und gut ausgestattet. Ein grosses schönes Bad und ein Doppelbett (Boxspring). Leider war die Matzratze sehr weich und schon ziemlich durchgelegen. Ansonsten gibt es an der Unterkunft nichts zu bemängeln.",4,2014,11,09
123,Ruhiges Hotel mit Stil und Charme an allerbester Lage,"Wir waren für 5 Nächte im Hotel. Das Personal war sehr freundlich und hat uns aufmerksam bedient. Ich möchte sogar von einer aussergewöhnlichen Gastfreund-schaft sprechen, denn am Frühstückstisch wurden wir sogar mit dem Namen ange-sprochen. Alles war sehr sauber und neuwertig. Das Hotel hat Stil und liegt sehr Zentral. Kanpp 5 Minuten zu Fuss von der Oxfordstreet entfernt. Wir sind noch nie (waren schon über 5 x in dieser coolen Stadt) so wenig mit der Tube oder dem Taxi gefahren, weil einfach alles sehr schnell erreichbar ist. Das Zimmer wurde sicher 2 x am Tag besucht und wenn es Abfall gab von der Shoppintour wurde dieser immer entfernt. Auch hatten wir immer volle Flaschen Mineralwasser auf dem Zimmer. Was auch ganz ganz interessant war, dass man von den anderen Hotelgästen im Flur nichts hörte, weil der Teppich den gesamten Lärm der High... schluckt. Wir können das Hotel nur empfehlen und werden es mit Bestimmtheit beim nächsten Trip nach London wieder als unsere Destination buchen.",5,2014,10,30
123,"Quasi al top, ma camere troppo piccole e qualche disattenzione","La ricerca di una camera a Londra nella zona 1 è sempre molto molto difficile - o si trovano topaie o sono estremamente care. Come membro GHA, ho trovato finalmente un Hotel carino, moderno, non economico ma fortunatamente con una promozione offerta sul sito dell'Hotel (3 notti al costo di 2)  è venuto un prezzo accettabile - comunque 300 euro a notte per camera standard. 
Ecco, la camera - standard, per due persone, ti aspetti che sia almeno vivibile per due persone. Ma lo è davvero a malapena. E' piccolissima! Nonostante avessimo segnalato che siamo membri GHA non ci hanno dato ""upgrade"" gratuiti, bensì appena arrivati ci hanno proposto un ""upsell"" a pagamento per una categoria superiore, perché la camera che avevamo prenotato era talmente piccola che loro la davano come singola. prego???? a parte la diplomazia assolutamente inesistente, ma messa così è quasi una truffa, e se avessi avuto voglia di litigare, mi sarei fatta dare la camera più grande a gratis, ma non avevo voglia, vado in vacanza per rilassarmi. Ci teniamo il loculo a 300 Euro, tanto ci avremmo solo dormito.

Qualche tocco davvero carino, come le salviette caldo all'arrivo, il ferro da stiro e asse in camera (non usato), il bollitore con te e caffè (ottimo dopo le lunghe camminate londinesi) e buoni prodotti per il bagno.
Il giornale richiesto è arrivato una mattina si e due no.
Segnalato che era un viaggio di Anniversario, ma né una nota nè niente (di solito a questi livelli almeno gli auguri te li fanno!) 
Concierge gentile, che ci ha consigliato e prenotato due ottimi posti.
Receptionist freddi e senza empatia verso il cliente, fanno solo il loro lavoro, senza una frase o una parola gentile di più.
Ristorante non provato.
In sintesi un buon Hotel, soprattutto per la location (assolutamente magnifica) e se trovassi di nuovo l'offerta 3 x 2 probabilmente ci tornerei anche, magari ho fortuna e trovo una receptionist più gentile che ci da una camera adatta a due persone senza chiederci altri soldi.....",4,2014,10,29
123,Grandhotelatmosphäre in allerbester Lage und trotzdem nicht laut,"Wir waren eine Woche hier und haben die außergewöhnliche Gastfreundschaft und den sehr aufmerksamen Service sehr genossen. Zweimal am Tag kommt jemand ins Zimmer. So ist es immer aufgeräumt und am Abend steht eine kostenlose Flasche Wasser neben dem Bett. Das Haus ist bestens ausgestattet, sehr gepflegt und obwohl rundum alle Vergnügungen der Großstadt locken (wir fuhren fast nicht Bahn oder Taxi, sondern die spannenden Dinge waren fußläufig zu haben), bleibt man auch gerne mal im Hotel.",5,2014,10,19
123,Aufmerksame Mitarbeitende - gute Lage - moderner Fitnessbereich,"Ich war für 2 Nächte Mi - Fr im Marylebone und wurde sehr freundlich und aufmerksam bedient. Alles ist sehr sauber und neuwertig. Das Frühstücksbuffet war gut und es hatte frische Früchte. Die vielen Speisen mit Eiern, Speck etc. haben mir bestens gefallen. Toll für meine Bedürfnisse war der Fitnessbereich: Spinning, 3 weitere Technogym-Velos, Crosstrainer, einige Geräte und viele zusätzliche Trainingsmöglichkeiten (Hanteln, Springseile, Matten, Bälle, Gummizüge etc.) waren super. Das Gym ist öffentlich und es hatte viele Personaltrainer die Gäste betreut haben. Die Zimmer sind - wie oft in Stadthotels - eng geschnitten und klein, aber OK. Die Lage ist für's Shopen ausgezeichnet: Oxford- und Bond-Street innert 3 - 5 Minuten zu Fuss zu erreichen. Viele kleine Restaurants und Cafés ganz in der Nähe im Quartier.",4,2014,09,01
123,Gutes Hotel mit super Lage,"Wir waren fuer 2 Naechte ueber das Wochenende im Marylebone und im Grossen und Ganzen haben wir die Zeit auch genossen.
Das Personal ist sehr freundlich und die Zimmer sowie das restl. Hotel sind sehr sehr sauber. Die Teppiche empfinde ich als angenehm, da man ansonsten die ganze Zeit die Absaetze der anderen Besucher ""klacken"" hoeren wuerde. 
Sehr toll finde ich die Kapsel-Kaffeemaschine auf jedem Zimmer.

Einziges Manko in gewisser Weise ist die Groesse. Die normalen Zimmer sind ueberschaubar was das angeht und ich mit meinen 192cm hatte auch gewissen Probleme unter den Duschkopf zu passen. 
In der ersten Nacht hatten wir leider ein Zimmer direkt neben dem Aufzug, welches wir aber sofort wechseln durften nachdem wir an der Rezeption darum gebeten haben.",4,2014,08,27
123,buen hotel,"El hotel esta muy bien situado, sobre todo si lo que buscar es estar cerca de la zona comercial, to estuve con mi hija y era perfecto porque podías ir caminando a todos los sitios.
El personal del hotel muy atento y amable, la persona que nos atendió hablaba español así que no tuvimos ningún problema y nos hizo unas buenas recomendaciones sobre Londres.

123,Gradevolissima location molto centrale,"Situato s pochi minuti a piedi dal metro di Bond Street e di Oxford Circus, in una zona tranquillissima e sicura anche per chi rientra tardissimo, è una ottima base x scoprire Londra. Personale molto professionale ed accogliente, il tocco empatico di una giovanissima addetta  alla reception italiana alza un pallino.
Un altro pallino lo alza la responsabile della sala colazioni,  sempre italiana,  di una efficienza e gentilezza senza pari. 
Colazione super, sia quella al buffet che quella a la carte, con specialità inglesi come il porridge-ottimo! - e i pancake alla ricotta, che non è affatto facile trovare.  Camere un po piccole rispetto al prezzo, ma siamo pur sempre al centro di Londra, pulitissime e luminose e soprattutto silenziose. Quattro stelle vere. Peccato che negli spazi comuni abbiano l'abitudine  di tenere i condizionatori accesi a palla anche se fuori ci sono neanche quindici gradi di temperatura e magari piove anche. Ma dicono che per gli inglesi questo vuol dire un clima molto caldo....",5,2014,08,18
123,"Extraordinario hotel en Londres, muy céntrico, tranquilo y con alta calidad de servicios y buen precio","Situado en una paralela a 5 minutos de Oxford St, a la altura de Selfridges, es un hotel de tamaño mediano, glamuroso, con habitaciones de tamaño algo justo (quizás el baño sea pequeño) pero con todo lo que se espera y muy limpias. Desayuno extraordinario (con muy buen cafe para los españoles), spa, piscina, salones,...Detalles como botellas de agua y chocolatina por la tarde. Precio razonable para ser Londres. Sin duda una de mis elecciones para escapada de fin de semana a Londres",4,2014,08,16
123,Gran hotel para descansar en el corazón de Londres,"Excelente servicio, cuarto y desayuno...

Es un hotel ubicado en Marylebone y rodeado de cafés y restaurants.

El cuarto muy amplio y cómodo, permite descansar de manera fantástica. Probé distintos hoteles en el centro de Londres y este fue sin dudas el mejor!",5,2014,08,01
123,"Buon hotel, vicino al centro e discreto","Hotel buono, con sevizio eccellente e personale impeccabile. Vicino al centro, ma non vicinissimo alle fermate bus e tube. Zona tranquilla e non rumorosa. Stanze eleganti, pulite con un bagno però decisamente piccolo e scomodo. Da sconsigliare a chi ha problemi di deambulazione ( doccia nella vasca da bagno, rialzata).",4,2014,07,06
123,"Super Lage, tolles Hotel","Ein tolles Hotel! Komfortabel, ruhig, super gelegen (5' zur Oxford Street)! Netter Staff, toller Service! Wir haben die Tage genossen. Vor allem die Walk-In-Dusche war cool. Die Teppiche sind praktisch, so werden Flurgeräusche unterdrückt... 
Frühstück haben wir ausgelassen, war lecker im Prêt à manger! Wir würden jederzeit wieder im Marylebone absteigen!",5,2014,06,05
123,Excelente hotel y su personal Maravilloso,"No puedo decir más qué gracias. El hotel es maravilloso, amplio, moderno, súper cálido.
Baño pequeño pero muy agradable e impecable.
Llegamos caminando desde el underground. Sin conocer! Si bien está en una calle muy tranquila, está a 4 cuadras de Oxford St. Cerca de lugares muy pintorescos para pasear. A 5 min a pie de Madame Tussauds.  Y el underground a 4 cuadras q te lleva a todos lados. Perfecto!
El personal maravilloso.
Desayuno perfecto
Restaurante buenísimo. Tuve una tardanza con el postre por que tuvieron un problema de cocina, y como mi hija estaba cansada lo suspendí y fuimos a la habitación. Tuvieron el detalle de enviármelo a la habitación sin cargo por la demora. FUE UN LINDO DETALLE. Q no tenían necesidad. Realmente Muy atentos.
Los de recepción nos aconsejaban todo. Hasta sacar entradas ahí mismo evitando colas en lugares q uno quiere asistir. 
Estaban en todos los detalles para que uno se sintiera muy cómodo. Y Lo han logrado.
Sin duda volveré.",5,2014,05,13
123,Ritorneremo !,"Siamo appena rientrate da Londra dove abbiamo alloggiato per 3 notti presso quest'hotel.Ci siamo sentite come a casa.Accoglienza perfetta ( salviettine calde per rinfrescarsi le mani )con possibilità di poter usufruire di un upgrade.Camere standard un po' piccole ( compreso bagno ) ma complete in tutto , pulite due volte al giorno con n espresso, bollitore elettrico con scelte di bevande calde e fredde, acqua minerale free, ferro ed asse da stiro, ombrello. colazione super ( continentale a 16 pounds ) ma gratuita per bambini sotto i 10 anni.Tea del pomeriggio con tante golosità ( torta lamponi e mandorle sublime ).Cena e pranzo presso il ristorante 108 assolutamente da consigliare ( FISN & chip ) mai provati così .grazie Elisa  per i consigli !
Mia figlia ed io siamo rimaste impressionate dalla gentilezza,cortesia non comune e sincera...
Ne abbiamo visitati di hotels con lo stesso livello , ma in nessuno ci eravamo sentite così coccolate come al Marylebone .Ritorneremo presto !",5,2014,04,29
123,Bellissimo hotel molta cortesia,"Hotel elegante, camere grandi e molto pulite, in un bellissimo quartiere e con tutte le comodità .
Ottimo il ristorante collegato all hotel .
Tutti molto cortesi e disponibili .
Posizione centrale e molto comoda a tutto.
Ci torneremo",4,2014,04,15
123,Ottimo Hotel in centro,"Veramente un ottimo hotel, ancor più apprezzato perché non ha i crismi dell'hotel delle grandi catene. 
Posizione strategica, bene le camere e soprattutto colazione e cena con personale gentile e professionale, ottimo anche per occasioni turistiche a Londra.",4,2014,04,13
123,Magnífico hotel,"Mal situado, en una zona demasiado alejada de las compras buenas.
Pero es un hotel muy bien cuidado, personal muy muy atento, y profesional.Su ubicación es complicada incluso para los taxistas londinenses, que tenían que hacer virgerias para llegar.
Coincidî con un group ode politicos españoles, conocidos, por lo que demuestra buena fama de hotel.
Desayuno completo y habitaciones pequeñas, y baños demasiado enanas.
No es caro, y se puede ir.aconsejable para un turista medio.",4,2014,03,17
123,Ideal para Londres,Ya me había alojado en este hotel hace unos 5 años pero tenía otro nombre.Han hecho una gran reforma ya que antes era autenticamente british y ahora es moderno y funcional.Bueno en gustos todo vale.En cualquier caso elegí este hotel por su magnífica situación a dos pasos de Oxford Street y del metro de Bond St pero alejado lo justo para darte un aire de barrio.Las habitaciones y baños no son muy grandes pero son suficientes después de pasar el dia en Londres.Creo que hay piscina aunque no he ido ninguna de las dos veces.Situación inmejorable.,5,2014,02,15
123,Servicio excelente!!,"El hotel es moderno y funcional, el servicio excelente. Todos los empleados, sin excepción, fueron extremadamente amables, nos hicieron sentir muy cómodos. La situación del hotel es perfecta, cerca de Oxford Street pero en una calle muy tranquila, sin ruidos. La habitación espaciosa pero mal iluminada y el baño muy pequeño para el tipo de habitación. También tuvimos un pequeño problema con la calefacción pero por lo demás tuvimos una estancia perfecta. Hotel totalmente recomendado.",4,2014,02,11
123,Una bella scoperta nel cuore di Mayfair,"Ho soggiornato al Marylebone hotel con le mie figlie per una breve vacanza e siamo stati accolti al nostro arrivo con molta cordialità e gentilezza dallo staff, a cominciare dalle salviette tiepide per lavarci le mani, per continuare con due delizioso orsetti regalati alle bambine. L'hotel ha spazi comuni molto intimi ed eleganti( abbiamo gustato in un bel salotto un ricchissimo the del pomeriggio). La nostra camera( avevano una deluxe) era spaziosa e curata, i letti molto comodi e il bagno, non troppo grande ma molto nuovo e ben illuminato e con asciugamani  abbondanti e di ottima qualità. La colazione, non compresa nel soggiorno, ha comunque un prezzo accessibile rispetto ad altri hotel, e cosa che trovo molto intelligente, prevede riduzioni per i ragazzi ed è gratis per i bambini. La posizione dell'albergo è strategica per visitare il centro di Londra e nelle vicinanze vi sono ristoranti molto graziosi. Credo proprio che ci ritorneremo.",5,2014,01,05
123,EXCELENTE y BUENA UBICACIÓN,"Vaya por delante que ya hace años utilizè en múltiples viajes a Londres este Hotel cuando tenía un nombre diferente.Con posterioridad he ido recorriendo otros Hoteles en Londres y 
cuando reservè nuevamente en el Marylebone Hotel las dos habitaciones me encontrè un Hotel completamente distinto ya que no sólo ha cambiado el nombre sino su fisonomìa y en cuatro días hemos disfrutado de un Hotel con una excelente ubicación,a100 metros de Oxford, pero en una zona tranquila y muy bien comunicada con calles vecinas donde hay restaurantes y algún pub por sí no deseas moverte de la zona cuando llegas cansado al Hotel.
Las habitaciones del hotel son diáfanas,limpias y cuentan con lo necesario para hacer la estancia agradable.Quizàs el único inconveniente sea el baño que no es muy espacioso aunque cuenta con todos los extras necesarios.
El Personal predominantemente Joven desde la entrada en recepción hasta el último día es de una gran amabilidad y atento en todo momento a tus solicitudes.
Enhorabuena a todo el Equipo y no sólo recomiendo el Hotel sino que volverè a reservar en mis próximos Viajes a Londres.",5,2013,12,15
123,Faire Preis Leistung,"Das Hotel liegt sehr gut in der Nähe der Oxfordstreet. Zimmer ok, obwohl mich in einem relativ neuen Hotel ein Teppichboden stört, da Parkett doch wesentlich zeitgemässer wäre . Zimmer und Bad relativ klein und auch wenig Stauraum für Gepäck und  Shoppingbeute .",4,2013,12,14
123,Come essere coccolati,"La mia compagna ed io siamo stati ospiti di questo hotel dal 14 al 21 novembre 2013, l'albergo si trova in Wellbeck Street, una via alquanto tranquilla. Al nostro arrivo in taxi due concierges, tra cui Rafael, ci aprono le portiere dell'auto e prelevano le valigie portandole dentro,alla reception Annalisa, italiana trasferitasi a Londra da alcuni mesi ci accoglie carina mente illustrandoci tutte le potenzialità dell'hotel e indicandoci su mappa punti strategici adiacenti. L'hotel lo trovo elegante, Rafael, brasiliano, parla abbastanza l'italiano e l'ho trovato grande, ci ha fatto da cicerone per tutto l'hotel e ci ha accompagnati in camera portandoci le valigie.
Abbiamo preso una Deluxe, una camera abbastanza comoda e luminosa, non sto qui a descriverla però vi dico che oltre alla teiera con le varie fragranze, avevamo a disposizione anche una Nespresso con 6 tipi di capsule oltre quelle per il latte comprese nel servizio.Rafael come ho detto prima per me è un grande non perché ci abbia mostrato la la camera e l'hotel ma perché ci ha coccolati costantemente, ogni giorno ci chiedeva se avessimo bisogno di qualcosa è ci dava delle indicazioni o dritte per cosa visitare o dove andare a mangiare più tante altre notizie di vario genere, in pratica una persona su cui appoggiarsi tranquillamente per tutto. Tornando all'hotel, tenendo conto che quando parto scelgo un quattro stelle superior, devo ammettere che ha superato le mie aspettative,giù molti angoli con divanetti e poltrone per poter gustare un te o un aperitivo tranquillamente, la camera Deluxe come ho detto prima e' dotata di ogni confort ed è comoda e luminosa, oltre alla già citata Nespresso la sera trovavamo sui nostri comodini due bottigliette d'acqua e due cioccolatini,tra l'altro nelle camere si usufruisce di internet con wifi gratuito 24h no stop.
l'hotel come ho detto prima si trova  in una via tranquilla, ma  a nemmeno 5 minuti di strada a piedi abbiamo James Street dove potete gustare la cucina italiana, spagnola tunisina e altro, ma  a 10 minuti sempre dall'hotel si trova Oxoford Sreet che come tutti sapete è la via dello shopping.
Concludendo, scusate se mi sono dilungato, giudico quest'hotel tra l'ottimo e l'elleccelente, perfetto per la sua posizione strategica, da ritornarci",5,2013,11,23
123,Ubicación excelente,"Nos hemos alojado aquí tres noches y tengo que decir que primero nos pusieron en una habitación con solo ducha que salía del techo con poca presión y el agua se salía por los lados, una calefacción con aire muy ruidosa y vieja, la habitació muy bien aprovechados los espacios pero bastante pequeña.
El personal del hotel es muy amable y puedo solo hacer comentarios positivos. Amables,educados y eficientes. 
Nos cambiaron de habitación sin problema al día siguiente algo más espaciosa y con ducha extraible aunque el agua se seguía saliendo por los bordes y teníamos que usar las toallas para secar el suelo.
La gran ventaja del hotel es su ubicación, a pocos metros de Oxford st y la parada de metro de Bond street. 
El bar del hotel  esta muy bien y muy acogedor. 
",4,2013,11,07
123,Ottimo hotel,"Ho soggiornato due notti durante un viaggio di lavoro. Ottimo servizio, tutti cortesi e gentili. Veramente ricca la colazione, che non era inclusa, ad un prezzo ragionevole. Avevo una camera superior, secondo me un po' piccola e per questo non do il massimo dei voti. In ogni caso tornerò molto volentieri, anche per usufruire della SPA.",4,2013,10,19
123,"Ottimo hotel, qualità eccellente","Hotel vicino ad Oxford street e nel quartiere di Marylebone. Servizio impeccabile, le stanze superior sono un po' piccole quindi consiglio di prendere le stanze dalla Deluxe in su, ma per il resto tutto ok!",4,2013,10,15
123,Il nostro compleanno a Londra,"Io è mia sorella (gemelle della Calabria -Italia) siamo state al Marylebone Hotel quest'anno dal 10 al 14 Ottobre 2013. Hotel accogliente e molto centrale. La via in cui si trova e' tranquilla ma a pochi passi da Oxford Street la via dello Shopping. Stanza numero 522 pulita molto bella con arredi raffinati ed ogni confort. Impeccabile la Reception. Da sottolineare la cortesia e la disponibilità' del personale tutto ma in particolar modo di : Raphael un ragazzo Brasiliano che parla un ottimo Italiano cortese e simpatico ci ha dato una marea di consigli. Enrico un giovane ragazzo di Torino molto affettuoso, socievole e che ha saputo con tanta pazienza risolvere ogni nostro problema (bancomat, cambio valuta, taxi etc.). Puntuali entrambi nell' augurarci Buon Compleanno, addirittura  Enrico allo scadere della mezzanotte. Ritorneremo sicuramente a Londra città bellissima e  nuovamente al Marylebone Hotel dove ci siamo sentite a casa.",5,2013,10,12
123,mi è piaciuto,"Io e mio marito siamo stati al Amrylebone quest'anno dal 10 al 13 agosto. Hotel accogliente e molto centrale e comodo a tutti i servizi. Unico neo, letto molto piccolo non crto un matrimoniale. Per la prossima volta prenderò una stanza con due letti.

Per il resto tuuto molto bene",3,2013,10,09
123,Sogno a 5 stelle! *.*,"Una struttura veramente fantastica, un 5 stelle di classe dove nemmeno le signore delle pulizie si facevano vedere perchè appena ti vedevano passare: puff, sparivano ;)
Abbiamo soggiornato solamente per due giorni senza pranzo e cena ma solo con la colazione veramente ricca e di qualità dove la scelta è stata vasta! La nostra stanza era ben arredata,  pulitissima e con tutti i comfort! Per non parlare del personale (cordiale, gentile disponibile a qualsiasi ora), e della SPA di cui è dotata l'Hotel, la quale non abbiamo potuto usufruirne perché essendo la prima esperienza a Londra non abbiamo avuto il tempo necessario! Come direbbero gli inglesi: gorgeous and wonderful!",5,2013,09,23
123,magnífica atención,"Desde el momento de la reserva (4 noches, 2 habitaciones) todo fueron facilidades gracias a Celia Rojas (un relief para los hispanohablantes), preocupándose por todo y contestando con rapidez los correos.
A la llegada y durante toda la estancia, todo el personal es super atento (en su punto, sin agobiar) y te soluciona cualquier duda (cambios de habitaciones, etc) con simpatía. María, otra española en el staff, es un buen ejemplo de esta actitud. Ni rastro de stiff-upper-lip.
La ubicación es perfecta, Marylebone es una zona tranquila y british a un corto paseo de Picadilly, Trafalgar, Museum, etc.
El tamaño, equipamiento y luminosidad de la habitaciones, perfectos.
No es un hotel barato (en Londres no existen) pero si supone una magnifica relación calidad-precio (pretty good value). Absolutamente recomendable",5,2013,09,05
123,Scelta azzeccata !,"Abbiamo scelto questo hotel in base ai giudizi su Tripadvisor. E abbiamo fatto bene. La mia famiglia ha soggiornato qui per 6 notti ad agosto. Ci siamo trovati meravigliosamente. L'hotel è molto accogliente ed è in una via molto tranquilla che però dista meno di 5 minuti a piedi da Oxford street (quindi ottimo per chi ama lo shopping e da lì agevole per spostarsi in autobus) e dalla stazione metro di Bond street. E' quindi in posizione comodissima per raggiungere le principali attrazioni della città. La nostra stanza era molto spaziosa e fornita (c'era anche la macchinetta per il nespresso). Vicino all'hotel ci sono molti ristoranti (dove abbiamo mangiato) con cucina di tutte le nazionalità. Il personale è estremamente gentile, premuroso e disponibile (qualcuno parla anche italiano) e ci ha fornito anche ottime indicazioni. Appena arrivati ci hanno detto che se la stanza (che dava sul cortile interno) non era di nostro gradimento potevamo chiedere di cambiarla. Abbiamo usufruito della possibilità di prenotare i biglietti di alcune attrazioni evitando le code. La colazione era ottima e abbondante. Se torneremo a Londra soggiorneremo nuovamente al Marylebone. Senza dubbio!",5,2013,09,03
123,Ottima scelta a Marylebone,"Ho soggiornato in questo hotel molto accogliente a due passi dallo shopping di Oxford Street e dalla splendida Wallace Collection. La via in cui si trova l'hotel è tranquilla ma a pochi passi si trovano negozi e grandi magazzini e indirizzi ottimi per lo shopping, come pure molti posti per mangiare. 
Lo staff mi ha accolto con estrema gentilezza e ha saputo risolvere prontamente qualsiasi richiesta. Impeccabile la reception.
Gli spazi comuni sono molto accoglienti e arredati con un gusto particolare, che a me è piaciuto.
La camera, una standard con letto queen, era attrezzata di tutto il necessario, accappatoio e pantofole incluse, con una buona scelta di bagnoschiuma, shampoo e il bollitore per tè/caffè. Bello il bagno (seppur un po' piccolo), da poco rinnovato e pulitissimo. Le camere ben isolate dal punto di vista acustico. Ho acquistato un pacchetto direttamente dal sito dell'hotel comprendente turndown della camera serale, bottiglie d'acqua e colazione all'inglese, tutto molto apprezzato. Ho anche utilizzato la Spa collegata all'hotel che ho trovato di ottimo livello e che consiglio sia per la professionalità che per la gentilezza. Insomma, un ottimo indirizzo a Londra per gli amanti di quella zona della città.",5,2013,08,29

Spazi comuni molto curati e camere spaziose, anch'esse fornite di molti confort. Personale gentilissimo e disponibilissimo a tutte le ore. La colazione è molto gustosa e anche il servizio in camera l'abbiamo trovato eccellente. Addirittura per i clienti che hanno difficoltà con la lingua, è a disposizione un consierge che parla italiano. Da provare anche l'ottimo ristorante interno alla struttura! Se mai dovessimo tornare a Londra, questo hotel sarebbe sicuramente la nostra prima scelta!",5,2013,08,18
123,"Elegant und schön, aber kleine Zimmer","Sehr schönes Hotel in bester Lage. Tolles Design nicht nur in Lobby, Restaurant und Fluren sondern auch in den Zimmern selbst. Sehr freundliches, kompetentes Personal, alles sauber und praktisch. Hervorragender Health Club mit ausgewachsenem Fitness-Center. Die Preise im Vergleich zu anderen Londoner Angeboten absolut vernünftig. Einziger Kritikpunkt, vielleicht aber unvermeidlich: Die Zimmer sind ziemlich klein (wir hatten für unsere 4-köpfige Familie 2x wohl das Standardzimmer, superior oder supreme).",5,2013,07,22

Intermedia con aggiunta di Yogurt mousse cereali vari e frutta e Completa che prevede anche l'assortimento salato (Bacon uova ecc.).

Cuando vuelva a Londres sin duda repetiré hotel.
Son amables en recepción y había una persona que hablaba español muy simpático.

123,Fantastico!!!,"E' la mia prima recensione, ma nel caso di specie non potevo farne a meno. Hotel splendido, centrale e pulito. Da sottolineare la cortesia e disponibilità del personale, in particolare del concierge Gunter. Ottimi consigli su ristoranti. Percorsi consigliati impeccabili. Wi-fi disponibile anche in stanza (II piano). Insomma, andateci e non ve ne pentirete. Qualità/prezzo al di sopra della norma.",5,2013,04,22
123,"Pulito, in pieno centro, pieno di servizi: Consigliatissimo","Ho soggiornato in questo albergo due notti; un ambiente informale ma elegante, pulitissimo con personale gentile e disponibile.
L'acqua in stanza con i cioccolatini ogni giorno, il giornale fuori dalla porta, la palestra, la piscina tutto compreso lo rendono un posto da scegliere... inoltre è in pieno centro, in una zona tranquilla a due passi da Oxford street.
Unica pecca: stanze molto piccole, così come il bagno.. per il resto nulla da eccepire...

Esperienza positiva, da ripetere!!!",5,2013,04,15
123,Top!!,"Das Hotel liegt sehr zentral, man ist in 5 Minuten auf der Oxford & Bond Street.
Das Personal ist sehr freundlich und hilfsbereit, stets bemüht dass man sich wohlfühlt. 
Das Frühstück ist gut, intercontinental. Für einen Aufpreis kann man auch ein englisches Breakfast bekommen, kostet 21£, habe ich aber nicht gemacht. Der frische Obstsalat und Toast mit Marmelade war ausreichend. Allerdings sollte man etwas Zeit mitbringen, es dauert etwas bis man seinen Tee/Kaffee bekommt.
Das einzige was mich etwas gestört hat, war die Grösse des Zimmers. Das ist schon sehr klein. Der Kleiderschrank bietet wenig Platz und es gibt auch keinen Stauraum für das Gepäck.
Dafür ist es aber sehr sehr sauber, es gibt ausreichend Handtücher und die Pflegeprodukte werden jeden Tag neu aufgefüllt. Die Badewanne ist auch eher etwas für sehr kleine Menschen.
Insgesamt super, ich kann es nur weiterempfehlen und werde selbst auch wiederkommen.",5,2013,03,10
123,Excelente elección,"La zona es estupenda. Cerca de todo, pero nada ruidosa. Para mi de las ubicaciones más agradables de Londres. El hotel, salvo por el tamaño de las habitaciones, da gusto.

Sin duda, lo recomiendo a cualquiera y seguro que volveré Estuvimos en abril de 2011.",4,2013,03,02
123,Ottimo hotel,"Bellissimo e moderno hotel, vale le sue stelle. Personale  gentile e fortunatamente si incontra sempre qualcuno italiano, e i consigli sui posti per pranzare e cenare sono risultati ottimi. Il nostro soggiorno e' stato breve, ma vale la pena pagare quella cifra. Siamo rimasti solo delusi dalla colazione (non dalla qualita')che abbiamo pagato una cifra esorbitante.",5,2013,02,16

Una curiosidad, cuando coges una chocolatina del minibar te la cobran al instante porque tienen instalado un sistema de pago por sensores.
Precio un poco alto, pero esto es normal, estando en la ubicación que está y con la categoría.",4,2013,02,02

123,Ci vuole tanto poco a perdere due vecchi clienti....,"Io e mio marito andiamo spesso a Londra. Lui per lavoro, io per shopping. Sono anni che soggiorniamo al Marylebone Hotel, almeno 2 volte all'anno, fin da quando si chiamava Juris Clifton Ford Hotel e devo dire che siamo stati sempre bene. Ma questa volta no.
E quindi non ci torneremo più! Il personale alla reception ed i concierge cambiano di continuo e questo non è bello perchè non si crea un rapporto di fiducia ed il cliente non ha mai un riferimento. Tutte le volte che andiamo ci chiedono se è la prima volta che alloggiamo da loro, e tutte le volte rispondiamo che siamo vecchi clienti... ma non hanno uno ""storico""? Le camere sono sempre piccole ed il guardaroba è praticamente inesistente, per non parlare del bagno: devi per forza chiudere la porta (anche se ti devi lavare solo le mani) perchè sennò non si entra da quanto è piccolo.
Siamo dovuti rimanere una notte in più del previsto perchè la British Airway ci ha cancellato il volo a causa di cm 1 di neve, ma abbiamo dovuto pagare ben 40 sterline in più del prezzo che ci avevano già applicato (più le tasse ovviamente che non sono mai comprese come in Italia e che che non sono basse) perchè avevamo ""beneficiato"" di una tariffa ""promozionale"" del week-end che non si poteva applicare anche al lunedì. Sono inglesi!!!! E dire che siamo clienti fissi.. Il giorno dell'arrivo era tardi e siccome era tutto chiuso, abbiamo ordinato 2 sandwich ""club"" con 2 bicchieri di vino. Costo 50 pounds... Il problema è che erano gelati, e alla nostra richiesta di scaldarli, ci hanno risposto che il sandwich club è freddo.. Che dire della reception? Se chiedi una prenotazione per un teatro o un ristorante, sono gentili, ma fin qui ci arriviamo anche noi. Se chiedi di chiamare la British Airways per chiedere la riconferma del volo per il ritorno, chiamano, ma poi ti passano la telefonata in camera perchè c'è troppo da attendere e poi te la addebitano, come è successo a noi.
Da quando andiamo al Marylebone (circa 7 anni) abbiamo notato che l'albergo è cambiato molto nel tempo, ma purtroppo è peggiorato. Inoltre, i prezzi sono sempre più alti. Anche la piscina (nuova) è veramente piccola e non ne vale proprio la pena. L'unica nota positiva è che l'albergo è in centro, ma del resto non è l'unico perchè il centro di Londra è grande e direi proprio che la prossima volta ci guardiamo in giro e troviamo un altro albergo. Dopotutto siamo innamorati di Londra, ma al Marylebone non ci torniamo più!! E' tanto facile perdere due vecchi clienti.....",1,2013,01,22
123,absolut empfehlenswert,"Alles passt, super netter Service, schönes Design, tolle Lage - ruhig, aber nah zu öffentlichen Verkehrsmitteln, Einkaufsstraßen und Hyde Park - Zimmer ok. Und dazu noch der freie Zugang zu Fitnessclub und Pool.",5,2013,01,09
123,Molto bello!,"Sono stato a Londra per le vacanze di fine anno e ho scelto questo hotel presso booking.com. Però devo dire che la stessa camera l'ho trovata a un prezzo minore il giorno dopo aver prenotato! 
L hotel era meraviglioso, anche il centro SPA era molto bello! La piscina lasciava un po' a desiderare perché è molto piccola e l'acqua al suo interno non è calda! Devo dire che apparte due piccoli inconvenienti la mia esperienza è stata eccellente grazie al concierge che ha permesso a me e alla mia famiglia di provare posti bellissimi e buonissimi, ma soprattutto poco conosciuti come ad esempio (burger joint etc.) 
Spero che la mia recensione vi aiuti e vi consiglio fortemente l'hotel!",5,2013,01,05

Difetti:
La stanza era un po' piccola. Il bagno- seppure in marmo e ben attrezzato - aveva uno spazio troppo limitato. 
Nei giorni di Natale (il 25 e 26) la piscina e lo spazio benessere erano chiusi!",4,2012,12,27

La posizione e ottima in una zona tranquilla ma a 5 minuti da Oxford street e con tanti locali e ristoranti intorno. L albergo e molto bello ed elegante, le camere ben accessoriate e il personale molto cortese. Ci hanno fatto trovare in camera oltre alla culla per la bambina una scatola di mini prodotti johnson per bambini ed un orsacchiotto che ha fatto impazzire di gioia mia figlia appena lo ha visto. Avevo letto commenti sul ridotto spazio delle camere ma direi che la superior room che avevamo noi fosse perfetta visto che oltre allo spazio per la culla c'era quello che aprire una valigia grande.

123,Afternoon tea al Marylebone Hotel,"In viaggio di piacere a Londra con la mia famiglia, avevo deciso di provare il gusto di un ""english afternoon tea"" e dopo un'attenta consultazione delle varie offerte , ho trovato sul sito afternoontea.co.uk particolari, recensioni e tutto quel che mi serviva per una scelta indovinata.
Ho potuto quindi prenotare presso il Marylebone Hotel un Afternoon tea con una offerta molto vantaggiosa: 2 persone al prezzo di 1, ovvero 38 sterline per 4 persone.
L'albergo è davvero molto bello, con un'atmosfera raffinata, discreta, senza ostentazione ma di lusso. E' situato in una bella zona di Londra, un quartiere residenziale con belle case in pieno centro.
Ci hanno fatto accomodare in una saletta riservata solo per noi 4 e ci hanno subito illustrato lo svolgimento del nostro tè pomeridiano.
Prima la scelta tra 5 tipi di tè, o in alternativa ci sarebbe stato anche il caffè; poi il menù, comprendente 5 tipi di tramezzini, degli scones, marmellata e burro e per finire della pasticceria assortita.
Il tutto servito nei classici vassoi.
La qualità del cibo servito è stata ottima,il servizio attento e cortese, l'atmosfera piacevolissima.
In definitiva abbiamo trascorso un paio di ore davvero gradevoli, ed è un'esperienza da provare senz'altro.
Il conto finale di questo pomeriggio all'insegna della più classica tradizione inglese è stato di 44 sterline, che paragonato al costo usuale per un ""afternoon tea"" a Londra è  davvero poco.
Un'ottima scelta da consigliare vivamente.",5,2012,11,04
123,Struttura di buon livello e con un rapporto prezzo qualità ottimo,"Come altre strutture al centro di Londra l'Albergo dispone di una posizione assolutamente di pregio alle spalle di Oxford ed al centro di un'area molto vitale, con caratteristiche specifiche come il centro fitness e il bar accessibile anche dall'esterno che ne  fanno una struttura di buon livello tra quelle della sua categoria. Apprezzate con molto piacere la qualità del servizio, la putlizia delle stanze - che non sempre in strutture analoghe è garantita agli stessi livelli - e i servizi offerti  agli ospiti in via standard. Piccole ma piacevoli attenzioni !",5,2012,09,11

Ci ritornerei volentieri.",4,2012,07,11
123,Ideale,"La cosa che più ha colpito me e mia moglie è stato il centro fitness: favoloso! L'albergo, comunque, offre tutte le comodità: un bar dove è possibile fare degli ottimi happy hour, un buon ristorante interno se una sera si vuole cenare in albergo. Le camere sono sufficientemente spaziose e la pulizia è impeccabile. Unica nota stonata: letti e cuscini non troppo comodi per i nostri gusti.",4,2012,06,30
123,Tutto al posto giusto!,Ho soggiornato in questo hotel per una notte solo per motivi di lavoro e sono stata davvero bene. L'albergo è di design davvero particolare e ben arredato.

Il personale è gentile e nelle stanze c'è tutto quello che serve, l'unica pecca è la camera  piccola, ma ci si stava bene comunque.
La piscina e la palestra non le ho viste, ma alcuni del mio gruppo ci sono stati e mi hanno detto che la piscina è abbastanza grande e la palestra ha tanti macchinari moderni.
In più è veramente in un bel quartiere, nella strada parallela andavo sempre a fare colazione in una pasticceria buonissima, perché in albergo era troppo cara.
In quella fascia di prezzo è sicuramente uno dei migliori hotel in cui sono stata.",4,2012,06,25

Reservamos en la web del hotel la habitación más barata: Standard Room 1 Double Bed... nos salió a unas 170 libras la noche y al llegar nos encontramos con una cama que creo que era de 1,35 m, pegada a la pared en uno de los lados y que se hundía hacia el medio!!!  vale, se duerme pero una cama incómoda por ese precio??? para mi no está justificado, ni me parece adecuado para un hotel de esa categoría tener ese tipo de habitación, al menos no para dos personas, para individual aún tendría sentido.  En mi experiencia para esa habitación la relación calidad precio no es buena.",3,2012,05,28
123,COMODO HOTEL A PREZZO ACCETTABILE,"Prima volta a Londra, quindi non ho riferimenti con altri hotel londinesi. 
Rispetto ad esperienze fatte in altre capitali europee ho avuto la senzazione cvhe sia un hotel con rapporto qualità prezzo più che accettabile. Ben collocato, personale gentile camere abbastanza confortevoli.

Costo frigobar a mio avviso un po' eccessivo.",4,2012,02,25

123,Hotel comodo e raffinato,"Il Marylbone ha come primo vantaggio il fatto di essere a pochi passi dal centro (dalla Oxfordstreet, dalla Regentstreet,...). Le camere inoltre sono molto pulite e confortevoli, il letto ha un ottimo materasso ed é molto silenzioso. Non abbiamo usufruito della piscina e della Spa perché eravamo troppo attirate dalla visita della città che ci ha sorpreso in bene. Il personale dell'albergo é tutto gentilissimo e si fanno in mille per aiutarti. L'unico lato negatico é che parlano solo e unicamente inglese, e questo é però un difetto che abbiamo riscontrato in tutta Londra, persino in aeroporto!La colazione é veramente super: tanta frutta fresca già preparata, dolci e pane fresco e poi per chi riesce c'é anche la colazione britisch! L'albergo lo consiglio tranquillamente e Londra é da vedere: semplicemente stupenda!!!",4,2011,12,12

123,"contesto splendido, struttura nella media","Abbiamo soggiornato io e mio marito per diversi giorni in questa struttura, l'hotel è stato ristrutturato di recente e quindi si presenta moderno e pulito, si trova vicino (300 m ca) alla fermata della metro ed è in un quartiere molto bello, tipicamente londinese, residenziale e tranquillo, non lontano da Soho (raggiungibile anche a piedi) e vicinissimo alle strade dello shopping più famose. Unica pecca sono le stanze, la nostra era davvero piccola e soprattutto il letto era ad una piazza e 1/2, anzichè a due e tremendamente scomodo, lo stesso dicasi dei cuscini! Il bagno era piuttosto pulito, ma ugualmente molto piccolo, non funzionava il lavandino (tubi intasati dall'inizio alla fine del ns. soggiorno) e la biancheria veniva cambiata ogni due/tre giorni, insomma non il massimo per un hotel a 4 stelle, ma considerando la posizione e gli standards londinesi, in piena media.

123,"buen hotel,pero fallan algunas cosas","Buenas noches. Estuvimos en este hotel por viaje de placer , en concreto de luna de miel!
Cogimos este hotel porque su situación es muy buena y por estar en una zona tranquila de Londres.
Cosas buenas del hotel:
Habitaciones amplias, baños amplios, plancha y secador en la habitación, desayuno aceptable, limpieza en las zonas comunes.
Cosas no tan buenas o que NO NOS GUSTARON.
estuvimos 4 dias y nadie en el hotel hablaba español, salvo el último día que nos atendió en recepción una chica que se llama Ana y hablaba español. Esto me parece impropio de un hotel de 4 estrellas.
En segundo lugar TAMPOCO NOS GUSTO ver que el baño no estaba del todo limpio, tenían manchas de suciedad la taza o al menos parecía no haber sido limpiada en condiciones.
La mampara de la ducha FATAL, tenías que poner 2 o 3 toallas para que no se te saliera el agua al suelo.
Y el último día nos encontramos en la habitación una factura de 3,85 Libras al parecer del consumo de minibar. Evidentemente bajamos y no lo cargaron y aque no habiamos ni siquiera abierto ni consumido nada.
Salvo esos pequeños detalles un hotel aceptable en una zona buena  y bien comunicada.",3,2010,09,04
123,nicht ganz so luxuriös wie erwartet,"Für ein langes Wochenende haben wir uns für The Marylebone Hotel, welches zur Doyle Collection gehört, entschieden.
Das Hotel liegt in einem Stadtteil Londons, das als ""up and coming"" beschrieben und manchmal mit dem Prenzlauer Berg in Berlin verglichen wird. In der näheren Umgebung finden sich in der Tat kleinere Cafés, Restaurants und Frühstückslokale. Vom Hotel ist es ein kurzer Weg zur Oxford Street, in der man sich sofort voll auf die Entdeckung Londons einlassen kann.
Leider ist das Hotel nicht ganz so luxuriös, wie es auf der Website den Anschein macht. Das Gebäude erscheint wie ein tristes Bürogebäude. Der Empfang war dennoch sehr herzlich. Zunächst erhielten wir ein Zimmer in einer unteren Etage mit Blick auf den Innenhof. Direkt vor dem Fenster türmte sich die Klimmaanlage. Sonnenlicht wird wohlin diesem Zimmer noch nie eine Chance gehabt haben. Auch wenn die Ausstattung für Londoner Verhältnisse sehr gut war, baten wir um ein anderes Zimmer. Der Zimmerwechsel verlief ohne Probleme, das Personal verhielt sich sehr professionell und bot uns ein nach unserer Meinung sehr viel besseres Zimmer an. Im Anschluß fragte der Receptionist noch einmal nach und stellte sicher, dass wir mit dem neuen Zimmer zufrieden waren.
Das Bad war klein, der Aufenthalt zweier Personen gleichzeitig war fast unmöglich, wobei dies keinen Einfluß auf unsere Zufriedenheit hatte.
Wenn man von dem ersten Eindruck absieht, läßt sich dieses Hotel sicher empfehlen. Wir verzichteten auf die gastronomische Betreuung durch das Hotel. Ein netter Ort zum Frühstück findet sich allemal in der Nähe. Wir wählte ""The Giraffe"", eine Kette, die auch eine Filiale am Flughafen Heathrow unterhält.",4,2010,08,11
123,"Sehr gutes Hotel, guter Service, gute Lage","Wir haben das Marylebone im Dezember 2009 besucht und waren begeistert. Top-Service, freundliches Personal. Das Frühstück sowie das Essen im Restaurant waren sehr gut. Das Marylebone ist zurecht ein Geheimtip, da es sich zudem in einer sehr guten Lage befindet.
Leider waren die Preise im März und Juli 2010 deutlich teuer als im Dezember, so dass wir uns für das Marriott entschieden haben, obwohl wieder gerne im Marylebone gebucht hätten .",5,2010,08,04

Das Zimmer war sehr klein, aber sauber und sehr gemütlich, die Matrazen sehr bequem, das Badezimmer hingegen so winzig, dass zuweilen artistische Kunststücke nötig waren, um sich einigermaßen ungehindert bewegen zu können.
Der Internetzugang ist inklusive, WLAN gibt es aber nur im Lobby-Bereich, so dass mit einem iPad auf dem Zimmer nicht viel anzufangen war.",4,2010,07,11
123,Schönes Hotel in toller Lage,"Das Marylebone ist ein echter Geheimtip unter den Londoner Hotels. In Laufweite zum Regent's Park, zur Oxford Street und in zehn Minuten mit dem Taxi von Paddington Station zu erreichen, bietet es einen sehr guten Ausgangspunkt für Geschäftstermine in der City oder ein wenig Shopping und Sightseeing während der Freizeit. Die Zimmer sind modern eingerichtet und absolut perfekt für den kurzen Businesstrip. Sehr empfehlenswert ist ein kurzer Ausflug auf die Marylebone Highstreet, eine schöne Einkaufsstraße eines gehobenen Londoner Viertels.",5,2010,06,02
123,"Un buen hotel, quizás sobrevalorado...","En primer lugar, hay que decir que estamos ante un buen hotel, dentro de los de clase alta de la ciudad, 4 estrellas, si no recuerdo mal, con una ubicación excepcional, a 3 minutos andando de Oxford Street, una de las calles principales y más turísticas de la ciudad, con parada de metro (bond street), nada más salir a la misma.

Es un hotel moderno, bien cuidado, sobre todo las zonas comunes, y en particular los baños de las mismas, que si cabe son más confortables, modernos y acogedores que los de las propias habitaciones. 

Las habitaciones son más bien pequeñas, con todas las comodidades, limpias y agradables, si bien se echa en falta algun sitio para dejar la maleta o un armario más amplio en que depositar los abrigos/camisas o pantalones, si tu viaje se acomete por un período de una semana o más.

El personal del hotel no habla castellano, pero es muy atento, y en caso de cualquier inconviniente con la habitación, la televisión o la caja fuerte, tratan de solucionártelo rápidamente.

El desayuno es a modo buffet, completo y variado, con abundantes salados, y algo dulce, para coger las fuerzas necesarias para visitar esta gran urbe.

Así mismo, el propio hotel dispone de restaurante a la carta, excesivamente caro, para lo que ofrece en el menú, para mi bolsillo y paladar, dificil de descifrar en su contenido  los platos que figuran en la carta, para los no plenamente bilingües (al igual que debe resultar complicado traducir al inglés, los platos de la nouvelle cuisine española), y el servicio del mismo no es todo lo atento que debiera.

En general un buen hotel, francamente bien situado, pero excesivamente caro a mi gusto y parecer el hospedaje en el mismo, el precio por noche y habitación lo encuentro algo elevado para lo que el establecimiento oferta.",3,2010,04,12
123,l'hotel è veramente bello,"L'hotel è veramente bello, arredato con stile classico-contemporaneo, con una particolare attenzione per ogni piccolo dettaglio anche nelle decorazioni floreali, che rispecchia il mio gusto estetico ed è per questo motivo che l'ho scelto, nonchè per la buona posizione vicina ad Oxford streeet (via centrale piena di negozi) e alla metro Bond Street (perfetta per girare tutta la città).
La colazione continentale è buona (cornetti, marmellate, yogurt, cereali, frutta, nonchè il salato e la colazione all'inglese), ma per gli italiani che non fanno la colazione all'inglese forse ci dovrebbe essere una maggior scelta di dolci; la sala colazione è perfetta, ricrea proprio quel giusto ambiente intimo...very english. 
Lo staff sia alla reception che alla sala colazione è gentile e professionale, ma dovrebbero conoscere un minimo di italiano.
Ci sono diversi ambienti, salottini, molto curati e ben arredati dove è picevole sedersi e riposarsi dopo aver visitato la città.
Purtroppo non abbiamo avuto il tempo per vedere la piscina.
La nostra camera era la 323: ben arredata in stile contemporaneo, ma un pò piccolina (non c'è uno spazio dove poter mettere i bagagli, così si è costretti a posizionarli per terra diminuendo ulteriormente i passaggi per passare); oltre alla televisione a schermo piatto, c'è la tavola e il ferro da stiro, il phon, tutto il necessario per farsi il thè da soli, la cassetta di sicurezza, una comoda poltrona con in più una scrivania con poltroncina. Il bagno è un pò piccolo e senza il bidet è un vero problema; purtroppo sulle mattonelle bianche della doccia si vedeva un pò di muffa che non si addice ad un hotel a 4 stelle; il rubinetto posto lateralmente al lavello è troppo scomodo e se si aggiunge che il nostro lavello si otturava il disagio si aggravava; anche il water non scaricava bene e il fatto che non ci sia una ventola di aspirazione dei cattivi odori è inconcepibile.  Abbiamo fatto presente per ben 2 volte allo staff della reception (sia in inglese che con l'unica ragazza italiana) del problema del lavello, ma non sono riusciti a ripararlo e il disagio lo abbiamo avuto per tutti e 4 i giorni del nostro soggiorno.
L'hotel lo consiglierei comunque ai miei amici (perchè comunque è di buon livello e ben posizionato) nella speranza che non incorrano nei nostri stessi disagi, i quali con un pò di buona volontà e con delle piccole accortezze sono facilmente risolvibili.
P.S.= Le recensioni negative probabilmente si riferiscono a quando l'hotel si chiamava Jurys Clifton Ford Hotel, ma poi è stato ristrutturato e vale la pena soggionarci.",4,2009,10,07
123,"Excelente, bien comunicado, habitaciones y baño muy amplio, personal muy amable, hotel con encanto","Estuvimos dos parejas en Julio en Londres, se trataba de un viaje muy especial y nos decidimos por el hotel Marylebone, elección muy muy acertada.
Hotel muy bien situado(3 minutos andando a la parada de metro de Bond Street-conecta con multitud de líneas), y en todo el centro de Londres muy cerca de Oxford Street, ubicado en una zona muy exclusiva.
 Habitaciones muy amplias, muy limpias y cuidadas de todo tipo de detalles y baño muy espacioso.
El personal del hotel superamable y muy servicial,habla perfectamente español, desayuno completisimo, exquisito y muy abundante, spa y piscina cubierta espectacular, instalaciones del hotel inmejorables.
En pocas palabras este hotel acaba con el tópico de los hoteles ingleses(habitaciones pequeñas, sucios, no en la categoria de las estrellas otorgadas...), ya que es todo lo contrario, hotel de 4 estrellas que superan a muchos de esta categoria en España.

Reservar ya este hotel , a que esperais... y no olvideis tomar una cerveza en el pub que hace esquina muy cerca del hotel, todas las noches música en directo muy muy muy inglesa...no os arrepentireis.",5,2009,07,26
123,excelente relacion calidad-precio. servicio a mejorar,"sería un hotel excelente, por su ubicacion, diseño e instalaciones si no tuviese un servicio tan poco eficiente. Es deplorable que ni tan solo en inglés nos pudiesen solucionar las diferentes incidencias que tuvimos (maletas, checkin, incluso tuvimos un fire-alarm a las 6.45!! que nos desperto sobresaltados...)pero la experiencia en general fue muy buena. Traerse bañador porque despues de un dia por Londres, hacer un chapuzón es un lujo de agradecer. Las habitaciones son muy correctas a nivel de diseño y espacio por lo que es el London average de los mid-range hoteles...",4,2009,06,06
123,Buen Hotel con sus peros...cuidado con el minibar y recepcion,"Después de mucho mirar y remirar en internet hoteles en londres, nos decidimos por este, habia una oferta en su pagina web, no estaba muy convencida, porque en los mapas parecia muy lejos la parada de metro, pero no, la parada de bond street estaba a escasos 5 minutos, las habitaciones en las criticas indicaban que eran pequeñas, entonces decidimos alojarnos en la habitacion luxury, un poco mas espaciosa que la normal y una maquina de nesspreso (el cual solo tenia 3 monodosis, y no repusieron en las 3 noches q estuvimos), la habitacion era practicamente igual que la que enseñan en las fotos, eso si... sin albornoz ni chanclas, tuvimos que bajar a recepcion a pedir que nos llevaran unas, para bajar a la piscina, hablando de la recepcion era pesima ningun recepcionista hablaba español y ellos mismos no hacian por entenderse ni entenderte a ti, lo mejor que al llegar nos ofrecieron toallas humedas para refrescarte.
Tambien destacar las vistas nulas de la ventana que daban a un patio interior, y el engaño del minibar, es automatico y si mueves la bebida te la cargan automaticamente a tu cuenta ¡cuidadooo!!",4,2009,06,03
