52,Enjoy Barcelona!,"We were a group of 2 famiies with 7 of us all together.  The kitchen was small and my daughter slept in the living space, but otherwise it was a great location, very clean and comfortable and very close to the Sagrada Familia and restaurants.  Only drawback was the street noise at night.",5,2024,09,28
52,"Great Hotel, Great Location","My Husband, me & my 11 year old daughter stayed in Hotel Parque La Paz on the 29th December for 10 days
I want to start my review by mentioning the staff in Parque La Paz hotel, they were exceptionally helpful and friendly, and not because they were paid to be, it felt like they were genuinely friendly.
Rooms were really lovely exactly what the pictures showed on the website, cleaned everyday.  Beds really comfortable and big balconies, Kitchen equiped with everything you could need.
Swimming Pool was lovely and clean and full time lifeguard.  the three sections of the swimming pool were different depth's which was great for different swimming levels, not a huge amount of interaction from the animation team but we were lucky enough to catch the inflatables in the water twice.
The food was nice from the pool bar, however, the buffet wasn't great we only ate breakfast one morning and didn't try it again, food was only ok and not anyway warm, great value in local restaurants much more worth the money.  We spoke to other guests staying that were full board but they were also leaving the hotel in the evenings for dinner.
Location was fantastic, out the door and around the corner your on the main trip of restaurants and shops.  Beach was a 5 minute walk.
Will definatley be going back again.",4,2024,01,20
52,WORST SERVICE / APARTMENT AVOID,"I am so disappointed to have stayed with this place. We stayed for about 3 nights 4days where we were fined €220 for making a bit of noise in our 6 bed apartment. 

We were asked to sign a document without any explanation on what it involved , not even explain that noise levels are a big deal and should there be loud noises it will result in being charged.

As a group of friends you can understand there will be some noise. 

Over the three nights not a single time was the apartment cleaned. It was actually disgusting, we requested new towels to be told there was not enough and was left with dirty horrible towels for 3 full nights and 1 day. The bathrooms were filthy as you imagine with 6 people staying the apartment and we could not even get something little as new towels. 

We were told they clean every third day , which they failed to do when challenged they said oh but your leaving tomorrow anyway so it does not matter. On top of not even getting clean towels , you are expected to take out all the rubbish and leave the apartment clean??? Sorry but what did we pay for?

On departure when returning keys rather than discussing the issue regarding the noise and explaining why we are being charged. Our card was charged at a later date. 

The reception is also on the 2nd floor , there no one to greet you when you arrive. For such a large apartment block there’s a tiny lift you can just about fit in. 

I would avoid, the only thing you get is a nice view from the rooms.  The bedrooms do not even have any mirrors apart from the one bathroom. It also states there’s two bathrooms which would make sense with 6 people but only one had a toilet??? 

So for 6 people trying to get ready and use a tiny bathroom mirror is pretty much a joke. Again when asked no help .

I WOULD AVOID THIS SPACE! ITS MARKETED GREAT BUT HAS HIDDEN COSTS WHICH ARE NOT EVEN EXPLAINED FROM THR OUTSET .",1,2019,09,20
52,AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!!,"I recently stayed here for my hen party with a group of other women (The majority being over the age of 50). We were asked to pay a deposit of 250 euros which we were happy to pay knowing full well that we were not a noisy or untidy group of ladies and had no reason to believe we wouldn't get this back. Two days after arriving home, we received an email to say that we are not entitled to claim our 250 euro deposit back due to reports of noise from neighbours at 10pm!!! We had no phone call or knock on the door from anyone to inform us of said complaint, nor were we noisy!!! We were due to get picked up for the airport the following morning at 6am so we were in bed extremely early to be up and out the door to catch our flight! Hen or Stag Do's please AVOID this place at all costs! It seems like they target large groups and claim noise disturbance so that they can keep your deposit!! DO NOT STAY HERE! We also complained about having no hot water for a shower but we were told it was because of the time of day we were trying to shower (which varied depending on the activities we had been carrying out on that particular day) so again this was a lie and the issue was not resolved! The cleanliness isn't fantastic either and the views from the bathroom windows in the back bedrooms are disgusting!! The lady on arrival was extremely rude and told us our rooms weren't ready but that we could pay an additional fee to go up early? (clearly the rooms were ready but another scam to try and take more money from us) also the heating unit didn't work nor did the television and our towels weren't changed once in the 3 nights we were there! PLEASE AVOID!!!!",1,2019,05,03
52,What a hidden gem!,"Location is amazing! So close to Sagrada Familia, metro and buses. Reception was very helpful. The apartment was so big! We were so impressed. It went on forever and then had a terrace overlooking Sagrada amilia and Barcelona. I would definitely recommend this palce and stay there again!",5,2019,01,09
52,Excellent for location!,If you are travelling to barcelona in a group this could be a great place to stay. It is pretty lively and sagrada familia is directly visible from the windows. Ask for a higher floor. The appartments do have a lift. DO not forget to check out the terrace which is open to use for all. The apartments does boast to have 2 bathrooms but only 1 WC. This could be a matter of inconvenience in large groups. There are 2 bathing areas though.,4,2018,10,15
52,Penthouse Apt AB,"What fantastic value for money. The apartment fits 8 people in three double bedrooms and two singles with its own little terrace area overlooking the Sagrada Família and with a fab view of it from the lounge too. One floor higher and there is a cool roof terrace for all the apartments in the building. Little surprise we didn’t realise was that they opened a bar there from 5-8pm with a free welcome glass of fizz. Perfect little touch. We were a group of 6 friends & we got the apartment through booking.com for 2 nights for around £400! The apartment block has plenty of local shops and restaurants around it and is 15 mins in a cab to Las Ramblas although the tube was nearby. If you view this apartment as a steal in value you won’t be disappointed. Two toilets and one shower for info & that’s where the mirrors are located. The apartment needs a full sized mirror , or even light mirrors on the inside of the wardrobe doors. My only grumble! ",4,2018,10,08
52,Not as expected,"We booked a three bedroomed apartment here for July 2018.Chose it for its location which was as said very close to the Sagrada Familia and some nice bars and restaurants.  This booking wad made nearly a year in advance.  On arrival we found that there were only two bedrooms (one with a double bed and the other two singles) and the third bedroom was actually in the lounge with a sofa bed.  Whilst the two bedroomed were OK for twin grandsons and 
their parents it was not ideal for me, being in my 70s and disabled, to have to sleep on a sofa.

We took this up with the manager who agreed we had not been allocated what we had booked and what had 
actually been confirmed to us by booking.com.  However we were told that back in Sept that particular apartment was no longer being offered as a 3 bed.  We feel we should have been notified of this and offered alternative accommodation but despite numerous messages back and forth to booking.com they refused to give us any compensation.  The apartment was not particularly clean and was not what we had expected.  Very disappointed",2,2018,08,27
52,Shocking and check carefully what you book is what you get.,"We booked well ahead in September 2017 a 3 bed apartment for 1 night for 5 people (myself, husband, 2 teens and mother-in-law). Some time between then and July 2018 when we traveled they changed our booking WITHOUT INFORMING US to a 2 bed that accommodates up to 6 people, 4 people could be accommodated in the 2 bedrooms and the other 2 were expected to sleep on a sofa bed in the lounge. This defeats the point of an apartment with a separate lounge to congregate in. The apartment looks NOTHING like the photos on the website so be warned. 6 people sharing 1 shower is ridiculous. There is an extra toilet but it was quite frankly disgusting. Electrical sockets were hanging loose from the wwalking there were huge chunks and holes in the walls. The response from the property implued  it was our fault as they no longer offer 1 night and 5 people automatically go into an apartment that can take up to 6 people.How is that our fault? That wasn't what we booked but they still charged full price for a 3 bed. A complete joke.",1,2018,07,23
52,Great for families,"In the heart of Barcelona, with views of the Gaudi’s La Sagrada Familia, Possibly the most iconic structure in Barcelona great accommodation ideal for families. Quite an old establishment but it’s clean and secure. Self service key entry. ",4,2018,06,11
52,Amazing Apartments - Great for large groups,"Stayed here recently while on a hen party. There were 8 of us. 1 double bed, 2 singles, a bunk bed and a pull out bed/settee. The apartment was very clean and had everything you need while away. There are a few quaint little restaurants nearby and a taxi rank right on the corner. Would definitely stay here again.",5,2018,05,15
52,Amazing apartment & staff!!,"‘Clean, central, helpful hosts, fab location’

We were a hen party of 5 and the apartment exceeded expectations!! 

➖ Not necessarily didn’t like the bedrooms needed full length mirrors  a necessity  for us women!! Lol.  And international tv more channels needed in English haha!!

➕ Welcoming hosts, great communication and helpfulness

Fab location, beautiful views of La Sagrada Familia!! Easy access to all amenities fab restaurant less than 5 mins called La Llesca!! 

Would definitely come back ! ",5,2018,04,24
52,Stag Do Weekend,"We chose the apartment as it allowed us to be all together, we were 6 people and everyone had its own bed and it was quite convenient and very well located. 
The reception is very good, the apartment is clean and it has all basics.
It is nothing luxury but you will be able to use the kitchen to prepare some food, you have washing machine and 2 bathrooms so it is very good for large groups or families.
The cafe downstairs in front of the hotel and the shop are also easy to get something quickly and get back.
Unfortunately I was unable to go to the roof to see the terrace and i can't comment.

Good place.",4,2018,04,23
52,Great accommodation for larger groups,"Great communication with the apartments through booking.com to accommodate our large group.  Everyone was happy with their apartments and the functionality. Being able to prepare their own food and relax together was a huge positive. Most of us were located close to each other also. Thankfully there is a lift as the top floors are a bit of a hike with luggage! 

Arrangements had been made with certain individuals to check in to make damage payments however those not named were permitted to check in which caused a bit of an issue internally but didn't cause too much of a problem.

There are plenty places to eat around about and supermarkets to get things to make in the apartment. The rooftop terrace has lovely views also. The apartments are near a busy crossroad though and some apartments were noisier than others although not unbearable. ",4,2018,04,15
52,Easter Weekend,"I came here as part of a group of 20 women over Easter weekend. We had 3 apartments in total; on level E, level 1 and level 5 (even though we had asked well in advance for them to be together).
Each apartment was clean & tidy although they didn’t look like the management photos - perhaps the refurbishments are still ongoing. The beds were very comfortable and the location was great for seeing the sagrada familia at both day & night, although it is a 20-30 min taxi ride away from las ramblas and there are limited bars and restaurants around the apartments. The roof terrace is a great size and we spent half a day here as it’s quite the sun trap.
The downside to these apartments is the middle column; it is a very small echoey space that means any little bit of noise from anyone’s room travels very loudly up & down, even if you don’t have your windows open. Not good if you want to sleep between the hours of 10pm-2am as this is when the most noise is made!!!",3,2018,04,05
52,brilliant accomodation,"we were greeted with a pleasant recpetionist who took us to the room (there is a lift and stairs) and informed us of the rooftop garden with lounger s(great view). The apartment had 1 double and 2 x twin rooms all spacious. in addition a kitchen, two bathrooms and a living/dining areas. the living sopoace and at least two bedrooms has views of the sagrada familia which is a couple of mins walk away (as is the sagrada metro). There kitchen is small but well equipted (also iron and hairdryer). Local bakery is opposite and supermarket just around the corner.  We could not ffault this and will definitly stay here again. Local area has much nicer retsurants than those we tried in the gother quarter and la ramblas. (cheaper too). Highly recommened if travelling with friends/family where you need multiple rooms and wish for use of a kitchen.",5,2018,03,13
52,"Convenient location, fantastic roof terrace with great views","We stayed here as a group of 7 women, and had plenty of space. The apartment was located very close to the Sagrada Familia, and therefore the Metro station.

Plenty of restaurants and bars to choose from nearby, and very accessible to the rest of the city thanks to the Metro.

Comfortable accommodation with three double beds and a single bed. There was a sofa bed which we didn't need.

The star of the show was our personal terrace and the roof terrace one floor up, with incredible panoramic views of the city. Sagrada Familia looks brilliant at dusk!

Recommended for those who would just like a comfortable place to sleep and relax after their busy day of tourist activities.",5,2017,10,30
52,Great location but the noise !!,Just returning from a great weekend in this lovely city. My sister niece and 80 year old mother. Apartments have a fab location with stunning views of the sagrada which is a stones throw away. Was advertised as two bathrooms but only one had a toilet. Hmmmm poetic licence here. Decor is lovely but paintwork needs sprucing up a bit. It was nice and clean. Three bedrooms good wardrobes but no mirrors apart from bathroom and sharing a toilet between four or six not my cup of tea. Major downside was the traffic noise. The apartments are at a major intersection and the traffic drones all night long. Didn't sleep a wink first night and resorted to white noise on the iPad after. It needs double glazing. Also no air conditioning so in the height of summer it would swelter. Health and safety also a concern. One tiny lift a majestic spiral staircase but no fire escapes nor fire alarms. Not sure how they get around that. That said a great weekend would I recommend yes if you can sleep next to the m25. ,3,2017,10,02
52,Great service!!,"A short weekend stay for a group of around 15. Initially the group was smaller but with the increased numbers we decided another room would be best. This was pretty easy arranging with the company and swiftly arranged. 

We had three apartments which were better than expected in all honestly. From the look of it, they are in the process of updating the decor which looks up to date and really looks good. The apartment itself is faultless and has all the amenities required. However, locks on the bathrooms would be better. 

Views from the room are great and there is a roof top terrace if you fancy some better views. 

Apartments are clean and spacious. 

Only thing to be aware of are the heaps of steps you may need to use if you are closer to the top. There is a lift, but it's tiny!! Also, I noticed quite a few other groups staying in other apartments. So if you are thinking of an early night, expect some music and lots of taking. 

Finally, I left some property at the address. And thankfully with the help of these guys, and a painfully slow courier service I finally got my items back. 

I would certainly come back to stay here when I visit again in a large group. Great service, apartment and great location. ",5,2017,08,07
52," Ok apartment - fantastic neighbourhood","We stayed here for 4 nights, and it was ok. 3 bedrooms, one og them with a ""real window"" - the windows on the other rooms faced out behind the elevator. 2 nice bathrooms - but the shower dispencer were empty in both. There should be some place to hang the towels in the appartment! The livingroom was huge, but there were only a sofa + tv, and a big diningtable - no sofa table. The kitchen was nice - we much appriciated the coffee machine! 

We had little to do with the people in the reseption, but they seemed nice, always smiling. 

The area is so nice - lots of places to eat outside, and a fantastic view to the Sagrada Familia! ",3,2017,07,26
52,noisy and insecure,"Groups of young people having party upstairs, they came into our apartment, we still dont know hoe they could get in, we were afraid with our children, windows and doors didn't lock no fire security, absolutely we are not coming back, we felt very upset and insecure",1,2017,06,12
52,Great experience and a wonderful stay,"I had a surprisingly good experience at this hotel, starting with a very warm, friendly, helpful and welcoming reception. This is a complete surprise after experiencing a dour reception at a Paris hotel, and impersonal receptions in hotels in London. I booked a 3-bedroom apartment here and it was clean, tidy and comfortable. The sitting, dining and one of the bedroom even has a clear view of the beautiful Sagrada Cathedral!! All the rooms are spacey and lots of natural light. The master bedroom has an ensuite bath, and another common bathroom is outside for the other rooms. The kitchen is complete and has a washing machine. The hotel is just 200m walk to the Sagrada Cathedral, and also a metro station. It opens out into a pedestrian mall with lots of cafes, tapas bars and restaurants, as well as general provisions shop. Some rooms were undergoing renovations, but it did not bother us since work was during the day, and stop in the night. However the lift is very small, and slow. Wifi is free and good, while street parking is free after 8pm or at a nearby parking facility for EUR20 overnight. You are also expected to help take your rubbish out and put it into the bins situated at the roadsides near the hotel on checking out.",4,2017,03,06
52,"Failed expectations, unprofessional service, unadequate infrastructure","""Our facilities are completely renewed and accomplished for giving our guests the best comforts."" -- Well, be aware that half the apartments are still undergoing major renovations, so the whole building is dirty, noisy and shouldn't be open for business while works last. 

""Our multilingual staff will help you with anything you may need and they will give you any information about the beautiful Barcelona. We want you to feel like you were home."" -- Well, we arrived on Christmas day and the ""madame"" that 'welcomed' us, asked for 20EUro ""cash"" because she had to be there on a holiday. She didn't bother to help with the lugagge or even come upstairs to show us the apartment. 

We were first located on the first floor apartment, which clearly needs to be renovated. Since they don't show it on their website or on booking, I'm attaching some pictures hereby. Not only it was poorly decorated, but it appeared dirty, it had a broken piece of furniture in the bathroom (it looked as if it had been rescued from a garbage container) and there was rust on the bathtub. 

After complaining about it all, we were moved to the penthouse. Although it was better decorated, it still smelled like tabaco and the bedroom windows and blinds were old and in bad shape (also attaching pictures here). We found a dirty cup (filled wiht coffee and cigarrettes) on the terrace and a half full bottle of wine in the bathroom cabinet (??) from previous tenants. I'm unable to describe the plastic flowers and plastic green grass on the otherwise nice terrace. 

After talking to other guests, who were also disappointed, I must believe most positive reviews are hoaxes or stayed here when things didn't get this bad.",1,2017,01,04
52,Great views and Location,"We stayed here for a long weekend , a group of 6 from work ..
The apartments are just 5 minutes from a metro station and Cathedral Sagrada Familia ..
Clean , spacious with great views and friendly helpful staff ..",5,2016,10,06
52,On route to Spain,"Stopped here on our way to Spain and on our return journey. Had rooms 5.3 and 3.3 both met our needs of a family of 4 adults and 4 children. Very clean and modern no faults here. Marc and Iban were extremely helpful. The lift is small and stairs very steep and spiral f you have mobility problems. 

Excellent location with bars, restaurants and shops just out the front on the pedestrian street. Everything good value for money. 

The  bus tour is definitely a must.

Love this city and we will be back next year ",5,2016,08,19
52,Disappointing,"We stayed for a week, my husband & I and our 3 year old daughter.  We arrived over the weekend and had to be met by a member of staff out of hours as the reception doesn't open over the weekend.  The reception has very short hours and we didn't really deal with anyone except Patricia (very nice) who met us to check in.  We stayed on the first floor and our room was very disappointing, it was like a completely different apartment to what we had viewed on the website.  The apartment however was in a great location and spacious and beds comfy but that was about it for us.  There was a couch in the seating area that the 3 of us fit on barely!  and this was an apartment to fit 6 adults so if 6 adults stayed they would even have a seat (and the dining table only had 4 chairs).  The facilities were as they said in regard to the kitchen and bathrooms which was great.  The noise was another problem we had as we were only on first floor and the windows didn't seem to close properly and not all the shutters closed to try drown out more noise.  The roof top garden looks very rough and dirty and not a bit like the photo they supply no lovely greenery or decking!! 

Overall it was fine and clean and central, but i always find it very disappointing when the places you stay are so far from the photos.  I understand from the other reviews that some rooms have been re-decorated, so my advice would be to stay here but asked for the re-decorated rooms.",3,2016,05,14
52,"Clean spacious apartments, amazing views, friendly staff","We stayed for 5 nights in a three bedroom apartment with a baby and young child and it suited our needs very well. They are clean and spacious with an incredible view of Sagrada Familia. Even when we returned to the apartment for daynaps or early evenings we could still marvel at the amazing view from our lounge room. 
Very helpful and friendly staff who spoke and emailed in fluent English. Highly recommended. Would definitely stay here again.",5,2016,05,02
52,What a view ,"It was my dream for long time: Barcelona and Sagrada Familia. And it become true. We rented apartment in Suite Home Barcelona and... We could admire Sagrada Familia sitting on the sofa. 
Place is clean, well equipped. Subway station is close to the apartments, what is very convenient. What you need more?",4,2016,04,23
52,Love it here!,This is the second time I have stayed in these apartments and I have had a great experience both times. We stayed in 3.2 which has clearly just been re-decorated. It is really modern and well laid out. The beds are extremely comfy! These apartments are so reasonably priced for Barca and absolutely spotless. They are in an ideal location to explore the city and boast views of Sagrada Familia. The staff are very polite and helpful. I went with my mum and my Gran and they loved it here. We chose a three bedroom apartment so we had our own rooms but it is made for 6. My Gran appreciated the lift access! Apartment block is located right beside the underground and it's easy to get taxis from right outside. Nice tapas restaurants nearby and a good supermarket. I will definitely stay here again. ,5,2016,04,08
52,"Amazing location, well maintained flat","We stayed in 5D, with panoramic views of Sagrada Familia from the living room. Perfectly set up for a weekend or week away with a group of friends - there was only two of us but you could comfortably put six people in there!",4,2015,12,15
52,"Good apartment, good location, but noisy!","Just back from a 3 night stay at Suite Home Barcelona. Apartment was easy to find and check in was quick. Reception had e mailed me beforehand to confirm check in time and I had e mailed a couple of queries to which they responded quickly. Apartment was nice and big and clean. It seemed as if a re wire had recently been done and new A/C fitted.The old wiring and sockets looked a bit tatty and needed tidying up, hopefully work is still in progress. We had a 3 bedroom apartment for 2 adults and 2 children which worked well as we had a little more space and more towels and bedding (there is only one pillow each and the duvets were singles in a double cover - we used 2 singles on a double bed). Unfortunately the downfall of this apartment was the very busy road outside which was noisy all day and all night and for this reason I would not stay again. Our nights were very disturbed :-( (may have been that we are not used to any traffic noise at night at home!).
The actual location of the apartment was great. Very near to La Sagrada Familia, near to the Metro and loads of restaurants nearby. A little shop opposite for bread and milk etc. We did venture up to the rooftop garden which is currently being refurbished. The views are spectacular and I would imagine it is a real suntrap in the summer.",3,2015,11,02
52,Suite Home= Sweet Home,"We stayed in a room  on the last  floor for days. The large  balcon  with fantastic views down to Sagrada Familia. There were six  of us; myself, my wife & two good friends & their wifes. All three bedrooms were fine. The lounge was very large and the kitchen was well equipped. The area was pleasant, with a number of good cafes & restaurants on the Gaudi avenue. . The location was ideal within walking distance to the metro station. The rooms were spacious, clean and had everything you needed. Good wifi too!! Staff was  very helpful and friendly I recommend this place  with confidence for those visiting Barcelona and want a friendly and warm apartment",5,2015,10,22
52,Excellent location,"We stayed in room 5.1 on the 5th floor. It's outstanding feature was the THREE balconies (one from bedroom, two from the lounge) with fantastic views down to Sagrada Familia.

There were four of us; myself, my wife & two sons (both over 18 now) - we'd only booked two bedrooms, but got a third in to the bargain, so the boys had one each. All three bedrooms were fine. The lounge was very large and the kitchen was well equipped.

There was a separate toilet from the bathroom, which itself also had a toilet. The bathroom was the only real downside: ridiculously they had crammed in TWO showers as well as the sink & toilet, in to a fairly small room, so there was no room to walk, let alone swing a cat!

Overall though we were happy with the apartment - the balcony really made it.

The area was pleasant, with a number of good cafes & restaurants on the avenue leading down to Sagrada.

52,"Full European Experience, No American Standards of Comfort","Home Suite Barcelona has a great location close to La Sagrada, Hop on Hop off bus, restaurants, and shops; however, if you expect any level of American standards of comfort this is not the place for you. 
My reservation was for a 4 bedroom, 2 bathroom apartment.  We got a 3 bedroom apartment, and there were 2 bathrooms; however, both showers were in the same bathroom.  Additionally, the bathroom with the showers was so horribly configured you couldn't even use the toilet, as it was behind the sink with less than 6 inches of clearance for you feet/legs.  We also referred to the shower as the shower of death because the configuration was so bad and the floor so slippery that you had to wedge yourself in the corner of the shower so as not to fall down, burn yourself on the faucet, or accidentally bump the faucet and either scald or freeze yourself in the process of attempting to shower.  The beds were moderately comfortable, the pillows highly uncomfortable, and the beds had no covers other than sheets.  The air conditioning worked fine in the bedrooms for the most part, but was highly ineffective in the family room. Additionally, during the first evening around 10:30pm half of the power went out in the unit to include the air conditioning which made for a very hot and uncomfortable summer night.  So if you are looking for that true European experience close to the sites this is acceptable; however, next time I will definitely be finding an American chain hotel.",3,2015,07,10
52,Fab location right near Sagrada Familia. Great value,"Stayed at these apartments for 3 nights in May with family. Was really impressed. The location was ideal with plenty of nice cafes, restaurants within walking distance as well as a metro station.  The rooms were spacious, clean and had everything you needed.  Good wifi too!!  Staff were all very helpful and friendly.  Will definitely stay again on return to Barcelona.",5,2015,05,08
52,Not bad but not 3 BEDROOMS! ,"I booked suite home Barcelona for a weekend trip with friends, I didn't want any of us to have to sleep on a pull out bed as I wanted us to all have our own room this was the main reason I booked suite home Barcelona as it said 3 bedrooms and it looked spacious plus the review were quite good.
It's not 3 bedrooms one of.us had to sleep on the pull out bed in the living area which was comfy although the front bedroom and the living room face the street and it was quite noisy.
The windows in the living room didn't lock and although it was 1st floor it was still a concern. 
The apartment itself was very clean and modern enough very basic although for the cost it was good value for money.
Down side was as it was a Sunday we couldn't store our luggage as there was no one on reception.It is not in the Exiample area but just outside so even though it is close to sagrada familia it felt a long way from everything else. The area around felt vert safe with the lovley chocolat cafe downstairs which was very reasonably priced and a fab bakery across the road.
Down sides lack of luggage storage,  only 2 bedrooms small lift and very steep winding stairs that whilst they were quaint are no good for anyone with mobility issues. 
The staff were very helpful though. Probably wouldn't stay again only because of location.",3,2015,04,28
52,Excellent location and friendly staff,"The receptionist was very helpful. We went to La Sagrada and couldn't get in due to long queue so we went back to the hotel and she helped us book tickets for the afternoon straight away. She was also kind enough to use the computer for online check in for our flight back home. The location is great, only a short walk from La Sagrada familia. We stayed in the apartment for six people. The decor is not very modern but everything is provided. It's got 3 bedrooms, a small kitchen, one bathroom with toilet and a separate toilet which makes it quite convenient for six people. It's also got a separate living room with dining table. Overall, nice stay, would stay again.",4,2015,03,09
52,Clean well located 3 rooms overseeing Sagrada Familia,"Great welcome, easy check-in, friendly Elisa, spacious even for 6 of us with 3 bedrooms. Great view from dining room. Good wifi. Located well. There is a small lift and that helps. Bathroom kind of small for one, but at least there were two of them. Recommend stocking some basic cooking provisions in case guest would like to do some light cooking. On the whole would not mind staying again.",4,2014,11,13
52,Perfect Barcelona accomodations.,"I stumbled on this delightfully awesome and rustic rental apartment thru the Internet and after reading some reviews from different sites, I was convinced to give it a try. The apartment is ideally located just a block from the Basilica Sagrada Familia with affordable sidewalk cafes,tapas restaurants and convenience stores just outside the building or a few minutes leisure walk. The contemporary designed 3-bedroom we had, with 2 full baths and 1 toilet unit with a full kitchen, a full sized refrigerator, microwave, coffee maker and with complete utensils, offers a front-row-center view of the Basilica and Plaza Gaudi. There is a safe inside the closet and it's free as well as the WI-Fi. The lobby area is quite limited and the only elevator in service can only carry 3-4 people at a time. If exercise is required, check out the spiral staircase. My emails before our Barcelona arrival about some inquiries or help were expeditiously answered by Elisa Vivas, the manager of the apartment building that speaks perfect English and even went out of her day off to help us with some other petty questions and assistance. Our 2-day stay in Barcelona is so enjoyable and hustle-free with no hiccups that I'm seriously considering retiring in this magnificent city. Don't worry about pickpockets. They are all over the world. Just mind your wallets and purses at all times and use common sense when carrying stuff with you. Tourists does not really care if you have a lot of blings/designer bags and fat wallets in your back pockets  because they are more interested about the place being visited, but pickpockets, on the other hand, does. ( I apologize for not having a shot of the main bedroom of the apartment. )",5,2014,10,26
52,Nice stay in Bacelona next to Sagrada Familia,"Excellent location, two blocks from Sagrada Familia, Metro station and double Decker bus stop. Near to many restaurants, coffee shops and grocery stores. Staff very friendly. Spacious apartment. Very good WiFi. Well equipped apartment but no clothes dryer.
Bathrooms kind of small. Would consider stay again .",4,2014,07,12
52,"Clean, great location and views, but basic","Stayed here with three friends for the Spanish  F1.

As the title says it's clean, furnishings are OK, views excellent, welcome great. We never saw the roof garden and to be honest never knew it existed until I saw the photos on this site.

I would not have liked the apartment if I was on holiday, but it was a good value place given we were hardly in the apartment.

Would I use again, probably not, it's too basic.",3,2014,05,19
52,Superb,Excellent 3 bedroom apartment with balcony's and the most amazing view of Sagrada Familia to boot  - beds really comfortable we stayed in Beethoven apt' . 2 showers which really helped with 3 ladies and would of been good to have a tall mirror though. Metro 5 min walk and restaurants/bars in the main street below. Benefit of luggage being left too up to 3pm which really helped and no charge. Staff very helpful and a lift to all floors us being on the 7th. Recommended and the more people less the price - sorted ;-)  Barcelona is a great City to explore  - happy days !,5,2013,08,15
52,"""Great apartment and an amazing view of the Sagrada Familia""","Our family (My mother, 21 year old daughter, my husband and myself)  stayed on the top floor of the apartment building and had an amazing view of the Sagrada Familia!  The 3 bedrooms were spacious as was the rest of the apartment!  Many good places  to eat nearby and a grocery store if you decide to cook instead.  Metro very close so was easy to get around the city!  We did take a taxi from and to the airport, was about 40 euro each way but well worth the time and ease of travel! The young lady at the reception was very nice and helpful. They are there just during the weekdays but do have a 24 hour phone number to call if needed. They were painting the winding staircase, but wasnt really an inconvience. Loved our trip to Barcelona and would most definately stay here again!",5,2013,06,16
52,A large apartment near Sagrada Familia,"My family (parents and adult daughter) stayed here for three days.  We had an apartment with 4 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, a large dining room and kitchen. Three rooms gave us fine views of the Sagrada Familia.  The building is a solid older apartment building which is being renovated, so there were signs of painting and other work in halls and stairways.  Our unit had been finished and everything was clean and new.  The front desk operates only 9:30 to 6 on weekdays, which was fine for our arrival on a Friday.  Otherwise you have to phone the receptionist and make arrangements.  The receptionist was very helpful about local shops and restaurants.  The area has a supermarket and many good shops and restaurants.  We traveled easily all over the city.",4,2013,06,05
52,Would definitely return,"Our family stayed here for 5 days in May 2013. We booked slightly late and so did not get an apartment with balcony nor with the ""fantastic view"" of the Sagrada but instead a 1st floor view of the side street, Avenida Gaudi. It was a three bed apartment, if I remember correctly known as E1.

As an apartment it was fine, compared to a hotel room it was excellent. Plenty of space, very comfortable beds, quietly efficient air conditioning (although we were not testing it in high summer), everything worked. Bathroom & second toilet room could have been bigger but this is a wish list rather than complaint. Kitchen might present more issues if you were actually going to be doing a lot of cooking but for us it was perfect.

All the technology worked - TV and wi-fi - no issues. 

Avenida Gaudi is a very nice, tree lined, mostly pedestrianised street and a fine view. If you want to see Sagrada, stick your head out the window. No problems with noise despite it being a busy street with markets and cafes.

Local area has plenty of shops, restaurants and cafes and it proved to be a good base from which to travel around Barcelona. Nothing seemed a long way away. We used the metro most of the time with occasional cabs.

The only negative point I would raise is that there is nowhere for you to leave bags. Our return flight was in the evening on a Sunday and we wanted to leave the bags after checkout, go do something, and then return for bags and leave for airport. As the reception service is rather basic and is closed at weekends the only suggestion was to use a left-luggage locker at the train station (or something like that), which was silly. Nobody wants to waste hours of their limited time in Barcelona schlepping bags around town. There must be a way for them to deal with this because we can""t be the first with this problem.

Fortunately, our apartment was not booked for that night so we were able to pay 50 EUR extra to have the apartment for the whole day, which worked out well (apart from having to pay 50 EUR) but if it had not been available I think this baggage issue would have taken the edge off our last day in Barcelona.

Otherwise, the staff were very helpful when they were there. Low service score is because there is very little of it, rather than because it was poor.

Bottom line - when we go back to Barcelona we would book here again providing we can work out the baggage thing.",4,2013,05,26
52,"good location, amazing view","Suite Home Barcelona was a pleasant surprise. My family (wife and two kids) stayed here for the weekend. Was freezing in Barcelona. But the heating in the apartment worked fine. Apartment was very clean, beds comfortable, and the flat we had (attic), had a view of the Sagrada Familia. Access to Metro was very easy (50 yards), and there's a great supermarket very nearby. All in all, a nice experience and one we would do again.",4,2013,02,25
52,Great find,"Stopped there for three nights, booked on line. It was good value - about 260 euros for 3 nights, half term. We had a suite with three rooms, 2 double, one small single plus a decent living room/ balcony. Kitchen was small but well equipped , but we weren't planning on cooking too much. Rooms very clean and again fully equipped but we couldn't get the tely to work - no big deal really. We arrived after 9 PM so had to pay a 30 Euro surcharge . 

Location great  - about 100m from the Famille underground and the iconic half buit church. Lots of restaurants around as well as caves and late night supermarkets , perfect for us - ate somewhere different each night walking 100 m .La Ramlas is walkable , about 45 mins but underground much quicker. Transfer was about 20 mins - they organised for us. Our teenage kids loved the whole trip. 

Well worth a look",5,2013,02,22
52,Fantastic terrace,"We took 2 apartments with 8 beds, both spacious. 
Fantastic communal terrace. 
Excellent service and always available. 
If I were to return I would book here again
I recommend it for friends and families. 
The only thing missing were the cups of Italian espresso coffee.",5,2024,06,03
52,Ottimo,"Stupendo soggiorno passato in un attico al sesto piano di un palazzo tranquillo e confortevole, appartamento grande e ac.· La posizione è ottima e l’appartamento all’ultimo piano offre una vista stupenda sulla Sagrada Familia da fare invidia.  Bagno piccolo in spazi, purtroppo per me che sono Italiano mancava il bidet. La casa pulitissima è molto accogliente.",4,2022,11,17
52,Incredibile ma vero,"Deve dire, perfetto. Credevo francamente che le foto facessero apparire oltremodo una immagine positiva degli appartamenti... Invece sono realmente magnifico, ben tenuti, spaziosi ed almeno il nostro con vista mozzafiato sulla sagrada... Ottima posizione, una gentilezza incredibile dello staff (un ringraziamento particolare ad Alvaro). Se andate a Barcellona, questa e' la struttura giusta! ",5,2019,07,07
52,Di fronte alla Sagrada familia,Appartamento pulito spazioso molto comodo vicino alla fermata della Sagrada Familia e distante 300 metri. Dotato di tutti i comfort. Lo consiglio per la posizione la pulizia  potete anche lasciare le valigie in reception,4,2019,01,03
52,"Ottima posizione, ma..","Appartamento nuovo situato in una zona centrale a due passi dalla Sagrada familia. All'apparenza sembra tutto perfettamente funzionante e nuovo, anche ben arredato, ma già dal primo giorno abbiamo avuto qualche problema: le docce nei bagni sono aperte (nonostante non siano docce senza piatto doccia), cosa che fa continuamente allagare il pavimento, e il divano letto era completamente inutilizzabile a causa delle doghe uscite dalla loro posizione. Abbiamo chiesto che venissero sistemate, ma non è avvenuto, quindi abbiamo dormito per tutta la durata del soggiorno per terra sul materasso del divano letto. Sicuramente ho dormito in posti più scomodi, ma per la cifra pagata ci si aspetta di avere un letto su cui dormire, o almeno mi sarei aspettata un rimborso parziale se non erano in grado di procurare un altro letto.",3,2018,11,04
52,Soggiorno a barcellona,"Ho soggiornato in un appartamento posto al primo piano di questa struttura. La posizione è eccezionale, a 100 metri dalla metro e dalla Sagrada Familia. Ambiente accogliente e con aria condizionata. Personale alla recepition molto cordiale. Unico neo il secondo bagno era minuscolo e senza doccia e non ha il bidet. Molto consigliato .",4,2018,07,15
52,Vista indimenticabile,"Abbiamo soggiornato in uno di questi appartamenti, era al quinto piano e avevamo la vista sulla Sagrada Família...incantevole. Pulito ,moderno e personale cordiale. Buona anche la posizione ovviamente.",4,2018,05,21
52,Molto buono! ,"Ciao a tutti sono stata in questa struttura 3 giorni, posto molto comodo e la casa dentro è molto grande e spaziosa. Noi eravamo in 7 e siamo stati bene come spazi. L’unico problema è che nella casa non ci sono i termosifoni ed è un po’ umida come casa, quindi consiglio appena arrivati di accendere un po’ l’aria calda per togliere l’umidità! 
Per il resto abbiamo speso 800 euro in 7 per 3 giorni! ",4,2018,04,01
52,Ubicación fantástica!!!,"Ubicación a pocos metros de la Sagrada Familia, con vistas desde sus balcones. Mejorable en cuanto a menaje y mobiliario. Muy buena atención en el check-in por parte de Montse. Un sólo ascensor algo lento. Supermercados y bares ceca. ",4,2018,02,11
52,Recomendado ,"Muy buena ubicación y también la relación calidad-precio, muy cerca de la Sagrada Familia y del metro, algo importante. Tiene aspectos mejorables, estaría bien que tuviera algo mas de menaje, algunas perchas y repisas en las habitaciones, etc. Por lo demás todo estupendo, la chica de recepción muy amable, nos permitió el dia de salida irnos mucho mas tarde y eso es muy de agradecer.",4,2018,02,11

52,A oscuras,"Apartamento estupendo, cómodo, amplio, limpio y bien situado. Pero nos mintieron y nos dejaron a oscuras. El sábado por la mañana se produce una avería en el cuadro eléctrico y nos quedamos sin corriente eléctrica. Nadie a quien acudir en  recepción, nadie en el edifico... Llamamos a un teléfono de contacto y nos dijeron que es un sobrecalentamiento habitual en sus apartamentos... volvimos por la noche de visitar Barcelona y seguíamos igual. Volvimos a llamar y nos mintieron porque nos prometieron enviar un técnico y nunca apareció. Sin poder utilizar los electrodomésticos disponibles, nada en la nevera para que no se estropeara, sin poder cargar los móviles, ducharnos a oscuras.... Al día siguiente la persona en recepción reconoce su error y pide disculpas. Pero la jugarreta ya estaba hecha. En fin que el que quiera ir a estos apartamentos que vaya, yo desde luego no vuelvo más.  ",1,2017,05,18

52,Ottima vista,"Appartamento ultimo piano, vista eccezionale della cattedrale, ottima accoglienza e disponibilità, pulito, camere spaziose, luminoso e confortevole a 5 minuti dalla metro. Il quartiere è ben servito, l'appartamento è un po' caro ma la sua posizione è invidiabile.",4,2015,01,09
52,Ottimo appartamento,"Ho alloggiato in questo appartamento alla fine di giugno, con un gruppo di amici. Dopo aver confrontato diversi prezzi e valutato le diverse possibilità questo appartamento ci offriva il miglior rapporto qualità prezzo.
E' situato a 200 m dalla Sagrada Familia, che si può ammirare in tutta la sua sontuosità dal balcone del soggiorno, magari sorseggiando un ottimo aperitivo casalingo. La fermata della metro è quella adiacente alla Sagrada. Il nostro appartamento (perchè ne possiedono diversi all'interno dello stesso stabile) era situato al penultimo piano ed era composto da tre camere da letto: due matrimoniali e una con letti singoli, due bagni con doccia però solo uno di essi possedeva il water, una cucina e un ampio soggiorno con tv. E' dotato di climatizzazione centralizzata e come ho già detto gode di una vista invidiale sulla Sagrada, senza considerare che in terrazza è presente un solarium dove si può prendere il sole in tutta tranquillità. La zona è molto fornita di negozi, bar e anche un supermarket Carrefour dove ci siamo riforniti di alcolici e viveri con una spesa accessibile. Non abbiamo avuto problemi di alcun genere, le stanze le abbiamo trovate pulite e ordinate, la ragazza alla reception è stata molto gentile e precisa nelle indicazioni e in più parlava italiano. Da notare che nel week end la reception è chiusa (apre solo per eventuali ceck in). Che dire se non ci tornerò!",5,2014,09,06
52,Party40,"Ottima posizione, vista sagrata famiglia, metro a pochi passi. Appartamenti molto molto accoglienti, si dorme bene. Poco rumore essendo in zona prevalentemente pedonale. In zona ottimi localini dove stuzzicare e bere qualcosa al fresco.",4,2014,08,04

Metro, Mc Donalds, Bus Turistico, y muchas tiendas y restaurante al lado.

Volveria definitvamente. Y se lo rrcomendaria a todos.",5,2014,07,21
52,UN'OTTIMA ALTERNATIVA AL CENTRO CITTA',"Siamo stati al Suite Home Barcelona in febbraio: e' una struttura che consiglio vivamente a famiglie con figli
perché l'appartamento e' molto grande, confortevole, le camere molto carine e arredate in stile moderno, due bagni. Non abbiamo usufruito della cucina ma a mio parere c'era tutto quelle che e' necessario. Il tavolo da pranzo e' nel grande salotto dal quale si ha una
magnifica vista sulla Sagrada Famiglia (chiedete, se e' libero, l'appartamento centrale: gli altri
hanno una visione solo parziale della magnifica chiesa). Occhio pero' ai balconi: la balaustra e'
un po' bassina quindi attenzione ai bimbi. La zona non e' molto servita da supermercati ma trovate bar, piccoli negozi e ristorantini molto carini, oltre naturalmente a vari immancabili fast food. Vicinissima e molto comoda la metropolitana.
Ottima l'organizzazione, noi abbiamo optato per il servizio navetta che propongono e siamo rimasti molto soddisfatti della gentilezza e puntualita' da e per l'aereoporto.",4,2013,05,22
52,Tolles Apartment,"Wir hatten ein sehr großzügiges Apartment mit tollem Blick auf die Sagrada Familia. U-Bahn, Restaurants und Supermärkte gleich in der Nähe. Die junge Dame am Empfang war sehr freundlich und hilfsbereit. Leider hatten wir nicht das eigentlich gebuchte Apartment mit Balkon bekommen. Aber alles in allem war das kein großer Nachteil. Das nächste Mal werden wir wieder dort buchen.",5,2013,04,07
52,un buon compromesso con vista sagrada,"ho trascorso, insieme alla mia famiglia, un bel week end a Barcellona sfruttando questa struttura.
Si tratta di un intero palazzo dove i vari appartamenti vengono affittati ai turisti. l'appartamento in cui abbiamo soggiornato era molto pulito bene arredato soprattutto la cucina era molto bene accessoriata dalla macchina del caffè alla lavastoviglie ect...
L'unico critica che mi sento di fare è la mancanza di  manutenzione tecnica degli appartamenti. al nostro arrivo abbiamo subito notato le sedie del salotto rotte un bagno in cui non funzionava lo scarico e persiane non funzionanti ect .
In compenso avevamo la vista sulla sagrada e il personale è stato molto cortese e disponibile.
Se dovessi ritornare a barcellona credo di sfruttare nuovamente questa struttura.",4,2013,02,01
